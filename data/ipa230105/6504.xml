This is accomplished by adding or subtracting the number of motor modules within the cluster.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 9,124,144, issued Sep. 1, 2015, to Bryan Prucher, entitled DUAL RADIAL GAP MOTOR-GENERATOR STRUCTURE (&#x201c;the '144 Patent&#x201d;), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein, discloses and teaches a dual radial gap DC motor/generator that is functionally both an inside and outside rotor motor packaged within the same housing. The '144 Patent discloses that the motor generator has a rotor composed of at least two spaced apart annular rings, each having an inner surface and an outer surface, containing an array of permanent magnets with alternating polarities and a common central axis. The annular rings are operationally attached to a central power shaft. A stator composed of a circular array of induction coils is encircled by the annular rings and centrally positioned so that there are equal gaps between the induction coils and the magnets of both rings. The stator is fixed between the annular rings so that the rotor and stator have the same axis of rotation. This arrangement produces a motor/generator with a donut shaped configuration having a hollow, unused central section. When employing more than one dual radial gap motor in a propulsion application each motor requires an individual motor controller and a rotary encoder or resolver for it to function.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For reducing cost and complexity, it would be desirable to provide a system or method whereby more than one motor could be used collectively in tandem to contribute to a single power output. It would be further desirable if these motors were to share the same motor controller and resolver or rotary encoder.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is disclosed and taught herein a modular motor system and method, wherein at least two dual radial gap motors with attachment points may be joined together in a modular manner for the purpose of providing the capability of incrementally increasing or decreasing the total power output of the modular motor system while having only one common controller and one common resolver or rotary encoder.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The power output of the modular motor system is incrementally increased or decreased by adding or subtracting a common individual motor module to the system. The modular motor system of the present invention has the advantage of providing power output flexibility and reducing system complexity by and having a standardized dual radial gap motor design capable of being used as a module in a system of more than one motor. Additionally, there is an overall system cost reduction by controlling the entire modular motor system with only one controller and one rotary encoder or resolver.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first embodiment, there is disclosed a cluster of at least two dual radial gap motor modules with complementary attachment points, assembled and mechanically connected in-line with one another, in-series, end-to-end, in a linear configuration. The motors within the cluster further include a rotor comprising a power output shaft and a base plate connecting two magnet rotor rings centrally and complementarily oriented around the shaft. The common rotor power output shaft employs a polygon shape to operationally connect and synchronize the magnetic orientation of the rotors of each of the motor modules with one another. Each motor also module includes a stator encompassed by the magnet rings. There is further one resolver used to determine their collective rotational angle and one controller to control its motion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a second embodiment, the power rotor shaft may be provided with a multi-lobe polygonal hole extending along its center axis.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to this embodiment, the rotor output shaft may have a male multi-lobe configuration at one end and a female multi-lobe configuration at the other to allow the motors to couple or attach within one another and to be operationally attached and magnetically synchronized when coupled together.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A polygon shaped rod complementary within a close tolerance to the internal configuration of the polygon shaped hole in the power rotor shaft passes through the central polygon hole in the power rotor shaft connecting each of the motor rotors, radially orientating and rotationally lock them together within each in-series cluster of motors.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The modular motor system herein transmits the torque and provides angular magnetic synchronization and affords a blind engagement between each motor of the modular motor system. The motors of the modular motor system attach to secure the rotor output shaft of each motor in the cluster using a multi-lobe polygon connection.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In both embodiments, the modular motor system may include a module housing mounted opposite a power delivery end of the modular motor system or cluster assembly. The module housing may contain one of a resolver and, optionally, a single motor controller. The resolver may be operationally attached or coupled to the end of the polygon power shaft or rod to sense the angular position of the rotors of all of the motors within the cluster assembly. This approach results in only one resolver and one controller required to facilitate the entire cluster of motors of the modular motor system as opposed to requiring one resolver and one controller for each motor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In both embodiments, a cluster assembly or modular motor system includes more than one multi-phased motor. Each motor includes an electrical power contact for each of the phases of the motor, as well as optionally, a common ground contact. The individual points of contact may be angularly offset within each motor and protrude externally from the motor housing. The points of contact for all of the motors within the cluster may be axially in-line with one another.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, each phase contact and, optionally the ground contact, for the motors in the cluster assembly may include a bus bar extending in a direction aligned with the axis of the cluster assembly and electronically coupling the phase contacts of all of the motors so that the power output of each motor is produced in parallel. The parallel bus bars will terminate in the module housing containing the resolver with contact points that will be used to connect to the motor controller. This parallel configuration allows for only one controller being required to operate the machine as opposed to requiring one controller for each motor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The total power output of the modular motor system is the sum of the power delivered from each individual motor or module and may be incrementally increased or decreased by adding or subtracting motors to obtain a desired output level. Optionally, in the event that there is a need to change the RPM output range, a separate gear reduction unit with the desired gear ratio may be operationally attached to the power delivery end of the polygon shaft.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For a more complete understanding of the present disclosure, reference is made to the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.

Each phase is separated by a bus bar phase link electrical insulator <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. Each stator modular assembly comprises a plurality of individual stators only one of which is shown at <b>114</b> which are interconnected.

There is a common fixed relationship between the radial position of the rotor magnets and the radial position of the polygon lobes on the central hub <b>70</b> as with the first embodiment. When one motor is attached to the other in a linear fashion, the male polygon shaped extension <b>73</b> of the hub <b>70</b> in the motor below fits into the female polygon cavity <b>76</b> of the motor hub <b>70</b> above. This establishes the magnetic and electrical synchronization of all the motors in the system. The output shaft <b>70</b> may include a first or female end <b>71</b> having a polygon shaped cross section for operationally connecting and synchronizing the rotors <b>80</b> of each of the motor modules <b>12</b> with one resolver or encoder <b>30</b> used to determine their collective rotational angle.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The end <b>71</b> is preferably a multi-lobe polygon shaped cross-section for establishing a rotational connection.
