system that irradiates a subject with radiation and captures a radiation image, an image processing method, and a storage medium.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, there has been known a radiation imaging system including a radiation detection apparatus that irradiates a subject with radiation (for example, X-rays) and detects the intensity distribution of the radiation transmitted through the subject, thereby capturing a radiation image of a target.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, in radiation imaging such as front-of-chest imaging, reflection of a foreign object such as a necklace and disposable body warmer can be a problem. Particularly, re-imaging at a later date may be required due to reflection of a foreign object when it is not possible to confirm the presence of the reflection of the foreign object on a small monitor in radiation imaging in a medical examination car with limited space.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Attempts have been made to prevent oversight by applying image processing for enhancing a foreign object. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2019-92857 describes a method of generating a plurality of images by applying a plurality of image processing operations set in advance to an image obtained by imaging.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the image processing of enhancing a foreign object is image processing that is effective in preventing oversight but not suitable for diagnosis. Therefore, operations are required to perform processing for reducing the influence of the image processing of enhancing a foreign object, and processing for preventing the image with the image processing of enhancing a foreign object applied thereto from being output to the outside. The burden of such operations becomes a problem in an examination workflow which requires efficient execution of radiation imaging.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above-described problems, and provides a radiation imaging technique capable of efficiently executing radiation imaging while reducing the burden of operations for performing image processing required in radiation imaging.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a radiation imaging system comprising: an obtainment unit configured to obtain an image captured by radiation imaging; an image processing unit configured to generate a radiation image by applying image processing to the captured image; a display control unit configured to display, on a display unit, the radiation image with the image processing applied thereto; and a control unit configured to determine, based on an operation input, whether confirmation of the radiation image displayed on the display unit is complete, wherein the image processing unit performs first processing of applying first image processing as the image processing, an if the control unit determines that confirmation of the radiation image is complete, performs second processing of applying, as the image processing, second image processing for generating a radiation image with a degree of processing reduced as compared to the first image processing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain principles of the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view showing the overall configuration of a radiation imaging system according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view showing the arrangement of a control unit in the radiation imaging system according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a view illustrating a display form of the radiation imaging system according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a view illustrating a display form of the radiation imaging system according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a view illustrating a display form of the radiation imaging system according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view illustrating a display form of the radiation imaging system according to the embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the radiation imaging system of this embodiment includes a radiation imaging apparatus <b>1</b>, and an HIS (Hospital Information System) <b>11</b> that manages the progress of examination.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The radiation imaging system of this embodiment also includes an RIS (Radiology Information System) <b>12</b> that transmits an examination order to the radiation imaging apparatus <b>1</b>. Further, the radiation imaging system of this embodiment is connected to a PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems) <b>13</b> that manages a radiation image, and a printer <b>14</b> that prints out a radiation image.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The HIS <b>11</b> is a hospital management system, and includes a server that manages accounting information. When executing radiation imaging, an operator inputs an examination instruction using a terminal (input unit) of the HIS <b>11</b>. Then, the HIS <b>11</b> transmits request information to a radiology department of the hospital which is the request destination of the radiation imaging. This request information is called an examination order. The examination order includes the department name of the request source, examination ID, examination items, patient information (subject information) of the subject (test object), and the like.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The RIS <b>12</b> is a radiology department information system. When the radiology department receives the examination order, the RIS <b>12</b> adds imaging information (imaging method, imaging conditions, image processing conditions, imaging portion information, imaging direction information, procedure information, and the like) of the radiation imaging to the examination order as imaging protocols, and transmits the examination order to the radiation imaging apparatus <b>1</b>. The radiation imaging apparatus <b>1</b> executes radiation imaging in accordance with the received examination order. The radiation imaging apparatus <b>1</b> obtains a captured radiation image, generates examination information associating the radiation image and the examination order, and outputs the examination information together with the radiation image.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The PACS <b>13</b> is an image server mainly for image management. Using a high resolution monitor connected to the PACS <b>13</b>, radiation image inspection work, detailed post-processing, and diagnostic work are performed. In this manner, the radiation image obtained by the radiation imaging apparatus <b>1</b> is transmitted to the PACS <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Examination execution information (image ID, imaging date and time, and the like) by the radiation imaging apparatus <b>1</b> is also transmitted to the HIS <b>11</b>. The execution information transmitted to the HIS <b>11</b> is also used for, other than the progress management of the examination, an accounting process after the examination.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The radiation imaging apparatus <b>1</b>, the HIS <b>11</b>, the RIS <b>12</b>, the PACS <b>13</b>, and the printer <b>14</b> are connected via a network <b>15</b> formed from, for example, a LAN (Local Area Network) or a WAN (Wide Area Network).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Note that each of these apparatuses includes one or a plurality of computers.

The radiation generator <b>8</b> is implemented by, for example, a radiation tube, and emits radiation toward the subject <b>10</b> (for example, a specific portion of the subject).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The radiation generator <b>8</b> can irradiate a desired irradiation range with radiation. A diaphragm (not shown) for shielding radiation is installed in the irradiation surface of the radiation generator <b>8</b>.

The radiation detector <b>7</b> detects the radiation transmitted through the subject <b>10</b>, and outputs image data corresponding to the radiation. Note that image data can also be called a radiation image.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">More specifically, the radiation detector <b>7</b> detects the radiation transmitted through the subject <b>10</b> as electric charges corresponding to the transmitted radiation dose. For example, a direct conversion type sensor that directly converts radiation into electric charges, such as an a-Se sensor that converts radiation into electric charges, or an indirect type sensor using a scintillator such as a CsI scintillator and a photoelectric converting element such as an a-Si photoelectric converting element can be used as the radiation detector <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The radiation detector <b>7</b> A/D-converts the detected electric charges to generate image data, and accumulates it in a storage unit (not shown). The radiation detector <b>7</b> can add image information (image ID, imaging date and time, and image data transfer status) to the image data (radiation image), and transfer the image information to the radiation imaging apparatus <b>1</b> together with the image data.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The display unit <b>2</b> is implemented by, for example, a liquid crystal display or the like, and displays various kinds of information to an operator (for example, a radiographer, a doctor, or the like).
