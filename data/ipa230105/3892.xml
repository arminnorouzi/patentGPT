An engineering equipment getting intelligent and unmanned is a current development trend. The engineering equipment senses the surrounding environment through a sensor arranged thereon and performs unmanned autonomous operation by using the sensed environment information, so as to improve safety and efficiency of the engineering operation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an unmanned operation scenario in which a ground operation is involved, the engineering equipment needs to detect an operating terrain (that is, ups and downs of the ground, also height values of different ground regions) in real time and makes a plan and performs the operation based on the operating terrain.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the related art, the conventional method for detecting the operating terrain includes the following three types.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">First type: the point cloud data of the ground that are collected by a laser radar are reconstructed by using a three-dimensional surface reconstruction technology (for example, a Poisson surface reconstruction technology and the like) to generate a grid model of the ground, and thus the operating terrain is obtained. The method has large computing amount and low computing speed, which is incapable of realizing a real-time terrain detection.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Second type: the operating region is divided into a plurality of grids, in which by using the point cloud data that are collected by the laser radar within a period of time in the past, an average height of the point cloud data in each grid is calculated as a terrain height of the grid so as to generate a grid elevation map. However, dusts (for example, ground flying dusts, smoke and the like) usually exist in the engineering operating site, which may be scanned by the laser radar, and consequently, many noise points are contained in the point cloud data. The method directly uses the average height of the point cloud data as the ground height, so the accuracy is low and the real-time property cannot meet an engineering operating requirement.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Third type: multiple frames of environment depth images are collected by a depth camera, in which based on each frame of the depth image, the ground height value of each grid is updated in real time by using a Kalman filter algorithm to generate the grid elevation map. The method is good in the real-time property but not ideal in dust denoising. Besides, since an effective distance of the depth camera is short (that is, the collected depth image is accurate only under a condition that the object is closer to the depth camera), the precision is insufficient for large engineering equipment, and the terrain detection accuracy is low.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In view of the above problems, an embodiment of the disclosure provides a method for detecting an operating terrain so as to realize an accurate and real-time operating terrain detection.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The embodiment of the disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of an example system <b>100</b> in which various methods and apparatuses described herein may be implemented according to an embodiment of the disclosure.

Furthermore, it may be determined that whether the input point of the grid is the noise point or the ground point, and the height value of the grid is updated solely based on the height coordinate of the ground point, so that the noise point can be effectively filtered, the accuracy of terrain detection can be improved, and the accurate and real-time operating terrain detection can be realized.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Each step of the method <b>200</b> is described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>210</b>, the point cloud data of the operating region that are collected by the laser radar at the current time are obtained.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As described above, the laser radar may be fixed, for example, in front, on a side or in other positions of the engineering equipment and a plurality of laser radars may be arranged. The laser radar emits laser beams towards the surrounding environment so as to collect the point cloud data of the surrounding environment.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The point cloud data collected by the laser radar include a large quantity of sampling points, and each sampling point includes a three-dimensional coordinate, i.e., (x, y, z), which is used for representing a space position of the sampling point. An x coordinate and a y coordinate are used for representing a position of the sampling point in a horizontal direction, and a z coordinate is used for representing a position of the sampling point in a height direction, i.e., an altitude of the sampling point. In the embodiment of the disclosure, the z coordinate is called a height coordinate. In general, each sampling point also includes a laser reflection intensity and an attitude angle (including a yaw angle, a pitch angle, and a rolling angle) relative to the laser radar.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In general, the original three-dimensional coordinates of the sampling points collected by the laser radar are the three-dimensional coordinates under a laser radar coordinate system. According to some embodiments, in order to conveniently detect the operating terrain and generate the grid elevation map of the ground, the three-dimensional coordinates under the laser radar coordinate system need to be transformed to be under a world coordinate system (e.g., a UTM coordinate system, a WGS84 coordinate system and the like), i.e., the three-dimensional coordinates in step <b>210</b> refer to three-dimensional coordinates under the world coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to some embodiments, a positioning module, for example, the RTK module, is arranged on the engineering equipment on which the laser radar is located. The RTK module can collect its own pose information in real time, which includes its own three-dimensional coordinates and the attitude angle (including the yaw angle, the pitch angle and the rolling angle) under the world coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Based on the pose information collected by the RTK module, the point cloud data under the laser radar coordinate system may be transformed to be under the world coordinate system. Specifically, positions of the RTK module and of the laser radar that are relative to the machine body of the engineering equipment may be calibrated respectively. Based on the pose information collected by the RTK module, a transformation relation between an RTK coordinate system and the world coordinate system (the transformation relation generally includes a translation vector and a transformation matrix) may be obtained. According to the calibrated positions of the RTK module and of the laser radar that are relative to the machine body of the engineering equipment, a transformation relation between the laser radar coordinate system and the RTK coordinate system may be obtained. Based on the transformation relation between the laser radar coordinate system and the RTK coordinate system, as well as the transformation relation between the RTK coordinate system and the world coordinate system, a transformation relation between the laser radar coordinate system and the world coordinate system may be obtained. Based on the transformation relation between the laser radar coordinate system and the world coordinate system, the three-dimensional coordinates under the laser radar coordinate system may be transformed to under the world coordinate system.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The laser radar can emit laser beams continuously, so that the point cloud data of the surrounding environment are collected continuously. According to some embodiments, in order to conveniently detect the operating terrain in real time, the laser radar transmits the collected point cloud data back to the control apparatus of the engineering equipment according to a certain time interval, and accordingly, the control apparatus of the engineering equipment obtains the point cloud data collected by the laser radar according to the certain time interval. In the embodiment of the disclosure, the point cloud data returned by the laser radar at each time may be called &#x201c;a frame of point cloud data&#x201d;. According to some embodiments, the time interval of returning the point cloud data by the laser radar may be set to have a small value, for example, 0.1 s, so that the real-time property and the accuracy of detection of the operating terrain are improved.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to some embodiments, the point cloud data are obtained by scanning the operating region via the laser radar according to a non-repetitive scanning path. It is noted that the non-repetitive scanning path of the embodiment of the disclosure means that the scanning path in each time interval is non-repetitive, which does not mean that the scanning path is non-repetitive in a whole operating process of the laser radar. Since the non-repetitive scanning can collect the dense point cloud data corresponding to different positions through time accumulation with no movement of the laser radar (while the common 360&#xb0; repetitive scanning can only obtain the dense point cloud by moving the laser radar), the stability and accuracy of data collection are improved, and thus the accuracy of detection of the operating terrain can be improved.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Besides, the quantity of laser emitters needed by the non-repetitive scanning of the laser radar (which, the quantity of wires is usually in a single digit) is usually far more smaller than that of the 360&#xb0; repetitive scanning laser radar (which, in order to collect the dense point cloud data, the quantity of wires needs to reach 64, 128 or more), and thus the cost can be greatly reduced.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">It can be understood that a scanning range of the laser radar is usually large. Given that the operating region of the engineering equipment has to be a region which can be touched by the engineering equipment, according to some embodiments, the operating region in step <b>210</b> may be set as a region with a certain size using the position of the engineering equipment (for example, the position of the engineering equipment may be obtained through the RTK module) as a center, for example, a region of 100 m*100 m. Furthermore, the operating region is divided into the plurality of grids, and each grid has a fixed size (for example, 0.2 m*0.2 m). In the embodiment of the disclosure, a size of a single grid may be called a resolution of the operating region. Based on the above embodiment, by obtaining in real time the position of the engineering equipment, the operating region is determined based on the position of the engineering equipment, and only the point cloud data in the operating region are processed, so that the quantity of the data that are to be processed can be reduced, and the detection efficiency and the real-time property of the operating terrain are improved.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the embodiment of the disclosure, the position of each grid is indexed through the horizontal and longitudinal coordinates (the x coordinate and y coordinate), and the terrain information is recorded by storing the height value of the grid.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In step <b>220</b>, the input point of each grid is determined from the plurality of sampling points based on the three-dimensional coordinates of the plurality of sampling points.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to some embodiments, the input point of each grid can be determined through the following steps. A sampling point set corresponding to the grid is determined based on the three-dimensional coordinates of the plurality of sampling points, wherein the sampling point set includes sampling points in the grid. A sampling point with the largest height coordinate in the sampling point set is used as the input point of the grid. The input point is used for updating the height value of the grid. According to different actual conditions, the sampling point set corresponding to the grid may include any quantity of sampling points. For example, in some cases, the sampling point set of the grid may include one or more sampling points. In other cases, the sampling point set of the grid may be null.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">It can be understood that the quantities and the height distributions corresponding to the sampling points of different grids at the same time are different, and the quantities and the height distributions corresponding to the sampling points of the same grid at different times are also different. This kind of variation would make terrain restoration difficult. Based on the above embodiment, by using the sampling point with the largest height coordinate in the sampling point set as the input point, the stability of the input data can be guaranteed. Besides, due to abandonment of other sampling points, the computing efficiency can be improved, the storage space can be saved, and the real-time detection of the operating terrain can be realized. Meanwhile, an interference caused when the laser radar scans a vertical object to return a plurality of height values can also be avoided by the above embodiment.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to some other embodiments, an average value of the height coordinates of the sampling points in the sampling point set may also be used as the input point of the grid.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step <b>230</b>, the type of the input point is determined based on the height coordinate of the input point and the height value of the grid, wherein the type of the input point includes the noise point and the ground point.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to some embodiments, the input point is determined as the noise point in response to determining that a difference between the height coordinate of the input point and the height value of the grid is greater than a first threshold. The first threshold may be, for example, set to be 0.5 m. It can be understood that as the dusts float above the ground, the height of the noise point is usually higher than the ground height (i.e., the height value of the grid). The noise point can be fast identified by comparing the height coordinate of the input point with the height value of the grid.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to some embodiments, the input point is determined as the ground point in response to determining that any one of the following conditions is met: the difference between the height coordinate of the input point and the height value of the grid is smaller than or equal to the first threshold (Condition I); or the difference between the height coordinate of the input point and the height value of the grid is greater than the first threshold, and the quantity of the input points of the grid determined as the noise point within a preset duration is greater than or equal to a second threshold (Condition II). The preset duration may be, for example, set to be 1 s, and the second threshold may be, for example, set to be 5.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the above embodiment, in Condition I, the ground point can be fast and accurately identified by comparing the height coordinate of the input point with the height value of the grid in the case that the ground height in the grid decreases, remains unchanged or slowly increases (the increased quantity within a unit time is smaller than the first threshold). In the Condition II, the ground point can be fast and accurately identified in the case that the ground height in the grid increases fast (the increased quantity within a unit time is greater than or equal to the first threshold).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to some embodiments, each grid has a corresponding noise point container and a ground point container which are respectively used for storing historical noise points and historical ground points closest to the current time.

The input point is added into the noise point container corresponding to the grid in response to determining that the input point is the noise point. The noise point with the earliest collection time in the noise point container is deleted in response to determining that the quantity of noise points in the noise point container is greater than or equal to a third threshold. Thus, the noise point container only stores a small quantity (smaller than the third threshold) of the historical noise points closest to the current time, so that the storage space can be saved, and the real-time detection of the operating terrain can be realized.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to some embodiments, the method <b>200</b> further includes the following steps.

Thus, the ground point container only stores a small quantity (smaller than a fourth threshold) of historical ground points closest to the current time, so that the storage space can be saved, the computing amount can be reduced, the computing efficiency of the height values of the grids can be improved, and the real-time detection of the operating terrain can be realized.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to some embodiments, the third threshold and the fourth threshold may be set as the same value, for example, 5.

Specifically, the height value of the grid may be updated to be an average value of the height coordinates of the ground points in the ground point container. Based on the above embodiment, by using the average height coordinate of the ground points (i.e., the ground points in the ground point container) within a period of most recent time as the height value of the grid, the accuracy and the real-time property of detection of the operating terrain can be improved.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">It is noted that the above steps <b>210</b> to <b>240</b> describe a process of real-time updating of the height value of each grid.
