For example, the joining of plastic parts is conceivable, for example in the field of packaging, in automotive engineering or in the manufacture of medical devices. In some cases, metallic workpieces also have to be joined together, for example contact parts with electrical conductors.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to introduce ultrasonic vibrations into the workpieces to join them. The ultrasonic vibrations that are introduced produce ultrasonic welds that join the workpieces together.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, it is not always possible to produce satisfactory ultrasonic welds, especially with different material combinations. Particularly with workpieces made of plastic materials that have different melting points, welding can be difficult. One way of achieving welding results with satisfactory properties even with different combinations of materials is to increase the contact pressure, the welding time and/or the energy applied. However, this can lead to destruction of sensitive workpieces.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical application for welding workpieces made of plastic is the fastening of spouts to packaging, for example beverage packaging. The spout should be made of a material that is as oxygen-tight as possible, for example HDPE. The packaging itself consists of a body formed from a film, typically a laminate film. The laminate film has a plastic layer on its outer surface, typically of LDPE. A cardboard layer provides the desired strength.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An aluminum layer provides oxygen tightness. However, it has now been shown that when large forces are applied during welding, the aluminum layer can be destroyed. This can lead to quality problems with the packaged contents, typically a beverage. The tearing of the aluminum layer can lead to the formation of pockets and thus also to hygienic problems.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore the task of the invention to avoid the disadvantages of the known, in particular to create a process for joining workpieces, with which workpieces made of different materials can be joined together with a good welding quality. A further task of the invention is to create a composite object in which two workpieces, in particular also made of different materials, are joined together with a good welding quality.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These tasks are solved according to the invention with a method and an article having the features of the characterizing part of the independent patent claims. Preferred embodiments result from the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method according to the invention is used for joining workpieces by means of ultrasound. Typically, two workpieces are joined together. However, it is also conceivable to join more than two workpieces together.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a first step, a first tool is provided which has at least one energy direction sensor. It is known per se to provide workpieces with energy direction generators during ultrasonic welding. Ultrasonic vibrations are introduced into the workpiece in the area of the energy direction generator.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first workpiece is typically a spout for packaging. However, other workpieces are also conceivable, for example sealing or filter membranes on injection molded parts, e.g. in medical technology. Sensor holders for accommodating sensors in automotive bumpers are also conceivable.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A second workpiece is also provided. In particular, this can be a packaging material for producing packaging. However, it is also conceivable that the second workpiece is a bumper to which a sensor holder as described above is to be applied.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first and second workpieces are brought into contact with each other in such a way that the energy direction sensor comes into contact with a first surface of the second workpiece.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Ultrasonic vibrations are then introduced into one of the workpieces via a working surface of a sonotrode. Sonotrodes are tools subjected to ultrasonic vibrations and are known to the skilled person in many embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The ultrasonic vibrations run parallel to the surface of the workpiece, which comes into contact with the working surface of the sonotrode. In this way, heat is generated based on two different mechanisms. On the one hand, movements introduced by the sonotrode into the workpieces lead to heating inside the workpiece(s). On the other hand, friction, or movements in the area of the interface between the workpieces also lead to heat generation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Particularly when welding plastic joining parameters, it is common practice to introduce ultrasonic vibrations in a vibration direction perpendicular to contact surfaces of the workpieces with a sonotrode. It has been shown that such vibrations can lead to damage with certain types of joining partners or that&#x2014;with reduced vibration amplitude to avoid damage&#x2014;no adequate welded joint can be produced. This is particularly the case with film-like joining parameters such as mono films, films made of biopolymers or multilayer composite films such as those used in the field of packaging.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A further aspect of the invention therefore relates to the use of torsional ultrasonic vibrations for joining joining partners, wherein at least one of the joining partners has, in the region of a contact surface with the other joining partner, a monofilm, a film made of a biopolymer (for example polylactate) or a multilayer film.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">While such applications are particularly preferred in connection with the further aspects of the invention described below, it is understood that advantageous results-se can also be obtained with other arrangements of sonotrodes and/or energy direction generators. In particular, the use of torsional oscillations makes it possible to increase the oscillation amplitude in the area of the contact surface between the sonotrode and the joining parameter until a sufficient weld joint is produced. In the case of torsional vibrations, the amplitude can be increased by increasing the radius of the welding surface relative to an axis. A similar increase in amplitude is not readily possible for classical longitudinal vibrations perpendicular to the workpiece. Because the direction of vibration is parallel to the contact surface, an increased amplitude does not impair the workpiece/joining parameters, unlike conventional vibrations perpendicular to the contact surface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular, the use of torsional ultrasonic vibrations for welding is especially advantageous when joining films with a thickness of less than 100 &#x3bc;m, in particular of about 50 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the invention, a sonotrode is used which has a contour with contact lines on its working surface. The sonotrode is positioned with respect to the first workpiece so that the contact lines run transversely to the energy direction generator. Transverse typically means at an angle of +/&#x2212;45&#xb0;, preferably about 85&#xb0;-95&#xb0;, particularly preferably about 90&#xb0;. In this way, sound is introduced into the workpieces, especially into the second workpiece, only at points of intersection between the contact lines and the energy direction sensor. As a result, the load on the second workpiece in particular is lower. Destruction by the applied force is avoided because the overall force is lower due to the limitation of the force application to the crossing points.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the working surface of the horn is brought into contact with a second surface of the second workpiece which is opposite to the first surface, i.e. the surface which comes into contact with the energy direction generator.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Typically, therefore, the second workpiece, for example a film of a packaging material, is brought into contact with the working surface of the sonotrode.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a preferred embodiment, a sonotrode is used in which the working surface is circular. However, depending on the shape of the workpiece, other shapes of the working surface of the sonotrode are also conceivable. In this case, the contact lines are arranged in a star shape on the working surface with reference to a center. The working surface does not have to comprise a complete circle but can also be circular.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Depending on the workpieces to be joined, it is also conceivable that sonotrodes have working surfaces that lie on a rectangle or a square. In this case, the contact lines usually run transversely to a direction of oscillation of the sonotrode, so that there is an entrainment effect due to the oscillations. The angle of the contact lines in relation to the contour of the workpieces and in particular of the energy direction sensor can therefore not be constant, especially in the case of torsional vibrations. In the case of torsional vibrations in particular, it is therefore advisable for the contact lines to be star-shaped. In the case of longitudinal vibrations, contact lines that are parallel to each other are also conceivable, each of which then runs transverse to a direction of vibration.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, a sonotrode is used in which the contact lines are formed on a rib between two adjacent depressions. Typically, the working surface of the sonotrode can be provided with a Hirth serration which forms the contact lines on the ribs.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, the cross-section of the rib is constant in a plane perpendicular to the radial direction in a welding area as seen in the radial direction. This ensures that the working surface acting on the corresponding workpiece with the con-tact grooves remains the same, even if the workpiece is not precisely positioned in relation to the working surface of the horn. Particularly in the case of circular workpieces and circular working surfaces of the sonotrode, it is conceivable that there is no perfect alignment, i.e. agreement between the axes of the workpiece and the sonotrode. In the case of imperfect alignment, a cross-section of the rib that remains constant in the radial direction in the welding area ensures that the shape of the contact lines at the point of contact with the workpiece in the area of the energy direction generator is always the same.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Typically, the rib is V-shaped in cross-section in a plane perpendicular to the radial direction. The angle between two legs of the V-shaped cross section is typically 40&#xb0;-70&#xb0;, in particular 60&#xb0;. The height of the rib, i.e. a distance between the contact lines and a base of the recesses, can typically be 0.1 mm to 1.5 mm, preferably 0.4 to 1 mm. Particularly preferably, the distance is about 0.6 mm.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The contact lines have a distance from each other of about 0.1 to 2.5, preferably 0.8 to 2 mm. Preferably, they are spaced apart by about 1 mm. It goes without saying that these dimensions can change depending on the size of the workpieces to be welded.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably, the energy direction sensor is designed as a circumferential elevation. Typically, the energy direction sensor is arranged on a circle or at least partially on a circle. This is particularly preferred if the first workpiece is also circular, for example shaped as a spout.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to a particularly preferred embodiment, an energy direction sensor is used which, viewed in cross-section, has a relatively wide contact surface for contacting the other workpiece. Energy direction sensors known from the prior art are often provided with a cross-section of approximately triangular shape. It has been shown that the use of an energy director with a trapezoidal cross-section and a relatively wide contact surface can prevent damage to the second workpiece, particularly in the case of second workpieces in the form of laminates, foils and membranes. This is particularly relevant in packaging applications. According to a further aspect, the energy direction generator is therefore preferably trapezoidal in cross-section and in particular provided with a contact surface having a width which is at least five times as large, preferably at least seven times as large as the height of the energy direction generator.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In traditional welding processes with oscillation directions perpendicular to the contact surface of a joining parameter, an energy direction sensor with a triangular cross-section and a contact area that is as sharp as possible is used. In torsional welding, welding is often carried out on a flat surface, so that an energy direction sensor can be dispensed with completely. By using an energy direction sensor with a wide contact area according to the invention, the welded joint in torsional welding can be optimized without the risk of the energy direction sensor penetrating the other joining partner.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In traditional longitudinal welding processes, it is not possible to apply sufficiently high energy to the film without destroying it. It has therefore been assumed up to now that mono-films cannot be reliably welded with ultrasound. However, mono-films can also be welded with ultrasonic oscillations parallel to acoustic input surfaces, in particular torsional ultrasonic oscillations. Pressure peaks, which occur due to sharp energy direction generators in longitudinal welding processes and lead to destruction of the monofilm, are not necessary in torsional or other linear welding processes. However, energy direction sensors can still be used if they have a sufficiently large contact area. Similar advantages arise with materials made of biopolymers. Otherwise, there is also the problem of destroying the material when it is heated.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The contact lines are preferably arranged at an angle of 90&#xb0; with respect to the energy direction sensor. This results in particularly precisely defined points of sound introduction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The ultrasonic vibrations can be introduced as torsional vibrations, as longitudinal vibrations or as combinations of torsional and longitudinal vibrations. The generation of such oscillations is known to the skilled person. Particularly preferred is a combination of torsional and longitudinal vibrations generated by a sonotrode as described in the pending application EP 1920953201 of the same applicant. The contents of that application are incorporated by cross-reference into the present application.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Particularly preferably, workpieces are provided which consist of different materials or have different materials. In particular, the first workpiece consists of HDPE at least in the area of the energy direction generator. The second workpiece has LDPE at least on its first surface.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It has been shown that it is particularly advantageous if the first workpiece is placed with its side facing away from the energy direction sensor on a receptacle which has a receptacle surface which is also provided with contact lines. Such receptacles are often referred to as an anvil. An anvil with contact surfaces additionally ensures that as little friction as possible is generated between the anvil and the workpiece, so that the heat generated due to friction is generated in particular in the region of the interfaces between the first and second workpiece. Particularly preferably, the contour of the support surface is the same as the contour described above in connection with the sonotrode. However, other dimensions or shapes of ribs are also conceivable.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It has been shown that relatively short welding times are possible due to the optimized energy input. Typically, a welding process during a welding time of 50 to 60 milliseconds is sufficient, for example, to weld a spout of plastic material onto a flat packaging material. A longer welding could result in damage to the packing material, even if the arrangement according to the invention is used with relatively wide energy direction generators and specifically arranged contact lines. Therefore, it is preferred to use a generator to produce ultrasonic vibrations, which allows very precise control of the welding times. In particular, it should be possible to set welding times to an accuracy of at least 5 milliseconds. When using torsional or longitudinal vibrations parallel to the interface between the first and second workpiece, sufficient energy is nevertheless introduced into the workpieces so that a reliable joint is possible even with a short welding time.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method is provided in which a first and a second workpiece are also provided and brought into contact in the manner described above and in which ultrasonic vibrations are introduced into one of the workpieces via a working surface of the sonotrode. According to this aspect of the invention, ultrasonic vibrations are introduced into the first or into the second workpiece in the region of the energy direction generator in at least one sound introduction point. Starting from the sound introduction point, melting of the material of at least one of the workpieces takes place up to a welding zone which is spaced from the sound introduction point. By the selective introduction of vibrations in sound introduction points which are distant from the actual welding zone, a satisfactory weld can be produced even if the workpiece is impaired in the sound introduction points due to the contact between the workpiece and the sonotrode.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to still another aspect of the invention, a composite article is proposed. The article is typically composed of a first workpiece and a second workpiece. Typically, the assembly is performed by a method as described above. In particular, the article is a package. For example, the first workpiece is a spout, typically injection molded. The second workpiece is typically a multilayer packaging film. Such films are known per se and have layers of aluminum, cardboard, and plastic. However, monolayer films are also conceivable.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first and second workpieces are joined together by means of ultra-sonic welding. The first workpiece has an energy direction sensor on a side facing the second workpiece. It is understood, however, that the energy direction sensor may disappear completely or partially in the course of the welding.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the invention, the object on the second workpiece has sound introduction impressions in a region along the energy direction generator. The sound introduction impressions are spaced apart from one another and separated from one another by welding zones. The sound input impressions run transversely to the energy direction sensor. By introducing sound at individual points, it is possible to work with smaller amplitudes and/or welding times as described above. This ensures that even pressure-sensitive workpieces can be welded reliably, in particular firmly and tightly, without impairment.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another aspect of the invention relates to a composite article in which, alternatively or additionally, the energy direction sensor has an optimized cross-sectional shape. In particular, also in this embodiment, the composite article is a package comprising a first workpiece and a second workpiece. Preferably, this is an article as described above.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first and second workpieces are joined together by ultrasonic welding. The first workpiece has an energy direction sensor on a side facing the second workpiece. In cross-section, the energy direction sensor is in particular trapezoidal and has a contact surface for connection to the second workpiece. The contact surface is in particular flat. It has a width and the energy direction sensor has a height perpendicular to the contact surface. According to this aspect of the invention, the width of the contact surface is at least five times as large, preferably at least seven times as large as the height of the energy direction generator. In particular, the width of the contact surface is about ten times as large as the height of the energy direction generator. In this way, a flat and relatively wide contact surface is provided. Penetration of the energy direction generator into a packaging material, which could be damaged by the penetration, is thus avoided. At the same time, it has been shown that an energy direction sensor with such a cross-section is sufficient to produce a reliable weld. Particularly preferably, the energy direction sensor has a width of between 0.5 mm and 2 mm, especially preferably between 0.7 mm and 1.2 mm. The height of the energy direction sensor is preferably between 0.5 mm and 1.2 mm and is preferably about 0.1 mm.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first workpiece typically comprises or consists of a first plastic material. In particular, the material may be HDPE. The second workpiece typically has, on at least the side facing the first workpiece, a second plastic material that is different from the first plastic material. Typically, this is LDPE.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In particular, different plastic materials can be used, which have different melting points, but which are not too far apart from each other. Typically, the melting points do not differ by more than about 40&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In particular, if the second workpiece is a laminate, the sound initiation impressions may extend substantially through an uppermost layer of the laminate. In the case of packaging films, the sound introduction impressions extend in particular through an uppermost plastic layer to the level of a cardboard layer.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably, in all of the embodiment examples explained above, the energy direction transducer extends transversely to the contact lines. In particular, in connection with an energy direction sensor of the width described above, it is also conceivable that the energy direction sensor runs approximately parallel to the contact lines. Furthermore, an angle between contact lines and the energy direction sensor can also vary along the energy direction sensor. In particular, it is conceivable, for example, to use a torsion sonotrode with a circular working surface and contact lines arranged in a star shape to weld a non-circular contour, for example a square contour. In this case, for example, the angle between the energy direction generator and the contact lines may vary between 45&#xb0; and 90&#xb0; (45&#xb0; in the region of a corner of the square and 90&#xb0; in the region of the center of a side of the square).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Still another aspect of the invention relates to an alternative method for joining workpieces of different material. Particularly preferably, this process is carried out in combination with a process as described above. However, it can also be advantageously used in other contexts. According to the invention, workpieces made of different materials are joined together. A first workpiece has a first degree of crystallization at least in the region of an interface facing the second workpiece. A second workpiece has a second degree of crystallization at least in the region of an interface facing the first workpiece. The second degree of crystallization is different from the first degree of crystallization. The workpieces are subjected to torsional vibrations at a sound introduction surface, as a result of which the workpieces are bonded to one another. It has been shown that conventional longitudinal welding processes can hardly produce reliable welded joints between parts made of different materials if the workpieces have different degrees of crystallization. A sufficient weld can only be produced if the amorphous and crystalline components in the workpieces are softened at the same time during welding. In particular, workpieces with a high crystalline content require a high energy and thus also a high amplitude in order to achieve maximum energy input into the weld zone in a sufficiently short time. At the same time, in the case of longitudinal vibration introduction, a sufficiently high amplitude cannot be introduced in order not to damage workpieces with a larger amorphous content that have already been softened with lower amplitudes. This problem does not exist with torsional vibration initiation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The effect of this aspect of the invention can be seen, for example, when welding LDPE to LDPE compared to welding LDPE to HDPE. With an amplitude of 30 &#x3bc;m, a joint percentage of 65% can be achieved when welding LDPE to LDPE. An amplitude of 30 &#x3bc;m could also be achieved with longitudinal vibration without destroying workpieces. On the other hand, an amplitude of 30 &#x3bc;m for a combination of LDPE with HDPE only achieves a bonding proportion of 20% (i.e. a bond between the joining partners is only formed in 20% of the volume adjacent to the interface). This is not sufficient for a reliable welded joint.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Increasing the amplitude to 40 &#x3bc;m causes amorphous and crystalline components to melt in both workpieces. The LDPE and HDPE materials form a sufficiently strong bond at the molecular level.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">This finding makes it possible to weld different material pairings for a wide variety of applications: Conceivable applications include the welding of sensor holders in bumpers, the welding of sensor housings or the welding of aroma protection valves in packaging, e.g. for coffee.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A torsional vibration with an amplitude of at least 40 &#x3bc;m is therefore particularly preferred in the area of the sound-introducing surface.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first degree of crystallization is preferably between 10% and 60% and the second degree of crystallization between 60% and 90%.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the basis of the findings described above, the process according to the invention can be used particularly preferably for joining workpieces with LDPE and HDPE in the region of the interfaces. The workpieces can be made in one piece from LDPE or HDPE. However, it is also conceivable that they are provided with the corresponding material only in the region of the interface, as is the case, for example, with plastic-coated packaging materials (aluminum and cardboard substrate with an LDPE layer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Still another aspect of the invention relates to a composite article comprising at least two workpieces. A first workpiece has a first degree of crystallization at least in the region of an interface facing the second workpiece. A second workpiece has, at least in the region of an interface facing the first workpiece, a second degree of crystallization which is different from the first degree of crystallization. The workpieces are connected to each other by a welded joint between the interfaces, which is generated by torsional ultrasonic vibrations. The generation by means of torsional ultrasonic vibrations can be recognized by means of sound introduction impressions arranged on the sound introduction surface, which at least partially exhibit rotational symmetry.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The invention is explained in more detail below in embodiment examples and on the basis of the drawings.
