A virtual reality, or &#x201c;VR,&#x201d; scenario typically involves presentation of digital or virtual image information without transparency to other actual real-world visual input; an augmented reality, or &#x201c;AR,&#x201d; scenario typically involves presentation of digital or virtual image information as an augmentation to visualization of the actual world around the user.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The wearable device may include augmented and/or virtual reality glasses. The image can be displayed using image frames or raster scanned images. In these display devices, optical combiners are often used to combine light beams from different light sources. For example, red, green, and blue light beams can be combined to form a collimated combined colored light beam for displaying an image. Conventional optical combiners made with glass lenses, mirrors, and prisms can be bulky and heavy. They are undesirable for wearable device in VR or AR applications.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, improved structures and methods for optical combiners are highly desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for RGB (Red Green Blue) illuminators that are compact and light weight compared with conventional combiners. Some embodiments can also provide speckle reduction. In embodiments of the invention, the optical combiners can combine light beams from two or more light sources, such as laser diodes. In some embodiments, a mirror assembly reflects light beams from the light sources towards a combining element, which produces combined output beams along a common optical axis. The mirrors direct the beams to the combining element to achieve collinearity. The spatial arrangement of the mirror assembly and the combining element provides folded optical paths to reduce the dimension of the optical combiner. The mirror assembly can be a set of multiple mirrors or a single reflective element. Collimation and circularization can be achieved by a combination of refractive lens (for instance, toroidal) and mirrors (rotational symmetric/off-axis parabolic or freeform). These elements can be individual for each source or the same for each source. Therefore it can be a &#x2018;segmented/separated&#x2019; solution or monolithic solution per element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The combining element can be a stack of dichroic mirrors, prism configurations based on dichroic beam-combining, diffractive elements, or MEMS (Micro-electro-mechanical-system) mirrors. For example, the combining element can be a rotating MEMS mirror, which is tilted at a different angular displacement for each light source. For coherent sources, speckle reduction can be achieved in combination with an etendue generating element (for instance holographic diffusor) by wobbling the combining element to slightly shift the beam. Embodiments based on the rotating MEMS mirror can provide dithering of the light beams without requiring additional elements. In other embodiments, to provide beam dithering would need an additional actuator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to some embodiments of the invention, an optical combiner includes an input mirror assembly configured to receive multiple light beams and to provide a first reflected light beam, a second reflected light beam, and a third reflected light beam.
