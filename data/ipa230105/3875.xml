description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a technology for detecting a predetermined object by receiving a reflected wave that is a transmitted transmission wave reflected off the object, it is beneficial if a walking or running person can be detected as a target as in the radar described above. That is, in the above-described technology for detecting an object, it is beneficial if a walking or running person, rather than a moving non-living thing or animal, can be detected. An object of the present disclosure is to provide an electronic device, a method for controlling an electronic device, and a program that can detect a walking or running person as a target. According to one embodiment, an electronic device, a method for controlling an electronic device, and a program that can detect a walking or running person as a target can be provided. One embodiment is described in detail below with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An electronic device according to one embodiment is mounted in a vehicle (mobility device) such as an automobile, for example, and thus is capable of detecting, as a target, a predetermined object located around the mobility device. Therefore, the electronic device according to the one embodiment is capable of transmitting a transmission wave to an area around the mobility device from a transmission antenna installed on the mobility device. The electronic device according to the one embodiment is also capable of receiving a reflected wave that is the reflected transmission wave, from a reception antenna installed on the mobility device. At least one of the transmission antenna and the reception antenna may be included in a radar sensor or the like installed on the mobility device, for example.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A configuration in which the electronic device according to the one embodiment is mounted in an automobile such as a passenger car is described below as a typical example. However, the mobility device in which the electronic device according to the one embodiment is mounted is not limited to an automobile. The electronic device according to the one embodiment may be mounted in various mobility devices such as an autonomous car, a bus, a truck, a motorcycle, a bicycle, a ship, an aircraft, an agricultural machine such as a tractor, a snowplow, a garbage truck, a police car, an ambulance, a fire engine, a helicopter, and a drone. The mobility device in which the electronic device according to the one embodiment is mounted is not necessarily limited also to a mobility device that moves by its own motive power. For example, the mobility device in which the electronic device according to the one embodiment is mounted may be a trailer towed by a tractor. The electronic device according to the one embodiment is capable of measuring a distance or the like between the sensor and a predetermined object when at least one of the sensor and the object is movable. The electronic device according to the one embodiment is also capable of measuring the distance or the like between the sensor and the object even when both the sensor and the object are stationary.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An example of how the electronic device according to the one embodiment detects an object is described first.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram for describing how the electronic device according to the one embodiment is used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example in which a sensor including a transmission antenna and a reception antenna according to the one embodiment is installed on a mobility device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A sensor <b>5</b> including a transmission antenna and a reception antenna according to the one embodiment is installed on a mobility device <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. It is assumed that an electronic device <b>1</b> according to the one embodiment is also mounted (for example, built) in the mobility device <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A specific configuration of the electronic device <b>1</b> is described later. The sensor <b>5</b> may include at least one of the transmission antenna and the reception antenna, for example. The sensor <b>5</b> may also appropriately include at least any of other functional units, such as at least part of a control unit <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) included in the electronic device <b>1</b>. The mobility device <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be an automotive vehicle such as a passenger car but may be a mobility device of any type. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the mobility device <b>100</b> may move (travel or slowly travel), for example, in a positive Y-axis direction (traveling direction) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or in another direction, or may be stationary without moving.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the sensor <b>5</b> including the transmission antenna is installed on the mobility device <b>100</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, only one sensor <b>5</b> including the transmission antenna and the reception antenna is installed at a front portion of the mobility device <b>100</b>. The position where the sensor <b>5</b> is installed on the mobility device <b>100</b> is not limited to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and may be another appropriate position. For example, the sensor <b>5</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be installed on a left side, on a right side, and/or at a rear portion of the mobility device <b>100</b>. The number of such sensors <b>5</b> may be any number equal to or greater than 1 depending on various conditions (or requirements) such as a range and/or an accuracy of measurement performed at the mobility device <b>100</b>. The sensor <b>5</b> may be installed inside the mobility device <b>100</b>. The inside the mobility device <b>100</b> may be, for example, a space inside a bumper, a space inside a body, a space inside a headlight, or a space such as a driver's space.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The sensor <b>5</b> transmits an electromagnetic wave as a transmission wave from the transmission antenna. For example, when a predetermined object (for example, an object <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is located around the mobility device <b>100</b>, at least part of the transmission wave transmitted from the sensor <b>5</b> is reflected off the object to become a reflected wave. For example, the reception antenna of the sensor <b>5</b> receives such a reflected wave. In this manner, the electronic device <b>1</b> mounted in the mobility device <b>100</b> can detect the object as the target.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sensor <b>5</b> including the transmission antenna may be typically a radar (Radio Detecting and Ranging) sensor that transmits and receives a radio wave. However, the sensor <b>5</b> is not limited to a radar sensor. The sensor <b>5</b> according to the one embodiment may be, for example, a sensor based on the LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging, Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging) technology that uses an optical wave. Each of these sensors can include, for example, a patch antenna. Since the technologies such as RADAR and LIDAR are already known, detailed description may be appropriately simplified or omitted.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The electronic device <b>1</b> mounted in the mobility device <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> receives, from the reception antenna, the reflected wave of the transmission wave transmitted from the transmission antenna of the sensor <b>5</b>. In this manner, the electronic device <b>1</b> can detect, as the target, the predetermined object <b>200</b> located within a predetermined distance from the mobility device <b>100</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the electronic device <b>1</b> can measure a distance L between the mobility device <b>100</b>, which is a vehicle of interest, and the predetermined object <b>200</b>. The electronic device <b>1</b> can also measure a relative velocity between the mobility device <b>100</b>, which is the vehicle of interest, and the predetermined object <b>200</b>.

Among these sensors, a millimeter-wave radar is often employed from the viewpoint of accuracy, reliability, and cost of obstacle detection.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Examples of techniques for detecting an obstacle or the like located around a vehicle by using a millimeter-wave radar include, for example, blind spot detection (BSD), cross traffic alert (CTA) during backward movement or exiting from a parking, and free space detection (FSD). In such detection, a radio wave radiation range that is dependent on a physical shape of an antenna of a millimeter wave radar is commonly set in advance to determine an object detection range. That is, in each radar, the physical shape of the antenna of the millimeter-wave radar is commonly determined in advance depending on the use purpose, function, or the like of the radar, and the specification of the object detection range is also commonly defined in advance. Thus, a plurality of different radar sensors are needed to implement functions of a plurality of different radars.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">However, preparing a plurality of radar sensors depending on the use purpose or function is disadvantageous from the viewpoint of cost. For example, when the physical shape of the antenna is determined in advance and the radiation range is also determined, it is difficult to change the use purpose and function of the antenna. For example, when the physical shape and the radiation range of the antenna are determined and all objects located within the radiation range are detected, an amount of information to be processed increases. In this case, since an unnecessary object may also be erroneously detected as a target, the reliability of detection may decrease. For example, when the physical shape and the radiation range of the antenna are determined and the number of installed sensors is increased, the weight of the vehicle (mainly harness) increases to decrease fuel efficiency or the power consumption increases to decrease fuel efficiency. When detection is performed by using a plurality of radar sensors, a delay may occur between the sensors. Therefore, when automated driving, driving assist, or the like is performed on the basis of such detection, processing may take time. This is because a processing speed of the CAN is slower than an update rate of the radar, and feedback also takes time.
