netbook and notebook PC, which is built by attaching a flexible display sheet made e.g. of organic EL over respective surfaces of a first casing and a second casing, wherein organic light emitting

This multiaxial hinge device enables the first and second casings to be opened and closed with no change in surface length of the flexible display sheet. Still further, it is designed such that a bent part keeps a constant radius of curvature in a space part inside the multiaxial hinge device in order to prevent a flexible display sheet from snapping or causing failure when the first casing and the second casing are opened and closed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">By the way, in a conventional multiaxial hinge device, when a first casing and a second casing are opened and closed and a bent part of the flexible display sheet is deformed from a flat state to a curved and folded state, the folded part is deformed within a space of the multiaxial hinge device.

Therefore, no sag nor other problems occur at the folded part of the flexible display sheet.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the third invention, articulation joints are arranged with a good balance in the longitudinal and width directions of a frame row to allow smooth rotation movement of each frame making up the frame row due to opening and closing operation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the fourth invention, the curved surface which the opening and closing operation describes on the surface of the frame portion can be a symmetrical parabola centered on the first vertical frame, and there is no partial stress concentration in the bent part of the flexible display sheet, which can prevent damage to the flexible display sheet.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the fifth invention, if a plurality of synchronous gear trains are distributedly arranged in a frame row, an entire synchronous driving portion can be more compact and an articulated hinge device itself can be thinner.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the sixth invention, it is possible to realize the rotation movement of adjacent frames relative to each other in a simple structure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the seventh invention, even longer arc-shaped arms can avoid an interference of their tips with other vertical frames, etc. and assure the opening and closing operation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the eighth invention, a stress applied to arc-shaped arms and guide hole portions is dispersed to realize a smooth opening and closing operation by avoiding an interference between adjacent articulation joints and by distributedly arranging the joint contacts in a vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the ninth invention, a first friction click stop mechanism and a second friction click stop mechanism can be housed along the vertical direction in the first base frame and the second base frame, respectively, so that an articulated hinge device can be made more compact, that components making up the first and second friction click stop mechanisms can be also arranged vertically, and that the first friction click stop mechanism and the second friction click stop mechanism can be made more compact.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the tenth invention, the back side of the frame section can be covered following an opening and closing movement.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the eleventh invention, an articulated hinge device can protect the folded part of a flexible display sheet and provide a foldable electronic device with reduced occurrence of failure of the flexible display sheet.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"
