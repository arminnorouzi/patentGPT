The presently disclosed subject matter further includes methods of making and using the disclosed system.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Pipes have long been used to transmit liquids such as drinking water, wastewater, irrigation water, sewage, chemicals, and the like from one location to another. Piping has further been used as a conduit for electrical wiring. Piping is conventionally constructed from rigid polymeric materials, such as Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Polyethylene (PE), Cross-Linked Polyethylene (PEX), and the like. Piping is frequently installed in a wide variety of environments, such as within trenches in the ground, within the walls or ceiling of a building, and/or between two already fixed (but not necessarily aligned) external elements. Due to the general rigidity of the piping, care must be taken to accurately design, lay out, and connect piping. However, pipe fitting is a difficult skill to master. Particularly, due to the complex angles and narrow workspaces, there is typically a great amount of guesswork and complex measurements that must be taken to properly angle or position one pipe relative to another pipe. In addition, tape measures, levels, and other tools used in the field of construction are imprecise due to human error and limitations of the tools themselves. Tape measures, for example, can product inaccurate results at long distances due to bending or slacking of the tape. Further, because adjacent pieces of piping and their fittings are often connected permanently (e.g., via an epoxy or the like), a technician connecting the elements has little flexibility in installation path and only a single chance to make each connection correctly. It would therefore be beneficial to provide an alignment device that facilitates and streamlines the process of connecting piping and conduits.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter is directed to a pipe alignment device.

The term &#x201c;laser&#x201d; refers to any of a variety of devices that emit one or more discrete frequencies of amplified light. For example, laser <b>20</b> can emit visible light, which can be in the form of a laser diode or circuit, a light emitting diode (LED), or other optically transmitting devices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates one embodiment of laser <b>20</b> comprising beam output <b>60</b> through which the light leaves the laser.

Laser <b>20</b> also includes cap <b>63</b> that can be removed as desired by the user, such as to replace the battery or make repairs. Cap <b>63</b> also functions to prevent dust or other foreign objects from contacting the battery or internal circuitry.

The laser diameter should be smaller than the diameter of channel <b>15</b> to retain the laser snugly but securely within the housing. In some embodiments, the similarity in shape and/or size between the laser and channel <b>15</b> is sufficient to securely retain the laser within the channel. However, the use of adhesives and the like can be used to ensure that laser <b>20</b> does not become dislodged from the housing, such as if device <b>5</b> is inadvertently dropped.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates one embodiment of laser <b>20</b> configured within housing channel <b>15</b>.

The first segment is retained on the exterior of the pipe and can be used to insert and/or remove the housing from the pipe mouth (e.g., applying pressure to remove, screwing or unscrewing the second segment from the pipe mouth, etc.).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the output directs a beam of light in the same plane of the direction of the pipe, such as by being self-leveled within channel <b>15</b> or including a leveling device <b>101</b>. However, in some embodiments, the beam of light can be adjusted to account for the angling of pipes in an upward or downward direction. This can be accomplished though manual or automatic adjusters <b>77</b> that can move one end of the laser in a desired direction (e.g., up, down, left, right, or angled from center), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>. Thus, in some embodiments, the device remains seated within the pipe, but the laser within the channel can be angled as desired (e.g., by modifying the adjusters in a desired direction to shift the laser output). Adjusters <b>77</b> can have any desired configuration, such as set screws, rods, and the like. The orientation of laser <b>40</b> within the channel can be controlled through manipulation of the adjusters. For instance, one adjuster can be rotated or moved toward/away from the laser to move the laser along the channel axis (e.g., to the right of center, left of center, above center, below center). In this way, the beam from laser <b>20</b> can be level or offset for a desired pipe fitting application.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Any mechanism can be used to releasably retain second segment <b>35</b> within the open mouth of a pipe or fitting. For example, snap fit, pressure fit, threading (e.g., the exterior surface of the second segment can cooperate with interior pipe mouth threads), fasteners, set screws, and the like can be used.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Housing <b>10</b> and laser <b>20</b> therefore provide a guide for leveling and/or completing construction on piping systems (as well as any other projects).
