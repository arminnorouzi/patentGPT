Therefore, the flash FPGA has become a mainstream programmable logic device and is widely applied to signal processing and control. The flash FPGA provides the user with logic having hundreds of thousands to millions of system equivalent gates, has a working frequency up to 350 MHz, and provides a large number of IP cores.

Unlike the specific process of the flash memory, the logic process cannot accommodate devices working under various voltages. Therefore, the flash FPGA needs to be designed according to a break-down voltage of a logic process-based device. The maximum working voltage and break-down voltage that the logic process can usually provide for the device are 5 V and 12 V, respectively.
