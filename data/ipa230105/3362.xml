However, since the light emitting diode is a point light source, it must be transformed to the surface light source if it is used as a lighting device. Besides, if it is used as a spot light, a light distribution angle characteristics must be considered.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Patent document 1 discloses a lighting device, which uses a light emitting diode as the light source and to put a collimator lens surrounding the light emitting diode to collimate the emitting light.

Conventionally, for such a lighting device, a parabolic mirror has been used to form a parallel light. However, a certain depth is necessary in such a lighting device; therefore, it is difficult to attain a small lighting device or thin lighting device. In the meantime, the lighting devices, disclosed in Patent document 1 and patent document 2, need a lens to collimate the light from the light source; therefore, they need a certain length of optical path, consequently, it is difficult to realize a lighting device of small depth.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">In addition, since a light emitting efficiency of the LED decreases when the LED becomes high temperature, it is preferable to be a low heat generating light source, namely, low power consuming light source as a whole. Besides, if heat generation from the light source is less, it becomes not necessary to provide a heat sink and so forth.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The purpose of the present invention is to realize

The light from the lighting device <b>10</b> is collimated; a spot light <b>130</b> is emitted from the emitting surface <b>110</b>, and irradiates the incident surface <b>120</b>.

The light intensity is largest at the normal direction to the light emitting surface <b>110</b>; the light intensity decreases according to the polar angle becomes larger. The light distribution angle is defined as 2&#x3b8; provided the intensity along the normal direction is 100%, and the intensity along the polar angle &#x3b8; is 50%. In general collimated light, the light distribution angle is required as 12 degrees or less.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">Conventionally, a parabolic mirror <b>200</b> has been used to acquire such a collimated light. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of the lighting device <b>10</b> using the parabolic mirror <b>200</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross sectional view of the lighting device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the LED <b>20</b> is set at the center of the parabolic mirror <b>200</b>. The LED <b>20</b> is set e.g. on the LED circuit substrate <b>30</b>. The LED <b>20</b> is a high brightness LED, which becomes high temperature; thus, the LED <b>20</b> is set on the heat sink <b>300</b>. A part of the heat sink <b>300</b>, which is set at the rear of the parabolic mirror <b>200</b>, is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> along the line A-A. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the LED <b>20</b> is disposed at the bottom surface of the parabolic mirror <b>200</b>. The lights emitted from the LED <b>20</b>, except the light emitted in the optical axis direction, reflect at the parabolic mirror <b>200</b> and become parallel to the optical axis. The parabolic mirror <b>200</b>, however, needs to be as high as h<b>1</b> for enough collimating function. The height h<b>1</b> of the parabolic mirror <b>220</b> needs to be approximately 60 mm to acquire the light distribution angle of approximately 12 degrees. Actually, since the height h<b>2</b>, e.g. approximately 20 mm, of the heat sink <b>300</b> is added, the total height of the lighting device becomes 80 mm or more. In the meantime, in the lighting device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, one LED, which constitutes the light source, needs to be supplied with a large power; consequently, the heat generation in the LED becomes large, thus, the heat sink is indispensable.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">The inventors considered the structures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> through <b>10</b></figref> to countermeasure the problem explained above in relating to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are the structures to acquire a collimated light by forming a lens structure between the LED light source and the emitting surface of the lighting device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a plan view; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> along the line B-B. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the resin <b>11</b>, which reveals lens effect, is filled in the container <b>15</b> whose inner side is mirror. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a space <b>12</b> is formed in the resin <b>11</b>; the LED <b>20</b>, which is light source, is set at the bottom of the space <b>12</b>. The light from the LED <b>20</b> refracts between the space <b>12</b> and the resin <b>11</b>; reflects at the inner wall of the container <b>15</b>, and eventually goes out from the emitting surface <b>110</b> of the lighting device.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">The light distribution angle can be made as small as e.g. 5 degrees in such a structure, however, since that structure utilizes refraction effect of the lens, a certain length of light path is necessary; therefore, a height h<b>1</b> of the lighting device <b>10</b> becomes as high as approximately 60 mm. Therefore, from the view point of a height h<b>1</b> of the lighting device <b>10</b>, the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> does not give enough improvement. In the meantime, a diameter dd of the emitting surface <b>110</b> of the light emitting device <b>10</b> is e.g. 89 mm.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a plan view of the lighting device <b>10</b> which a height h<b>1</b> can be low. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> along the line C-C. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the LED <b>20</b> as a light source and the LED circuit substrate <b>30</b> are set at the side of the light emitting surface <b>110</b> in the light emitting device <b>10</b>, and the lights are reflected at the inner wall, which is constituted as a mirror, of the container <b>15</b>, thus, collimated lights are emitted.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> can make the height h<b>1</b> of the lighting device <b>10</b> low; however, the diameter dd of at the light emitting surface <b>110</b> of the lighting device <b>10</b> tends to be bigger as e.g. 110 mm. Further, this structure has difficulty in forming enough collimated light, thus, the light distribution angle becomes as approximately 13 degrees.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">The structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> is a third structure of the lighting device <b>10</b> considered by the inventors; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a plan view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a cross sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> along the line D-D. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, the resin <b>11</b> is filled in the container <b>15</b>; the LED <b>20</b> as the light source is set at the bottom of the container <b>15</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the curved surface reflector <b>16</b> made of metal is set opposing to the LED <b>20</b>, and is embedded in the resin <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">As shown by arrows, the lights emitted from the LED <b>20</b> reflect at the curved surface reflector <b>16</b> and go to the inner wall, which is made as reflecting surface, of the container <b>15</b>; then, the lights are reflected at the inner wall of the container <b>15</b> and go out from the emitting surface <b>110</b>. In this structure, it is rather easy to acquire a necessary light path because lights are returned to the direction of the light source <b>20</b> by the curved surface mirror <b>16</b>.

The resin <b>11</b> forms two surfaces at the emitting surface area, namely, a first surface, which constitutes the periphery of the emitting surface and a second surface which constitutes recessed central area. The first surface and the second surface are connected to each other by inclined third surface. The purpose of forming the recessed region is to control the light distribution angle of the emitting light. The reflection block <b>13</b> made of metal is locked in the central area of the recessed portion of the resin <b>11</b>.

The reflection block <b>13</b> is made of high reflection metal as e.g. aluminum. The reflection block <b>13</b> can be formed by resin whose surface, opposing to the LED <b>20</b>, is coated by metal film having high reflectance.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">The surface, opposing to the light source <b>20</b>, of the reflection block <b>13</b> is a curved surface; the opposite surface, namely emitting surface side, of the reflection block is flat. Forming the curved surface is easy if it is a spherical surface. However, theoretically, the curved surface of the reflection block <b>13</b> is determined in relation with the inner curved surface of the hole formed in the resin <b>11</b> and the curved reflection surface that corresponds to the outer surface of the resin <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">Unlike the container of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, the bottom portion of the container <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is made thick so that the curved surface can be designed and manufactured with flexibility, thus, to make the efficiency of the reflection surface maximum, or to make minimize the light distribution angle. A hole is formed at the bottom of the container <b>15</b>; the hole is filled with the LED <b>20</b> and the LED circuit substrate <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">There is a space <b>12</b>, where the resin <b>11</b> does not exist, between the LED <b>20</b> and the refection block <b>13</b>.

The inner wall of the resin <b>11</b> is circular in a plan view and is curved line in a cross sectional view. The light emitted from the LED <b>20</b> reflects at the lower curved surface (herein after, simply, curved surface) of the reflection block <b>13</b>, and impinges in the inner wall of the hole of the resin <b>11</b>. The light, impinged in the inner wall, refracts in the direction determined by curved surface of the inner wall, impinging angle to the inner wall, and refraction index of the resin <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">The outer surface of the resin <b>11</b> is circular in a plan view and is a curved line in a cross sectional view. The inner surface of the container <b>15</b> is formed along the outer surface of the resin <b>11</b>. The light entered the resin <b>11</b> is reflected at the inner surface of the container <b>15</b> and goes to the upper surface of the resin <b>11</b>, which is an emitting surface. The inner surface of the container <b>15</b> is a reflecting surface to collimate the impinged light. Namely, the reflection surface of the container <b>15</b> is designed most suitably in relation with the curved surface of the reflection block <b>13</b> and the curved surface of the hole of the resin <b>11</b>. The thickness of the container <b>15</b> is thicker at the bottom than at the emitting surface in a cross sectional view to facilitate for designing a suitable curved inner surface.

The lighting device is designed so that the exiting light has a certain light distribution angle. In embodiment 1, the recessed portion and the inclined portion are formed at the emitting surface to control the light distribution angle finally. A diameter, a depth of the recess and an angle of the inclined portion to form the recess can be determined freely. The reflection block <b>13</b> is locked at the center of the recess.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">In the meantime, the LED <b>20</b> becomes high temperature, thus, a heat from the LED <b>20</b> must be dissipated.

Then, the reflection block <b>13</b>, which is made of aluminum block, is locked in the hole formed at the center of the resin <b>11</b>. On the other hand, a hole is formed at the bottom of the container <b>15</b>, which is filled by the LED <b>20</b> and LED circuit substrate <b>30</b>.
