Users may insert a cigarette into the smoking space inside the sidestream smoke removal device and smoke the cigarette.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While providing advantageous effects such as reducing hand smell and removing (purifying) sidestream smoke, the sidestream smoke removal device has a problem in that, since smoking occurs in the smoking space therein, it is difficult for users to check smoking progress. For example, it is difficult for users to check whether ignition has occurred properly, whether an end of smoking is almost reached, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, sometimes, in order to directly check smoking progress, users may, during smoking, perform manipulations such as opening the smoking space or removing the cigarette from the smoking space and then inserting the cigarette back into the smoking space. When such manipulations are performed during combustion of the cigarette, the risk of burns and fire may sharply increase.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to providing a sidestream smoke removal device and a control method thereof capable of, by automatically displaying information on smoking progress, promoting ease of use and safety.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Objectives of the present disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned objective, and other unmentioned objectives should be clearly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present disclosure pertains from the description below.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A sidestream smoke removal device according to some embodiments of the present disclosure includes a housing in which a smoking space is formed, an article insertion portion which is disposed at one end of the housing and forms an opening for insertion of a smoking article into the smoking space, an ignition portion which is configured to ignite the smoking article inserted into the smoking space, a sidestream smoke processing portion which is configured to process sidestream smoke generated from the smoking article inserted into the smoking space, a temperature sensor which is configured to measure the temperature of the smoking article inserted into the smoking space, a display which is disposed on the outside of the housing, and a controller which is configured to monitor smoking progress with respect to the smoking article on the basis of the measured temperature and display a monitoring result through the display.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the temperature sensor may be disposed to measure the temperature near a downstream end of a smoking material portion constituting the inserted smoking article, and on the basis of the temperature measured by the temperature sensor, the controller may determine whether smoking has ended.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the temperature sensor may include a first temperature sensor and a second temperature sensor which are disposed at different positions inside the smoking space, and on the basis of temperatures measured by the first temperature sensor and the second temperature sensor, the controller may monitor smoking progress.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the first temperature sensor and the second temperature sensor may be disposed in the longitudinal direction of the smoking article, and the controller may compare temperatures measured by the first temperature sensor and the second temperature sensor to monitor smoking progress and may display, through the display, information on the smoking progress.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the temperature sensor may have an elongated body, may be disposed in the longitudinal direction of the inserted smoking article, and may be configured so that a first portion of the elongated body measures the temperature of a first corresponding portion of the smoking material portion constituting the smoking article and a second portion of the elongated body measures the temperature of a second corresponding portion of the smoking material portion, and the controller may monitor smoking progress on the basis of the temperatures measured by the first portion and the second portion.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the controller may, through the display, display information related to the smoking progress and may control the display to change the length of an indicator or the size of a display area of the indicator, as smoking is performed.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, a vent through which outside air enters may be formed in the housing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, a vent through which outside air enters may be formed in the housing, the sidestream smoke processing portion may include an exhaust fan configured to exhaust the sidestream smoke through rotation, and the controller may detect an end of smoking on the basis of the measured temperature and may, in response to detecting the end of smoking, close the vent and stop operation of the exhaust fan.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, a sidestream smoke removal device including a display can be provided, and information on smoking progress can be automatically provided through the display. Accordingly, since a user is able to directly check smoking progress without manipulating the device, ease of use and safety can be significantly improved.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Also, by using a plurality of temperature sensors disposed at different positions inside a smoking space or using an elongated temperature sensor disposed in a longitudinal direction, smoking progress can be easily monitored without an additional monitoring module. For example, puff events can be easily monitored by measuring changes in temperature, and the current smoking position of a smoking article can be easily monitored by comparing temperatures measured by the plurality of temperature sensors.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, a vent and an exhaust fan can be appropriately controlled according to smoking progress, and thus a user's smoking satisfaction can be improved.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, an automatic extinguishing function can be performed upon detecting an end of smoking. Accordingly, the risk of fire and burns due to the user's carelessness can be minimized.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The advantageous effects according to the technical spirit of the present disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned advantageous effects, and other unmentioned advantageous effects should be clearly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art from the description below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exemplary view for describing a structure of a sidestream smoke removal device according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>6</b></figref> are exemplary views for describing various modifications of the sidestream smoke removal device according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an exemplary flowchart showing a control method of the sidestream smoke removal device according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an exemplary flowchart showing a control method of a sidestream smoke removal device according to some other embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an exemplary view for describing a method of determining the current smoking position according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an exemplary view for describing a method of displaying the extent to which a smoking article is smoked according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">MODES OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

For example, smoking articles may include products that can be smoked, such as a cigarette, a cigar, and a cigarillo.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the following embodiments, &#x201c;smoking material&#x201d; may refer to a material that generates smoke and/or an aerosol or is used in smoking. For example, the smoking material may include a tobacco material. For example, the tobacco material may include pieces of tobacco leaves, tobacco stems, and materials obtained by processing the same. As a more specific example, the tobacco material may include ground tobacco leaves, ground reconstituted tobacco, expanded shredded tobacco, expanded tobacco midribs, reconstituted tobacco leaves, and the like, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the following embodiments, &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; or &#x201c;upstream direction&#x201d; may refer to a direction moving away from an oral region of a user, and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; or &#x201c;downstream direction&#x201d; may refer to a direction approaching the oral region of the user. The terms &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; may be used to describe relative positions of components constituting a smoking article. For example, in a smoking article <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and so on, a filter portion is disposed downstream or in a downstream direction of a smoking material portion, and the smoking material portion is disposed upstream or in an upstream direction of the filter portion.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the following embodiments, &#x201c;longitudinal direction&#x201d; may refer to a direction corresponding to a longitudinal axis of a smoking article.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the following embodiments, &#x201c;puff&#x201d; refers to inhalation by a user, and the inhalation may refer to a situation in which a user draws smoke into his or her oral cavity, nasal cavity, or lungs through the mouth or nose.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Hereinafter, various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exemplary view for describing a structure of a sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. In particular, the drawings such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrate a state in which the smoking article <b>30</b> is inserted into the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may include a housing <b>11</b>, an article insertion portion <b>12</b>, a back cover <b>13</b>, an insulating portion <b>14</b>, a temperature sensor <b>20</b>, an ignition portion <b>15</b>, a sidestream smoke processing portion <b>16</b>, a mesh <b>17</b>, a display <b>19</b>, and a controller <b>18</b>. However, only the components relating to the embodiment of the present disclosure are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Therefore, those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present disclosure pertains should understand that the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may further include general-purpose components other than the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may further include a battery (not illustrated) configured to supply power to electrical components (e.g., the controller <b>18</b>, the display <b>19</b>, etc.). Also, some of the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may not be essential components of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b>. That is, the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may also be implemented in a form in which some of the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are omitted. Hereinafter, each component of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The housing <b>11</b> may form a smoking space inside the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> and may form at least a portion of an exterior of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the housing <b>11</b> as a sidewall of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b>, but the housing <b>11</b> may also refer to the entire exterior-forming structure including the article insertion portion <b>12</b>, the back cover <b>13</b>, and the insulating portion <b>14</b>. In order to ensure the durability of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> and minimize the risk of damage thereto, the housing <b>11</b> may be made of a sturdy material.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, a vent <b>111</b> may be formed in the housing <b>11</b> to allow outside air to smoothly enter the smoking space. By allowing the outside air to enter during smoking, the vent <b>111</b> may promote combustion of the smoking article <b>30</b>, and accordingly, a smoking function of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may be significantly improved. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example in which a single vent <b>111</b> is formed in the housing <b>11</b>, but the number of vents <b>111</b> may also be plural. In addition, positions at which vents <b>111</b> are formed, sizes of the vents, intervals between the vents, etc. may also be designed in various ways. The opening/closing of the vent <b>111</b> and/or a degree of opening/closing thereof may be controlled by the controller <b>18</b>. This will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, the article insertion portion <b>12</b> may be disposed at one end (e.g., an upper end) of the housing <b>11</b> and form an opening for insertion of the smoking article <b>30</b>. A user may insert the smoking article <b>30</b> into the smoking space inside the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> through the article insertion portion <b>12</b>. In order to block the heat inside the smoking space from being released to the outside, the article insertion portion <b>12</b> may be made of an insulating material. Also, in order to prevent shaking of the inserted smoking article <b>30</b>, the article insertion portion <b>12</b> may have a holder structure that can hold the smoking article <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the article insertion portion <b>12</b> may have a structure in which it is possible to adjust the size of the opening. For example, the article insertion portion <b>12</b> may have a structure that allows the opening to be tightened or loosely expanded through manual operation. As another example, the article insertion portion <b>12</b> may also be configured to automatically tighten the opening to fit the smoking article <b>30</b>. As a more specific example, the article insertion portion <b>12</b> may be controlled by the controller <b>18</b>, and the controller <b>18</b> may control the opening of the article insertion portion <b>12</b> to be tightened upon a sensor detecting insertion of the smoking article <b>30</b> or upon reception of a user input (e.g., a push on a button). According to the present embodiment, since the size of the opening is adjusted to fit the smoking article <b>30</b>, shaking of the smoking article <b>30</b> may be prevented, and support stability for the smoking article <b>30</b> may be improved. Further, since it becomes possible to insert smoking articles of various sizes, usability of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may also be improved.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The smoking article <b>30</b> may consist of a filter portion which is disposed at a downstream portion and a smoking material portion which abuts an upstream end of the filter portion. However, a detailed structure of the smoking article <b>30</b> may be modified in various ways. The filter portion may include a filter material that can filter smoke, and the smoking material portion may include a smoking material. Examples of the smoking article <b>30</b> may include a combustion-type cigarette, but the smoking article <b>30</b> is not limited thereto and may be any article which generates sidestream smoke during smoking.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, the back cover <b>13</b> may be disposed at the other end (e.g., a lower end) of the housing <b>11</b> and serve as a cover of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b>. A gas discharge path may be formed in the back cover <b>13</b> to allow sidestream smoke processed (purified) through the sidestream smoke processing portion <b>16</b> to be discharged to the outside. For example, a gas discharge path such a fine hole may be formed in the back cover <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, the insulating portion <b>14</b> may be made of a material having low thermal conductivity and block the heat inside the smoking space from being released to the outside. By being disposed on an outer surface of the housing <b>11</b>, the insulating portion <b>14</b> may serve to prevent the risk of burns due to internal heat when the user's body comes in contact with the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> (e.g., when the user grips the device <b>1</b> for smoking).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, the temperature sensor <b>20</b> may be disposed inside the smoking space and measure the temperature of the smoking article <b>30</b> inserted into the smoking space. The number of temperature sensors <b>20</b>, the shape of temperature sensors <b>20</b>, positions at which temperature sensors <b>20</b> are disposed, intervals at which temperature sensors <b>20</b> are disposed, etc. may be designed in various ways and may vary according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the temperature sensor <b>20</b> may be disposed to measure the temperature near a downstream end of the smoking material portion. In this case, whether smoking has ended may be accurately determined using only the temperature sensor <b>20</b> without an additional monitoring module. This may be understood as using the fact that smoking usually ends upon complete combustion of the smoking material portion. For example, the controller <b>18</b> may determine that smoking has ended when the temperature measured by the temperature sensor <b>20</b> is a reference value or more (e.g., when the current smoking position reaches the downstream end of the smoking material portion) or when the temperature measured by the temperature sensor <b>20</b> increases and then decreases to less than the reference value (e.g., when combustion power weakens at the downstream end of the smoking material portion).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some other embodiments, a plurality of temperature sensors <b>20</b> may be disposed at different positions inside the smoking space. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a plurality of temperature sensors <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> may be disposed in the longitudinal direction of the smoking article <b>30</b>. Alternatively, the plurality of temperature sensors <b>20</b> may be disposed at positions facing each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example in which the two temperature sensors <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> are disposed, but the number of temperature sensors <b>20</b> may also be three or more. Here, the intervals at which the temperature sensors <b>20</b> are disposed may be the same or different. When the plurality of temperature sensors <b>20</b> are used, smoking progress (e.g., the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is smoked) may be more accurately monitored, and various pieces of monitoring information may be obtained as follows.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some examples, the start of smoking may be detected (determined) through the temperature sensor (e.g., <b>20</b>-<b>2</b>) disposed near the upstream end of the smoking material portion. For example, the controller <b>18</b> may determine that smoking has started when the temperature measured by the temperature sensor (e.g., <b>20</b>-<b>2</b>) is equal to or higher than a reference value.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some examples, temperatures measured by the plurality of temperature sensors (e.g., <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>2</b>) disposed in the longitudinal direction may be compared to determine the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is smoked (e.g., the current smoking (combustion) position). This example will be described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some examples, the plurality of temperature sensors <b>20</b> may be disposed at positions facing each other with respect to the inserted smoking article <b>30</b> or may be disposed in the circumferential direction of the smoking article <b>30</b> inside the smoking space (for example, four temperature sensors <b>20</b> may be disposed at <b>90</b>&#xb0; intervals). In this case, temperatures measured by the plurality of temperature sensors <b>20</b> may be compared to determine the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is tilted (shaken). For example, when a temperature measured by a specific temperature sensor is higher than a temperature measured by another temperature sensor, the controller <b>18</b> may determine that the inserted smoking article <b>30</b> is tilted in a direction toward the specific temperature sensor. Alternatively, when temperatures measured by the plurality of temperature sensors <b>20</b> fluctuate by a reference value or more, the controller <b>18</b> may determine that the inserted smoking article <b>30</b> is shaking.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In still some other embodiments, a temperature sensor <b>20</b> having an elongated body may be disposed in the smoking space. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the elongated temperature sensor <b>20</b> may be disposed in the longitudinal direction of the smoking article <b>30</b>. The temperature sensor <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment may be implemented so that a first portion of the elongated body measures the temperature of a first corresponding portion of the smoking material portion constituting the smoking article <b>30</b>, and a second portion measures the temperature of a second corresponding portion of the smoking material portion. A specific implementation method may vary. In this case, smoking progress may be monitored on the basis of a temperature measured by a specific portion of the elongated body. For example, the controller <b>18</b> may compare temperatures measured by different portions of the elongated body and determine the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is smoked.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In yet some other embodiments, the temperature sensor <b>20</b> may be disposed on the basis of combinations of the above-described embodiments.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Description will be given by referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The ignition portion <b>15</b> may be disposed inside the smoking space and ignite the smoking article <b>30</b> inserted into the smoking space. The ignition portion <b>15</b> may be controlled by the controller <b>18</b> or may provide an ignition function due to manual operation by a user. The number of ignition portions <b>15</b>, the shape of ignition portions <b>15</b>, the arrangement form thereof, etc. may be designed in various ways and may vary according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the ignition portion <b>15</b> may be disposed at a fixed position. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and so on, the ignition portion <b>15</b> may be disposed to ignite the vicinity of the upstream end of the inserted smoking article <b>30</b>. In this case, the structure of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may be simplified, and thus a defect rate during manufacture may be minimized.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some other embodiments, the ignition portion <b>15</b> may be designed and implemented to be movable. A specific implementation method may vary. For example, the ignition portion <b>15</b> may be implemented to move in the longitudinal direction due to manual operation by a user or control by the controller <b>18</b>. In some examples, the controller <b>18</b> may, in response to detecting the insertion of the smoking article <b>30</b>, move the ignition portion <b>15</b> to the upstream end of the smoking article <b>30</b>. According to the present embodiment, since it becomes possible to universally apply the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> to smoking articles of various lengths, the usability of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may be significantly improved.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In still some other embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the ignition portion <b>15</b> may be coupled to an elastic support portion <b>21</b>. The elastic support portion <b>21</b> may consist of an elastic body that is able to stretch and contract and may perform a function of elastically supporting the upstream end of the inserted smoking article <b>30</b>. For example, as the smoking article <b>30</b> is inserted, the ignition portion <b>15</b> may come in close contact with the upstream end of the smoking article <b>30</b>, and the elastic support portion <b>21</b> may be contracted due to an insertion force and thus stably support the smoking article <b>30</b>. In some examples, at least a portion of the ignition portion <b>15</b> may have a shape that sharply protrudes toward the article insertion portion <b>12</b> (e.g., the shape of a needle). In this case, since the ignition portion <b>15</b> passes through the upstream end of the smoking article <b>30</b> as the smoking article <b>30</b> is inserted, the smoking article <b>30</b> may be supported more strongly at the time of ignition, and accordingly, support stability and ignition stability may be significantly improved. That is, it is possible to significantly alleviate a problem in which, at the time of ignition, the smoking article <b>30</b> is not ignited well due to shaking. According to the present embodiment, since the elastic support portion <b>21</b> which is stretchable and contractible allows smoking articles (e.g., <b>30</b>) of various lengths (e.g., L<b>1</b>) to be stably accommodated, the usability of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may be significantly improved.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Description will be given by referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The sidestream smoke processing portion <b>16</b> may be disposed inside the smoking space and perform various processes for sidestream smoke generated from the inserted smoking article <b>30</b>. For example, the sidestream smoke processing portion <b>16</b> may be disposed between the inserted smoking article <b>30</b> and the back cover <b>13</b> and perform a purification function for the sidestream smoke. Also, the sidestream smoke processing portion <b>16</b> may further perform an exhaust function that allows the purified sidestream smoke to be easily discharged to the outside. However, a detailed structure and an operation method of the sidestream smoke processing portion <b>16</b> may be designed in various ways and may vary according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, as illustrated, the sidestream smoke processing portion <b>16</b> may be configured to include a filter structure <b>161</b> and an exhaust fan <b>162</b>. The filter structure <b>161</b> may perform a purification function for the sidestream smoke, and the exhaust fan <b>162</b> may perform an exhaust function for the sidestream smoke. For example, the exhaust fan <b>162</b> may suction the sidestream smoke toward the filter structure <b>161</b> through rotation and allow the sidestream smoke that has passed through the filter structure <b>161</b> to be smoothly discharged to the outside. The operation of the exhaust fan <b>162</b> may be controlled by the controller <b>18</b>. This will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and so on.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, the mesh <b>17</b> may be disposed between the sidestream smoke processing portion <b>16</b> and the back cover <b>13</b> and serve as a safety net. For example, the mesh <b>17</b> may prevent a specific object (e.g., some pieces of the filter portion <b>161</b>, etc.) inside the smoking space from being detached toward the back cover <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, the display <b>19</b> may be disposed on an outer surface of the housing <b>11</b> to display various pieces of information according to control by the controller <b>18</b>. For example, the display <b>19</b> may display smoking progress information, device information, smoking history information, user information, and the like. Here, examples of the smoking progress information may include information on smoking progress (e.g., any information related to smoking progress such as the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is smoked, the current smoking position, the number of remaining puffs, smoking time, remaining smoking time, etc.) and puff information (e.g., any information related to puff events such as a puff number, a puff length, a puff interval, a puff intensity, whether puffs are performed, etc.), but the smoking progress information is not limited thereto. Examples of the device information may include information such as a power state, whether a failure has occurred, and a battery state (e.g., a battery level, whether charging is needed, etc.), but the device information is not limited thereto. The smoking history information may include the cumulative number of cigarettes smoked but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The display <b>19</b> may include a visual display means such as a light emitting diode (LED) display and thus visually display the various pieces of information. However, a specific display means may vary.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, the controller <b>18</b> may control the overall operation of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b>. For example, the controller <b>18</b> may control the operation of the exhaust fan <b>162</b>, control the operation of the display <b>19</b>, and also control the operation of other components included in the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b>. In addition, the controller <b>18</b> may determine smoking progress of the smoking article <b>30</b> and may check a state of each of the components of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> to determine whether the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> is in an operable state. A specific operation method of the controller <b>18</b> will be described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The controller <b>18</b> may be implemented with at least one processor. The processor may also be implemented with an array of a plurality of logic gates or implemented with a combination of a general-purpose microprocessor and a memory which stores a program that may be executed by the microprocessor. Also, those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present disclosure pertains should clearly understand that the controller <b>18</b> may also be implemented with other forms of hardware.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the controller <b>18</b> as being disposed outside the housing <b>11</b> of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b>, but this is only for convenience of understanding, and the position at which the controller <b>18</b> is disposed may vary. For example, in order to prevent a failure due to external impact, the controller <b>18</b> may be disposed at a specific position inside the housing <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Meanwhile, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may further include a module configured to provide aural and/or tactual outputs. For example, the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may further include a speaker, a vibration module, etc. In this case, the controller <b>18</b> may further use these modules to provide various pieces of information to the user.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Also, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a support portion <b>22</b> configured to support a side surface of the smoking article <b>30</b> inserted into the smoking space of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may be further disposed. For example, as illustrated, a plurality of support portions <b>22</b> may be disposed to support a side surface at a first point and a side surface at a second point of the smoking article <b>30</b>. In order to support a specific point of the smoking article <b>30</b>, a plurality of support portions <b>22</b> may be disposed in the circumferential direction of the smoking article <b>30</b> (for example, four support portions <b>22</b> may be disposed at <b>90</b>&#xb0; intervals), or a single support portion <b>22</b> formed in a ring shape may be disposed. In this way, the number of support portions <b>22</b>, the arrangement form thereof, the shape thereof, etc. may be designed and implemented in various ways.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Also, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a cutting portion <b>23</b> may be further disposed in the smoking space. By cutting the smoking article <b>30</b>, which is undergoing combustion, to prevent further combustion, the cutting portion <b>23</b> may provide a safe extinguishing function at a point in time desired by the user and may minimize the risk of burns that may occur due to carelessness of the user (e.g., the risk of burns due to carelessness when directly extinguishing the smoking article <b>30</b>) and the risk of fire.

Also, since information on smoking progress is displayed through the display <b>19</b>, ease of use and safety may be significantly improved.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Hereinafter, a control method according to some embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and so on.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Each step of the control method which will be described below may be performed by the controller (e.g., <b>18</b>) of the sidestream smoke removal device (e.g., <b>1</b>). Also, each step of the control method may be implemented with one or more instructions executed by the controller. The control method is applicable to various types of sidestream smoke removal devices, but for convenience of understanding, description will be continued assuming that the control method is performed by the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>. Therefore, in the following description, when the subject of a specific operation is omitted, the specific operation may be understood as being performed by the controller <b>18</b> of the illustrated device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an exemplary flowchart showing a control method according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. However, this is only a preferred embodiment for achieving the objectives of the present disclosure, and, of course, some steps may be added or omitted as necessary.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the control method may begin by detecting the start of smoking (S<b>10</b>). In this step, a method of detecting the start of smoking may vary.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may detect the start of smoking through a user input (e.g., an input on a button, etc.) operating the ignition portion <b>15</b>. Alternatively, the controller <b>18</b> may recognize the start of smoking through a user input (e.g., an input on a button, etc.) requesting to start smoking and may operate the ignition portion <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some other embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may detect the start of smoking in response to determining that a temperature measured by the temperature sensor <b>20</b> is a reference value or more. Here, for example, the temperature sensor <b>20</b> may be disposed to measure the temperature near the upstream end of the smoking article <b>30</b> inside the smoking space.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In step S<b>20</b>, in response to detecting the start of smoking, the controller <b>18</b> may open (e.g., partially open or completely open) the vent <b>111</b>. This is because outside air that enters through the vent <b>111</b> may promote combustion of the smoking article <b>30</b>. Also, the controller <b>18</b> may operate the exhaust fan <b>162</b>. This is because, as the exhaust fan <b>162</b> operates, sidestream smoke generated during smoking may be smoothly exhausted.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Meanwhile, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the controller <b>18</b> may perform control of the vent <b>111</b> and the exhaust fan <b>162</b> on the basis of puff events of the user during smoking. However, a specific control method thereof may vary.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some examples, the controller <b>18</b> may adjust a degree of opening/closing of the vent <b>111</b> on the basis of puff events. Specifically, the controller <b>18</b> may make the vent <b>111</b> more open when puffs are performed and make the vent <b>111</b> less open when puffs are not performed. In this case, outside air may more smoothly enter while puffs are performed, and thus combustion of the smoking article <b>30</b> may be further promoted. Also, a problem that unpurified sidestream smoke leaks through the vent <b>111</b> while puffs are not performed may be alleviated. For reference, while puffs are performed, since a lot of sidestream smoke is not generated and an air flow path through which gas enters is formed through the vent <b>111</b>, leaking of sidestream smoke may not occur even when the vent <b>111</b> is opened.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some other examples, the controller <b>18</b> may operate (rotate) the exhaust fan <b>162</b> in a reverse direction while puffs are performed and may operate (rotate) the exhaust fan <b>162</b> in a forward direction while puffs are not performed. Here, the forward direction may refer to a rotational direction that causes sidestream smoke to be suctioned toward the filter structure <b>161</b>, and the reverse direction may refer to the opposite rotational direction. In this case, while puffs are performed, an air flow may be concentrated toward the upstream end of the smoking article <b>30</b> and combustion may be promoted, and while puffs are not performed, sidestream smoke may be suctioned toward the filter structure <b>161</b> and smoothly exhausted.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In still some other examples, the controller <b>18</b> may adjust the degree of opening/closing of the vent <b>111</b> and/or the rotational speed of the exhaust fan <b>162</b> on the basis of information on puff events (e.g., a puff intensity, a puff interval, a puff length, etc.). For example, in a case in which the puff intensity increases, the puff length increases, or the puff interval decreases, the controller <b>18</b> may make the vent <b>111</b> more open. In the opposite case, the controller <b>18</b> may make the vent <b>111</b> less open. This is because the puff intensity is likely to increase when combustion of the smoking article <b>30</b> is not smoothly performed. Alternatively, in the case in which the puff intensity increases, the puff length increases, or the puff interval decreases, the controller <b>18</b> may increase the rotational speed of the exhaust fan <b>162</b> while puffs are performed (that is, increase the rotational speed thereof in the reverse direction). In the opposite case, the controller <b>18</b> may decrease the rotational speed of the exhaust fan <b>162</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In yet some other examples, the controller <b>18</b> may perform control on the basis of combinations of the above-described examples.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the previous embodiments, a method in which the controller <b>18</b> detects a puff may vary. For example, the controller <b>18</b> may detect a puff on the basis of a change in temperature measured by the temperature sensor <b>20</b>. Specifically, when a degree of temperature change is a reference value or more (e.g., when combustion temperature of the smoking article <b>30</b> instantaneously increases), the controller <b>18</b> may recognize that a puff is generated. This may be understood as using a phenomenon in which combustion is accelerated at the upstream end of the smoking article <b>30</b> by puffs. Also, the controller <b>18</b> may determine a puff intensity on the basis of a degree of temperature change. For example, the controller <b>18</b> may determine the puff intensity to be high as the degree of temperature change is high and determine the puff intensity to be low as the degree of temperature change is low.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In step S<b>30</b>, the controller <b>18</b> may detect the end of smoking. In this step, the controller <b>18</b> may detect the end of smoking using various methods, and the method may vary according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may detect the end of smoking on the basis of a temperature measured by the temperature sensor <b>20</b>. Here, for example, the temperature sensor <b>20</b> may be disposed near the downstream end of the smoking material portion of the smoking article <b>30</b>. For example, when the temperature measured by the temperature sensor <b>20</b> is a reference value or more or the measured temperature increases and then decreases, the controller <b>18</b> may determine that smoking has ended.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some other embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may detect the end of smoking on the basis of puff events, the time elapsed after the start of smoking, and the like. For example, when a predetermined amount of time has elapsed after the start of smoking, a puff number is a reference value or more, or a puff has not been detected for a predetermined amount of time or more after a previous puff, the controller <b>18</b> may determine that smoking has ended.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In still some other embodiments, smoking termination conditions may be set. For example, smoking termination conditions may be set on the basis of a puff number, the time elapsed after the start of smoking, and the like. In this case, in response to predetermined smoking termination conditions being satisfied, the controller <b>18</b> may determine to end smoking.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In step S<b>40</b>, in response to detecting the end of smoking, the controller <b>18</b> may perform an automatic extinguishing function. In this step, a method in which the controller <b>18</b> performs the automatic extinguishing function may vary.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may close the vent <b>111</b> and stop operation of the exhaust fan <b>162</b>. In this case, since outside air stops entering due to closing of the vent <b>111</b>, the smoking article <b>30</b> may be naturally extinguished due to lack of oxygen.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some other embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may close the vent <b>111</b> and operate the exhaust fan <b>162</b> for a predetermined amount of time and then stop the operation or continuously operate the exhaust fan <b>162</b>. In this case, since outside air stops entering due to closing of the vent <b>111</b>, and inside air is exhausted to the outside through the exhaust fan <b>162</b>, the smoking article <b>30</b> may be naturally extinguished.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In still some other embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may perform the automatic extinguishing function by operating the cutting portion <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In yet some other embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may perform the automatic extinguishing function on the basis of combinations of the above-described embodiments. For example, the controller <b>18</b> may perform the automatic extinguishing function through a first extinguishing process of closing the vent <b>111</b> and stopping operation of the exhaust fan <b>162</b> and a second extinguishing process of cutting the inserted smoking article <b>30</b> through the cutting portion <b>23</b>. Here, the first extinguishing process and the second extinguishing process may be performed in any order.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Meanwhile, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure, in response to detecting the end of smoking, the controller <b>18</b> may operate the exhaust fan <b>162</b> in the forward direction (that is, the suctioning direction) for a predetermined amount of time. In this case, since smoking by-products such as cigarette ash gather near the filter structure <b>161</b> due to the exhaust fan <b>162</b>, the inside of the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b> may be cleaned more easily. In some examples, the controller <b>18</b> may also adjust the rotational speed of the exhaust fan <b>162</b> on the basis of the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is burned. For example, when the smoking article <b>30</b> is completely burned, since the amount of by-products is large, the controller <b>18</b> may rotate the exhaust fan <b>162</b> at a higher speed. In the opposite case, the controller <b>18</b> may rotate the exhaust fan <b>162</b> at a lower speed. The extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is burned may be determined on the basis of a puff number, the time elapsed after the start of smoking, the current smoking position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), and the like.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The control method according to some embodiments of the present disclosure has been described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. According to the above-described method, since the vent <b>111</b> and the exhaust fan <b>162</b> may be appropriately controlled according to smoking progress, a user's satisfaction with the device may be improved. Also, since the automatic extinguishing function is performed upon the end of smoking, the risk of fire and burns due to the user's carelessness may be minimized.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Hereinafter, a control method according to some other embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. However, for clarity of the present disclosure, description of contents overlapping with those related to the control method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an exemplary flowchart showing the control method according to some other embodiments of the present disclosure.

In this step, the controller <b>18</b> may display an indicator indicating the start of smoking on the display <b>19</b>. For additional description of this step, refer to step S<b>10</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In step S<b>120</b>, the controller <b>18</b> may monitor smoking progress. Here, smoking progress may include any situation related to smoking such as the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is smoked, puff events, and the like.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may compare temperatures measured by a plurality of temperature sensors <b>20</b> disposed at different positions to accurately determine the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is smoked (or the current smoking (combustion) position thereof). Specifically, let's assume that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a plurality of temperature sensors <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>20</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> are disposed in the longitudinal direction in the smoking space inside the sidestream smoke removal device <b>1</b>. Then, the controller <b>18</b> may compare temperatures measured by a first temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, a second temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>2</b>, and a third temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> to determine the current smoking position of the smoking article <b>30</b> and the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is smoked. For example, in a case in which the temperature measured by the first temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> is the lowest, the temperature measured by the second temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> is lower than the temperature measured by the third temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>, and the temperature measured by the third temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> is the highest, the controller <b>18</b> may determine that the current smoking position of the smoking article <b>30</b> is between the second temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> and the third temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> and closer to the third temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>. Here, the controller <b>18</b> may determine that the larger the temperature difference between the second temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> and the third temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>, the closer the current smoking position of the smoking article <b>30</b> is to the third temperature sensor <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In step S<b>130</b>, the controller <b>18</b> may display monitoring information through the display <b>19</b>. However, types of monitoring information and a specific display method therefor may vary.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may, through the display <b>19</b>, display information related to the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is smoked. For example, the controller <b>18</b> may display an indicator (e.g., a cigarette-shaped object) indicating the smoking article <b>30</b> (or the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is smoked) and may control the display <b>19</b> to reduce the length of the indicator as smoking is performed. As another example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the controller <b>18</b> may display, through the display <b>19</b>, a display area (e.g., LED lighting areas/sections) indicating the extent to which the smoking article <b>30</b> is smoked and may control the display <b>19</b> to change the size of the display area (e.g., the number of LED lighting areas/sections) as smoking is performed. Here, the size of the display area may increase or decrease as smoking is performed.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some other embodiments, the controller <b>18</b> may display information related to puff events through the display <b>19</b>.
