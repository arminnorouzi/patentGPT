More particularly, this disclosure is related to a grill basket with a removable handle. Specifically, this disclosure is related to a grill basket with a removable handle and two or more engagement assemblies provided on a basket portion of the grill basket. The two or more engagement assemblies enable the handle to be removably engaged with the basket portion in different locations so that the grill basket is usable in more than one orientation. The disclosure further relates to a grill basket having one or more selectively removable dividers which allow for selective separation of regions of the grill basket interior.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Background Information</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cooking on a grill is a popular method of preparing food. Some grills are heated by charcoal, others are gas powered, and, more recently, some are powered by infrared elements. Food is placed onto a metal grate provided in the grill and the food is cooked by its close proximity to heat produced by one of the aforementioned methods. The foods are heated and cooked to the desired degree and the flavor profile of some foods may be enhanced by caramelization through the exposure of the food to heat.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At times, if a user has to step away from the grill for too long or is inexperienced with cooking a particular food, the food being cooked may end up sticking to the grill's grate. This may result in the food becoming burned and/or blackened and the food may also be difficult to remove from the grate without comprising the integrity of the food item. Furthermore, grilling irregularly-shaped foodstuffs can prove challenging as it may be difficult to find suitable surfaces on the food item to expose to heat in order to cook the food in an even manner. Additionally, small pieces of food may tend pass through the spaces in the grate of the grill, attaching themselves to the heating element and burning up, thereby causing smoke to billow from the grill.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">After use of the grill it is likely that the grate will have accumulated some grease and charred food thereon from the cooking process. Typically the grill is too hot to clean immediately after use and a user may not remember to clean the grill prior to the next use. If the grates are not adequately cleaned after prolonged use of a grill there can be a grease and burned foods on the grate and this can lead to a fire risk or to the imparting of undesirable flavors to food that is subsequently cooked on the grill.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, various grill pans or grill baskets have been introduced to try and address some of the above-mentioned issues. These grill pans or baskets (which will be referred to hereafter as &#x201c;grill baskets&#x201d; or &#x201c;baskets&#x201d;) frequently include a statically-connected handle for the user to grip and thereby manipulate the grill basket. In some instances, the handles are integrally formed with the grill basket and are therefore in a fixed location and orientation relative to the basket. In other instances, the handles are engaged with the grill basket so as to be movable between a folded storage position and an expanded use position. In many instances, the handles are elongate and extend for a distance outwardly from the basket to ensure that a user's hand will be kept some distance away from the grill's heat source. The nature of the long handle means that the grill basket may only be able to be used in one orientation so as to best keep the user's hand a distance from the heat source. If integral with the grill basket, these elongate handles can make it difficult to clean the grill basket as the handle may prevent the grill basket from easily fitting into a dishwasher or sink.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates to a grill basket with a handle that is easily engaged with and disengaged from the basket in a number of different locations thereby enabling the basket to be used in different orientations.

This squeezing pressure will cause arms sections of the grasping portion, the stepped sections <b>14</b>B, and semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C to move toward one another. The semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C are then positioned between the tabs on one of the sides of the basket portion <b>12</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C have been positioned between the tabs <b>24</b> of first side <b>12</b>A. The semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C are aligned with the slots <b>24</b>A (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>) of tabs <b>24</b> and the squeezing pressure on the arms of grasping portion <b>14</b>A is released. The release of the pressure allows semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C to return to their original at-rest position and as the semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C to this, they slide through slots <b>24</b>A.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As indicated earlier herein a latching member in the form of an extension tip <b>14</b>D extends outwardly from each semi-circular region <b>14</b>C and forms a hooked region at the free end of the associated arm of the handle <b>14</b>. When semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C are received through the slots, such as slots <b>24</b>A of tabs <b>24</b> the configuration of the extension tip <b>14</b>D is such that the extension tip <b>14</b>D cannot move through the slot <b>24</b>A and, instead, abuts the inner surface of the tab <b>24</b>. The handle <b>14</b> is held in connective engagement with the engagement assembly by friction (of the extension tip <b>14</b>D contacting the tab) and by spring force from the arms of handle <b>14</b> returning to their original or at-rest position. The combination of friction and spring force tends to lock each semi-circular region <b>14</b>C of the handle <b>14</b> to the associated tab <b>24</b>, and thereby secures the handle <b>14</b> to the basket portion <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">When it is desired to remove handle <b>14</b> from basket portion <b>12</b>, the user will hold the grasping portion <b>14</b>A of handle <b>14</b> in their hand and will squeeze the arm sections of grasping portion <b>14</b>A towards one another. This squeezing motion causes the semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C to slide out of the slots <b>24</b>A of the tabs <b>24</b> and thereby out of locking engagement with tabs <b>24</b>. The handle <b>14</b> may then be lifted free from basket region <b>12</b>. If desired, and as will be described later herein, handle <b>14</b> may be engaged with a different engagement assembly provided on basket portion <b>12</b>, i.e., with a different set of tabs and their associated slots, such as tabs <b>32</b> and their associated slots <b>32</b>A.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">It will be understood that in alternative embodiments the third, fourth and fifth, and sixth apertures <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>34</b> may be shaped different from the &#x201c;D&#x201d; shape illustrated and described herein and that as a consequence, the associated tabs <b>24</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>36</b> will be complementary in shape to the differently configured apertures. Additionally, the shape of the opening defined in each of the tabs <b>24</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>36</b> (or the alternatively and differently configured tabs) may be other than the elongate slots illustrated in the attached figures. The differently configured tabs and associated openings may therefore be capable of engaging with a handle that has engagement regions thereon that are complementary in configuration to the differently-shaped openings and are thereby able to engage therewith. The engagement regions of handle <b>14</b>) will be configured so as to be capable of being selectively connected to any differently configured engagement assemblies provided on the basket portion <b>12</b> of grill basket <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, one or more dividers <b>16</b> are provided for selective engagement with grill basket <b>10</b> to subdivide interior <b>12</b>M into smaller compartments. Each divider <b>16</b> is a planar plate that is selectively engaged in aligned pairs of connector apertures <b>20</b> of basket portion <b>12</b>. Each divider <b>16</b> has a first end <b>16</b>A and a second end <b>16</b>B horizontally opposed to the first end <b>16</b>A. When engaged with basket portion <b>12</b>, divider <b>16</b> spans from first side <b>12</b>A to second side <b>12</b>B of basket portion <b>12</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>. Both the first end <b>16</b>A and the second end <b>16</b>B are configured to include a projection <b>16</b>C. The projection <b>16</b>C comprises a hook, particularly a triangular hook that extends outwardly from the respective first end <b>16</b>A and second end <b>16</b>B. The triangular hook is oriented such that an apex of the V-shaped, triangular hook extends outwardly and downwardly towards a bottom end of divider <b>16</b> and away from a top end of divider <b>16</b>. The projection <b>16</b>C, seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, is configured to be received through connector aperture <b>20</b> and to extend for a short distance below the connector aperture <b>20</b> so as to secure divider <b>16</b> to the associated first side <b>12</b>A or second side <b>12</b>B of the basket portion <b>12</b>. Divider <b>16</b> also has a first surface <b>16</b>D and a second surface <b>16</b>E opposed to the first surface <b>16</b>D. The first and second surfaces <b>16</b>D, <b>16</b>E extend from first end <b>16</b>A to second end <b>16</b>B. Divider <b>16</b> further includes projection <b>16</b>F that extends outwardly from one of the first surface <b>16</b>D and second surface <b>16</b>E and a complementary indentation <b>16</b>G formed in the other of the first surface <b>16</b>D and second surface <b>16</b>E. The indentation <b>16</b>G extends into the projection <b>16</b>F and is configured to receive fingertips of a user therein while their thumb engages the projection <b>16</b>F or vice versa. The indentation <b>16</b>G and projection <b>16</b>F, together, form a gripping region on the divider <b>16</b> which enables a user to grasp and manipulate the divider <b>16</b>. Divider <b>16</b> furthermore defines a plurality of apertures <b>16</b>H that extend between first surface <b>16</b>C and second surface <b>16</b>D. Apertures <b>16</b><i>h </i>may be similarly configured to through-holes <b>18</b> in first side <b>12</b>A, second side <b>12</b>B, third side <b>12</b>C, and fourth side <b>12</b>D.

In this particular instance the user has selected two dividers <b>16</b> and has engaged the dividers <b>16</b> into the angled outermost connector apertures <b>20</b> located proximate third side <b>12</b>C and <b>12</b>D. This arrangement effectively stores the dividers <b>16</b> within the grill basket <b>10</b> and allows for the maximum size compartment space of interior <b>12</b>M for cooking food. Items of food will be placed on the upper surface of bottom <b>12</b>E of basket portion <b>12</b> for cooking. (In an alternative configuration, one or both of the dividers may be completely removed from their engagement with first side <b>12</b>A and second side <b>12</b>B.) In either instance a single cooking compartment is provided by grill basket <b>10</b> with that single cooking compartment essentially being of the maximum length and width (or close to the maximum length and width) of bottom <b>12</b>E.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> also show the handle <b>14</b> in a first position, engaged with the first side <b>12</b>A via the tabs <b>24</b>. Handle <b>14</b> is engaged with tabs <b>24</b> by squeezing the arms of grasping section <b>14</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) thereof so that they move inwardly towards one another, reducing the space between the outermost region of the two semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C of handle <b>14</b>. The grasping portion <b>14</b>A is squeezed to the point that the two semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C of handle can fit between the opposing inner surfaces of the two tabs <b>24</b>. The semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C (which are of a thickness narrower than the slots <b>24</b>A of tabs <b>24</b>) are then aligned with slots <b>24</b>A and the user stops squeezing the grasping portion. The release of the pressure permits the semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C to slide through the slots <b>24</b>A and the outward movement through slots <b>24</b>A continues until the extension tips <b>14</b>D contact the opposed inner surface of the tabs <b>24</b>. The extension tip <b>14</b>D extends beyond the slot <b>24</b>A in order to frictionally hold the semi-circular region <b>14</b>C in engagement with the associated tab <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At that point the handle <b>14</b> is engaged and locked to the basket portion <b>12</b> to a sufficient degree that the grill basket <b>10</b> can be lifted, carried, and otherwise manipulated.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As indicated earlier herein, basket portion <b>12</b> is generally rectangular in shape. The manner in which basket portion <b>12</b> is illustrated shows the longer two sides of the basket portion <b>12</b> are first side <b>12</b>A and second side <b>12</b>B. The shorter two sides of the basket portion <b>12</b> are third side <b>12</b>C and fourth side <b>12</b>D. Grill basket <b>10</b> has a longitudinal axis that extends between third side <b>12</b>C and fourth side <b>12</b>D and is parallel to the upper edge of first side <b>12</b>A and second side <b>12</b>D. Grill basket <b>10</b> has a lateral axis that extends between first side <b>12</b>A and second side <b>12</b>D and is parallel to the upper edge of third side <b>12</b>C and fourth side <b>12</b>D. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows that dividers <b>16</b> are oriented generally parallel to the lateral axis and that handle <b>14</b> is oriented generally at right angles to the longitudinal axis (and thereby parallel to the lateral axis). Grill basket <b>10</b> with dividers <b>16</b> engaged at their furthest position away from one another is suitable for grilling larger pieces of food or for grilling a single type of food. For example, a whole steak may be placed on the bottom <b>12</b>E of the compartment <b>12</b>M for cooking or a quantity of vegetables may be placed on bottom <b>12</b>E for cooking.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a second configuration of the grill basket <b>10</b> is shown. In this configuration, the user has engaged only one divider with the basket portion <b>12</b> in a central location, i.e., in the aligned center connector apertures <b>20</b> located between the third apertures <b>22</b> and between the fourth apertures <b>26</b>. The center connector apertures <b>20</b> are located equidistant from third side <b>12</b>C and fourth side <b>12</b>D. This arrangement causes the divider <b>16</b> engaged with the center connector apertures <b>20</b> to divide the interior <b>12</b>M in half, i.e., into two equally sized compartments <b>12</b>N&#x2032; and <b>12</b>N&#x2033;. This arrangement allows for the bottom <b>12</b>E to provide equally-sized surfaces to cook two different foodstuffs next to one another or to cook two larger pieces of food separately from one another. For example, one compartment <b>12</b>N&#x2032; may hold a steak and the other compartment <b>12</b>N&#x2033; may hold vegetables. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, show handle <b>14</b> engaged with first side <b>12</b>A and therefore the grill basket <b>10</b> is able to be oriented with its longitudinal axis parallel to a front end of a barbeque grill as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, further alternative configurations of grill basket <b>10</b> are shown. These figures show two dividers <b>16</b> engaged with basket portion <b>12</b>. In this particular instance the dividers <b>16</b> are shown engaged in the connector apertures <b>20</b> which are located between one of the aligned tab pairs <b>24</b>, <b>28</b> and the angled outermost connector apertures <b>20</b> proximate third wall <b>12</b>E, and the other of the aligned tab pairs <b>24</b>, <b>28</b> and the other angled outermost connector apertures <b>20</b> proximate fourth wall <b>12</b>F. This arrangement causes the compartment <b>12</b>M to be divided into three equally-sized smaller compartments <b>12</b>P&#x2032;, <b>12</b>P&#x2033;, and <b>12</b>P&#x2032;&#x2033;. The three smaller compartments could each separately be used to hold one of a smaller piece of fish, a smaller piece of chicken, and a smaller piece of steak for cooking.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In other further alternative configurations, one of the dividers <b>16</b> could be located as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> (in the centrally-located connector apertures <b>20</b>) and one of the dividers could be located as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. This arrangement (which is not shown herein) would result in one larger compartment equivalent to compartment <b>12</b>N&#x2032;, one smaller compartment equivalent to compartment <b>12</b>P&#x2032;&#x2033;, and one even smaller compartment located between the compartments <b>12</b>N&#x2032; and <b>12</b>P&#x2032;&#x2033;. Each of these differently sized compartments could be utilized to cook a different foodstuff. It will be understood that the user can lift any divider <b>16</b> out of basket portion <b>12</b> using the indentation <b>12</b>F to better grip divider <b>16</b> and can then reposition and secure the divider <b>16</b> in another desired location within basket portion <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows handle <b>14</b> moved to a second position on basket portion <b>12</b>. In order to remove handle <b>14</b> from the first position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), the user will squeeze the grasping portion <b>14</b>A of handle <b>14</b> until the two semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C are free of slots <b>24</b>A. Handle <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is shown engaged with tabs <b>36</b> on fourth side <b>12</b>D of basket portion. Handle <b>14</b> is engaged with tabs <b>36</b> by squeezing the grasping portion <b>14</b>A of handle <b>14</b> until the two semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C are moved towards one another to a sufficient degree to fit between the two spaced-apart tabs <b>36</b> and the semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C are aligned with slots <b>36</b>A of tabs <b>36</b>. The user then stops squeezing grasping portion <b>14</b>A and semi-circular regions <b>14</b>C slide through slots <b>36</b>A and become locked to tabs <b>36</b> via spring force and extension tips <b>14</b>D.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows handle <b>14</b> moved to a third position on grill basket <b>10</b>, namely where handle is engaged with tabs <b>28</b> extending outwardly from second side <b>12</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows handle <b>14</b> moved to a fourth position on grill basket, namely where handle is engaged with tabs <b>32</b> on third wall <b>12</b>C. Moving handle <b>14</b> between the first position, the second position, the third, position, and the fourth position is quick and easy requiring only that squeezing finger pressure be used to withdraw the handle from its engagement with the tabs on any particular side <b>12</b>A through <b>12</b>D of basket portion <b>12</b>, that the squeezed handle be inserted between the two tabs on the selected other of the sides <b>12</b>A through <b>12</b>D, and then the squeeze pressure is released to permit the handle <b>14</b> to lock securely to basket portion <b>12</b>. Handle <b>14</b> may be moved freely to any of these positions prior to or during a cooking operation. For instance, referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, a user <b>38</b> is using a grill <b>40</b>. The grill basket <b>10</b> (without food being illustrated therein) is placed on the grate of the barbeque grill <b>40</b>. The user <b>38</b> has the handle <b>14</b> in the second position on basket portion. While cooking, the user <b>38</b> decides it could be advantageous to reorient the grill basket <b>10</b> on the grate of barbeque grill <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows the first side <b>12</b>A of the basket portion <b>12</b> oriented parallel to the front of the barbeque grill. The user may squeeze the grasping portion <b>14</b>A of handle <b>14</b> to disengage the handle <b>14</b> from first side <b>12</b>A. The basket portion <b>12</b> may then be rotated on the barbeque grill to present the fourth side <b>12</b>D of the basket portion <b>12</b> parallel to the front of the barbeque grill. The user is then able to reengage the handle <b>14</b> with tabs <b>32</b> of basket portion <b>12</b> as previously described and continue cooking the food in grill basket <b>10</b>. This moving of the handle <b>14</b> may be repeated or changed at any time before, during, or after the cooking process. The handle cover <b>14</b>E is operative to deflect or otherwise dissipate heat from handle <b>14</b>, allowing for the afore-mentioned handle position changes during cooking or while grill basket <b>10</b> may still be hot or warm. Additionally, dividers <b>16</b> can readily be withdrawn and repositioned within basket portion at any time but preferably prior to placing foodstuffs into the interior compartment(s) thereof.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b></figref> it should be noted that connecting the handle <b>14</b> of grill basket with a first engagement assembly (e.g. tabs <b>24</b> or <b>28</b>) orients the basket portion <b>12</b> in a first orientation such as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. Connection of the handle <b>14</b> with A second engagement assembly (e.g. tabs <b>32</b> or <b>36</b>) will orient the basket portion <b>12</b> in a second orientation such as is illustrated as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.
