Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is shown a battery <b>100</b> comprising a separator <b>103</b> sandwiched between an anode <b>101</b> and a cathode <b>105</b>, with current collectors <b>107</b>A and <b>107</b>B. There is also shown a load <b>109</b> coupled to the battery <b>100</b> illustrating instances when the battery <b>100</b> is in discharge mode. In this disclosure, the term &#x201c;battery&#x201d; may be used to indicate a single electrochemical cell, a plurality of electrochemical cells formed into a module, and/or a plurality of modules formed into a pack.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The development of portable electronic devices and electrification of transportation drive the need for high performance electrochemical energy storage. Small-scale (&#x3c;100 Wh) to large-scale (&#x3e;10 KWh) devices primarily use lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries over other rechargeable battery chemistries due to their high-performance.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The anode <b>101</b> and cathode <b>105</b>, along with the current collectors <b>107</b>A and <b>107</b>B, may comprise the electrodes, which may comprise plates or films within, or containing, an electrolyte material, where the plates may provide a physical barrier for containing the electrolyte as well as a conductive contact to external structures. In other embodiments, the anode/cathode plates are immersed in electrolyte while an outer casing provides electrolyte containment. The anode <b>101</b> and cathode are electrically coupled to the current collectors <b>107</b>A and <b>1078</b>, which comprise metal or other conductive material for providing electrical contact to the electrodes as well as physical support for the active material in forming electrodes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the battery <b>100</b> in discharge mode, whereas in a charging configuration, the load <b>107</b> may be replaced with a charger to reverse the process. In one class of batteries, the separator <b>103</b> is generally a film material, made of an electrically insulating polymer, for example, that prevents electrons from flowing from anode <b>101</b> to cathode <b>105</b>, or vice versa, while being porous enough to allow ions to pass through the separator <b>103</b>. Typically, the separator <b>103</b>, cathode <b>105</b>, and anode <b>101</b> materials are individually formed into sheets, films, or active material coated foils. Sheets of the cathode, separator and anode are subsequently stacked or rolled with the separator <b>103</b> separating the cathode <b>105</b> and anode <b>101</b> to form the battery <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the separator <b>103</b> is a sheet and generally utilizes winding methods and stacking in its manufacture. In these methods, the anodes, cathodes, and current collectors (e.g., electrodes) may comprise films.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an example scenario, the battery <b>100</b> may comprise a solid, liquid, or gel electrolyte. The separator <b>103</b> preferably does not dissolve in typical battery electrolytes such as compositions that may comprise: Ethylene Carbonate (EC), Fluoroethylene Carbonate (FEC), Propylene Carbonate (PC), Dimethyl Carbonate (DMC), Ethyl Methyl Carbonate (EMC), Diethyl Carbonate (DEC), etc. with dissolved LiBF<sub>4</sub>, LiAsF<sub>6</sub>, Li PF<sub>6</sub>, and LiClO<sub>4 </sub>etc. The separator <b>103</b> may be wet or soaked with a liquid or gel electrolyte. In addition, in an example embodiment, the separator <b>103</b> does not melt below about <b>100</b> to 120&#xb0; C., and exhibits sufficient mechanical properties for battery applications. A battery, in operation, can experience expansion and contraction of the anode and/or the cathode. In an example embodiment, the separator <b>103</b> can expand and contract by at least about 5 to 10% without failing, and may also be flexible.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The separator <b>103</b> may be sufficiently porous so that ions can pass through the separator once wet with, for example, a liquid or gel electrolyte. Alternatively (or additionally), the separator may absorb the electrolyte through a gelling or other process even without significant porosity. The porosity of the separator <b>103</b> is also generally not too porous to allow the anode <b>101</b> and cathode <b>105</b> to transfer electrons through the separator <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The anode <b>101</b> and cathode <b>105</b> comprise electrodes for the battery <b>100</b>, providing electrical connections to the device for transfer of electrical charge in charge and discharge states. The anode <b>101</b> may comprise silicon, carbon, or combinations of these materials, for example. Typical anode electrodes comprise a carbon material that includes a current collector such as a copper sheet. Carbon is often used because it has excellent electrochemical properties and is also electrically conductive. Anode electrodes currently used in rechargeable lithium-ion cells typically have a specific capacity of approximately 200 milliamp hours per gram. Graphite, the active material used in most lithium ion battery anodes, has a theoretical energy density of 372 milliamp hours per gram (mAh/g). In comparison, silicon has a high theoretical capacity of 4200 mAh/g. In order to increase volumetric and gravimetric energy density of lithium-ion batteries, silicon may be used as the active material for the cathode or anode. Silicon anodes may be formed from silicon composites, with more than 50% silicon, for example.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example scenario, the anode <b>101</b> and cathode <b>105</b> store the ion used for separation of charge, such as lithium. In this example, the electrolyte carries positively charged lithium ions from the anode <b>101</b> to the cathode <b>105</b> in discharge mode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for example, and vice versa through the separator <b>105</b> in charge mode. The movement of the lithium ions creates free electrons in the anode <b>101</b> which creates a charge at the positive current collector <b>1078</b>. The electrical current then flows from the current collector through the load <b>109</b> to the negative current collector <b>107</b>A. The separator <b>103</b> blocks the flow of electrons inside the battery <b>100</b>, allows the flow of lithium ions, and prevents direct contact between the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">While the battery <b>100</b> is discharging and providing an electric current, the anode <b>101</b> releases lithium ions to the cathode <b>105</b> via the separator <b>103</b>, generating a flow of electrons from one side to the other via the coupled load <b>109</b>. When the battery is being charged, the opposite happens where lithium ions are released by the cathode <b>105</b> and received by the anode <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The materials selected for the anode <b>101</b> and cathode <b>105</b> are important for the reliability and energy density possible for the battery <b>100</b>. The energy, power, cost, and safety of current Li-ion batteries need to be improved in order to, for example, compete with internal combustion engine (ICE) technology and allow for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). High energy density, high power density, and improved safety of lithium-ion batteries are achieved with the development of high-capacity and high-voltage cathodes, high-capacity anodes and functionally non-flammable electrolytes with high voltage stability and interfacial compatibility with electrodes. In addition, materials with low toxicity are beneficial as battery materials to reduce process cost and promote consumer safety.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The performance of electrochemical electrodes, while dependent on many factors, is largely dependent on the robustness of electrical contact between electrode particles, as well as between the current collector and the electrode particles. The electrical conductivity of silicon anode electrodes may be manipulated by incorporating conductive additives with different morphological properties. Carbon black (SuperP), vapor grown carbon fibers (VGCF), and a mixture of the two have previously been incorporated separately into the anode electrode resulting in improved performance of the anode. The synergistic interactions between the two carbon materials may facilitate electrical contact throughout the large volume changes of the silicon anode during charge and discharge.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">State-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries typically employ a graphite-dominant anode as an intercalation material for lithium. Silicon-dominant anodes, however, offer improvements compared to graphite-dominant Li-ion batteries. Silicon exhibits both higher gravimetric (3579 mAh/g vs. 372 mAh/g for graphite) and volumetric capacities (2194 mAh/L vs. 890 mAh/L for graphite). In addition, silicon-based anodes have a lithiation/delithiation voltage plateau at about 0.3-0.4V vs. Li/Li+, which allows it to maintain an open circuit potential that avoids undesirable Li plating and dendrite formation. While silicon shows excellent electrochemical activity, achieving a stable cycle life for silicon-based anodes is challenging due to silicon's large volume changes during lithiation and delithiation. Silicon regions may lose electrical contact from the anode as large volume changes coupled with its low electrical conductivity separate the silicon from surrounding materials in the anode.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, the large silicon volume changes exacerbate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, which can further lead to electrical isolation and, thus, capacity loss. Expansion and shrinkage of silicon particles upon charge-discharge cycling causes pulverization of silicon particles, which increases their specific surface area. As the silicon surface area changes and increases during cycling, SEI repeatedly breaks apart and reforms. The SEI thus continually builds up around the pulverizing silicon regions during cycling into a thick electronic and ionic insulating layer. This accumulating SEI increases the impedance of the electrode and reduces the electrode electrochemical reactivity, which is detrimental to cycle life.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A solution to the expansion of anodes is to configure the expansion that occurs with lithiation by configuring the size of the silicon particles in the anode active material. Silicon particles with a particle size distribution in a certain range (e.g. 5 &#x3bc;m to 25 &#x3bc;m) form films exhibiting less expansion than films made from silicon particles in a different range (e.g. 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m). Anodes with less dense, or more porous, active materials show reduced expansion, and lower density and more porosity may result when using larger silicon particles. Furthermore, electrodes with rough surfaces have reduced expansion as compared to electrodes with smooth surfaces, and use of larger silicon particles may result in a rougher surface. The size of the particles may be configured by the source material and/or the mixing process when preparing the slurry for anode formation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates anode expansion during lithiation, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is shown a current collector <b>201</b>, adhesive <b>203</b>, and an active material <b>205</b>. It should be noted that the adhesive <b>203</b> may or may not be present depending on the type of anode fabrication process utilized, as the adhesive is not necessarily present in a direct coating process. Furthermore, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a single-sided anode for simplicity, the active material <b>205</b> may be present on both sides of the current collector <b>201</b>. In an example scenario, the active materials comprises silicon particles in a binder material and a solvent, the active material being pyrolyzed to turn the binder into a glassy carbon that provides a structural framework around the silicon particles and also provides electrical conductivity. The active material may be coupled to the current collector <b>201</b> using the adhesive <b>203</b>. The current collector <b>201</b> may comprise a metal film, such as copper, nickel, or titanium, for example, although other conductive foils may be utilized depending on desired tensile strength.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also illustrates lithium ions impinging upon and lithiating the active material <b>205</b>. The lithiation of silicon-dominant anodes causes expansion of the material, where horizontal expansion is represented by the x and y axes, and thickness expansion is represented by the z-axis, as shown. The current collector <b>201</b> has a thickness t, where a thicker foil provides greater strength and providing the adhesive <b>203</b> is strong enough, restricts expansion in the x- and y-directions, resulting in greater z-direction expansion, thus anisotropic expansion. Example thicker foils may be greater than 10 &#x3bc;m thick, such as 20 &#x3bc;m for copper, for example, while thinner foils may be less than 10 &#x3bc;m, such as 5-6 &#x3bc;m thick or less for copper.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another example scenario, when the current collector <b>201</b> is thinner, on the order of 5-6 &#x3bc;m or less for a copper foil, for example, the active material <b>205</b> may expand more easily in the x- and y-directions, although still even more easily in the z-direction without other restrictions in that direction. In this case, the expansion is anisotropic, but not as much as compared to the case of higher x-y confinement.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition, different materials with different tensile strength may be utilized to configure the amount of expansion allowed in the x- and y-directions. For example, nickel is a more rigid, mechanically strong metal for the current collector <b>201</b>, and as a result, nickel current collectors confine x-y expansion when a strong enough adhesive is used. In this case, the expansion in the x- and y-directions may be more limited, even when compared to a thicker copper foil, and result in more z-direction expansion, i.e., more anisotropic. In anodes formed with 5 &#x3bc;m nickel foil current collectors, very low expansion and no cracking results. Furthermore, different alloys of metals may be utilized to obtain desired thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and tensile strength, for example.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an example scenario, in instances where adhesive is utilized, the adhesive <b>203</b> comprises a polymer such as polyimide (PI) or polyamide-imide (PAI) that provides adhesive strength of the active material film <b>205</b> to the current collector <b>201</b> while still providing electrical contact to the current collector <b>201</b>. Other adhesives may be utilized depending on the desired chemistry, as long as they do not degrade, react, or dissolve in the electrolyte used. If the adhesive <b>203</b> provides a stronger, more rigid bond, the expansion in the x- and y-directions may be more restricted, assuming the current collector is also strong. Conversely, a more flexible and/or thicker adhesive may allow more x-y expansion, reducing the anisotropic nature of the anode expansion.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As stated above, particle size is a variable that affects expansion, where the particle size can influence the density of the material and/or surface roughness. Use of larger particles results in more roughness in the anodes, which leads to less expansion in lateral directions, and also results in less dense layers, which also expand less.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows top and side views of a pouch cell, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there is shown pouch cell <b>301</b> with foil tabs <b>303</b> for providing contact to the anode and cathode within the cell <b>301</b>. Rather than using a metallic cylinder and glass-to-metal electrical feed-through for insulation, conductive foil tabs welded to the electrodes and sealed to the pouch carry the positive and negative terminals to the outside. The pouch cell offers a simple, flexible and lightweight solution to battery design, and allows some expansion in the z-direction due to the ability to expand slightly, but is less forgiving with x-y expansion. For at least this reason, it is desirable to limit expansion overall, but for any expansion that does occur, it is desirable to configure expansion in the z-direction primarily and restrict it in the x-y directions.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a process for reduced expansion in a silicon anode, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure. While one process to fabricate composite electrodes comprises a high-temperature pyrolysis of an active material on a substrate coupled with a lamination process, this process comprises physically mixing the active material, conductive additive, and binder together, and coating it directly on a current collector. This example process comprises a direct coating process in which an anode slurry is directly coated on a copper foil using a binder such as CMC, SBR, Sodium Alginate, PAI, PI and mixtures and combinations thereof. The process described here is for reduced anode expansion overall, but expansion primarily in the z-direction while x-y expansion is decreased.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step <b>401</b>, the raw electrode active material may be mixed using a binder/resin (such as PI, PAI), solvent, and conductive carbon. For example, graphene/VGCF (1:1 by weight) may be dispersed in NMP under sonication for, e.g., 1 hour followed by the addition of Super P (1:1:1 with VGCF and graphene) and additional sonication for, e.g., 45-75 minutes. Silicon powder with a desired particle size, may then be dispersed in polyamic acid resin (15% solids in N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP)) at, e.g., 900-1100 rpm in a ball miller for a designated time, and then the conjugated carbon/NMP slurry may be added and dispersed at, e.g., 1800-2200 rpm for, e.g., another predefined time to achieve a slurry viscosity within 2000-4000 cP and a total solid content of about 30% to 60%. The solids content of the anode slurry is largely dependent on particle size of active material and binder/resin molecular weight and viscosity. The particle size and mixing times may be varied to configure the active material density and/or roughness. For example, larger particle sizes, with a particle size distribution range from 5 &#x3bc;m to 25 &#x3bc;m, as compared to a silicon particle size distribution in a 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m range, result in less dense and rough active layers. Silicon with higher particle size produces thicker coatings with lower density, which reduces expansion in all directions. Similarly, longer mixing times in a ball miller result in smaller particles sizes, and thus smoother, more dense active layers, but increased expansion.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step <b>403</b>, the slurry may be coated on the foil at a loading of, e.g., 3-4 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, which may undergo drying in step <b>405</b> resulting in less than 15% residual solvent content. In step <b>407</b>, an optional calendering process may be utilized where a series of hard pressure rollers may be used to finish the film/substrate into a smoother and denser sheet of material. Calendering may cause increased z-direction expansion, while x-y expansion is not affected, but even by incorporating a calendaring process, the expansion is generally not more than would be if there had been no calendering.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step <b>409</b>, the active material may be pyrolyzed by heating to 500-800&#xb0; C. such that carbon precursors are partially or completely converted into glassy carbon. The pyrolysis step may result in an anode active material having silicon content greater than or equal to 50% by weight, where the anode has been subjected to heating at or above <b>400</b> degrees Celsius. Pyrolysis may be done either in roll form or after punching in step <b>411</b>. If done in roll form, the punching is done after the pyrolysis process. The punched electrode may then be sandwiched with a separator and cathode with electrolyte to form a cell. In step <b>413</b>, the cell may be subjected to a formation process, comprising initial charge and discharge steps to lithiate the anode, with some residual lithium remaining.

An optional calendering process may be utilized where a series of hard pressure rollers may be used to finish the film/substrate into a smoothed and denser sheet of material. Calendering may cause increased z-direction expansion, while not affecting the degree of x-y expansion, but even by incorporating a calendaring process, the total thickness is not more than would be if there had been no calendering.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In step <b>507</b>, the green film may then be removed from the PET, where the active material may be peeled off the polymer substrate, the peeling process being optional for a polypropylene (PP) substrate, since PP can leave &#x2212;2% char residue upon pyrolysis. The peeling may be followed by a cure and pyrolysis step <b>509</b> where the film may be cut into sheets, and vacuum dried using a two-stage process (100-140&#xb0; C. for 15 h, 200-240&#xb0; C. for 5 h). The dry film may be thermally treated at 1000-1300&#xb0; C. to convert the polymer matrix into carbon.

The silicon-carbon composite film may be laminated to the coated copper using a heated hydraulic press (30-70 seconds, 250-350&#xb0; C., and 3000-5000 psi), thereby forming the finished silicon-composite electrode.

The larger silicon particle size results in a rougher surface, higher porosity and less dense material, which reduces the expansion of the active material during lithiation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the change in particle size distribution with milling time, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, there is shown silicon particle size distributions for slurries mixed for various milling durations. In a ball milling process, the active material is milled in solvent in 0.5 inch cylindrical Zirconia grinding media for durations ranging from 1 to 12 hours, and then mixed with a binder/resin via high shear dispersion. The particle size distribution of the milled active materials in solvent is measured after the completion of ball milling. The values at each particle size indicate the percentage of material that comprises particles of that size. As can be seen by the curves in the plot, longer milling time shifts the curves left to smaller particle size distributions.
