Considering the long distances often traveled and the need for riders to carry food, gear, tools and personal effects, cycling jerseys are commonly equipped with back pockets in a lower portion of the jerseys. The back pockets are located above the hips of the wearer, in the waist region, and generally opposite the kidney area.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such pockets are quite convenient for riders who do not want to carry saddle bags on their bicycles in order not to increase the drag coefficient of the bicycle, or who want to have access to food, gear, etc within arm's reach.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to the longer duration of the cycling activity, the rider may be exposed to changing environmental conditions, such as rain and temperature variations. Moreover, cycling may often include hill climbing and the subsequent descending. The rider must often produce a strong effort to climb, resulting in sweat and moist clothing, and the subsequent downhill velocities cause a chilling factor on the rider. For these reasons, cyclists commonly carry additional outer shells in their rear pockets. For instance, vests, also known as gilets, are commonly used as a windbreaker to protect the torso of the rider in downhill riding. Rain jackets may be used in case of rain.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A disadvantage of such outer shells is that the rear pockets of the jersey are not readily accessible when an outer shell is worn. The rider may have to stop to access the pockets or must be particularly agile so as to raise the bottom edge of the outer shell to reach an interior of the pocket. In racing or competitive cycling, such maneuvers are hazardous and may even cause falls.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, in racing events, a bib with an identifying number is typically worn on the back pockets. The use of an outer shell prevents commissioners from seeing the rider's identification. A rider does not want to have to move the bib from the back pockets of the jersey to the outer shell.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an aim of the present disclosure to provide an outer shell such as a vest or jacket that addresses issues related to the prior art.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another aim of the present disclosure to provide an outer shell such as a vest or jacket that allows for an identification bib to be seen on the back of the rider.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, in accordance with the present application, there is provided a cycling outer shell worn over a cycling jersey by a wearer comprising: at least a torso portion made of panels of at least one material, the torso portion having a back surface adapted to cover a back of the wearer when worn, and a front surface to cover a chest of the wearer when worn; a cutout defined in a lower portion of the back surface of the torso portion and located in alignment with pockets of the cycling jersey, the cutout having a peripheral edge with opposite lateral edge portions, a bottom edge portion and a top edge portion, the bottom edge portion delimited by a strip extending between the opposite lateral edge portions, with a width dimension between the lateral edge portions of the cutout generally corresponding to a width of the pockets of the cycling jersey, and with a height dimension between the bottom edge portion and the top edge portion of the cutout generally corresponding to a height of the pockets of the cycling jersey; and at least a lateral pocket on a side of the torso portion.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of a rider wearing an outer shell in accordance with the present disclosure, above a cycling jersey having back pockets;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a rear view of the outer shell of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in a long-sleeve configuration;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a rear view of an outer shell in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a rear view of an outer shell in accordance with yet another embodiment, having a see-through panel; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic cross-section view of the outer shells of the present disclosure, showing a location of pockets and cutout or see-through panel.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is illustrated an outer shell <b>10</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The outer shell <b>10</b> is illustrated as being a vest worn over a jersey A. However, the outer shell <b>10</b> could be a jacket as well, such as a windbreaker jacket, a rain jacket, a gilet, a cover jersey, etc, namely garment worn over the jersey A. For illustrative purposes, the jersey A is illustrated as having rear pockets B. The jersey A is a conventional jersey and, therefore, typically has three pockets B, although more or fewer pockets could be provided as well. The jersey A has short sleeves C, but could also be a long-sleeve jersey or midlength-sleeve jersey, or even a sleeveless top. An identification bib D is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and the identification bib D is commonly used in race cycling for race commissioners to identify the rider.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The outer shell <b>10</b> has a torso portion <b>12</b>. The torso portion <b>12</b> is made of one or multiple panels and is typically but optionally provided with a zip fastener <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), such as centered in a front of the torso portion <b>12</b>, or offset from the center. The torso portion <b>12</b> covers the torso of the user and has a back surface <b>14</b> and a front surface <b>16</b>, with the zip fastener <b>13</b> typically provided on the front surface <b>16</b>. Unless specified, the material used for the outer shell <b>10</b> may be any appropriate paneling material. For instance, the front surface <b>16</b> is typically made of a windbreaker material, a waterproof material, and/or a multiple-ply insulation material. Synthetic fibers (e.g., polyester, nylon, Lycra&#xae;, ePTFE) and/or natural fibers (e.g., wool) may be used to make up the fabric(s) of the paneling material of the shell <b>10</b>. The back surface <b>14</b> may involve the same material as for the front surface <b>16</b>, or a different material may be used. Meshing material is also commonly used for the back surface <b>14</b>, as windbreaking properties are not required on the rider's back. In other words, any appropriate material may be used for the outer shell <b>10</b>, and material is typically chosen as a function of the contemplated use and the riding conditions. The material may be a blend of materials as well, with for example Lycra&#xae; or Spandex&#xae; or like stretchable fabrics.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the outer shell <b>10</b> is sleeveless, but may also feature sleeves, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, with the sleeves illustrated at <b>18</b>. An elastic band <b>19</b> may be at a bottom of the torso portion <b>12</b>, in any one of the embodiments described herein. The elastic band <b>19</b> may be optional, in that the outer shell <b>10</b> may rely on the outer shell's elasticity to conform to the shape of the rider.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring concurrently to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the outer shell <b>10</b> is provided with a cutout <b>20</b> in the lower back region of the back surface <b>14</b>. The cutout <b>20</b> is aligned with the pockets B of the jersey A, and may be generally obround, rink-shaped (i.e., with at least some rounded corners), rectangular, etc. The cutout <b>20</b> is defined by a peripheral edge <b>22</b> with a width W and a height H. The height H (i.e., distance between the top edge portion and the bottom edge portion of the peripheral edge <b>22</b>) is typically chosen as a function of the height of the pockets B, while the width (i.e., distance between the lateral edge portions of the peripheral edge <b>22</b>) is selected as a function of the width of all pockets B. For example, the height H may be between 4.0 in to 8.0 in, though it may be outside of this range. The width W may be between 9 in to 16 in, though it may be outside of this range. In a variant, the top portion of the peripheral edge <b>22</b> may slightly cover a top edge of the pockets B. Alternatively, the top portion of the peripheral edge <b>22</b> may be slightly above a top edge of the pockets B. Similarly, a bottom edge of the peripheral edge <b>22</b> may be slightly below a bottom of the pockets B or slightly above same. According to an embodiment, height H of the cutout <b>20</b> has a value generally equal to or greater than a height of the jersey pockets B. According to the same or another embodiment, width W of the cutout <b>20</b> has a value generally equal to (i.e., slightly smaller or greater) a width of the jersey pockets B. By generally equal, it is meant that the cutout <b>20</b> is within a few inches of the dimension of the pockets B, i.e., the dimensions are similar or correspond.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a bottom strip <b>24</b> bounds a bottom of the cutout <b>20</b>, and forms part of the peripheral edge <b>22</b>. The bottom strip <b>24</b> may be an elastic. The elastic may be sized so as to slightly elastically deform when the outer shell <b>10</b> is worn. Therefore, a bottom portion of the outer shell <b>10</b> contours the upper buttocks/lower back portion of the rider. Moreover, an elastic used as the bottom strip <b>24</b> may wrap around the bosses formed by the contents in the pockets B. This enhances the tight fitting of the outer shell <b>10</b> at the bottom of the torso of the wearer. The bottom strip <b>24</b> may have an inner surface with a gripping material such as a rubber or like sticky material to ensure that the bottom edge of the outer shell <b>10</b> remains in position below the pockets B. The gripping material may be an additional strip of material adhered or sown to the strip <b>24</b>, or may be seams of rubbery filament, among other possibilities. If the bottom strip <b>24</b> is an elastic, the combination of the elastic bottom strip <b>24</b> and of the elastic band <b>19</b> may constitute an elastic that fully surrounds the waist of the wearer (with a potential disruption at a zipper closure, if present).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, an interior of the pockets B is accessible despite the outer shell <b>10</b> being worn. As outer shells <b>10</b> are typically worn tight or in close fitting relation with the torso, there is no loose material that prevents access to the pockets B. Also, the identifying bib D is visible despite the outer shell <b>10</b> being worn.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, an important safety feature is present in the outer shell <b>10</b>, in the lateral pockets <b>30</b>. The outer shell <b>10</b> may have a right lateral pocket and a left lateral pocket, both shown as <b>30</b>. There may be a single right lateral pocket <b>30</b> or a single left lateral pocket <b>30</b> as well. The lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b> has(have) a top open end.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The lateral pockets <b>30</b> may be made of the same material as the material of the torso portion <b>12</b>. A strip <b>32</b> may be provided at a top open end of the lateral pockets <b>30</b>. The strip <b>32</b> may be an elastic, in an at rest state when the lateral pocket <b>30</b> is empty. The strip <b>32</b> may be reflective. The vertical edges and the bottom edge of the lateral pocket <b>30</b> may be stitched, sewn, laminated, fused to the panel of the torso portion <b>12</b>. The bottom edge of the lateral pockets <b>30</b> may be on the bottom edge of the torso portion <b>12</b>, or above. In a variant, a slit is defined in the torso portion <b>12</b>, and a pocket panel is on an interior of the torso portion <b>12</b>, instead of being on an outer surface thereof as shown.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b> may primarily be used to store objects that may be accessed during the cycling activity, so as to have the rider access the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b> instead of the pockets B of the jersey. For example, the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b> may be used to store packaged snacks, like bars, energy gels, gummies. It may also be used to store eyewear. In a non-competing setting, it may be used to store a smart phone, a wallet, a credit card, key(s). Accordingly, in an embodiment, a width of the lateral pocket <b>30</b> is smaller than a height of the lateral pocket <b>30</b>, due to the small size of the objects that may be stored in the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b>. For example, a width of the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b> is between 2.0 in and 4.0 in, inclusively. The height of the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b> may be between 4.0 in to 8.0 in, inclusively, though it may be outside of this range. Moreover, in a variant, the outer shell <b>10</b> may have one or both of the lateral pockets <b>30</b>, but no cutout <b>20</b>, and no back pockets. As the jersey conventionally has the back pockets B, another layer of pockets on the vest <b>10</b> could be redundant, and could create an excess of volume at the back of the rider if the back pockets B and another set of back pockets on the outer shell <b>10</b> were filled.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a schematic cross-section view of the outer shell <b>10</b> is shown, with a generally ovoid shape as would be worn by a user. The cross-section, from a cranial point of view (i.e., from a top), is only provided as a reference and depends on the stomach region anatomy of a wearer, and may differ from the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Stated differently, the human torse may not have a substantially ovoid shape. However, reference may be made to the medio-lateral axis ML (a.k.a., lateral axis, lateral-lateral axis, from side to side) that lies in a front plane of the wearer, and to the anterior-posterior axis AP that lies in a sagittal plane of the wearer (i.e., from front to back). The expressions medio-lateral and anterior-posterior are commonly used to describe the human anatomy, and are employed in a similar manner herein. The outer shell <b>10</b> may be said to have such a frontal plane with axis ML, and sagittal plane with axis AP. Angular values are provided to illustrate the portion of the outer periphery covered by the cutout <b>20</b> and lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b>, with the angular values being in a transverse plane. The angular values are for an unstretched condition of the outer shell <b>10</b>. Angle &#x3b1;, for the cutout <b>20</b> (if present), may be between 140 and 170 degrees, inclusively. An angle &#x3b2;, for the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b>, may be between 35 and 55 degrees, inclusively. Angle may be the addition of angles &#x3b2;1 and &#x3b2;2, which may be separated by the virtual frontal plane shown by axis ML. In an embodiment, to facilitate an access to the interior of the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b>, angle &#x3b2;2&#x3e;angle &#x3b2;1. In an embodiment, angle &#x3b2;2 is at least 20 degrees. Thus, in a variant, the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b> is (are) intersected by the frontal plane of the outer shell <b>10</b>, though the lateral pockets <b>30</b> may be entirely located in the anteriorly of the frontal plane of the outer shell <b>10</b>. In another embodiment, the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b> may be immediately forward of the sides of the cutout <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, instead of the bottom strip <b>24</b>, the outer shell <b>10</b> may alternatively have an elongated pocket <b>40</b>, as opposed to an elastic. The elongated pocket <b>40</b> may for instance be made of a mesh, or may be pierced, so as not to hold water. It may further include a seam <b>40</b>&#x2032; or like separation, alternatively, to separate the elongated pocket <b>40</b> into a first pocket and a second pocket, or a first compartment and a second compartment. The elongated pocket <b>40</b> may be well suited to receive elongated objects that may not entirely fit in other pockets, such as the lateral pocket(s) <b>32</b> and/or the back pockets B.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A border <b>42</b> may be sewn or adhered to the top edge of the elongated pocket <b>40</b>, with the border <b>42</b> being, for instance, an elastic material. The border <b>42</b> may further include or integrate a reflective material or coating. Another border may also be sewn or attached to a bottom edge of the elongated pocket <b>40</b>. The elongated pocket <b>40</b> may have the same angular value a as the cutout <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. A height of the elongated pocket <b>40</b> may be between 2.0 in and 3.5 in, inclusively. In an embodiment, the elongated pocket <b>40</b> may be used to store additional clothing, that may be rolled or folded into an elongated shape, such as a rain jacket, arm warmers, gloves, a handpump. The elongated pocket <b>40</b> may be for objects that must not be accessed as often.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, another embodiment is shown, of a shell of the type being a rain jacket, such as made in a breathable waterproof material (e.g., Gore-tex&#xae;). The back surface <b>14</b> of the torso portion <b>12</b> features a see-through panel <b>50</b> to cover the back pockets B of the jersey A. The see-through panel <b>50</b> is made of a transparent impermeable material, and may be solely present in the lower region of the torso portion <b>12</b>, namely opposite the back pockets B. The see-through panel <b>50</b> may define a see-through window that allows an identifying bib D to be visible therethrough. As the panel <b>50</b> is adjacent to the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b>, it is possible for the see-through panel <b>50</b> not to have any access slits, as the objects that need to be readily available to a rider are in the lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b>. The lateral pocket(s) <b>30</b> are an important safety feature, considering that the pockets of the jersey A are concealed under the rain shell of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.
