Salad rocket is a quick growing crop grown for its leaves. Due to its pleasant taste it is often used as an ingredient in salads and other dishes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many production areas the production of salad rocket is being hindered by the infection of the plants by downy mildew (<i>Hyaloperonospora parasitica</i>, previously called <i>Peronospora parasitica</i>). Downy mildew is a polycyclic disease caused by different species of the oomycete <i>Hyaloperonospora</i>. The obligate parasite from the genus <i>Hyaloperonospora </i>is living on <i>Brassica </i>plants and related cruciferous crops. The losses are more severe at the seedling stage than on mature healthy plants. Young seedlings can die as a result of the infection. Cool and moist conditions are favorable for the disease development. The disease causes quantitative and qualitative losses of the crops. Although all (aerial) parts of the plant can be infected, the symptoms primarily appear on the leaves. Symptoms of the disease such as discolored lesions and necrotic spots with brown edges can destroy the quality of the leaves. Also the quantity of the harvest is reduced due to the downy mildew infection.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Citation or identification of any document in this application is not an admission that such document is available as prior art to the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There exists a need, therefore, for a salad rocket variety which exhibits a combination of traits including downy mildew resistance, dark green colored leaves, short to medium leaf length and narrow to medium leaf width, medium to strong leaf division and medium secondary leaf lobing, and medium late to late flowering.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention addresses this need by providing a new type of salad rocket (<i>Eruca sativa</i>) variety, designated 88-208 RZ.

In the next season, the most desirable F<sub>3 </sub>lines are first identified, and then desirable F<sub>3 </sub>plants within each line are selected. The following season and in all subsequent generations of inbreeding, the most desirable families are identified first, then desirable lines within the selected families are chosen, and finally desirable plants within selected lines are harvested individually. A family refers to lines that were derived from plants selected from the same progeny from the preceding generation. Using this pedigree method, two parents may be crossed using an emasculated female and a pollen donor (male) to produce F<sub>1 </sub>offspring.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Parental varieties are selected from commercial varieties that individually exhibit one or more desired phenotypes.

This isolate may be obtained upon request from the applicant, Rijk Zwaan. Resistance is tested by inoculating a relevant number of plants, such as 30, with spores of <i>Hyaloperonospora parasitica </i>strain P90615 after having grown the plants for about 2 weeks at a temperature regime of 14/12&#xb0; C. day/night, and observing symptoms of downy mildew infection, including the formation of discoloured lesions, necrotic spots with brown edges and sporulation, 10 and 17 days later. Resistant plants show no symptoms of downy mildew infection. Salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ exhibits a resistance to <i>Hyaloperonospora parasitica</i>, in particular a resistance to <i>Hyaloperonospora parasitica </i>strain Pp0615.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">As used herein, time of lowering is defined as the time when 50% of plants have at least one open flower. The time of flowering is defined in concordance with the definition in the UPOV TG/245/1 Form. Time of flowering is determined by comparison to standard varieties Highway and Runway. Highway is a medium (5) time of flowering variety and Runway is a late (7) time of flowering variety. Salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ has a timing of time of flowering (6-7) that is later than that of medium flowering time of variety Highway up to the late time of flowering of variety Runway, and is therefore considered a medium late to late time of flowering variety.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">As used herein, leaf division is defined in concordance with the definition in the UPOV TG/245/1 Form.

Five different levels of leaf division are recognized, absent or very weak, weak, medium, strong, very strong. The leaves of variety 88-208 RZ show a medium secondary lobing (5).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">As used herein, the color and the intensity of the color of the leaves is defined in concordance with the definition in the UPOV TG/245/1 Form.

The leaf width of variety 88-208 RZ is more narrow than comparison variety Myway, the leaf width of variety 88-208 RZ is narrow to medium (4).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">In an embodiment, the invention relates to a salad rocket plant that has all the morphological and physiological characteristics of the invention and has acquired said characteristics by introduction of the genetic information that is responsible for the characteristics from a suitable source, either by conventional breeding, or genetic modification, in particular by cisgenesis or transgenesis. Cisgenesis is genetic modification of plants with a natural gene, coding for an (agricultural) trait, from the crop plant itself or from a sexually compatible donor plant. Transgenesis is genetic modification of a plant with a gene from a non-crossable species or a synthetic gene.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">Just as useful traits that may be introduced by backcrossing, useful traits may be introduced directly into the plant of the invention, being a plant of salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ, by genetic transformation techniques; and, such plants of salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ that have additional genetic information introduced into the genome or that express additional traits by having the DNA coding there for introduced into the genome via transformation techniques, are within the ambit of the invention, as well as uses of such plants, and the making of such plants.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">Genetic transformation may therefore be used to insert a selected transgene into the plant of the invention, being a plant of salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ or may, alternatively, be used for the preparation of transgenes which may be introduced by backcrossing. Methods for the transformation of plants, including salad rocket, are well known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">Vectors used for the transformation of salad rocket cells are not limited so long as the vector may express an inserted DNA in the cells. For example, vectors which may comprise promoters for constitutive gene expression in salad rocket cells (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter) and promoters inducible by exogenous stimuli may be used. Examples of suitable vectors include pBI binary vector. The &#x201c;salad rocket cell&#x201d; into which the vector is to be introduced includes various forms of salad rocket cells, such as cultured cell suspensions, protoplasts, leaf sections, and callus. A vector may be introduced into salad rocket cells by known methods, such as the polyethylene glycol method, polycation method, electroporation, <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transfer, particle bombardment and direct DNA uptake by protoplasts. To effect transformation by electroporation, one may employ either friable tissues, such as a suspension culture of cells or embryogenic callus or alternatively one may transform immature embryos or other organized tissue directly. In this technique, one would partially degrade the cell walls of the chosen cells by exposing them to pectin-degrading enzymes (pectolyases) or mechanically wound tissues in a controlled manner.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">A particularly efficient method for delivering transforming DNA segments to plant cells is microprojectile bombardment. In this method, particles are coated with nucleic acids and delivered into cells by a propelling force. Exemplary particles include those which may be comprised of tungsten, platinum, and preferably, gold. For the bombardment, cells in suspension are concentrated on filters or solid culture medium. Alternatively, immature embryos or other target cells may be arranged on solid culture medium. The cells to be bombarded are positioned at an appropriate distance below the macroprojectile stopping plate. An illustrative embodiment of a method for delivering DNA into plant cells by acceleration is the Biolistics Particle Delivery System, which may be used to propel particles coated with DNA or cells through a screen, such as a stainless steel or Nytex screen, onto a surface covered with target salad rocket cells. The screen disperses the particles so that they are not delivered to the recipient cells in large aggregates. It is believed that a screen intervening between the projectile apparatus and the cells to be bombarded reduces the size of projectiles aggregate and may contribute to a higher frequency of transformation by reducing the damage inflicted on the recipient cells by projectiles that are too large. Microprojectile bombardment techniques are widely applicable, and may be used to transform virtually any plant species, including a plant of salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057"><i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transfer is another widely applicable system for introducing gene loci into plant cells. An advantage of the technique is that DNA may be introduced into whole plant tissues, thereby bypassing the need for regeneration of an intact plant from a protoplast. <i>Agrobacterium </i>transformation vectors are capable of replication in <i>E. coli </i>as well as <i>Agrobacterium</i>, allowing for convenient manipulations. Moreover, advances in vectors for <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated gene transfer have improved the arrangement of genes and restriction sites in the vectors to facilitate the construction of vectors capable of expressing various polypeptide coding genes. The vectors have convenient multi-linker regions flanked by a promoter and a polyadenylation site for direct expression of inserted polypeptide coding genes. Additionally, <i>Agrobacterium </i>containing both armed and disarmed Ti genes may be used for transformation. In those plant strains where <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation is efficient, it is the method of choice because of the facile and defined nature of the gene locus transfer. The use of <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated plant integrating vectors to introduce DNA into plant cells, including lettuce plant cells, is well known in the art (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,250,560 and 5,563,055).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">Transformation of plant protoplasts also may be achieved using methods based on calcium phosphate precipitation, polyethylene glycol treatment, electroporation, and combinations of these treatments.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">A number of promoters have utility for plant gene expression for any gene of interest including but not limited to selectable markers, scoreable markers, genes for pest tolerance, disease resistance, nutritional enhancements and any other gene of agronomic interest. Examples of constitutive promoters useful for salad rocket plant gene expression include, but are not limited to, the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) P-35S promoter, a tandemly duplicated version of the CaMV 35S promoter, the enhanced 35S promoter (P-e35S), the nopaline synthase promoter, the octopine synthase promoter, the figwort mosaic virus (P-FMV) promoter (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,619), an enhanced version of the FMV promoter (P-eFMV) where the promoter sequence of P-FMV is duplicated in tandem, the cauliflower mosaic virus 19S promoter, a sugarcane bacilliform virus promoter, a commelina yellow mottle virus promoter, the promoter for the thylakoid membrane proteins from lettuce (psaD, psaF, psaE, PC, FNR, atpC, atpD, cab, rbcS) (see U.S. Pat. No. 7,161,061), the CAB-1 promoter from spinach (see U.S. Pat. No. 7,663,027), the promoter from maize prolamin seed storage protein (see U.S. Pat. No. 7,119,255), and other plant DNA virus promoters known to express in plant cells. A variety of plant gene promoters that are regulated in response to environmental, hormonal, chemical, and/or developmental signals may be used for expression of an operably linked gene in plant cells, including promoters regulated by (1) heat, (2) light (e.g., pea rbcS-3A promoter, maize rbcS promoter, or chlorophyll a/b-binding protein promoter), (3) hormones, such as abscisic acid, (4) wounding (e.g., wunl, or (5) chemicals such as methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, or Safener. It may also be advantageous to employ organ-specific promoters.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">Exemplary nucleic acids which may be introduced to the salad rocket variety of this invention include, for example, DNA sequences or genes from another species, or even genes or sequences which originate with or are present in salad rocket species, but are incorporated into recipient cells by genetic engineering methods rather than classical reproduction or breeding techniques. However, the term &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; is also intended to refer to genes that are not normally present in the cell being transformed, or perhaps simply not present in the form, structure, etc., as found in the transforming DNA segment or gene, or genes which are normally present and that one desires to express in a manner that differs from the natural expression pattern, e.g., to over-express. Thus, the term &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; gene or DNA is intended to refer to any gene or DNA segment that is introduced into a recipient cell, regardless of whether a similar gene may already be present in such a cell. The type of DNA included in the exogenous DNA may include DNA which is already present in the plant cell, DNA from another plant, DNA from a different organism, or a DNA generated externally, such as a DNA sequence containing an antisense message of a gene, or a DNA sequence encoding a synthetic or modified version of a gene.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">Many hundreds if not thousands of different genes are known and could potentially be introduced into a plant of salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ. Non-limiting examples of particular genes and corresponding phenotypes one may choose to introduce into a salad rocket plant include one or more genes for insect tolerance, pest tolerance such as genes for fungal disease control, herbicide tolerance, and genes for quality improvements such as yield, nutritional enhancements, environmental or stress tolerances, or any desirable changes in plant physiology, growth, development, morphology or plant product(s).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">Alternatively, the DNA coding sequences may affect these phenotypes by encoding a non-translatable RNA molecule that causes the targeted inhibition of expression of an endogenous gene, for example via antisense- or cosuppression-mediated mechanisms. The RNA could also be a catalytic RNA molecule (i.e., a ribozyme) engineered to cleave a desired endogenous mRNA product. Thus, any gene which produces a protein or mRNA which expresses a phenotype or morphology change of interest is useful for the practice of the present invention. (See also U.S. Pat.

The invention, of course, includes a salad rocket plant produced by this method.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">Backcrossing may also be used to improve an inbred plant. Backcrossing transfers a specific desirable trait from one inbred or non-inbred source to an inbred that lacks that trait. This may be accomplished, for example, by first crossing a superior inbred (A) (recurrent parent) to a donor inbred (non-recurrent parent), which carries the appropriate locus or loci for the trait in question. The progeny of this cross are then mated back to the superior recurrent parent (A) followed by selection in the resultant progeny for the desired trait to be transferred from the non-recurrent parent. After five or more backcross generations with selection for the desired trait, the progeny are heterozygous for loci controlling the characteristic being transferred, but are like the superior parent for most or almost all other loci. The last backcross generation would be selfed to give pure breeding progeny for the trait being transferred. When a plant of salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ, representative seed of which having been deposited under NCIMB Accession No. 43991, is used in backcrossing, offspring retaining the combination of traits including downy mildew resistance, dark green colored leaves, short to medium leaf length and narrow to medium leaf width, medium to strong leaf division and medium secondary leaf lobing, and medium late to late flowering are progeny within the ambit of the invention. Backcrossing methods may be used with the present invention to improve or introduce a characteristic into a plant of the invention, being a plant of salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ. See, e.g., U.S. Pat.

This method may additionally comprise the step of storing the results of detecting the plurality of polymorphisms on a computer readable medium. The plurality of polymorphisms are indicative of and/or give rise to the expression of any one or more, or all, of the morphological and physiological characteristics of salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">There are various ways of obtaining genotype data from a nucleic acid sample. Genotype data may be gathered which is specific for certain phenotypic traits (e.g. gene sequences), but also patterns of random genetic variation may be obtained to construct a so-called DNA fingerprint. Depending on the technique used a fingerprint may be obtained that is unique for salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ. Obtaining a unique DNA fingerprint depends on the genetic variation present in a variety and the sensitivity of the fingerprinting technique. A technique known in the art to provide a good fingerprint profile is called AFLP fingerprinting technique (See generally U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,215), but there are many other marker based techniques, such as RFLP (or Restriction fragment length polymorphism), SSLP (or Simple sequence length polymorphism), RAPD (or Random amplification of polymorphic DNA) VNTR (or Variable number tandem repeat), Microsatellite polymorphism, SSR (or Simple sequence repeat), STR (or Short tandem repeat), SFP (or Single feature polymorphism) DArT (or Diversity Arrays Technology), RAD markers (or Restriction site associated DNA markers) (e.g. Baird et al. PloS One Vol. 3 e3376, 2008; Semagn et al. African Journal of Biotechnology Vol. 5 number 25 pp. 2540-2568, 29 Dec., 2006). Nowadays, sequence-based methods are utilizing Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are randomly distributed across genomes, as a common tool for genotyping (e.g. Elshire et al. PloS One Vol. 6: e19379, 2011; Poland et al. PloS One Vol. 7: e32253; Truong et al. PLoS One Vol. 7 number 5: e37565, 2012).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075">With any of the aforementioned genotyping techniques, polymorphisms may be detected when the genotype and/or sequence of the plant of interest is compared to the genotype and/or sequence of one or more reference plants. As used herein, the genotype and/or sequence of a reference plant may be derived from, but is not limited to, any one of the following: parental lines, closely related plant varieties or species, complete genome sequence of a related plant variety or species, or the de novo assembled genome sequence of one or more related plant varieties or species. For example, it is possible to detect polymorphisms for the characteristic of the time of flowering time of the plant by comparing the genotype and/or the sequence of salad rocket variety 88-208 RZ with the genotype and/or the sequence of one or more reference plants.
