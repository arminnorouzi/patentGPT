Teeth are repositioned by applying controlled forces to the teeth over an extended time period. In one example, teeth may be repositioned by placing a dental appliance, generally referred to as an orthodontic aligner or an orthodontic aligner tray, over the teeth of the patient for each treatment stage of an orthodontic treatment. The orthodontic alignment tray includes a polymeric shell defining a plurality of cavities for receiving one or more teeth. The individual cavities in the polymeric shell are shaped to exert force on one or more teeth to resiliently and incrementally reposition selected teeth or groups of teeth in the upper or lower jaw.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A series of orthodontic aligner trays are provided to a patient to be worn sequentially and alternatingly during each stage of the orthodontic treatment to gradually reposition teeth from one tooth arrangement to a successive tooth arrangement to achieve a desired tooth alignment condition. Once the desired alignment condition is achieved, an aligner tray, or a series of aligner trays, may be used periodically or continuously in the mouth of the patient to maintain tooth alignment. In addition, orthodontic retainer trays may be used for an extended time period to maintain tooth alignment following the initial orthodontic treatment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Incidence and prevalence of white spot lesions (WSL) during fixed orthodontic treatment is a well-documented challenge to both patients and providers. Certain factors such as poor oral hygiene, particularly in younger male patients, and length of treatment, can increase the incidence of WSL, whereas, factors such as salivary flow and preventive fluoride therapy throughout the treatment can reduce the incidence of WSLs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although patients undergoing either fixed or aligner orthodontic treatment are encouraged to pursue enhanced oral hygiene, in many cases patients fail to follow the necessary daily hygienic procedures. For this reason, WSL formation during orthodontic treatments remains a widespread problem.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the present disclosure is directed to a dental appliance having a continuous layer of a therapeutic material, or a pattern of discrete structures of a therapeutic material, on at least a portion of at least one major surface thereof, and to various example methods for making the dental appliance. For example, the layer or structures can release ions or compounds to protect the teeth against decalcification, reduce cavities, prevent biofilm formation on the exposed surfaces of the dental appliance, reduce, eliminate, and repair WSL, and the like. In some embodiments, the layer or structures can even be recharged with therapeutic agents, ions or compounds by exposing the dental appliance to an oral solution containing such therapeutic agents or compounds, and the structures then re-release the therapeutic compounds to a surface of the tooth when in use. The layer or structures can provide a wholistic solution to protect against WSL formation and repair damage to enamel caused by WSL during a treatment with a dental appliance such as an orthodontic aligner tray. The layer or structures includes a glass ionomer (GI), a resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI), or a combination thereof that can control the dosage and duration of beneficial ion or compound release at a surface of the teeth throughout the treatment time in which the dental appliance is used in the mouth of a patient.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for making a dental appliance configured to position at least one tooth of a patient. The method includes printing a hardenable liquid resin composition on a major surface of a polymeric material to form a pattern thereon, wherein the hardenable liquid resin composition comprises a glass ionomer, a resin modified glass ionomer, and mixtures and combinations thereof; and forming a dental appliance from the polymeric material, wherein the dental appliance comprises an arrangement of cavities configured to receive one or more teeth.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for making a dental appliance configured to position at least one tooth of a patient.

In the present application, the term aspect ratio means a ratio of the height to the width of the discrete features.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The hardenable liquid resin composition that forms the liquid regions <b>14</b> includes a glass ionomer (GI) or resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI), or a combination thereof. Generally, GI and RMGI materials are either self-cured and/or light cured bioactive dental restorative materials that form a polymerized resin matrix that bonds to a tooth. In the present application the term GI refers to compositions that include a homopolymer of an &#x3b1;,&#x3b2; unsaturated carboxylic acid, a glass filler such as fluoroaluminosilicate glass (FAS), and water. The term RMGI as used herein refers to compositions that include an &#x3b1;,&#x3b2; unsaturated carboxylic acid, a glass filler such as fluoroaluminosilicate glass (FAS), and water. The term &#x201c;ethylenically unsaturated compounds with acid functionality&#x201d; is meant to include monomers, oligomers, and polymers having ethylenic unsaturation and acid and/or acid-precursor functionality. Acid-precursor functionalities include, for example, anhydrides, acid halides, and pyrophosphates. In the RMGI the polyacid is modified to replace or end-cap some of the acidic repeating units with pendant curable groups and an optional photoinitiator can be added to provide a second curing mechanism. Acrylate or methacrylate (also referred to herein as (meth)acrylates) groups can be used as the pendant curable groups. In some embodiments, the polyacid may optionally be modified to replace or end-cap some of the acidic repeating units with pendant curable groups, and a redox or other chemical cure system can be used instead of or in addition to the photoinitiator system.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">GI and RMGI compositions are usually formulated as powder/liquid or paste/paste systems, and contain water as mixed and applied. They may partially or fully harden in the dark due to the ionic reaction between the acidic repeating units of the polycarboxylic acid and cations leached from the glass, and some commercially available RMGI products can also cure on exposure of the compositions to light from a dental curing lamp.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In various embodiments, GI/RMGI materials have calcium and phosphate ion release and recharge capabilities, re-mineralize enamel and/or dentine surfaces, and increase resistance of contacted tooth structures to acid attack. The release of ions (for example, at least one of calcium, fluoride and phosphorus) into the oral environment is known to enhance the natural re-mineralizing capability of dental structures, and the sustained release of calcium and phosphorous provided by GI/RMGI materials can be used to enhance mineralization a the surfaces of the teeth and reduce, prevent or repair WSL during a desired treatment time with a dental appliance, as well as improve the general oral health of the patient.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The hardenable liquid GI/RMGI composition forming the liquid regions <b>14</b> includes a resin matrix formed by a polyacid and an optional polymerizable component, as well as at least one of a nanofiller and a dental filler. By &#x201c;hardenable&#x201d; is meant that the composition can be cured or solidified, e.g., by heating, chemical cross-linking, radiation-induced polymerization or crosslinking, or the like.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the dental filler can have a treated surface configured to release beneficial ions such as, for example, at least one of calcium, fluoride and phosphorus, into an oral environment at a predetermined rate. For example, the surface treated fillers may include a phosphate salt as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 10,137,061, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the hardenable liquid GI/RMGI composition forming the liquid regions <b>14</b> includes a therapeutic agent in addition to or separate from those provided by the surface treated dental filler. In this application the term therapeutic agent refers to compounds that can have a beneficial effect in the mouth of the patient. Examples of suitable therapeutic agents for the hardenable resin composition include, but are not limited to, fluoride sources, whitening agents, anti-cavity agents (e.g., xylitol), re-mineralizing agents (e.g., calcium phosphate compounds), enzymes, breath fresheners, anesthetics, clotting agents, acid neutralizers and pH control agents, ion-recharging agents, chemotherapeutic agents, immune response modifiers, thixotropes, polyols, anti-inflammatory agents, antimicrobial agents, antifungal agents, agents for treating xerostomia, desensitizers, and the like, of the type often used in dental compositions. Combinations of any of the above therapeutic agents may be used.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, suitable therapeutic agents include re-mineralizing agents such as calcium, phosphorous, and fluoride compounds.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, in some embodiments, suitable calcium compounds in the hardenable liquid resin composition include, but are not limited to, calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, calcium caseinate, calcium chloride, calcium citrate, calcium glubionate, calcium gluceptate, calcium glycerophosphate, calcium gluconate, calcium hydroxide, calcium hydroxyapatite, calcium lactate, calcium oxalate, calcium oxide, calcium pantothenate, calcium phosphate, calcium polycarbophil, calcium propionate, calcium pyrophosphate, calcium sulfate, and mixtures and combinations thereof. These compounds have been found to minimize demineralization of calcium hydroxyapatite at the surface of the tooth of a patient.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the tooth re-mineralizing compounds in the hardenable liquid resin composition include phosphate compounds. Suitable phosphate compounds include, but are not limited to, aluminum phosphate, bone phosphate, calcium phosphate, calcium orthophosphate, calcium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, calcium phosphate-bone ash, calcium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, calcium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, calcium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, calcium phosphate tribasic, dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, dicalcium phosphate, neutral calcium phosphate, precipitated calcium phosphate, tertiary calcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, whitlockite, magnesium phosphate, potassium phosphate, dibasic potassium phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen orthophosphate, dipotassium monophosphate, dipotassium phosphate, monobasic potassium phosphate, potassium acid phosphate, potassium biphosphate, potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium phosphate, anhydrous sodium phosphate, dibasic sodium phosphate, disodium hydrogen orthophosphate, disodium hydrogen orthophosphate dodecahydrate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, disodium phosphate, and sodium orthophosphate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Fluoride compounds incorporated into the mineral surface of a tooth help inhibit the demineralization of enamel and protect the tooth. Fluoride compounds absorbed into mineral surfaces of a tooth attract calcium and phosphate ions from saliva, or other sources, which results in the formation of fluorapatite and protects the tooth against demineralization. While not wishing to be bound by any theory, currently available evidence indicates that fluorapatite exhibits lower solubility than naturally occurring hydroxyapatite, which can help resist the inevitable acid challenge that teeth face daily.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Orthodontic patients are considered high risk for cavities over the course of their treatment. Commercial fluoride varnishes are very sticky by design and typically last a few hours on the enamel once applied. For an orthodontic patient wearing a dental appliance such as an aligner tray, this is undesirable since the varnish can interfere with the fit of the aligners on the arches of the patient, as well as adhere to the plastic that the aligners are made from and permanently warp or deform them. In one embodiment, for example, the liquid regions <b>14</b> on the structured surface <b>16</b> can be configured to deliver, when subsequently hardened, beneficial fluoride over a typical wear time for an alignment tray set (for example, 10-14 days), without compromising the fit of the alignment tray for the patient or ruining the polymeric material from which the alignment tray is made.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the calcium compounds, phosphate compounds, fluoride compounds or combinations thereof, are present in the liquid regions in an amount sufficient such at least one of calcium, phosphate or fluoride can substantially reduce or prevent demineralization on the surface of the teeth of the patient during or exceeding a predetermined wear time.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The dental fillers used in the hardenable liquid composition are surface treated by methods similar to those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,429 (Mitra et al.). In brief, the dental fillers can be surface treated by combining the filler with a liquid having a salt or other surface treating agent (e.g., fluoride ion precursors, silanes, titanates, and the like) dissolved, dispersed, or suspended therein. Optionally, the liquid includes water, and if an aqueous liquid is used, it can be acidic or basic. Once treated, at least a portion of the liquid can be removed from the surface treated dental filler using any convenient technique (e.g., spray drying, oven drying, gap drying, lyophilizing, and combinations thereof). See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,697 (Kolb et al.) for a description of gap drying. In one embodiment, the treated fillers can be oven dried, typically at drying temperatures of about 30&#xb0; to about 100&#xb0; C., for example, overnight. The surface treated filler can be further heated as desired. The treated and dried dental filler can then be screened or lightly comminuted to break up agglomerates.

In various embodiments the dental filler includes porous particles and/or porous agglomerates of particles, and in some cases the dental fillers include nanoparticles and/or agglomerates of nanoparticles. Preferred classes of dental fillers include metal oxides, metal fluorides, metal oxyfluorides, and combinations thereof, wherein the metal can be a heavy or non-heavy metal.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In preferred embodiments, the dental filler is an oxide, a fluoride, or an oxyfluoride of an element selected from elements such as, for example, Ca, Sr, Ba, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm Yb, Lu, Ti, Zr, Ta, Zn B, Al, Si, Sn, P, and mixtures and combinations thereof. The dental filler can be a glass, an amorphous material, or a crystalline material.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Optionally, the dental filler can include a source of fluoride ions, phosphorous ions or calcium ions. Such dental fillers include, for example, fluoroaluminosilicate glasses (FAS).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments the filler is finely divided, and can have a unimodial or polymodial (e.g., bimodal) particle size distribution. In various example embodiments, the maximum particle size (the largest dimension of a particle, typically, the diameter) of the filler is less than 20 micrometers, or less than 10 micrometers, or less than 5 micrometers, and the average particle size of the filler is less than 2 micrometers, or less than 0.1 micrometers, or less than 0.075 micrometer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The filler can be an inorganic material. It can also be a crosslinked organic material that is insoluble in the hardenable liquid composition, and is optionally filled with inorganic filler. The filler should in any event be nontoxic and suitable for use in the mouth. The filler can be radiopaque or radiolucent. The filler typically is substantially insoluble in water. Examples of suitable inorganic fillers are naturally occurring or synthetic materials including, but not limited to: quartz; nitrides (e.g., silicon nitride); glasses derived from, for example, Zr, Sr, Ce, Sb, Sn, Ba, Zn, and Al; feldspar; borosilicate glass; kaolin; talc; titania; low Mohs hardness fillers such as those described in U.S. Pat.

Typical metal oxides include barium oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, and zinc oxide. Typical glasses include borate glasses, phosphate glasses, and fluoroaluminosilicate (&#x201c;FAS&#x201d;) glasses. FAS glasses are particularly preferred. The FAS glass typically contains sufficient elutable cations so that a hardened dental composition will form when the glass is mixed with the components of the hardenable composition. The glass also typically contains sufficient elutable fluoride ions so that the hardened composition will have cariostatic properties. The glass can be made from a melt containing fluoride, alumina, and other glass-forming ingredients using techniques familiar to those skilled in the FAS glassmaking art.

In alternative embodiments, the polyacid may be substantially free of polymerizable groups. The polyacid needs not be entirely water soluble, but it should be at least sufficiently water-miscible so that it does not undergo substantial sedimentation when combined with other aqueous components. Suitable polyacids are listed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,209,434 (Wilson et al.). The polyacid should have a molecular weight sufficient to provide good storage, handling, and mixing properties.

No. 5,501,727 (Wang et al.); amines, especially tertiary amines, such as 4-tert-butyl dimethylaniline; aromatic sulfinic salts, such as p-toluenesulfinic salts and benzenesulfinic salts; thioureas, such as 1-ethyl-2-thiourea, tetraethyl thiourea, tetramethyl thiourea, 1,1-dibutyl thiourea, and 1,3-dibutyl thiourea; and mixtures thereof. Other secondary reducing agents may include cobalt (II) chloride, ferrous chloride, ferrous sulfate, hydrazine, hydroxylamine (depending on the choice of oxidizing agent), salts of a dithionite or sulfite anion, and combinations thereof. Preferably, the reducing agent is an amine.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Suitable oxidizing agents will also be familiar to those skilled in the art, and include, for example, persulfuric acid and salts thereof, such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, cesium, and alkyl ammonium salts. Additional oxidizing agents include, for example, peroxides such as benzoyl peroxides, hydroperoxides such as cumyl hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and amyl hydroperoxide, as well as salts of transition metals such as cobalt (III) chloride and ferric chloride, cerium (IV) sulfate, perboric acid and salts thereof, permanganic acid and salts thereof, perphosphoric acid and salts thereof, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">It may be desirable to use more than one oxidizing agent or more than one reducing agent. Small quantities of transition metal compounds may also be added to accelerate the rate of redox cure. In some embodiments it may be preferred to include a secondary ionic salt to enhance the stability of the hardenable composition as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,982,288 (Mitra et al.).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The reducing and oxidizing agents are present in amounts sufficient to permit an adequate free-radical reaction rate. This can be evaluated by combining all of the ingredients of the hardenable composition except for the filler, and observing whether or not a hardened mass is obtained. In some example embodiments, the reducing agent is present in an amount of at least 0.01% by weight, and more preferably at least 0.10% by weight, based on the total weight (including water) of the components of the hardenable composition. In some example embodiments, the reducing agent is present in an amount of no greater than 10% by weight, and more preferably no greater than 5% by weight, based on the total weight (including water) of the components of the polymerizable composition.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments, the oxidizing agent is present in an amount of at least 0.01% by weight, and more preferably at least 0.10% by weight, based on the total weight (including water) of the components of the polymerizable composition. In some embodiments, the oxidizing agent is present in an amount of no greater than 10% by weight, and more preferably no greater than 5% by weight, based on the total weight (including water) of the components of the hardenable composition.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The reducing or oxidizing agents can be microencapsulated as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,154,762 (Mitra et al.). This will generally enhance shelf stability of the polymerizable composition, and if necessary permit packaging the reducing and oxidizing agents together. For example, through appropriate selection of an encapsulant, the oxidizing and reducing agents can be combined with an acid-functional component and optional filler and kept in a storage-stable state. Likewise, through appropriate selection of a water-insoluble encapsulant, the reducing and oxidizing agents can be combined with an FAS glass and water and maintained in a storage-stable state.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In a further alternative, heat may be used to initiate the hardening, or polymerization, of free radically active groups. Examples of heat sources suitable for the dental materials of the composition include inductive, convective, and radiant. Thermal sources should be capable of generating temperatures of at least 40&#xb0; C. and at most 150&#xb0; C. under normal conditions or at elevated pressure. This procedure is preferred for initiating polymerization of materials occurring outside of the oral environment.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Yet another alternative class of initiators capable of initiating polymerization of free radically active functional groups in the hardenable resin are those that include free radical-generating thermal initiators. Examples include peroxides (e.g., benzoyl peroxide and lauryl peroxide) and azo compounds (e.g., 2,2-azobis-isobutyronitrile (AIBN)).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Photoinitiator compounds are preferably provided in dental compositions disclosed in the present application in an amount effective to initiate or enhance the rate of cure or hardening of the resin system. Useful photopolymerizable compositions are prepared by simply admixing, under safe light conditions, the components as described above. Suitable inert solvents may be used, if desired, when preparing this mixture. Any solvent that does not react appreciably with the components of the inventive compositions may be used. Examples of suitable solvents include, for example, acetone, dichloromethane, and acetonitrile.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The hardenable liquid compositions contain water, which should be present in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide adequate handling and mixing properties and to permit the transport of ions, particularly in the filler-acid reaction. Preferably, water represents at least 2 wt-%, and more preferably at least 5 wt-%, of the total weight of ingredients used to form the composition. Preferably, water represents no greater than 90 wt-%, and more preferably no greater than 80 wt-%, of the total weight of ingredients used to form the composition.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition to the dental filler and the nanofiller components, the compositions can also optionally include one or more other fillers. Such fillers may be selected from one or more of a wide variety of materials suitable for the use in dental and/or orthodontic compositions. The other filler can be an inorganic material. It can also be a crosslinked organic material that is insoluble in the resin component of the composition, and is optionally filled with inorganic filler. The filler should in any event be nontoxic and suitable for use in the mouth. The filler can be radiopaque or radiolucent. The filler typically is substantially insoluble in water. Examples of suitable inorganic fillers are naturally occurring or synthetic materials including, but not limited to: quartz; nitrides (e.g., silicon nitride); glasses derived from, for example, Zr, Sr, Ce, Sb, Sn, Ba, Zn, and Al; feldspar; borosilicate glass; kaolin; talc; titania; low Mohs hardness fillers such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,695,251 (Randklev); and silica particles (e.g., submicron pyrogenic silicas such as those available under the trade designations AEROSIL, including &#x201c;OX 50,&#x201d; &#x201c;130,&#x201d; &#x201c;150&#x201d; and &#x201c;200&#x201d; silicas from Degussa AG, Hanau, Germany and CAB-O-SIL M5 silica from Cabot Corp., Tuscola, Ill.). Examples of suitable organic filler particles include filled or unfilled pulverized polycarbonates, polyepoxides, and the like. Suitable filler particles are quartz, submicron silica, and non-vitreous microparticles of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,503,169 (Randklev). Mixtures of these non-acid-reactive fillers are also contemplated, as well as combination fillers made from organic and inorganic materials.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The surface of the filler particles can also be treated with a coupling agent in order to enhance the bond between the filler and the resin. The use of suitable coupling agents include gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane, gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, and the like. Examples of useful silane coupling agents are those available from Crompton Corporation, Naugatuck, Conn., as SILQUEST A-174 and SILQUEST A-1230. For some embodiments of the hardenable liquid composition that include other fillers (e.g., dental restorative compositions), the compositions may include at least 1% by weight, more preferably at least 2% by weight, and most preferably at least 5% by weight other filler, based on the total weight of the composition. For such embodiments, compositions of the present composition preferably include at most 40% by weight, more preferably at most 20% by weight, and most preferably at most 15% by weight other filler, based on the total weight of the composition.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Optionally, the hardenable compositions may contain other solvents, cosolvents (e.g., alcohols) or diluents. If desired, the hardenable composition can contain additives such as indicators, dyes, pigments, inhibitors, accelerators, viscosity modifiers, wetting agents, tartaric acid, chelating agents, surfactants, buffering agents, stabilizers, and other similar ingredients that will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Additionally, medicaments or other therapeutic substances can be optionally added to the dental compositions. Examples include, but are not limited to, fluoride sources, whitening agents, anticarries agents (e.g., xylitol), remineralizing agents (e.g., calcium phosphate compounds), enzymes, breath fresheners, anesthetics, clotting agents, acid neutralizers, chemotherapeutic agents, immune response modifiers, thixotropes, polyols, anti-inflammatory agents, antimicrobial agents, antifungal agents, agents for treating xerostomia, desensitizers, and the like, of the type often used in dental compositions.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The hardenable liquid compositions can be prepared by combining all the various components using conventional mixing techniques. As discussed above, the compositions may be partially or fully hardened by an ionic reaction between an acid-reactive filler and a polyacid. Optionally, the compositions may contain a polymerizable component and a photoinitiator and be hardened by photoinitiation, or may be partially or fully hardened by chemical polymerization such as a redox cure system in which the composition contains a free-radical initiator system, e.g., including an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent. Alternatively, the hardenable composition may contain different initiator systems, such that the composition can be both a photopolymerizable and a chemically polymerizable composition, as well as an ionically hardenable composition.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The hardenable compositions can be supplied in a variety of forms including one-part systems and multi-part systems, e.g., two-part powder/liquid, paste/liquid, paste/powder and paste/paste systems. Other forms employing multi-part combinations (i.e., combinations of two or more parts), each of which is in the form of a powder, liquid, gel, or paste are also possible. The various components of the composition may be divided up into separate parts in whatever manner is desired; however, the polyacid, dental filler and water generally would not all be present in the same part, although any two of these may be grouped together in the same part along with any combination of other components. Furthermore, in a redox multi-part system, one part typically contains the oxidizing agent and another part typically contains the reducing agent. However, the reducing agent and oxidizing agent could be combined in the same part of the system if the components are kept separated, for example, through use of microencapsulation.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, two-part dental compositions of the present composition can be provided in a dual barrel syringe having a first barrel and a second barrel, wherein the part A resides in the first barrel and the part B resides in the second barrel. In other embodiments, two-part dental compositions can be provided in a unit-dose capsule. In some embodiments, each part of a multi-part dental system can be mixed together using a static mixer.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Suitable GI/RMGI compositions are commercially available under the trade designations VITREMER, VITREBOND, RELYX Luting Cement, RELYX Luting Plus Cement, PHOTAC-FIL QUICK, KETAC-MOLAR, KETAC-FIL PLUS and VANISH XT VARNISH from 3M, St Paul, Minn., Fuji II LC and Fuji IX (GC Dental Industrial Corp, Tokyo, Japan) and Chemfil Superior (Dentsply Intl, York, Pa.). The delivery mode of these materials can be varnish, sealant, powder-liquid, single-paste, liquid-paste and paste-paste systems. Suitable compounds are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 10,137,061; 4,871,786; 9,132,069; 8,129,444; 7,632,098; and 6,444,725; 10,080,708, U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/773,244, WO2019/234661, and WO2019/234633, each of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, the hardenable liquid composition is a photocurable RMGI coating available from 3M, St. Paul, Minn., under the trade designation VANISH XT VARNISH Durable Fluoride-Releasing Coating, which has heretofore been used for application to tooth and enamel surfaces to treat exposed root surface sensitivity and to provide site specific protection for high risk, caries prone areas including non-cavitating lesions. The VANISH XT Varnish provides sustained fluoride and calcium phosphate release, and presently available evidence indicates that at least one of F, Ca and P ions release from VANISH XT varnish over a period of more than 200 days. The VANISH XT Varnish RMGI can intermittently be recharged of its F, Ca and P ions with dentifrice such as those available from 3M, St. Paul, Minn. under the trade designations CLINPRO 5000, and the like, or with an aqueous buffered fluoride solution such as, for example, a 1-2% sodium fluoride gel.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In various embodiments, the therapeutic agents released from the structures <b>24</b> can vary between areas on the major surfaces of the dental appliance <b>20</b>, and even within a single region. For example, the therapeutic agents released by the structures <b>24</b> in a first area of the surfaces <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> of the dental appliance <b>20</b> can be different from the therapeutic agents released from the structures <b>24</b> in a second area of the surfaces <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, e.g., fluoride in the first area and phosphate or calcium in the second area. In other examples, the therapeutic agents released from the structures <b>24</b> within the first area can differ from one another, e.g., fluoride and phosphate could be released from different structures <b>24</b> in the first area. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agents within the structures <b>24</b> can be released at a different concentration between regions and within a selected region.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In another embodiment, the therapeutic agents provided by the liquid regions <b>14</b> and the corresponding structures <b>24</b> can be releasable over a predetermined patient wear time of the dental appliance <b>20</b>. The therapeutic agents may be released over a period of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months, and in some embodiments, which are not intended to be limiting, are released over a typical treatment time for an orthodontic device such as, for about 1-2 weeks, or 10 days to 14 days. In addition, different regions of the orthodontic appliance can have therapeutic agents with varying predetermined release periods. For example, one region may have a release period on the order of seconds, and another different region may have a release period on the order of months.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In another embodiment, the liquid regions <b>14</b> and the corresponding structures <b>24</b> can be configured to absorb and release therapeutic agents. For example, calcium and/or phosphorus can be absorbed from saliva and released over time. In another example, fluoride, calcium, tin, and/or phosphorus in the structures can be recharged from oral care products (e.g., toothpaste and rinse) and re-released at a tooth surface over time.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In another embodiment, the liquid regions <b>14</b> or the corresponding structures <b>24</b> can be configured to facilitate unhindered flow of salivary fluids and other fluids to enhance and/or maintain hard tissue health. For example, when a tooth surface undergoes demineralization instigated by oral bacteria, dietary choices, xerostomia, etc., the structures <b>24</b> can provide open channels for the saliva to hydrate and re-mineralize the tooth surface.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As noted above, the liquid regions <b>14</b> can be applied on the surfaces <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> by any suitable printing technique. In some non-limiting examples, screen printing is a printing technique in which a mesh is used to transfer a liquid composition, referred to as an ink, onto a substrate, except in areas made impermeable to the ink by a blocking stencil. A blade or squeegee is moved across the screen to fill the open mesh apertures with ink, and a reverse stroke then causes the screen to touch the substrate momentarily along a line of contact. This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed. One color is printed at a time, so several screens can be used to produce a multi-colored image or design. Screen printing is particularly useful in forming liquid regions <b>14</b> with varying heights or spacings above the surfaces <b>15</b>, <b>17</b>. For example, in some embodiments the spacing of apertures in the screen, or the thickness of the screen, or both, can be varied to form arrays of liquid regions with corresponding spacings or heights above the surfaces <b>15</b>, <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In another non-limiting example, a flexographic print is made by creating a positive mirrored master of the required image as a 3D relief in a rubber or polymeric material, which is referred to as a flexographic printing plate. The image areas on the flexographic printing plate are raised above the non-image areas on the plate. Printing ink is transferred to the image areas of the flexographic plate via an anilox roll (composed of cells filled with ink, usually by a blading ink into the anilox roll cells), and then the ink is transferred to the substrate by contacting the &#x201c;inked&#x201d; flexographic plate to the substrate. Ink is only transferred from the relief features of the flexographic plate to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as noted above, after printing the liquid regions <b>14</b> are subsequently at least partially hardened to form a pattern <b>22</b> of discrete structures <b>24</b> on either or both major surfaces <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> of the substrate <b>26</b>.

In some embodiments, the substrate <b>16</b> may be thermoformed at a temperature and a pressure such that an image formed by the array of structures <b>22</b> is not substantially distorted, which means that the image is still recognizable at a normal viewing distance. In some embodiments, the conditions in the thermoforming step may be utilized to change a first pattern of the structures <b>24</b> into a second pattern of structures <b>24</b> different from the first pattern.

The microstructures can have a wide variety of shapes including, but not limited to, grooves separated by V-shaped regions or trapezoidal regions, dots, depressions, prisms, a matte surface, a holographic surface, and the like.

Once released from the mold, the dental appliance includes a pattern of discrete microstructures that corresponds to the pattern <b>322</b> of microstructured structures <b>324</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In another embodiment, dental appliance including a plurality of cavities configured to retain one or more teeth of a patient may be formed by any suitable method such as, for example, thermoforming a polymeric film substrate, three-dimensional (3D) printing, laser patterning, chemical or physical etching, additive manufacturing, and combinations thereof. Once the dental appliance is formed, the hardenable dental resin compositions described above may be applied to one or more surfaces of the dental appliance, or selected portions thereof, using any suitable method and hardened to form a substantially continuous layer or a pattern of discrete structures as described above. In various example embodiments, which are not intended to be limiting, the hardenable dental resin composition may be applied by spraying, dip coating, printing, and the like. In various embodiments, the substantially continuous layer or the pattern of discrete structures may be applied to all of at least one surface of the dental appliance, or to a selected portion thereof. For example, the layer or pattern of discrete structures may be applied to portions of the dental appliance that are intended to cover specific teeth, or portion of the dental appliance that are most visible when the dental appliance is in use in the mouth of the patient.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a shell <b>402</b> of an orthodontic appliance <b>400</b> is an elastic polymeric material that generally conforms to a patient's teeth <b>500</b>, but that is slightly out of alignment with the patient's initial tooth configuration. In some embodiments, the shell <b>402</b> may be one of a group or a series of shells having substantially the same shape or mold, but which are formed from different materials to provide a different stiffness or resilience as need to move the teeth of the patient. In this manner, in one embodiment, a patient or a user may alternately use one of the orthodontic appliances during each treatment stage depending upon the patient's desired usage time or treatment time period for each treatment stage.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">No wires or other means may be provided for holding the shell <b>402</b> over the teeth <b>500</b>, but in some embodiments, it may be desirable or necessary to provide individual anchors on teeth with corresponding receptacles or apertures in the shell <b>402</b> so that the shell <b>402</b> can apply a retentive or other directional orthodontic force on the tooth which would not be possible in the absence of such an anchor.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The shells <b>402</b> may be customized, for example, for day time use and night time use, during function or non-function (chewing vs. non-chewing), during social settings (where appearance may be more important) and nonsocial settings (where the aesthetic appearance may not be a significant factor), or based on the patient's desire to accelerate the teeth movement (by optionally using the more stiff appliance for a longer period of time as opposed to the less stiff appliance for each treatment stage).</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">For example, in one aspect, the patient may be provided with a clear orthodontic appliance <b>400</b> that may be primarily used to retain the position of the teeth, and an opaque orthodontic appliance that may be primarily used to move the teeth for each treatment stage. Accordingly, during the daytime, in social settings, or otherwise in an environment where the patient is more acutely aware of the physical appearance, the patient may use the clear appliance. Moreover, during the evening or nighttime, in non-social settings, or otherwise when in an environment where physical appearance is less important, the patient may use the opaque appliance that is configured to apply a different amount of force or otherwise has a stiffer configuration to accelerate the teeth movement during each treatment stage. This approach may be repeated so that each of the pair of appliances are alternately used during each treatment stage.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, systems and method in accordance with the various embodiments include a plurality of incremental position adjustment appliances, each formed from the same or a different material, for each treatment stage of orthodontic treatment. The orthodontic appliances may be configured to incrementally reposition individual teeth <b>500</b> in an upper or lower jaw <b>502</b> of a patient. In some embodiments, cavities <b>504</b> are configured such that selected teeth will be repositioned, while others of the teeth will be designated as a base or anchor region for holding the repositioning appliance in place as it applies the resilient repositioning force against the tooth or teeth intended to be repositioned.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Placement of the elastic positioner shell <b>402</b> over the teeth <b>500</b> applies controlled forces in specific locations to gradually move the teeth into the new configuration. Repetition of this process with successive appliances having different configurations eventually moves a patient's teeth through a series of intermediate configurations to a final desired configuration. During the movement process, structures <b>410</b> on the shell <b>402</b> provide a therapeutic or aesthetic function as described above.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In one example embodiment, the orthodontic alignment appliances may include a shell <b>402</b> made from a clear elastomeric polymeric material and are referred to as a clear tray aligner (CTA). In use, CTAs at stage one (N) of treatment are inserted over a dental arch with misaligned or malocclusion dentition at stage zero (N&#x2212;1). The polymeric tray can be stretched to force the dentition to reposition into the next stage one (N). In other words, each aligner tray starts out &#x201c;ill-fitting&#x201d; on purpose. The polymeric tray may have a contoured surface to be able to engage and transfer forces to the dentition to effectively reposition the right tooth or set of teeth at a designated location, vector and time. Because of the ability of the polymeric tray to engage and/or transfer forces to the dentition while starting out &#x201c;ill-fitting,&#x201d; the CTA can be effective and/or efficient appliance for, e.g., correcting Class II malocclusions, more comfortable to patient, easy to place/remove, and providing predictable treatment outcome. Therefore, a polymeric aligner tray with some flexibility at least in part because of its flat surface may be able to engage and/or transfer forces to the dentition to effectively reposition the right tooth or set of teeth at a designated location, vector and time. Because of the fit between the tooth or set of teeth, the CTA can be effective and/or efficient appliance for correcting Class II malocclusions and be comfortable to the patient, easy to place/remove, predictable treatment outcome, etc.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Embodiments will now be illustrated with reference to the following non-limiting examples.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Direct printing of a discrete RMGI dot pattern onto untreated PETG was achieved with stencil printing.
