In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter relates to a composition comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of soft hydrogel microparticles and stiff hydrogel microparticles and methods for generating microporous gel systems that comprise the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Arthritis of the hand and wrist is a chronic, disabling condition that affects roughly 4 million Americans annually with an estimated annual cost in terms of healthcare expenditure and decreased productivity exceeding $300 billion (Murphy et al., 2013). Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by progressive, irreparable loss of articular cartilage due to its limited intrinsic repair capacity because of its relative lack of blood supply and low cellular proliferation rate. Therefore, current treatment strategies are focused on replenishing the lost articular cartilage. Osteochondral grafting and autologous chondrocyte implantation have been employed to replace degenerated or damaged cartilage (Medved et al., 2013; Obert et al., 2013). These methods have shown limited long term efficacy and do not significantly modify OA symptoms (Mobasheri et al., 2014). Many hypothesize these methods of chondrocyte transplantation failed in part due to the lack of a nourishing environment to promote chondrogenesis (Yang et al., 2018). Additionally, transplantation of cartilage is an open, invasive procedure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A major obstacle in the management of OA remains the inability to effectively restore articular cartilage, restricting the options for patients to continued non-operative management, joint replacement, or ablation in the form of arthroplasty or arthrodesis. Tissue-engineered cartilage replacements represent an innovative approach to promote the development of functional articular cartilage and potentially avoid total joint replacement. However, the optimum mechanical and biochemical properties of the substrate material have yet to be defined, and leakage of the substrate, inadequate integration of host tissue, and insufficient structural support are common problems in tissue-engineered approaches (Armiento et al., 2018).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This Summary lists several embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, and in many cases lists variations and permutations of these embodiments.

Once acted upon by an annealing initiator such as but not limited to stimulation by light, the injected microspheres are chemically annealed to one another (and to surrounding tissue) through permanent covalent bonds to form a solid and hyper-porous scaffold to support tissue ingrowth (Griffin et al., 2015). This porous biomaterial allows for an accelerated window of tissue-biomaterial integration and the flowable nature makes the MAP gel an ideal candidate for arthroscopic procedures, for example in the treatment of wrist osteoarthritis (OA). Each microparticle is created using extremely tunable synthetic hydrogel chemistry and can be engineered to match the mechanical and chemical needs of the environment. In some embodiments, microparticle stiffness and mechanisms of degradation (e.g., the removal of a protease-sensitive peptide linker) were modified to produce a MAP scaffold specialized for long-term treatment of cartilage, bone, or other anatomical structures.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">I ABBREVIATIONS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0023">BMP-2: bone morphogenetic protein 2</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0024">BMP-4: bone morphogenetic protein 4</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0025">BMP-7: bone morphogenetic protein 7</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0026">CAT: computerized axial tomography</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0027">CS: chondroitin sulfate</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0028">CT: computerized tomography</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0029">D: Diameter</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0030">DMTMM: 4-(4,6-Dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0031">GAG: glycosaminoglycan</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0032">H&#x26;E: hematoxylin and eosin</li>        <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0033">HA: hyaluronic acid</li>        <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0034">kDa: kiloDaltons</li>        <li id="ul0002-0013" num="0035">kPa: kilopascal</li>        <li id="ul0002-0014" num="0036">LAP: lithium phenyl-(2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl) phosphinate</li>        <li id="ul0002-0015" num="0037">LED: light emitting diode</li>        <li id="ul0002-0016" num="0038">LFC: lateral femoral condyle</li>        <li id="ul0002-0017" num="0039">MAP: microporous annealed particle</li>        <li id="ul0002-0018" num="0040">MFC: medial femoral condyle</li>        <li id="ul0002-0019" num="0041">MSC mesenchymal stem cell</li>        <li id="ul0002-0020" num="0042">MWCO: molecular weight cut-off</li>        <li id="ul0002-0021" num="0043">OA: osteoarthritis</li>        <li id="ul0002-0022" num="0044">OCD: osteochondral defect</li>        <li id="ul0002-0023" num="0045">PBS: phosphate buffered saline</li>        <li id="ul0002-0024" num="0046">PDGF: platelet-derived growth factor</li>        <li id="ul0002-0025" num="0047">PDI: polydispersity index</li>        <li id="ul0002-0026" num="0048">PEG: polyethylene glycol</li>        <li id="ul0002-0027" num="0049">PEG-MAL: poly(ethylene glycol) maleimide</li>        <li id="ul0002-0028" num="0050">PEG-NH2: poly(ethylene glycol) amine</li>        <li id="ul0002-0029" num="0051">PEG-SH: poly(ethylene glycol) thiol</li>        <li id="ul0002-0030" num="0052">PET: positron emission tomography</li>        <li id="ul0002-0031" num="0053">PLGA: poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)</li>        <li id="ul0002-0032" num="0054">TEA: Triethylamine</li>        <li id="ul0002-0033" num="0055">TFA: trifluoroacetic acid</li>        <li id="ul0002-0034" num="0056">TG: trochlear groove</li>        <li id="ul0002-0035" num="0057">TGF-&#x3b2;: transforming growth factor beta</li>        <li id="ul0002-0036" num="0058">TNBSA: 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0059">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the presently disclosed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0060">While the following terms are believed to be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the following definitions are set forth to facilitate explanation of the presently disclosed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0061">All technical and scientific terms used herein, unless otherwise defined below, are intended to have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

In some embodiments, the MAP scaffolds and/or microporous gel systems can be used to treat bone and/or cartilage defects, diseases, disorders, or conditions such as but not limited to osteoarthritis.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0074">In some embodiments, the compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter comprise at least two components: a first component comprising at least one sub-population of soft hydrogel microparticles and a second component comprising at least one sub-population of stiff hydrogel microparticles. As used herein, the term &#x201c;soft hydrogel&#x201d; refers to a hydrogel having a Young's modulus of less than 50 kPa. As used herein, the term &#x201c;stiff hydrogel&#x201d; refers to a hydrogel with a Young's modulus of greater than 90 kPa. Methods for measuring the Young's modulus of a hydrogel are known in the art (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 9,447,381, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) and are described herein, such as in the EXAMPLES.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0075">The relative amounts of the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population and the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population can vary in the composition, depending in some embodiments on the end use planned for the compositions. By way of example and not limitation, in some embodiments the volume of the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population present in the composition is in a ratio of 1:10-1:3 with respect to the volume of the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population in the composition.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0076">In some embodiments, the soft hydrogel and the stiff hydrogel are combined, and the microparticles that make up the hydrogels are annealed (in some embodiments, crosslinked) to form the MAP scaffolds and/or microporous gel systems. While not wishing to be limited by any particular theory of operation, the mixing soft and stiff microparticles permits the annealing event that bonds the microparticles together (and thus the construction of the scaffold) to happen. Importantly, if only stiff microparticles (which match the mechanical environment and needed mechanical signaling for these tissues) alone are employed, it has been determined that they do not anneal to one another effectively. This might be due to them not deforming adequately to provide a sufficient surface area for formation of linkages between microparticles.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0077">Additionally, if only soft microparticles are employed, they will anneal but the desired mechanical signaling environment needed for matching cartilage and promoting chondrogenesis is not generated. Accordingly, the use of both soft and stiff microparticles together has been found to provide the unexpected benefit that both the desired scaffolding as well as the desired mechanical signaling environment can be generated.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0078">Thus, in some embodiments the composition further comprises an annealing initiator to facilitate annealing/crosslinking of the microparticles. In some embodiments, the annealing initiator is selected from the group consisting of a photoinitiator (which can in some embodiments be Eosin-Y and/or lithium phenyl-(2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl) phosphinate; LAP), although other crosslinkers can be employed based on the functionality employed to effectuate the crosslinking. By way of example and not limitation, small molecule crosslinkers, soluble crosslinkers, heat-activated crosslinkers, spontaneous radical generating crosslinker combinations (including but not limited to ammonium persulfate and tetramethylethylenediamine), and enzymatic crosslinkers (such as but not limited to Factor XIII) can be employed, provided that the annealing initiator facilitates annealing of the at least one soft hydrogel and the at least one stiff hydrogel to form a microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffold.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0079">In a non-limiting example, in some embodiments both the at least one sub-population of soft hydrogel microparticles and at least one sub-population of stiff hydrogel microparticles comprise one or more methacrylamide functionalities that permit inter-microparticle surface chemical annealing of at least one soft hydrogel microparticle and at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle to create a microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffold.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0080">The microparticles employed can have any backbone structure, provided that the soft hydrogel is a hydrogel having a Young's modulus of less than 50 kPa and the stiff hydrogel is a hydrogel with a Young's modulus of greater than 90 kPa. Exemplary materials upon which the hydrogels can be based are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2016/0279283, 2017/0368224, 2018/0078671, and 2019/0151497, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. By way of example and not limitation, the hydrogel microparticles can be made from a hydrophilic polymer, amphiphilic polymer, synthetic or natural polymer (e.g., poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(propylene glycol), poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate), hyaluronic acid (HA), gelatin, fibrin, chitosan, heparin, heparan, and synthetic versions of HA, gelatin, fibrin, chitosan, heparin, or heparan). In some embodiments, the hydrogel microparticles are made from any natural (e.g., modified HA) or synthetic polymer (e.g., PEG) capable of forming a hydrogel. In some embodiments, a polymeric network and/or any other support network capable of forming a solid hydrogel construct may be used. Suitable support materials for most tissue engineering/regenerative medicine applications are generally biocompatible and preferably biodegradable. Examples of suitable biocompatible and biodegradable supports include: natural polymeric carbohydrates and their synthetically modified, crosslinked, or substituted derivatives, such as gelatin, agar, agarose, crosslinked alginic acid, chitin, substituted and cross-linked guar gums, cellulose esters, especially with nitrous acids and carboxylic acids, mixed cellulose esters, and cellulose ethers; natural polymers containing nitrogen, such as proteins and derivatives, including cross-linked or modified gelatins, and keratins; vinyl polymers such as poly(ethyleneglycol)acrylate/methacrylate/vinyl sulfone/maleimide/norbornene/allyl, polyacrylamides, polymethacrylates, copolymers and terpolymers of the above polycondensates, such as polyesters, polyamides, and other polymers, such as polyurethanes; and mixtures or copolymers of the above classes, such as graft copolymers obtained by initializing polymerization of synthetic polymers on a preexisting natural polymer. A variety of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers are available for use in therapeutic applications; examples include: polycaprolactone, polyglycolide, polylactide, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0081">In some embodiments, the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population, the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population, or both comprise a polyethylene glycol (PEG), optionally a PEG with an average molecular weight of 10 kiloDaltons (kDa). In some embodiments, the hydrogels are based on a four-arm PEG with about one arm of maleimide (which allows attachment to hydrogel chemical network backbone) and about three arms of methacrylamide to promote the polymerization/annealing reaction.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0082">In any of the embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, the degree to which the annealing/crosslinking occurs can be adjusted to create more or less crosslinking via adjustment of the parameters under which the annealing/crosslinking occurs.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0083">In addition to the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population, the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population, and the annealing initiator(s), the compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter can also include one or more additional active agents. By way of example and not limitation, the one or more additional active agents can be selected from the group consisting of a cell adhesive peptide, optionally an RGD-containing cell adhesive peptide, further optionally a peptide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of the amino acid sequence RGDSPGGC (SEQ ID NO: 1); chondroitin sulfate (CS), optionally thiolated CS, heparin, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0084">For example, in some embodiments the compositions further comprise mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), chondrocyte progenitor cells, chondrocyte primary cells as targets for cartilage, MSCs and/or osteocytes as targets for bone), one or more growth factors, including but not limited to BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7, PDGF, TGF-&#x3b2;, and combinations thereof. Heparin, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid are also examples of bioactive polymers that can be employed in the compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0085">IV. Methods for Making the Presently Disclosed Compositions</p><p id="p-0052" num="0086">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter also pertains to methods for generating microporous gel systems. General approaches to generating microporous gel systems are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2016/0279283, 2017/0368224, 2018/0078671, and 2019/0151497, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. However, the basic strategies disclosed in these patent application publications were found to be less applicable for use in treating bone and/or cartilage defects, and thus new strategies were developed as disclosed herein wherein at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population and at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population are combined in order to create microporous gel systems that are flowable prior to annealing for ease of introduction into bone and/or cartilage spaces, and once annealed can provide a stable structure that is retained in the bone and/or cartilage spaces and in some embodiments provide a scaffold onto which a subject's cells can migrate and/or adhere in order to treating and/or prevent bone and/or cartilage defects. It was determined that the use of both soft and stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-populations in appropriate ratios could provide the desired characteristics.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0087">Thus, in some embodiments the methods comprise combining at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population and at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population to create a mixture; and annealing the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population and the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population in the mixture, whereby a microporous gel system is generated. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population&#x201d; refers to a hydrogel microparticle sub-population wherein the microparticles are characterized by a Young's modulus of less than 50 kPa. Exemplary Young's moduli for a soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population include less than about 10 kPa, in some embodiments less than about 15 kPa, in some embodiments less than about 20 kPa, in some embodiments less than about 25 kPa, in some embodiments less than about 30 kPa, in some embodiments less than about 35 kPa, in some embodiments less than about 40 kPa, in some embodiments less than about 45 kPa, and in some embodiments less than about 50 kPa. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population&#x201d; refers to a hydrogel microparticle sub-population wherein the microparticles are characterized by a Young's modulus of greater than about 90 kPa. Exemplary Young's moduli for a stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population include greater than about 90 kPa, in some embodiments greater than about 95 kPa, and in some embodiments greater than about 100 kPa.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0088">The ratio of the soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population to the stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population can also influence the performance of the microporous gel system generated. In some embodiments, the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population is present in the mixture in a mass ratio of 1:10-1:3 to the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0089">In order to produce the microporous gel system, the desired amounts of soft and stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-populations and combined and annealed. Any method for annealing the soft and stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-populations can be employed. Exemplary annealing strategies are also disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2016/0279283, 2017/0368224, 2018/0078671, and 2019/0151497. By way of example and not limitation, in some embodiments the annealing is accomplished with an annealing initiator, optionally wherein the annealing initiator is selected from the group consisting of a photoinitiator (optionally Eosin-Y and/or lithium phenyl-(2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl) phosphinate; LAP), a small molecule crosslinker, a soluble crosslinker, a heat-activated crosslinker, a spontaneous radical generating crosslinker combination (optionally ammonium persulfate with tetramethylethylenediamine), and an enzymatic crosslinker (optionally Factor XIII).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0090">In some embodiments, the annealing can depend on the functionalities present in the soft and stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-populations. In a non-limiting example of the presently disclosed subject matter, in some embodiments both the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population and the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population comprise one or more methacrylamide functionalities that permit crosslinking of the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population and the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population in order to generate the microporous gel system.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0091">The at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population and the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population can be based on any scaffold structure, including but not limited to PEG, hyaluronic acid, and/or collagen. PEG, hyaluronic acid, collagen, or other scaffold structures can be employed as desired, provided that the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population and the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population comprises microparticles characterized by a Young's modulus of less than about 50 kPa and the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population comprises microparticles characterized by a Young's modulus of greater than about 90 kPa.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0092">In some embodiments, the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population, the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population, or both comprise a polyethylene glycol, optionally a PEG with an average molecular weight of 10 kiloDaltons (kDa).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0093">In some embodiments, the methacrylamide functionalities are provided by a four-arm PEG molecule, wherein the four-arm PEG molecule comprises about one arm of maleimide to facilitate attachment to a chemical network backbone of the at least one soft hydrogel microparticle sub-population and the at least one stiff hydrogel microparticle sub-population, and about three arms of methacrylamide to promote polymerization and/or annealing of the microporous gel system.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0094">In some embodiments, additional active agents, such as but not limited to cell attractants, cell adhesion enhancers, and/or other bioactive molecules can be included in the at least one soft hydrogel, the at least one stiff hydrogel, or both, as desired. Thus, in some embodiments the at least one soft hydrogel, the at least one stiff hydrogel, or both can further comprise one or more additional active agents, wherein the one or more additional active agents are optionally selected from the group consisting of a cell adhesive peptide, optionally an RGD-containing cell adhesive peptide, further optionally a peptide comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of the amino acid sequence RGDSPGGC (SEQ ID NO: 1). Other actives that can be employed include, but are not limited to chondroitin sulfate (CS), optionally thiolated CS, heparin, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0095">V. Treatment and/or Prevention Methods for Using the Presently Disclosed Compositions</p><p id="p-0062" num="0096">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter also relates to methods for treating and/or preventing bone and/or cartilage defects, disorders, and/or conditions using the compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter. Thus, in some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter pertains to methods for treating a bone and/or cartilage defects, disorders, and/or conditions in a subject in need thereof, in which the methods comprise introducing into a bone and/or cartilage defect a composition as disclosed herein in an amount and via a route sufficient to substantially or completely fill the bone and/or cartilage defect, and annealing the at least one soft hydrogel and the at least one stiff hydrogel present in the composition such that a microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffold is produced in the bone and/or cartilage defect in order to treat and/or prevent a bone and/or cartilage defect, disorder, and/or condition in the subject. In some embodiments, the MAP scaffold persists in the bone and/or cartilage defect for a time sufficient for host cell migration into the bone and/or cartilage defect to occur. In some embodiments, the bone and/or cartilage defect is present in a knee, elbow, or wrist of the subject. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed composition is injected into the bone and/or cartilage defect in the subject, optionally wherein the injection is carried out arthroscopically. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed composition induces glycosoaminoglycan expression within the MAP scaffold in the subject. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed composition introduced into the bone and/or cartilage defect induces little or no inflammatory response to the MAP scaffold in the subject.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0097">Once introduced into a bone and/or cartilage defect, the MAP scaffold is generated by annealing the at least one soft hydrogel and the at least one stiff hydrogel present in the composition. Strategies for annealing the at least one soft hydrogel and the at least one stiff hydrogel are disclosed herein. In those embodiments, the annealing strategy employed can take into account the fact that the annealing occurs in vivo in the body of a subject, and thus should employ annealing enhancers that are pharmaceutically acceptable for use in vivo, including but not limited to in vivo in a human. Thus, in some embodiments the annealing strategy employs a light-sensitive annealing initiator such as but not limited to Eosin-Y and/or lithium phenyl-(2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl) phosphinate (LAP) and exposure of the introduced composition of the presently disclosed subject matter to light of an appropriate wavelength, intensity, and duration to produce the MAP scaffold.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0098">In some embodiments, of the presently disclosed methods, the bone and/or cartilage defect is associated with osteoarthritis in the subject or is created in the subject in order to provide a space into which a composition of the presently disclosed subject matter can be introduced to treat the osteoarthritis. As such, in some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter pertains to methods comprising introducing into a bone and/or cartilage space associated with osteoarthritis or created in the subject to treat the osteoarthritis a composition of the presently disclosed subject matter in an amount sufficient to substantially or completely fill the bone and/or cartilage space, and annealing the at least one soft hydrogel and the at least one stiff hydrogel present in the composition such that a microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffold is produced in the bone and/or cartilage space.

The gel was found to fill the defect and the gel demonstrated object permanence with maintenance of its structure and position up to the 8 week time point. Of note, in control treated cartilage defects without treatment with MAP gel, the osteochondral defects appeared to contract and fill with scar and subchondral bone.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0146">Histologic evaluation showed the lack of an inflammatory response to the MAP gel and excellent tissue integration (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>). Glycosaminoglycan rich tissue, found in cartilage, was also noted to migrate across the surface of the MAP gel, which could signify a re-establishment of the previously damaged articular cartilage across the defect (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0147">It is unclear at this time the clinical significance of the MAP gel maintaining the width and depth of the osteochondral defect; however, it is hypothesized that this feature allows the MAP gel to provide a stable scaffold for more organized deposition of host tissue. However, definitive cartilaginous ingrowth within the gel has not been absolutely confirmed on histologic evaluation. Nonetheless, the presently disclosed subject matter successfully demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing a base formulation of a MAP gel that provide a stiffness matched to articular cartilage as an effective scaffold in an osteochondral defect. The &#x201c;plug and play&#x201d; nature of the MAP gel provides the option of further tuning the mechanical properties and to incorporate key signaling extracellular cellular matrix components, cytokines, growth factors, and cells, such as chondroitin sulfate, TGF-&#x3b2;, and mesenchymal stem cells, or chondrocytes to promote cartilaginous ingrowth and augment its efficacy.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0148">A major limitation of biomaterial-based approaches to cartilage regeneration to date is lack of mechanical integration. A benefit to this porous biomaterial is an accelerated window of tissue-biomaterial integration, which is illustrated by maintenance of the gel within the osteochondral defect with host tissue deposition at the 8 week time point as disclosed herein. Additionally, current approaches to cartilage regeneration (osteochondral allograft transplantation) and surgical management of end-stage wrist arthritis (arthroplasty or arthrodesis) necessitate open approaches to the joint. With these open approaches, there is morbidity associated with violation of the joint capsule including discomfort, bleeding, and scar formation. MAP is the first flowable porous biomaterial scaffold, making it an ideal candidate for arthroscopic procedures (e.g. wrist arthritis treatment), which represents a fundamental change in the approach to cartilage replacement or reconstruction.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0149">Summarily, disclosed herein is the demonstration of successful delivery of an injectable, flowable MAP gel scaffold into a rat knee osteochondral defect with subsequent annealing and stable positioning. The flowable nature of this scaffold allowed for minimally invasive application, for example via an arthroscopic approach for management of wrist arthritis. The MAP gel was noted to fill the osteochondral defect and maintain the defect dimensions, suggesting its ability to provide a stable scaffold for tissue ingrowth. The MAP gel did not elicit a chronic inflammatory response and maintained a structurally smooth surface that allowed for GAG-rich tissue to migrate across. Thus, the presently disclosed demonstration of feasibility provides opportunity for optimized MAP gel formulations to promote the healing of articular cartilage and increase the treatment options for patients with osteoarthritis.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0150">The references listed below as well as all references cited in the specification are incorporated herein by reference to the extent that they supplement, explain, provide a background for or teach methodology, techniques and/or compositions employed herein.
