Typically, two mounts are fixedly mounted to the opposed sides of the adjacent frame, with each mount including a cupped portion or rod cradle for receiving the opposed ends of the curtain/drapery rod. To install the ends of the rod within each rod cradle, the rod must typically be positioned vertically above the rod cradles (e.g., at a location between the rod mounts and the top of the frame to allow the rod to vertically clear the cradles) and subsequently lowered down into the cradles. Unfortunately, when such an installation technique is required for inserting the rod into the rod cradles, the rod mounts must be mounted to the sides of the frame a sufficient distance below the top of the frame to allow the rod to be inserted above and clear the rod cradles. As a result, a significant gap typically exists between the rod and the top of the frame, which results in the associated curtain or drapery being supported lower within the frame. In addition to the potential for creating significant light gaps, such a lowered position of the covering within the frame is often aesthetically undesirable to a consumer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, an improved mount assembly for mounting a covering rod, such as curtain or drapery rod, relative to an architectural structure would be welcomed in the technology.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In various aspects, the present disclosure is directed to an adjustable mount assembly for mounting a covering rod relative to an adjacent architectural structure.

Specifically, in several embodiments, the rod mount assembly may include a base plate having an inner side and an outer side opposite the inner side. In addition, the rod mount may include a rod cradle extending outwardly from the outer side of the base plate, with the rod mount being rotatable about a mount axis to adjust a circumferential position of the rod cradle. The mount assembly may also include an engagement member supported relative to the rod mount such that the engagement member is configured to engage at least a portion of the rod mount as the mount is rotated relative to the engagement member about the mount axis.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In several embodiments, the engagement member may be configured to engage corresponding engagement features of the rod mount as the mount is being rotated relative to the engagement member about the mount axis. For instance, in one embodiment, the engagement member may be configured to be selectively engaged with circumferentially spaced engagement features spaced apart along a portion of the rod mount. In such an embodiment, the circumferential spacing of the engagement features may be selected, for example, so that the engagement member is engaged with a respective engagement feature of the rod mount when the circumferential position of the rod cradle is disposed at one of a plurality of pre-defined circumferential positions set for the rod cradle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Specifically, in one embodiment, the rod mount may be configured to be rotated relative to the engagement member to re-orient or re-position the rod cradle to any number of circumferential positions to facilitate, for instance, installation (or removal) of the rod relative to the rod cradle and/or to provide a desired aesthetic or appearance for the disclosed mounting structure. For instance, as will be described in detail below, such rotatability of the rod mount may allow the rod cradle to be re-oriented to a circumferential position that allows the rod to be inserted and removed from the cradle despite the cradle being mounted a distance away from the top of the adjacent frame of the architectural structure that is less than the diameter of the rod. As such, the associated covering (e.g., a curtain or drapery) configured to be suspended from rod may be disposed at a higher position relative to the adjacent architectural structure, which may provide the covering with an improved aesthetic appearance and may also reduce or minimize any light gaps.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It should also be understood that, as described herein, an &#x201c;embodiment&#x201d; (such as illustrated in the accompanying Figures) may refer to an illustrative representation of an environment or article or component in which a disclosed concept or feature may be provided or embodied, or to the representation of a manner in which just the concept or feature may be provided or embodied. However, such illustrated embodiments are to be understood as examples (unless otherwise stated), and other manners of embodying the described concepts or features, such as may be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art upon learning the concepts or features from the present disclosure, are within the scope of the disclosure. In addition, it will be appreciated that while the Figures may show one or more embodiments of concepts or features together in a single embodiment of an environment, article, or component incorporating such concepts or features, such concepts or features are to be understood (unless otherwise specified) as independent of and separate from one another and are shown together for the sake of convenience and without intent to limit to being present or used together. Independent concepts can be used in any configuration as may be appreciated by one ordinary skill in the art. For instance, concepts or features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used separately, or with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present disclosure covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate one embodiment of a mounting system <b>100</b> for mounting a covering (indicted by dashed lines <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) relative to an adjacent architectural structure <b>104</b>. In general, the mounting system <b>100</b> may be configured to be installed relative to a window, door, or any other suitable architectural structure, to allow a covering <b>102</b> to be supported or suspended relative to the architectural structure <b>104</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the mounting system <b>100</b> is shown as being installed relative to a frame <b>106</b> of an architectural structure <b>104</b>, such as a window frame or a door frame. However, it should be understood that the disclosed mounting system <b>100</b> is not limited in its particular use as mounting structure for a window or door covering, and may be used in any application in association with a covering <b>102</b> configured to be installed relative to and/or within any type of architectural structure <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the mounting system <b>100</b> includes a covering rod <b>120</b> and opposed rod mount assemblies <b>150</b> configured to support the rod <b>120</b> relative to the adjacent architectural structure <b>104</b>. Specifically, the covering rod <b>120</b> may extend in a lateral direction (indicted by arrow L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) between a first end <b>122</b> of the rod <b>120</b> and a second end <b>124</b> of the rod <b>120</b>, with each rod end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> configured to be supported relative to the adjacent architectural structure <b>104</b> by a respective rod mount assembly <b>150</b>. As such, when supported at its opposed ends <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> by the rod mount assemblies <b>150</b>, the covering rod <b>120</b> may, in turn, support a covering <b>102</b>, such as a curtain, drapery, shade, and/or any other suitable covering panel or fabric, relative to the architectural structure <b>104</b>. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, suitable attachment structure <b>108</b>, such as rings, clips, carriers, and/or the like, may be slidably or movably coupled to the covering rod <b>120</b> to allow an associated covering <b>102</b> to be suspended from the rod <b>120</b>. Such attachment structure <b>108</b> may allow the covering <b>102</b> to be moved relative to the covering rod <b>120</b>, for example, between an opened position, at which the adjacent architectural structure <b>104</b> is exposed, and a closed position, at which the adjacent architectural structure <b>104</b> is covered.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, in several embodiments, the rod mount assemblies <b>150</b> may correspond to inside mount assemblies configured to be mounted within the inside of the frame <b>106</b> of the adjacent architectural structure <b>104</b>. Specifically, in the illustrated embodiment, each rod mount assembly <b>150</b> is coupled to the inner side of a respective sidewall <b>110</b> of the frame <b>106</b> at a location adjacent to a top wall <b>112</b> of the frame <b>106</b> such that the rod mount assemblies <b>150</b> are configured to support the opposed ends <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the covering rod <b>120</b> at opposed upper corners <b>114</b> of the frame <b>106</b>. For instance, as particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each rod mount assembly <b>150</b> is installed relative to a respective upper corner <b>114</b> of the frame <b>106</b> such that the covering rod <b>120</b> is supported a vertical distance <b>126</b> below the top wall <b>112</b> of the frame <b>106</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, the disclosed rod mount assemblies <b>150</b> may allow for such vertical distance <b>126</b> to be minimized, thereby permitting the associated covering <b>102</b> to be suspended at a higher position relative to the adjacent architectural structure <b>104</b> to reduce or minimize any light gaps.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In several embodiments, each mount assembly <b>150</b> includes a rod mount <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) configured to be secured or coupled to the adjacent wall <b>110</b> of the frame <b>106</b> (e.g., via one or more fasteners) to allow the rod mount <b>152</b> to support the adjacent end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the covering rod <b>120</b> relative to the architectural structure <b>104</b>. For instance, as particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the rod mount <b>152</b> includes a base or mounting plate <b>160</b> configured to be mounted or secured to the frame <b>106</b> and a rod support or cradle <b>180</b> extending outwardly from the mounting plate <b>160</b> for supporting the adjacent end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the covering rod <b>120</b>. For instance, the rod cradle <b>180</b> may have an arcuate or curved profile defining a semi-circular or &#x201c;U-shaped&#x201d; channel <b>182</b> for receiving the adjacent rod end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. As such, a portion of the adjacent end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the covering rod <b>120</b> may nest within the rod cradle <b>180</b> when the rod <b>20</b> is installed relative to the rod mount assembly <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter, each rod mount <b>152</b> may configured to be pivotably or rotatably coupled to the adjacent wall <b>110</b> of the frame <b>106</b> to allow the circumferential orientation of the rod mount <b>152</b> to be adjusted and, in particular, to allow the circumferential position of the associated rod cradle <b>180</b> to be adjusted relative to the frame <b>106</b>. Specifically, in several embodiments, the rod mount <b>152</b> may be rotatable about a mount axis <b>154</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) relative to the frame <b>106</b> to rotate the rod cradle <b>180</b> through an angular range of circumferential positions. For instance, in the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the rod cradle <b>180</b> is shown as being disposed at a central or &#x201c;support&#x201d; position at which an open end <b>184</b> of the rod channel <b>182</b> defined by the cradle <b>180</b> faces vertically upwardly such that cradle <b>180</b> wraps circumferentially around a lower portion of the rod <b>120</b>. As will be described below, each rod mount <b>152</b> may be rotated from the support position relative to the frame <b>106</b> in both a first rotational direction (indicated by arrow <b>156</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and an opposed second rotational direction (indicated by arrow <b>158</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to any number of circumferential positions to facilitate, for instance, installation (or removal) of the ends <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the rod <b>120</b> relative to the rod cradles <b>180</b> and/or to provide a desired aesthetic or appearance for the disclosed mounting system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, as indicted above, the disclosed rod mount assemblies <b>150</b> may be configured to allow the covering rod <b>120</b> to be supported in close proximity to the top wall <b>112</b> of the frame <b>106</b> of the adjacent architectural structure <b>104</b> (e.g., by minimizing vertical distance <b>126</b>). In doing so, when the rod cradle <b>180</b> is in the support position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the open end <b>184</b> of the rod channel <b>182</b> may be spaced apart from the top wall <b>112</b> of the frame <b>106</b> by a distance <b>185</b> that is, for example, less than a diameter <b>128</b> of the covering rod <b>120</b>. In such instance, each rod mount <b>152</b> may be rotated relative to the frame <b>106</b> (e.g., in the first rotational direction <b>156</b>) to adjust the orientation of the rod cradle <b>180</b> from the upward facing orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to an inward facing orientation (e.g., inwardly towards the interior of the adjacent room) to allow each rod end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> to be inserted into (and removed from) its respective rod cradle <b>180</b>. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates one of the rod mounts <b>152</b> after it has been rotated in the first rotational direction <b>156</b> relative to the adjacent frame <b>106</b> about the mount axis <b>154</b> from the support position to an &#x201c;installation&#x201d; position at which the rod channel <b>182</b> faces inwardly towards the interior of the room. Specifically, the rod cradle <b>180</b> has been pivoted downwardly (e.g., towards the interior of the room and away from the adjacent architectural structure) such that a vertical gap <b>186</b> is defined between the open end <b>184</b> of rod channel <b>182</b> and the top wall <b>112</b> of the frame <b>106</b> that is greater than the diameter <b>128</b> of the covering rod <b>120</b>. As a result, the adjacent end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the covering rod <b>120</b> can be quickly and easily installed into (or removed from) the rod cradle <b>180</b>. Once each end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the rod <b>120</b> has been installed within its respective rod cradle <b>180</b>, the rod mounts <b>152</b> may then be rotated, for example, in the opposite direction (e.g., the second rotational direction <b>158</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>)) back to the support position to allow the rod <b>120</b> to be retained relative to the rod mounts <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition to facilitating installation and removal of the rod <b>120</b> relative to the rod mount assemblies <b>150</b>, the ability to rotate the rod mounts <b>152</b> relative to both the frame <b>106</b> and the rod <b>120</b> (as installed therein) may also allow the appearance or aesthetic of the rod mounting configuration to be varied, such as by allowing each rod end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> to be hidden or concealed by the adjacent rod mount <b>152</b>. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, with the rod cradle <b>180</b> in the support position, an upper portion of the rod end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> extends above the open end <b>184</b> of the rod cradle <b>180</b>, and, thus, is visible from the interior of the room. However, by rotating the rod mount <b>152</b> relative to the frame <b>106</b> (e.g., in the second rotational direction <b>158</b>), the orientation of the rod cradle <b>180</b> may be adjusted from the upward facing orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to an outwardly facing orientation (e.g., away the interior of the room and towards the adjacent architectural structure <b>104</b>) to allow the cradle <b>180</b> to conceal or hide the rod end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates one of the rod mounts <b>152</b> after it has been rotated relative to the frame <b>106</b> in the second rotational direction <b>158</b> from the support position to a &#x201c;cover&#x201d; position at which the rod cradle <b>180</b> extends vertically across and covers or substantially covers the adjacent rod end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>.

Thus, with the mounting plate <b>160</b> secured to the frame <b>106</b> of the architectural structure, the end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of covering rod <b>120</b> may be installed within the rod cradle <b>180</b> to allow the rod <b>120</b> to be supported relative to the architectural structure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Additionally, in accordance with aspect of the present subject matter, the rod mount assembly <b>150</b> may also include an engagement member (e.g., a detent plunger <b>200</b>) configured to engage a portion of rod mount <b>152</b> as the mount <b>152</b> is being rotated to adjust the circumferential orientation or positioning of the rod cradle <b>180</b>. Specifically, as will be described below, the engagement member may be configured to engage corresponding engagement features of the rod mount <b>152</b> as the mount <b>152</b> is being rotated relative to the engagement member. For instance, in several embodiments, the engagement member may be configured to be selectively engaged with circumferentially spaced engagement features spaced apart along a portion of the rod mount <b>152</b> (e.g., the mounting plate <b>160</b>). In such an embodiment, the circumferential spacing of the engagement features may be selected, for example, such that the engagement member is engaged with a respective engagement feature of the rod mount <b>152</b> when the rod cradle <b>180</b> is disposed at one of a plurality of pre-defined circumferential positions (e.g., the support, installation, and cover positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the mounting plate <b>160</b> of the rod mount <b>152</b> includes an inner side <b>161</b> and an opposed outer side <b>162</b>, with the inner side <b>161</b> defining an inner face <b>163</b> of the mounting plate <b>160</b> and the outer side <b>162</b> defining an outer face <b>164</b> of the mounting plate <b>160</b>.

Such mounting of the rod mount <b>152</b> may be used, for instance, when it is desired to have a fixed rod mount configuration as opposed to the rotatable rod mount configuration described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As indicated above, the rod mount assembly <b>150</b> may also include an engagement member configured to engage a portion of rod mount <b>152</b> as the mount <b>152</b> is being rotated about the mount axis <b>154</b> to adjust the circumferential orientation or positioning of the rod cradle <b>180</b>. In several embodiments, the engagement member may correspond to a detent plunger <b>200</b> configured to be installed or positioned adjacent to the outer side <b>162</b> of the mounting plate <b>160</b> of the rod mount <b>152</b>.

For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the rod mount <b>152</b> includes three circumferentially spaced detent channels <b>172</b>A, <b>172</b>B, <b>172</b>C defined within the circumferential engagement slot <b>167</b> such that each detent channel <b>172</b> is recessed relative to the inner engagement surface <b>168</b> of the slot <b>167</b>. In such an embodiment, a portion of the plunger <b>200</b> may be configured to be selectively received within each detect channel <b>172</b> as such channel <b>172</b> is rotated into alignment with the plunger <b>200</b> during rotation of the rod mount <b>152</b>. For instance, as indicated above, the detent ball <b>210</b> of the plunger <b>200</b> may be compressed against the inner engagement surface <b>168</b> of the engagement slot <b>167</b> as the rod mount <b>152</b> is rotated relative to the plunger <b>200</b>. However, as one of the detent channels <b>172</b> is moved into alignment with the plunger <b>200</b>, the detent ball <b>210</b> may be pushed outwardly relative to the cartridge <b>212</b> (e.g., via the action of the spring <b>214</b>) and into the aligned detent channel <b>172</b>. Such engagement of the detent ball <b>210</b> within the aligned detent channel <b>172</b> may provide a retention force or a given amount of friction against the rod mount <b>152</b> that serves to retain the rod mount <b>152</b> at the associated circumferential position relative to the plunger <b>200</b>. For instance, the friction applied against the rod mount <b>152</b> may be sufficient to prevent the rod mount <b>152</b> from being inadvertently or unintentionally rotated relative to the plunger <b>200</b>. In such instance, an installer or user of the disclosed rod mount assembly <b>150</b> may be required to rotate the rod mount <b>152</b> with sufficient force to overcome the friction and allow the aligned detent channel <b>172</b> to be moved past the detent ball <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In several embodiments, the circumferential spacing of the detent channels <b>172</b> may be selected to allow the plunger <b>200</b> to be engaged or received within each channel <b>172</b> when the rod mount <b>152</b> is disposed at a predetermined or desired circumferential position relative to the plunger <b>200</b>. For example, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, it may be desirable to rotate the rod mount <b>152</b> to re-orient or re-position the rod cradle <b>180</b> to one of a plurality of different circumferential positions, such as the central or rod &#x201c;support&#x201d; position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the rod &#x201c;installation&#x201d; position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and the rod &#x201c;cover&#x201d; position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Thus, in one embodiment, the circumferential spacing of the detent channels <b>172</b> may be selected so that the plunger <b>200</b> is received within one of the detent channels <b>172</b> at each of such circumferential positions. For instance, one of the detent channels <b>172</b> may correspond to a central detent channel <b>172</b>A within which the detent ball <b>210</b> is configured to be received when the rod cradle <b>180</b> is disposed at its rod support position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In such an embodiment, the other two detent channels (e.g., a first side detent channel <b>172</b>B and a second side detent channel <b>172</b>C) may be spaced apart circumferentially along either side of the central detent channel <b>172</b>A such that, when the rod mount <b>152</b> is rotated in one direction or other to move the rod cradle <b>180</b> from the rod support position to either the rod installation position or the rod cover position, the plunger <b>200</b> is aligned with and received within the corresponding side detent channel <b>172</b>B, <b>172</b>C when the rod cradle <b>180</b> reaches the desired circumferential position. For instance, the first side detent channel <b>172</b>B may be spaced apart circumferentially from the central detent channel <b>172</b>A (e.g., approximately 45 degrees) such that, when the rod mount <b>152</b> is rotated in the first rotational direction <b>156</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to move the rod cradle <b>180</b> from the support position to the rod installation position, the plunger <b>200</b> is received within the first side detent channel <b>172</b>B when the rod cradle <b>180</b> reaches the rod installation position. Similarly, the second side detent channel <b>172</b>C may be spaced apart circumferentially from the central detent channel <b>172</b>A (e.g., approximately 45 degrees) such that, when the rod mount <b>152</b> is rotated in the second rotational direction <b>158</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to move the rod cradle <b>180</b> from the support position to the rod cover position, the plunger <b>200</b> is received within the second side detent channel <b>172</b>C when the rod cradle <b>180</b> reaches the rod cover position.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be appreciated that, although the rod mount <b>152</b> is shown in the illustrated embodiment as including three separate detent channels <b>172</b>, the rod mount <b>152</b> may generally be configured to include any suitable number of detent channels, such as two detent channels or four or more detent channels, to allow the rod mount assembly <b>150</b> to have a corresponding number of pre-defined circumferential positions for the rod cradle <b>180</b>. It should also be appreciated that, although the detent channels <b>172</b> are shown in the illustrated embodiment as being spaced apart circumferentially from one another by approximately 45 degrees, the circumferential spacing of the detent channels <b>172</b> may be varied or selected depending, for example, on the desired spacing between the pre-defined circumferential positions for the rod cradle <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should also be appreciated that, in one embodiment, the rod mount <b>152</b> may further include a detent opening <b>174</b> defined through the mounting plate <b>160</b> that is configured to be coaxially aligned with the center of the detent plunger <b>200</b> when the rod mount <b>152</b> is installed on the frame <b>106</b> relative to the plunger <b>200</b>. As such, the detent opening <b>174</b> may be used to ensure proper installation of the rod mount <b>152</b> and the detent plunger <b>200</b> relative to each other. For instance, with the rod mount <b>152</b> placed against the adjacent wall <b>110</b> of the frame <b>106</b> at the desired mounting location, the center of both the fastener opening <b>165</b> and the detent opening <b>174</b> may be marked on the wall <b>110</b>.

The fastener <b>190</b> may then be inserted through the fastener opening <b>165</b> and screwed into the wall <b>110</b> to secure the rod mount <b>152</b> to the frame <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, several views of another embodiment of a rod mount assembly <b>150</b>* suitable for use with the disclosed mounting system are illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> illustrate different perspective, exploded views of the rod mount assembly <b>150</b>*, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the rod mount assembly <b>150</b>* as installed relative to the frame <b>106</b> of an adjacent architectural structure, such as a cross-section taken from the same perspective as line VIII-VIII in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown, the rod mount assembly <b>150</b>* includes a rod mount <b>152</b>* configured to be secured or coupled to the frame <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) of an adjacent architectural structure to allow the rod mount <b>152</b>* to support an end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) of an associated covering rod <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) relative to the architectural structure. In general, the rod mount <b>152</b>* is configured the same as the rod mount <b>152</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b></figref>. For instance, the rod mount <b>152</b>* includes a mounting plate <b>160</b>* defining an inner side <b>161</b>* and an outer side <b>162</b>*, and a rod cradle <b>180</b>* extending outwardly from the outer side <b>162</b>* of the mounting plate <b>160</b>* for supporting the adjacent end <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the covering rod <b>120</b>. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, a fastener opening <b>165</b>* is defined through the mounting plate <b>160</b>* that extends along a mount axis <b>154</b>* of the rod mount <b>152</b>* for receiving a fastener <b>190</b>* (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) configured to couple the rod mount <b>152</b>* to the adjacent wall <b>110</b> of the frame <b>106</b>. An optional secondary fastener opening <b>166</b>* may also be defined through the mounting plate <b>160</b>* at a location offset from the mount axis <b>154</b>* for receiving a secondary fastener (not shown), such as when it is desired to rotationally fix the rod mount <b>152</b>* relative to the frame <b>106</b>. Moreover, as particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the rod mount <b>152</b>* defines a plurality of engagement features, such as a circumferential engagement slot <b>167</b>* and circumferentially spaced detent channels <b>172</b>* recessed relative to an inner engagement surface <b>168</b>* of the slot <b>167</b>*.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally, similar to the rod mount assembly <b>150</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the assembly <b>150</b>* includes an engagement member configured to engage or selectively engage one or more of the engagement features of the rod mount <b>152</b>* as the mount <b>152</b>* is being rotated to adjust the circumferential orientation or positioning of the rod cradle <b>180</b>*. However, unlike the plunger <b>200</b> described above, the engagement member is configured as an engagement plate <b>240</b>* configured to be positioned between the mounting plate <b>160</b>* of the rod mount <b>152</b>* and the adjacent wall <b>110</b> of the frame <b>106</b> when the rod mount assembly <b>150</b>* is installed relative to the associated architectural structure. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, the engagement plate <b>240</b>* has a similar configuration as the mounting plate <b>160</b>* of the rod mount <b>152</b>* and includes an inner side <b>242</b>* and an opposed outer side <b>244</b>*, with the inner side <b>242</b>* defining an inner face <b>246</b>* of the engagement plate <b>240</b>* and the outer side <b>244</b>* defining an outer face <b>248</b>* of the engagement plate <b>240</b>*. As particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the inner face <b>246</b>* of the engagement plate <b>240</b>* is generally configured to face towards and extend adjacent to the outer side <b>162</b>* of the mounting plate <b>160</b>* when the rod mount <b>152</b>* is installed relative to the engagement plate <b>240</b>*, while the outer face <b>248</b>* of the engagement plate <b>240</b>* is configured to face towards the adjacent wall <b>110</b> of the frame <b>106</b> on which the rod mount assembly <b>150</b>* is configured to be installed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Moreover, to facilitate engagement between the engagement plate <b>240</b>* and the engagement features of the rod mount <b>152</b>*, the engagement plate <b>240</b>* includes a detent projection <b>250</b>* extending outwardly from the inner face <b>246</b>* of the plate <b>240</b>*. In general, the detent projection <b>250</b>* may be configured to function the same as or similar to the detent ball <b>210</b> of the plunger <b>200</b> described above. For instance, with the engagement plate <b>240</b>* installed between the rod mount <b>152</b>* and the adjacent wall <b>110</b> of the frame <b>106</b>, the detent projection <b>250</b>* may be engaged with or compressed into the inner engagement surface <b>168</b>* of the engagement slot <b>167</b>* defined along the outer side <b>162</b>* of the mounting plate <b>160</b>* (e.g., due to the spring-like material properties of the engagement plate <b>240</b>*). Additionally, with rotation of the rod mount <b>152</b>* relative to the engagement plate <b>240</b>*, the detent projection <b>250</b>* may be configured to spring outwardly into or may otherwise be separately received within each of the detent channels <b>172</b>* of the rod mount <b>152</b>* as one of the detent channels <b>172</b>* is moved into alignment with the detent projection <b>250</b>*. Such engagement of the detent projection <b>250</b>* within the aligned detent channel <b>172</b>* may provide a retention force or friction against the rod mount <b>152</b>* that serves to retain the rod mount <b>152</b>* at the associated circumferential position relative to the engagement plate <b>240</b>*. Thus, similar to the rod mount assembly <b>150</b> described above, the rod mount assembly <b>150</b>* shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref> may allow for the rod mount <b>152</b>* to be quickly and easily rotated relative to the engagement plate <b>240</b>* to re-orient or re-position the rod cradle <b>180</b>* to one of the corresponding pre-defined circumferential positions associated with receipt of the detent projection <b>250</b>* into one of the detent channels <b>172</b>*.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, the engagement plate <b>240</b>* may also define a fastener opening <b>252</b>* configured to be aligned with the fastener opening <b>165</b>* of the mounting plate <b>160</b>* when the rod mount assembly <b>150</b>* is being installed relative to the frame <b>106</b> of the adjacent architectural structure. For instance, as particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a suitable fastener <b>190</b>* (e.g., a mounting screw) may be inserted through the aligned openings <b>165</b>*, <b>252</b>* to couple the rod mount <b>152</b>* and the engagement plate <b>240</b>* to the adjacent frame wall <b>110</b>. In doing so, the fastener <b>190</b>* may, for example, be configured to threadably engage the engagement plate <b>240</b>* (e.g., around the circumference of the fastener opening <b>252</b>*) while passing through the mounting plate <b>160</b>* without threadably engaging such plate <b>160</b>*. As a result, the rod mount <b>152</b>* may be rotated relative to the fastener <b>190</b>* about the mount axis <b>154</b>*, as desired, to adjust the circumferential positioning of the rod cradle <b>180</b>*. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, similar to the mounting plate <b>160</b>*, the engagement plate <b>240</b>* may, optimally, define a secondary fastener opening <b>254</b>* configured to receive a secondary fastener (not shown) when it is desired to rotationally fix the rod mount <b>152</b>* relative to the engagement plate <b>240</b>* and the adjacent wall <b>110</b> of the frame <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">While the foregoing Detailed Description and drawings represent various embodiments, it will be understood that various additions, modifications, and substitutions may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.
