According to some studies, the third most common reason for visiting an ophthalmologist's office is for dry eye disease symptoms. Recently it has been shown that up to 80% of dry eye cases also have a component called meibomian gland dysfunction or MGD. MGD is related to the absence of, or the severely reduced production of, tear film lipids.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Normally, the lipid layer produced by the meibomian (also expressed as Meibomian) glands spreads evenly into a thin (thickness in nanometers) protective film over the air-tear interface above the cornea. Every time a person blinks a slight amount of lipid protective film may be spread. However, there are many conditions under which this oily layer no longer spreads out evenly over the tear film and this process can be interrupted, reduced, or even stopped entirely. These root causes can include, but are not limited to, hormonal changes in the oil production properties with age, skin mites living in the eyelashes, prolonged infection such as difficult to remove sties, general inflammation (Blepharitis), autoimmune diseases or allergic reactions, and more recently the inadequate blinking from excessive screen time known as computer vision syndrome. The absence of an outer protective lipid layer reduces the evaporation time for the tear film covering the eye leading to interrelated issues of inadequate production of tears and meibum.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the past mild MGD has been addressed by using warm compresses, eyelid cleansing compounds, and massaging the eyelids gently. However, these approaches have not been shown to clinically be effective in many severe dry eye cases.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, a better in-office ophthalmological treatment, known as LipiFlow&#xae;, has shown clinical promise. This treatment works by heating up the meibomian glands in the eyelids and melting the oils which have become clogged. As the eyelids are heated from the inside, heat is delivered directly to the meibomian gland. In addition, air bladders are used to simultaneously provide pulsating mechanical pressure which helps mechanically loosen clogged glands. However, LipiFlow&#xae; and other office procedures are still a highly invasive and costly procedure requiring an expert ophthalmologist. Furthermore, treatment may need to be repeated multiple times a year, and the eyes may need local anesthetic applied.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other known eye treatments include heating the outside of the eyelids using heating pads. In this type of procedure, ophthalmologists still typically use forceps with an intermediate pressure to effectively exercise the glands. In addition, since an office visit is typically required to visit a health care professional, such treatments remain costly.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some treatments for aqueous deficient dry eye (ADDE) syndrome include application of various types of artificial tears or pharmaceutical-based treatments. Recently, an effective intranasal electroceutical stimulator for dry eye treatment, called TrueTear, was brought to the market.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure advantageously describes devices, systems, and methods for treating dry eye. The present disclosure presents novel electroceutical treatments and devices to the existing portfolio of dry eye therapies.

of promoting an understanding of the principles of the present disclosure, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and specific language will be used to describe the same. It is nevertheless understood that no limitation to the scope of the disclosure is intended. Any alterations and further modifications to the described devices, systems, and methods, and any further application of the principles of the present disclosure are fully contemplated and included within the present disclosure as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the disclosure relates. In particular, it is fully contemplated that the features, components, and/or steps described with respect to one embodiment may be combined with the features, components, and/or steps described with respect to other embodiments of the present disclosure. For the sake of brevity, however, the numerous iterations of these combinations will not be described separately.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> present different views of portions of one or more typical human eyelids. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of an upper eyelid. An upper eyelid has a number of meibomian glands <b>110</b>, one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and a number of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Disclosed herein are devices for placement underneath the eyelid. The devices include one surface for facing the eyelid and another surface for facing the sclera. In some embodiments, the devices include electrodes configured to stimulate the sclera to induce a blink reflex and/or generate reflex tears. In some embodiments, the underlid devices include heating elements on the eyelid side to heat Meibomian glands in the eyelids to unclog glands and/or stimulate meibum. In some embodiments, the underlid devices further include magnetic materials responsive to an external magnet to engage the underlid device for massaging an eyelid and/or enhancing the heating of the eyelid. Underlid devices may include a combination of the aforementioned features.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates examples of underlid devices <b>200</b>. Each of the devices <b>200</b> is placed underneath an eyelid, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the outline of each device <b>200</b> as it resides underneath each eyelid, according to one positioning and embodiment of the device <b>200</b>. The devices <b>200</b> are designed to be worn by a user and to remain completely covered by an eyelid and underneath an eyelid, even when the eyelid is open as shown. In this embodiment, each device <b>200</b> is generally rectangularly shaped, but each device is not limited to this shape. The device <b>200</b> is configured to treat dry eye by applying heat to meibomian glands and/or applying a stimulation to the scleral and/or conjunctival surface as described further herein. As is well known, the sclera generally refers to the thick white layer that makes the white part of the eye while the conjunctiva generally refers to the thin layer that surrounds the entire eye except for the cornea. Heating meibomian glands assists with unclogging the glands so that oils within the glands flow onto the eye, and applying stimulation to the scleral and/or conjunctival surface assists with triggering the person to blink or produce reflex tears, each of which assist with treating dry eye disease. It is generally understood that discussion of stimulation of a sclera or scleral surface includes stimulation of a conjunctival surface overlaying the sclera.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The form factor of each device <b>200</b> is desirable relative to contact lenses because the device <b>200</b> covers substantially less surface area of the eye than a contact lens. Furthermore, a contact lens can aggravate dry eye because it interferes with the interaction between tears, oils produced by the meibomian glands and the eye itself. The device <b>200</b> does not have these drawbacks. Additionally, the device <b>200</b> beneficially is not in view of the user, so the device <b>200</b> does not negatively affect the user's eyesight in any way.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> present different views of an example underlid device <b>300</b>, which is an example embodiment of device <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> presents a view of a surface of the device <b>300</b> for opposing the sclera; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> presents a view of an opposing surface of the device <b>300</b> for opposing an eyelid; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> presents a cross-sectional side view of the device <b>300</b>. Generally, components shown in the view of the device <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> are used to stimulate a surface of the eye to stimulate blinking or reflex tears.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Beginning with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the scleral side of device <b>310</b> includes a number of stimulation electrodes <b>380</b>. The embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> includes 16 stimulation electrodes <b>380</b> as an illustrative and non-limiting example. However, generally the device <b>310</b> includes two or more stimulation electrodes, or four or more stimulation electrodes. The electrodes <b>380</b> provide neurostimulation of cold receptors or nociceptors on the scleral surface to produce reflex tearing. The stimulation waveform is designed to stay below the pain threshold but still produce reflex tearing. The device <b>310</b> may be covered by a material <b>385</b>, such as silicone elastomer or silicone hydrogel or Hydrogel, that is comfortable for a user when the device <b>310</b> is placed underneath, and against, an eyelid and against an eyeball. By using a plurality of electrodes, a patterned stimulation may be applied in which different electrodes or pairs or sets of electrodes are activated at different times to stimulate the sclera in different areas and orientations. The greater the number of electrodes, the greater the potential number of variations of stimulation patterns. In some embodiments, a periodic stimulation waveform is applied to the electrodes to generate blink rate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown, the device <b>300</b> may also include an antenna <b>350</b>. The antenna <b>350</b> as illustrated is configured as a loop antenna, but the antenna <b>350</b> generally can take any useful form for performing wireless charging via inductive wireless charging and/or for providing communications capability for the device <b>310</b>. The antenna <b>350</b> may reside on a surface of the device <b>310</b> or may reside inside the device <b>310</b>. The antenna <b>350</b> in this context may also be referred to as a wireless charging device. The wireless inductive charging occurs by coupling the antenna <b>350</b> to an external device that supplies energy to the device. The antenna <b>350</b> is coupled to the energy storage element <b>330</b> so that power received by the antenna is supplied to energy storage element <b>330</b> to charge energy storage element <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the device <b>300</b> may also include an integrated circuit (IC) <b>370</b> and/or an integrated passive device (IPD) <b>360</b>. In an embodiment, the IC <b>370</b> is configured to provide any combination of the following: power management (such as managing the energy storage element <b>330</b> or energy harvesting via wireless charging), blink sensing, blink timing, or scleral/bulbar conjunctiva surface neurostimulation for tear production and/or stimulating the blink reflex. The electrodes <b>380</b> may be controlled by the IC <b>370</b> to produce any known type of neurostimulation waveform, such as a waveform utilizing any effective combination of pulse width, pulse frequency, pulse amplitude, duty cycle, on time, and/or off time, etc. Antenna <b>350</b> is located on a surface or inside device <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Device <b>300</b> additionally includes energy storage element <b>330</b>, which stores energy for powering the device <b>300</b>. Examples of energy storage element <b>330</b> are a battery and a capacitor. Device <b>300</b> additionally includes two electrodes <b>340</b>. The electrodes <b>340</b> may be configured to sense the onset of a blink via, e.g., electromyography (EMG) or environmental impedance sensing to provide blink detection. For example, the electrodes may measure electric potential or voltage generated by a conjunctiva or other cells in the eyelid to detect the onset of a blink. The electrodes <b>340</b> may also, or alternatively, be configured to stimulate the eyelid muscles to cause a person to blink. For example, in some embodiments, IC <b>370</b> couples to electrodes <b>340</b> to provide both blink sensing and blink stimulation, taking one or more measurements from electrodes <b>340</b> to perform blink sensing and applying voltages or currents to electrodes to perform blink stimulation by stimulating the eyelid.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the device width <b>316</b> is about 4 millimeters (mm), and the device length <b>318</b> is about 12 mm. In some embodiments, the energy storage element <b>330</b> is a 7.5 mF super capacitor with dimensions of about 3.2 mm&#xd7;2.5 mm&#xd7;0.9 mm, the integrated circuit <b>370</b> has dimensions of about 1.2 mm&#xd7;1.2 mm&#xd7;0.08 mm, and the IPD <b>360</b> has dimensions of about 1.0 mm&#xd7;1.0 mm&#xd7;0.08 mm. These dimensions are exemplary and not intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Thus, the device <b>310</b> can be used to treat dry eye using electrodes <b>340</b> by performing blink stimulation, and/or treat dry eye using electrodes <b>380</b> to generate reflex tears or stimulate the eye surface to stimulate blinking.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Any pair of electrodes, such as electrodes <b>340</b>, can be used to measure tear osmolarity based on an impedance measurement, such as using impedance spectroscopy. For example, the impedance measurement can be performed with a potentiostat circuit (at DC), or can be swept across frequency with a frequency-adjustable sine wave from one electrode, and analyzed through phase and magnitude through the return from the other electrode. By measuring tear impedance to determine osmolarity, the device <b>300</b> can implement closed-loop treatment of dry eye. For example, if impedance measurements indicate that the eye needs treatment, the device <b>300</b> can apply heating and/or stimulation as discussed herein. Measurements from the electrodes are supplied to a processor, such as integrated circuit <b>370</b>, and the processor determines whether heating and/or stimulation should be applied based on the measurements. For example, if a measurement indicates that tear osmolarity exceeds a threshold, heating and/or electrode stimulation may be applied.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, a cross-sectional side view of the device <b>300</b> is presented.

The view of device <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is from the perspective of the eyelid. In other words, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> presents the eyelid facing portion of device <b>500</b>. The device <b>500</b> includes a number of heating elements <b>520</b>, examples of which are resistors or resistive heating elements. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> presents one embodiment with <b>24</b> heating elements <b>520</b> for illustrative purposes, but generally any number of heating elements are included in underlid device <b>500</b>. In some embodiments, the heating elements <b>520</b> are 100 ohm resistors.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, a cross-sectional side view of the device <b>500</b> is presented. Energy storage element <b>330</b>, heating elements <b>520</b>, and an overmold <b>385</b> are shown. Additionally, a heat reflector <b>590</b>, such as a Mylar heat reflector, is illustrated. The heat reflector <b>590</b> is designed to ensure the heat generated from resistive heating elements <b>520</b> does not cause harm to any portion of the human eye located on the opposing side of the device. The heat reflector <b>590</b> may form a layer within device <b>500</b> positioned between the heating elements <b>520</b> and a surface <b>595</b> configured to face a sclera of an eyeball. The heating elements <b>520</b> are positioned proximate to a second surface <b>596</b> of the device <b>500</b> configured to face an eyelid. The heating elements are positioned closer to the second surface <b>596</b> in order to facilitate heating of the eyelid. When power is supplied to heating elements <b>520</b>, the temperature of the heating elements <b>520</b> is increased. Heating elements <b>520</b> facilitate heat transfer to eyelid tissue facing the heating elements <b>520</b>. In some embodiments, power is supplied to heating elements <b>520</b> from energy storage element <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view from the underside of the device <b>500</b> placed between a lower eyelid <b>420</b> and the sclera of an eyeball <b>430</b>.

Consistent with the description above, the heating elements <b>520</b> are placed on the side facing the lower eyelid <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, underlid devices include heating elements but not electrodes, such as the device <b>500</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, and <b>6</b></figref>. In some embodiments, underlid devices include electrodes but not heating elements, such as the device <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C and <b>4</b></figref>. Depending on the desired application, underlid devices can be configured to provide only heating of meibomian glands using heating elements or only stimulation of the eye surface using electrodes. In some embodiments, underlid devices may include both electrodes and heating elements. Such a device is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional side view of a device <b>700</b> according to some aspects of the present disclosure. Features of the device <b>500</b> that are the same as described previously utilize the same numbering and are generally not described further. Device <b>700</b> includes electrodes <b>380</b>, heating elements <b>520</b>, and a heat reflector <b>590</b>, such as a Mylar heat reflector. The device includes a first surface configured to face an eyeball and a second surface configured to face an eyelid. A cross-section of the first surface is indicated as <b>795</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, and a cross-section of the second surface is indicated as <b>796</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view from the underside of the device <b>700</b> placed between a lower eyelid <b>420</b> and the sclera of an eyeball <b>430</b>.

Consistent with the description above, the heating elements <b>520</b> are placed on the side of the device <b>700</b> facing the lower eyelid <b>420</b>, and the electrodes are placed on the side of the device <b>700</b> facing the sclera <b>430</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">There are various potential use cases for underlid devices, such as those described herein. In one use case, the devices <b>200</b> are used together with an eyeglasses form factor <b>910</b>, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, an underlid device <b>200</b>, such as devices <b>300</b>, <b>500</b>, or <b>700</b> described previously, is placed underneath each eyelid of a person as shown. The outline of underlid devices <b>200</b> positioned underneath a person's eyelid are shown. The devices <b>200</b>, such as devices <b>300</b>, <b>500</b>, or <b>700</b>, are designed to be worn by a user and to remain completely covered by an eyelid and underneath an eyelid, even when the eyelid is open as shown.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The person also wears an associated eyeglass frame <b>910</b>. The frame <b>910</b> may include portions that reside over a person's ear (not shown), and the frame <b>910</b> may or may not include glass eyepieces. The frame <b>910</b> may be any sort of known eyeglass frame form factor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> thus illustrates a system for stimulating the human eye including one or more devices <b>200</b> and frame <b>910</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">However, the frame <b>910</b> may also contain electronics for operating the devices <b>200</b>. For example, the frame <b>910</b> may include a power transfer and communications coil, such as an antenna, for wirelessly coupling to a coil or antenna, such as antenna <b>350</b> discussed previously. Blink detection may be performed by the frame <b>910</b> via inward-facing infrared reflectometer or camera and communicated to the underlid device or using EMG or environmental impedance sensing electrodes on the underlid device <b>200</b> itself. The underlid devices <b>200</b> may or may not include energy storage elements, as energy for stimulation and/or heating may be supplied by the frame <b>910</b>. If the underlid devices <b>200</b> include energy storage elements, the frame <b>910</b> may charge the energy storage elements and/or supply energy as needed to the underlid devices.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each device <b>200</b> may perform blink sensing and energy harvesting monitoring. If there is sufficient power harvesting, and a blink is detected, the device <b>200</b> can activate the heating, via resistive heating elements, so that the heating can occur in sync with the eyelid blink. One reason to synchronize the heat with the blink is that due to limited power available to do the heating, the heat application works well to melt the waxy/oily lipid layer and &#x201c;de-clog&#x201d; the meibomian glands. The motion of a blink works naturally to eject meibum oil from the meibomian glands.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Instead of detecting when the blink occurs, in other embodiments, the electrodes on the eyelid side are utilized to stimulate the eyelid muscles prior to heat application to suggest, stimulate, or encourage a blink during heating. In some embodiments, an on-chip timer in the device <b>200</b> is utilized to make sure this does not happen too often or too slowly (use the same electrodes to sense average blink rate over a long time, when there is still insufficient harvested power to do a stimulation event). In addition or alternatively, a scleral side may be periodically stimulated via stimulation electrodes to cause natural tear production.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A second use case for devices <b>200</b> is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. This use case involves a system including one or more devices <b>200</b>, such as devices <b>300</b>, <b>500</b>, or <b>700</b> described previously, and handheld wand <b>1010</b>. Instead of a wand <b>1010</b>, the system may instead use a glove or finger cot. Regardless of whether a wand <b>1010</b> or glove or finger cot is used, each of which may be referred to as an external device, the external device in some embodiments includes a wireless power transfer coil at a fingertip to provide enough power to heat device <b>200</b> via resistive heating elements as discussed herein and also for communication with device <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Buttons on the external device, such as device <b>1010</b>, can be easily operated by the thumb to enable/disable heating, and/or to enable scleral stimulation for tear production. When the user feels his/her eyes are dry, he/she can bring the external device, such as device <b>1010</b>, on the other side of where the underlid device <b>200</b> is installed, and they can gently massage their eyelid. At the same time, they can also hold a button down on the external device, such as device <b>1010</b>, to enable heating. Because the distance between the power transfer coil on the external device and the underlid device is small, a lot of power can be transmitted for continuous heating. The continuous heating can happen during the entire time the user is massaging their eyelid to help mechanically and thermally stimulate the meibomian glands. As needed, the user may also press a button on the external device <b>1010</b> to cause the underlid device <b>200</b> to stimulate the scleral surface to generate tears.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In yet a third use case, underlid device <b>200</b> includes an energy storage element sufficient to power the device <b>200</b> for continuous operation over a relatively long period of time (e.g., days or weeks) and does not require any external device to provide power or control for such operation. For example, the energy storage element in underlid device <b>200</b> may be a battery.

After using the electromagnet to reposition the underlid device, the electromagnet can be used to stimulate the underlid device to stimulate the eyelid by alternately squeezing and relaxing the eyelid.

Third, frequency and pulse amplitude may be controlled by a wand or other external device. Fourth, a pressure sensor in a wand or other external device can be used to measure pressure.

A design includes a 1-inch long electromagnet with a % inch wide head that has a length of about 157 inches or 13 feet (providing a resistance of roughly 5 ohms).

A handheld wand may include various treatment tracking features, such as an accelerometer to track wand's treatment motion, and/or a wireless connection with a cellphone to give better treatment advice (figure out where &#x201c;blindspots&#x201d; are in treatment and suggest to user where they should spend more time), or not staying enough time in one spot. The handheld wand may track treatment time(s) and duration, and send reminders. The handheld wand may utilize a pressure sensor on wand tip to get an idea of force applied (protection as well as data). An underlid device utilized with a handheld wand may utilize thermal stimulation, for example, to melt the meibum that is clogging Meibomian glands. Such an underlid device may additionally or alternatively employ mechanical stimulation to provide a DC and pulsed magnetic field for an eyelid squeezing motion, as well as ability to move the underlid device around.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The following is a usage example of an underlid device system.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0083">1.

The frequency versus time of an example stimulation pulse is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. The stimulation signal is a frequency chirp signal whose frequency increases over a time period followed by decreasing over a time period in repeating cycles.

The method <b>1900</b> commences in step <b>1910</b>. In step <b>1910</b>, an underlid device, such as the embodiments of underlid devices described previously, is positioned underneath an eyelid of a patient. For example, an underlid device is placed between an eyelid and eyeball as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b></figref> or other figures herein. Once positioned, in step <b>1920</b> a determination is made whether a condition is satisfied. Step <b>1920</b> is an optional step that may not be employed. For example, the method <b>1900</b> may go from step <b>1910</b> directly to step <b>1930</b>, wherein a treatment is applied.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0095">Returning to step <b>1920</b>, a condition may be detected by sensors in the underlid device. According to one embodiment, the sensors may include a pair of electrodes, such as electrodes <b>340</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, and the electrodes are used to measure tear film conductance or impedance, which can be used to provide a measure of tear osmolarity as discussed herein. In one embodiment, if the tear osmolarity exceeds a threshold, thereby signaling a dry eye condition, the condition in step <b>1120</b> is satisfied and a treatment is applied in step <b>1930</b>, thereby providing relief to or treating the dry eye condition. In some embodiments, the treatment includes supplying power to various electrodes, such as electrodes <b>380</b>, to stimulate a sclera to produce reflex blinking or reflex tear production. In some embodiments, the treatment includes supplying power to various heating elements, such as heating elements <b>520</b>, to heat Meibomian glands in the eyelid to stimulate meibum production and/or unclog glands to relieve dry eye. In some embodiments, the treatment includes both stimulating the sclera and heating Meibomian glands using an underlid device such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0096">In some embodiments, the treatment in step <b>1930</b> includes utilizing an external device, such as a handheld wand.

An example underlid device with magnetic material is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref>. The treatment includes the wand generating magnetic pulses to alternately squeeze and release the eyelid between the wand and an underlid device. The magnetic pulses may be periodic or aperiodic. This alternate squeeze and release action massages the Meibomian glands to unclog the glands and/or stimulate meibum production. The treatment may also include supplying power to heating elements in the underlid device to apply heat to the Meibomian glands and/or supplying power to electrodes to stimulate a blink or reflex tears. The electrodes may face either the eyelid or the sclera.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0097">During operation, an underlid device may utilize electrodes or other sensors for blink detection. By detecting blinks and keeping track of the time between blinks, the underlid device can compute a blink rate over a predetermined time interval. In an embodiment, the blink rate is computed as the number of detected blinks in a time interval. The blink rate may be used as a condition in step <b>1920</b>. For example, if the blink rate is too low, the method <b>1900</b> moves to step <b>1930</b> in which power is supplied to electrodes to stimulate one or more blinks and increase the blink rate to an acceptable level.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0098">In step <b>1940</b>, the underlid device is removed from between an eyelid and eyeball.

This system may also gather eye position and blink rate data for other data-driven diagnostics. Localized, protected heating through an underlid device does not require invasiveness or anesthetic to be applied as in other prior art systems, and allows for home-based application. Two different secondary hardware devices (frames or handheld external device) allow for two distinct therapy strategies to be applied with the same underlid device: background, continuously applied therapy, or on-demand, manual therapy (acute treatment).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0100">Persons skilled in the art will recognize that the devices, systems, and methods described above can be modified in various ways.
