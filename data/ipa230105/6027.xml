num="0026">It should be noted that the thickness and shape of various film layers in the drawings do not represent any real proportion in the organic electroluminescence display panel, and are merely intended to illustrate the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to a conventional approach, a gate line <b>01</b>, a data line <b>02</b>, and a pixel unit <b>03</b> are disposed in a display area A of a display panel, wherein the pixel unit is disposed in an area defined by the gate line <b>01</b> and the data line <b>02</b>. Also, a gate driving circuit for driving the gate line <b>01</b> is provided at the left and right frames. Specifically, the gate driving circuit consists of a plurality of cascaded shift registers, wherein each shift register is composed of at least four switching transistors T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>, and T<b>4</b>, and a circuit structure diagram thereof is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As mentioned above, for the purpose of narrowing down the frame of display panel and even realizing a frameless design, it has been proposed to use the approach as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in which the gate driving circuit that was located otherwise in the frame area is moved now to the pixel area. In this way, the space for disposing the gate driving circuit at the frame is eliminated, thereby realizing an ultra-narrow frame or even a frameless design. However, in actual operations, it is difficult to dispose a gate driving circuit in the display area. In particular, for OLED products, the difficulty is further increased, because in OLED products, especially in high-resolution OLED products, complex pixel circuits have already been disposed in the size-limited display area.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a display panel is provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the display panel comprises a base substrate <b>100</b> comprising a display area A, a plurality of pixel driving circuits <b>200</b>, a plurality of light-emitting units <b>400</b> and a plurality of connection lines <b>500</b>, the plurality of pixel driving circuits <b>200</b>, the plurality of light-emitting units <b>400</b> and the plurality of connection lines <b>500</b> are located on the base substrate <b>100</b> and in the display area A. At least one pixel driving circuit <b>200</b> of the plurality of pixel driving circuits is electrically connected with at least one light-emitting unit <b>400</b> of the plurality of light-emitting units via at least one connection line <b>500</b> of the plurality of connection lines.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, the light-emitting unit <b>400</b> is of top emission type, but the light-emitting unit is not limited to this embodiment, the light-emitting unit <b>400</b> is a bottom emission type light-emitting unit in other embodiments. The display panel further comprises a gate driving circuit <b>300</b>. Further, an orthographic projection of the gate driving circuit <b>300</b> on the base substrate <b>100</b> does not overlap with an orthographic projection of the plurality of pixel driving circuits <b>200</b> on the base substrate <b>100</b>. Besides, the orthographic projection of the gate driving circuit <b>300</b> on the base substrate <b>100</b> at least partially overlaps with an orthographic projection of the plurality of top emission type of light-emitting units <b>400</b> on the base substrate <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Specifically, in the above organic electroluminescence display panel provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure, the gate driving circuit <b>300</b> and the pixel driving circuits <b>200</b> are simultaneously disposed in the display area A of the base substrate <b>100</b>, and also it is ensured that the orthographic projection of the gate driving circuit <b>300</b> on the base substrate <b>100</b> does not overlap with the orthographic projection of the pixel driving circuits <b>200</b> on the base substrate <b>100</b>. That is, the switching transistors in the gate driving circuit <b>300</b> are not disposed inside the pixel driving circuit <b>200</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and thus will not occupy the wiring space of the pixel driving circuit <b>200</b>. Therefore, it is ensured that both of the gate driving circuit <b>300</b> and the pixel driving circuit <b>200</b> have sufficient wiring spaces in the display area.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Meanwhile, in the above organic electroluminescence display panel provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure, a plurality of top emission type of light-emitting units <b>400</b>, which is covering the pixel driving circuits <b>200</b> and the gate driving circuit <b>300</b>, are further disposed in the display area A of the base substrate <b>100</b>. In such a case, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the area occupied by each of the top emission type of light-emitting units is increased as compared with the conventional pixel unit (corresponding to the top emission type of light-emitting unit <b>400</b>). Specifically, in the conventional approach, one of the top emission type of light-emitting units <b>400</b> only overlaps with one of the pixel driving circuits <b>200</b>. That is, the conventional top emission type of light-emitting unit <b>400</b> is disposed in a region defined by the gate line and the data line. However, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the gate driving circuit <b>300</b> has an overlapping region with the top emission type of light-emitting units <b>400</b> in the display area A. That is, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the top emission type of light-emitting units <b>400</b> may span over the data lines, thereby ensuring that all circuits in the display area A are covered by the top emission type of light-emitting units <b>400</b>. In this way, it is ensured that both of the gate driving circuit <b>300</b> and the pixel driving circuits <b>200</b> have sufficient wiring spaces in the display area A, thereby eliminating the need for arranging the gate driving circuit <b>300</b> at the frame, and thus realizing an ultra-narrow frame or even a frameless design.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to a specific embodiment, in the above organic electroluminescence display panel provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure, each of the top emission type of light-emitting units <b>400</b> comprises generally an anode, a light-emitting layer, and a cathode that are sequentially stacked, wherein the anode is connected to a respective pixel driving circuit <b>200</b>. In order to ensure light emission from the cathode side of each of the top emission type of light-emitting units <b>400</b>, it is required that the cathode is made of light transmissive material. However, the anode may be generally fabricated by an opaque metal, or a reflective layer can be fabricated separately under a transparent anode. In addition, the top emission type of light-emitting unit <b>400</b> may further comprise a functional film layer, such as an electron transport layer, a hole transport layer, an electron blocking layer, and a hole blocking layer, and the present disclosure is not limited in this regard.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to a specific embodiment, in the above organic electroluminescence display panel provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure, in order to ensure that light-emitting regions are distributed uniformly in the display area A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, anodes of each of the top emission type of light-emitting units <b>400</b> may be distributed uniformly in the display area A of the base substrate <b>100</b>.
