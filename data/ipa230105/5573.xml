Symptoms and/or physiological issues that directly affect a person's health and/or wellbeing may be associated with and/or exasperated by factors associated with the person and/or the person's lifestyle, such as a person's health and/or medical history (e.g., preconditions, congenital issues, previous treatments/diagnoses, etc.), a person's occupation (e.g., military service history, type of work performed, etc.), areas and/or regions that the person may have been exposed to, and/or the like. Symptoms and/or physiological issues that directly affect someone's health and/or wellbeing may go undetected/unidentified due to a lack of awareness of the individual of such symptoms and/or physiological issues, and/or a failure of the individual to inform a clinical professional of such symptoms and/or physiological issues. Screening can improve detection of symptoms and/or physiological issues that directly affect the health and/or wellbeing of an individual. Individuals may be interviewed with standardized screening questions and their responses may be manually and/or verbally entered to a computerized patient record system. Manual and/or verbal entrance of user (e.g., patient, subject, etc.) records into medical and/or health record systems is laborious, subject to transcription and/or translation error, and/or subject to incomplete/incorrect information due to self-reporting anxiety. Further, trends and or commonalities between individuals affected by symptoms and/or physiological issues may go undetected.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is to be understood that both the following general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive.

The data/information may be associated/integrated with a health and/or medical record system and used to determine, track, and/or the like various health and medical related issues that may affect a user and/or multiple users of a similar demographic.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The user device may generate and/or display, via an interface (e.g., a graphical user interface (GUI), etc.), screening questions. Screening questions may target and/or be directed towards any users or users of a particular demographic, such as the general veteran population. The screening questions may place emphasis on collecting information on early diagnosis and/or under-diagnosis of long-term health effects due to occupational and/or regional exposure to various risk factors, such as exposure to chemicals, high decibel sound, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) inducing events, and/or the like. For example, screening questions may be associated with the military service history of a user, somatic symptoms a user may be experiencing, pain/injury a user may be experiencing, illness a user may be experiencing, personal and/or social behavior of the user, depression symptoms the user may be experiencing, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A user profile may be generated/created based on responses to the screening questions.

A user device (e.g., a mobile device, a smart device, computing device, etc.) may periodically collect and/or actively solicit a user (e.g., patient, subject, etc.) for data/information. The data/information may be associated and/or integrated with a health and/or medical record of a user to determine, track, and/or the like various health and/or medical related issues that may affect a user and/or multiple users of a similar demographic.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The user device may generate and/or display, via an interface (e.g., a graphical user interface (GUI), etc.), screening questions. Screening questions may target any user or may be directed towards users of a particular demographic, such as the general veteran population. Screening questions may target and/or be directed towards any user. Screening questions may be associated with and/or include one or more symptomatic indicators. A symptomatic indicator may indicate a likelihood that the user (e.g., patient, subject, etc.) may be experiencing and/or be affected by a health issue, a medical issue, a physiological issue, a psychological issue, and/or the like. Screening questions may place emphasis on collecting information on early diagnosis and/or under-diagnosis of long-term health effects due to occupational and/or regional exposure to various risk factors, such as exposure to chemicals, high decibel sound, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) inducing events, and/or the like. For example, screening questions may be associated a military service history of a user, somatic symptoms a user may be experiencing, pain/injury a user may be experiencing, illness/irritability a user may be experiencing, personal and/or social behavior associated with a user, depression/anxiety/paranoia symptoms a user may be experiencing, and/or the like. Screening questions may be associated with any topic, health/medical related issue, and/or the like relative to a user.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For each response (e.g., tactile response, audio response, patient provided response, etc.) to the screening questions and/or symptomatic indicators, a score (e.g., a score on a scale from 1-10, etc.) may be determined. In some instances, the user device may determine scores to the screening questions, such as by accessing data/information associated with the screening questions and/or symptomatic indicators and correlating each response to the screening questions and/or symptomatic indicators to the data/information associated with the screening questions and/or symptomatic indicators. In some instances, the user device communicate with a computing device (e.g., cloud-based device, server, electronic records management device, etc.) and provide the responses to the screening questions to the computing device. The computing device may determine scores to the screening questions. Scores to the screening questions may be determined, for example, by accessing data/information associated with the screening questions (and/or symptomatic indicators) and correlating each response to the screening questions (and/or symptomatic indicators) to the data/information associated with the screening questions (and/or symptomatic indicators). For example, a machine learning module may be used to correlate each response to the screening questions (and/or symptomatic indicators) to data/information associated with the screening questions (and/or symptomatic indicators).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Data/information associated with the screening questions (and/or symptomatic indicators) may be and/or associated with a scale/score. For example data/information associated with physical injury, illness, and pain (PIIP) may be associated with a scale. For example, a screening question may ask the user where they are experiencing pain and to describe the type of pain (e.g., aching, burning, cramping, dull, earache, fatigue, gastrointestinal pain, headache, itching, sharp, stabbing, shocking, etc.). The screening questions may be derived from a catalogue and/or data repository of known diseases, illnesses, and injuries to enable the user to describe in great diagnostic detail what they are experiencing. The user may provide a response based on a scale from 1-10, where scores/values of 4 or greater are considered to be clinically significant pain, and/or the like. The data/information associated with the screening questions and/or symptomatic indicators may be and/or associated with any scale and/or score. Each response to the screening questions and/or symptomatic indicators may be associated with a score that is determined relative to a scale and/or the like associated with each screening questions. Each score generated and/or determined based on responses to the screening questions may be associated with user information (e.g., a user profile, an electronic medical record (EMR) associated with the patient, a user account, etc.).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Data/information associated with the screening questions may include data indicative of keystrokes and/or answer selections made by a user. For example, a user may initially select a first answer to a screening question (e.g., a selection of &#x201c;4 out of 10&#x201d; on a pain scale), and the user may subsequently select (e.g., 3 second after selecting the first answer) a second answer question to the screening question (e.g., a selection of &#x201c;6 out of 10&#x201d; on a pain scale). The data indicative of the keystrokes and/or the answer selections made by the user may be used to adjust for patient self-reporting anxiety. For example, the data/information associated with physical injury, illness, and pain (PIIP) may be adjusted based on the data indicative of the keystrokes and/or the answer selections.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">User information (e.g., a user profile, an electronic medical record (EMR) associated with the patient, a user account, etc.) may include a baseline metric and/or dataset based on the responses to the screening questions, previous responses to screening questions. The baseline metric and/or dataset may be adjusted, modified, and/or changed by any collected data/information regarding the activity, diet, and/or vitals of the user. In some cases, additional data/information may be collected from one or more devices associated with the user device and/or user, such as an accelerometer, a pedometer, a geographical position sensing (GPC) module, an oximeter, a tactile sensor, and/or the like. For example, data/information (e.g., one or more signals, etc.) from an accelerometer, a pedometer, a geographical position sensing (GPC) module, and/or a tactile sensor may be analyzed (e.g., a long-term evaluation, etc.) to determine movement and impact velocities associated with the user device and/or the user. The data/information (e.g., one or more signals, etc.) may be associated with the user information (e.g., baseline metric and/or dataset, responses to screening questions, etc.). In some cases, the user information may include data/information from one or more records systems such as an electronic medical record, a military service record, and/or any other record/information associated with the user.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some instances, the user device may solicit data/information associated with the user. For example, the user profile may be analyzed to determine a time (e.g., instance, date, period, etc.) when responses to screening questions and/or data/information from the one or more devices (e.g., an accelerometer, a pedometer, a geographical position sensing (GPC) module, an oximeter, a tactile sensor, etc.) associated with the user device was received. The user device (and/or a computing device) may determine, based on the time when the responses to the screening questions and/or the data/information from the one or more devices was received, a time frame, a time period, a time window, and/or the like. The time frame (e.g., time period, time window, etc.) may be relative to when additional responses to screening questions and/or additional data/information from the one or more devices should be received, such as daily, weekly, monthly, and/or the like. The time frame may be automatically determined based on the user profile and/or any symptomatic indicators affecting the user. The time frame may be determined by the user. When additional responses to screening questions and/or additional data/information from the one or more devices is not received within the time frame, the user device (and/or computing device) may send a notification (e.g., a signal, a message, an email, a text, etc.) to the user device and/or the user that causes the user to provide additional responses to screening questions and/or additional data/information from the one or more devices.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The user profile may be used to determine/predict the onset of and/or a change to any health, medical, and/or mental issues the user may be experiencing based on one or more symptomatic indicators. Each score generated and/or determined based on responses to the screening questions may be used to determine/predict the onset of and/or a change to any health, medical, and/or mental issues, such as a likelihood that the user will be diagnosed with a health/medical issue. In some instances, the user device and/or computing device (e.g., via the machine learning module) may determine the likelihood that a user will be diagnosed with a health/medical issue based on a score generated and/or determined from responses to the screening questions. Scores satisfying a threshold (e.g., a clinical threshold, etc.) may indicate a health issue. For example, scores may be used to determine an alert condition.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An alert condition may be an indication that a user (e.g., patient, subject, etc.) is at risk for an emergency medical condition. An alert/notification (e.g., a clinical notification and/or reminder, etc.) may be determined and/or generated based on an alert condition. For example, a score determined from a response to a screening question associated with pain (e.g., aching, burning, cramping, dull, earache, fatigue, gastrointestinal pain, headache, itching, sharp, stabbing, shocking, etc.) may exceed a threshold value of 4 (on a scale from 1-10), and may alert condition to be determined and/or an alert/notification to be generated/sent (e.g., sent to a medical and/or healthcare device/professional, etc.).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some instances, a plurality of user profiles associated with a plurality of users may be used to determine and/or identify one or more target areas (e.g., geographical areas) where individuals likely may be associated with one or more symptomatic indicators. For example, the plurality of user profiles may be analyzed (via a machine learning module) to determine not only target areas (e.g., geographical areas) where individuals experience a high rate of suicide, but also why a target area has such a high suicide rate for users that may have been previously stationed in the target area during military service.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The methods and systems for comprehensive symptom analysis described herein may lower the cost of medical care and reduce the analytical burdens on clinicians faced with increasing amounts of clinical data.

When additional responses to screening questions and/or additional data/information from the interface <b>112</b> (e.g., one or more devices, an accelerometer, a pedometer, a geographical position sensing (GPC) module, an oximeter, a tactile sensor, etc.) is not received within the time frame, the user device <b>102</b> (and/or computing device <b>104</b>) may send a notification (e.g., a signal, a message, an email, a text, etc.) to the user device <b>102</b> and/or the user that causes the user to provide additional responses to screening questions and/or additional data/information from the interface <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The user device <b>102</b> (and/or computing device <b>104</b>) may use the additional responses to screening questions and/or additional data/information from the interface <b>112</b> to update the user profile. The user profile and/o the updated user profile may be used to determine an alert condition. In some cases, an alert condition may be determined based on a score derived from a screening question. An alert condition may be and/or include an indication that a user is at risk for an emergency medical condition associated with a symptomatic indicator related to a screening question. Scores associated with a user profile may be compiled with additional medical information associated with each symptomatic indicator of a plurality of symptomatic indicators, and specific diagnosis, and prescribed services and/or treatments may be determined based on an alert condition.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Scores may be accessed and/or analyzed according to one or more rules associated screening question and/or associated symptomatic indicator. For example, a rule associated with a symptomatic indicator for pain a user may be experiencing may dictate that user scores that satisfy a threshold value may indicate an alert condition. A screening question may ask the user where they are experiencing pain, or use a symptomatic indicator (e.g., by displaying a 3D model) to enable the user to indicate where pain is experienced. The screening question may ask and/or a symptomatic indicator may probe a user to describe the type of pain (e.g., aching, burning, cramping, dull, earache, fatigue, gastrointestinal pain, headache, itching, sharp, stabbing, shocking, etc.) the user is experiencing. The user may provide a response based on or correlated to a scale from 1-10, where scores/values of 4 or greater are considered to be clinically significant pain, and therefore indicative of an alert condition. An alert condition may be determined based on any rule associated with associated screening question and/or associated symptomatic indicator. In some instances, the user device <b>102</b> (via the analysis module <b>115</b>, etc.) may determine the alert condition. For example, an application associated with the user device <b>102</b> may determine the alert condition. In some instances, the computing device <b>104</b> may determine the alert condition based on the responses received from the user device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The computing device <b>104</b> may include a machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b>. In some instances, a machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may determine an alert condition and/or the likelihood that the user will be diagnosed with a health/medical issue related to a symptomatic indicator of the plurality of symptomatic indicators, based on a score for the symptomatic indicator. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may be and/or include a neural network.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some cases, the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may perform, in whole or in part, analytical function of the system <b>100</b>. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may be configured to approximate the knowledge of a clinician/physician and a standard of mental, physical, and medical care by making discriminating judgments based on a probable cause of a mental, physical, and medical related diagnoses determined through the analysis of user health data (e.g., responses to screening questions, etc.) in view of a set or sets (e.g., a dataset and/or datasets, etc.) of clinical methodologies. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may use both fuzzy logic, Boolean models, and/or the like. Fuzzy logic, in contrast to more deterministic Boolean models, may provide analytical output of clinical/medical data sets in terms of clinical/medical probabilities rather than more rigid absolutes.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may access and/or determine clinical probabilities, such as probable medical and/or health alert conditions. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may include contemporaneous determined and stored user health data (e.g., from screening questions, from one or more devices, etc.). The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may comprise a collection of clinical data/information, such as historical symptoms, diagnoses and outcomes, along with time development of health/medical issues. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may place emphasis on collecting information on early diagnosis and/or under-diagnosis of long-term health effects due to occupational and/or regional exposure to various risk factors, such as exposure to chemicals, high decibel sound, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) inducing events, and/or the like. For example, the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may associate a military service history of a user with any somatic symptoms a user may be experiencing, pain/injury a user may be experiencing, illness a user may be experiencing, personal and/or social behavior associated with a user, depression symptoms a user may be experiencing, and/or the like to determine/identify correlations between certain symptoms and/or health/mental issues, such as a user's propensity for suicide. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may analyze data/information associated with any topic, health/medical related issue, and/or the like relative to a user. Data/information, such as responses derived from screening questions, and/or one or more signals (e.g., additional data/information) collected from one or more devices associated with the user device <b>102</b> (e.g., interface module <b>112</b>, an accelerometer, a pedometer, a geographical position sensing (GPC) module, an oximeter, a tactile sensor. etc.), may be coded and/or encoded and input into the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> to populate and/or train the computing device <b>104</b> with clinical data/information. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may use the clinical data/information to determine, derive, and/or predict clinical, medical, health, and diagnostic outcomes, such as one or more alerts conditions.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Scores derived from responses to the screening questions may be used to create a dataset. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may compare the dataset to previously stored datasets and/or information. Comparing the dataset to stored datasets and/or information may provide an indication of a possible diagnosis of a health/medical issue associated with a symptomatic indicator of the plurality of symptomatic indicators. In some instances, scores derived from responses to the screening questions from multiple users and/or multiple user devices <b>102</b> may be used to create a training dataset. The training dataset may be used to train the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b>. When new data/information (e.g., clinical information, responses to screening questions, training datasets, etc.) is provided to the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b>, the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may update any stored data/information and adapt to any changing parameters (e.g., changes to a dataset, etc.) associated with the clinical data/information. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may verify conclusions, diagnoses, and/or the like for accuracy and/or significance. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may store test cases, appropriate outcomes and the relative occurrence of misidentification of the proper outcome and/or diagnosis. The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may establish a threshold of acceptable misidentifications or misdiagnoses.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> may use the clinical data/information to determine, derive, and/or predict clinical, medical, health, and diagnostic outcomes (referred to herein as &#x201c;medical conditions&#x201d;). Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an example system <b>200</b> depicting an implementation of the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> is shown. The system <b>200</b> may be configured to use machine learning techniques to train, based on an analysis of one or more training data sets <b>210</b>A-<b>210</b>B by a training module <b>220</b>, at least one machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b>. The machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b> may be the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b> described herein. The machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b> may be configured to determine whether patient data (e.g., user data) for a particular patient/user is indicative or not indicative of a particular medical condition. Patient data for a particular patient/user and/or training data may comprise one or more pieces of clinical data/information and/or stored user health data as described herein. The training data set <b>210</b>A may comprise labeled patient data for a first plurality of patients/users (e.g., labeled as being indicative (or not) of a presence of particular medical condition). The training data set <b>210</b>B (e.g., a second portion of the second core data) may also comprise labeled patient data for a second plurality of patients/users (e.g., labeled as being indicative (or not) of a presence of particular medical condition). The labels may comprise &#x201c;Indicative of Medical Condition&#x201d; and &#x201c;Not Indicative of Medical Condition.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Patient data used for training may be randomly assigned to the training data set <b>210</b>B or to a testing data set. In some implementations, the assignment of data to a training data set or a testing data set may not be completely random. In this case, one or more criteria may be used during the assignment, such as ensuring that similar numbers of patient/user datasets with different labels and different medical conditions are in each of the training and testing data sets. In general, any suitable method may be used to assign the data to the training or testing data sets, while ensuring that the distributions of &#x201c;Indicative of Medical Condition&#x201d; and &#x201c;Not Indicative of Medical Condition&#x201d; labels are somewhat similar in the training data set and the testing data set.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The training module <b>220</b> may train the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b> by extracting a feature set from a first portion of the training data set <b>210</b>A according to one or more feature selection techniques. The term &#x201c;feature&#x201d; as used herein may refer to one or more pieces of patient data, such as one or more pieces of clinical data/information and/or stored user health data as described herein. The training module <b>220</b> may further define the feature set obtained from the training data set <b>210</b>A by applying one or more feature selection techniques to a second portion of the training data set <b>210</b>B that includes statistically significant features of positive examples (e.g., one or more pieces of patient data labeled as &#x201c;Indicative of Medical Condition&#x201d;) and statistically significant features of negative examples (e.g., one or more pieces of patient data labeled as &#x201c;Not Indicative of Medical Condition&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The training module <b>220</b> may extract a feature set from the training data set <b>210</b>A and/or the training data set <b>210</b>B in a variety of ways. The training module <b>220</b> may perform feature extraction multiple times, each time using a different feature-extraction technique. In an embodiment, the feature sets generated using the different techniques may each be used to generate different machine learning-based classification models <b>240</b>. For example, the feature set with the highest quality metrics may be selected for use in training. The training module <b>220</b> may use the feature set(s) to build one or more machine learning-based classification models <b>240</b>A-<b>240</b>N that are configured to indicate whether or not one or more pieces of patient data for a patient/user are associated with indicative or not indicative of a particular medical condition.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The training data set <b>210</b>A and/or the training data set <b>210</b>B may be analyzed to determine any dependencies, associations, and/or correlations between extracted features and the indicative/not indicative labels in the training data set <b>210</b>A and/or the training data set <b>210</b>B. The identified correlations may have the form of a list of features that are associated with each label. The features may be considered as variables in the machine learning context. The term &#x201c;feature,&#x201d; as used herein, may refer to any characteristic of an item of data that may be used to determine whether the item of data falls within one or more specific categories. By way of example, the features described herein may comprise one or more pieces of patient data.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A feature selection technique may comprise one or more feature selection rules. The one or more feature selection rules may comprise a &#x201c;data point occurrence rule&#x201d; associated with one or more pieces of patient data. The data point occurrence rule may comprise determining which pieces of patient data in the training data set <b>210</b>A occur over a threshold number of times and identifying those pieces of patient data that satisfy the threshold as candidate features. For example, any piece of patient data that appears greater than or equal to 2 times in the training data set <b>210</b>A may be considered as candidate features. Any piece of patient data appearing less than 2 times may be excluded from consideration as a feature. Any threshold amount may be used as needed.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">A single feature selection rule may be applied to select features or multiple feature selection rules may be applied to select features. The feature selection rules may be applied in a cascading fashion, with the feature selection rules being applied in a specific order and applied to the results of the previous rule. For example, the clinical data point occurrence rule may be applied to the training data set <b>210</b>A to generate a first list of imaging result attributes. A final list of candidate features may be analyzed according to additional feature selection techniques to determine one or more candidate groups (e.g., pieces/groups of patient data that may be used to predict whether new patient/user data is indicative or not of a particular medical condition). Any suitable computational technique may be used to identify the candidate feature groups using any feature selection technique such as filter, wrapper, and/or embedded methods. One or more candidate feature groups may be selected according to a filter method. Filter methods include, for example, Pearson's correlation, linear discriminant analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square, combinations thereof, and the like. The selection of features according to filter methods are independent of any machine learning algorithms. Instead, features may be selected on the basis of scores in various statistical tests for their correlation with the outcome variable (e.g., indicative or not of a particular medical condition).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As another example, one or more candidate feature groups may be selected according to a wrapper method. A wrapper method may be configured to use a subset of features and train the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b> using the subset of features. Based on the inferences that drawn from a previous model, features may be added and/or deleted from the subset. Wrapper methods include, for example, forward feature selection, backward feature elimination, recursive feature elimination, combinations thereof, and the like. In an embodiment, forward feature selection may be used to identify one or more candidate feature groups. Forward feature selection is an iterative method that begins with no features in the training module <b>220</b>. In each iteration, the feature which best improves the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b> is added until an addition of a new feature does not improve the performance of the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b>. In an embodiment, backward elimination may be used to identify one or more candidate feature groups. Backward elimination is an iterative method that begins with all features in the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b>. In each iteration, the least significant feature is removed until no improvement is observed on removal of features. Recursive feature elimination may be used to identify one or more candidate feature groups. Recursive feature elimination is a greedy optimization algorithm which aims to find the best performing feature subset. Recursive feature elimination repeatedly creates models and keeps aside the best or the worst performing feature at each iteration. Recursive feature elimination constructs the next model with the features remaining until all the features are exhausted. Recursive feature elimination then ranks the features based on the order of their elimination.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As a further example, one or more candidate feature groups may be selected according to an embedded method. Embedded methods combine the qualities of filter and wrapper methods. Embedded methods include, for example, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and ridge regression which implement penalization functions to reduce overfitting. For example, LASSO regression performs L1 regularization which adds a penalty equivalent to absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients and ridge regression performs L2 regularization which adds a penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of coefficients.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">After the training module <b>220</b> has generated a feature set(s), the training module <b>220</b> may generate one or more machine learning-based classification models <b>240</b>A-<b>240</b>N based on the feature set(s). For example, the training module <b>220</b> may use the feature sets extracted from the training data set <b>210</b>A and/or the training data set <b>210</b>B to build a machine learning-based classification model <b>240</b>A-<b>240</b>N for each classification category (e.g., indicative/not indicative) for each particular medical condition. In some examples, the machine learning-based classification models <b>240</b>A-<b>340</b>N may be combined into a single machine learning-based classification model <b>240</b>. Similarly, the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b> may represent a single classifier containing a single or a plurality of machine learning-based classification models <b>240</b> and/or multiple classifiers containing a single or a plurality of machine learning-based classification models <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The extracted features may be combined in the machine learning-based classification models <b>240</b>A-<b>240</b>N using a machine learning approach such as discriminant analysis; decision tree; a nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm (e.g., k-NN models, replicator NN models, etc.); statistical algorithm (e.g., Bayesian networks, etc.); clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, mean-shift, etc.); neural networks (e.g., reservoir networks, artificial neural networks, etc.); support vector machines (SVMs); logistic regression algorithms; linear regression algorithms; Markov models or chains; principal component analysis (PCA) (e.g., for linear models); multi-layer perceptron (MLP) ANNs (e.g., for non-linear models); replicating reservoir networks (e.g., for non-linear models, typically for time series); random forest classification; a combination thereof and/or the like. The resulting machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b> may comprise one or more decision rules or mappings for each feature and for each particular medical condition to assign new patient data to a class (e.g., indicative/not indicative of the particular medical condition).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The one or more decision rules or mappings for each particular medical condition and the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b> may be used to predict a label (e.g., indicative/not indicative of the particular medical condition) for new patient data for a plurality of new patients/users (e.g., unlabeled patient data) in the testing data set. In one example, the prediction for each of the plurality of new patients/users in the testing data set includes a confidence level that corresponds to a likelihood or a probability that the corresponding new patient data for the particular new patient/user belongs in the predicted indicative/not indicative of the particular medical condition status. The confidence level may be a value between zero and one, and it may represent a likelihood that the corresponding new patient data for the particular new patient/user belongs to a particular indicative/not indicative of the particular medical condition status. In one example, when there are two statuses (e.g., indicative/not indicative of the particular medical condition), the confidence level may correspond to a value p, which refers to a likelihood that corresponding new patient data for the particular new patient/user belongs to the first status (e.g., indicative of the particular medical condition). In this case, the value 1&#x2212;p may refer to a likelihood that the corresponding new patient data for the particular new patient/user belongs to the second status (e.g., not indicative of the particular medical condition). In general, multiple confidence levels may be provided for each of the plurality of new patients/users and for each feature. As noted above, the term &#x201c;feature&#x201d; as used herein may refer to one or more pieces of patient data, such as one or more pieces of clinical data/information and/or stored user health data as described herein. A top performing feature&#x2014;or a group of top performing features&#x2014;may be determined by comparing the result obtained for each of the plurality of new patients/users with a known indicative/not indicative of the particular medical condition status for each in the testing data set. In general, the top performing candidate feature&#x2014;or group of top performing candidate features&#x2014;will have results that closely match the known indicative/not indicative of the particular medical condition status.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Once trained, the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b> may determine which pieces of new patient data, such as one or more pieces of clinical data/information and/or stored user health data, are most indicative of a particular medical condition.

Such that a score/value of 4 or greater (on an associated scale ranging from values 1-10) are considered to be clinically significant pain, and therefore indicative of an alert condition. An alert condition may be determined based on any rule associated with each symptomatic indicator of the plurality of symptomatic indicators.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some instances, an alert condition may be determined by a machine learning module (e.g., the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b>/the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b>). For example, to determine a likelihood that a user will have a diagnosis of a health/medical issue associated with a symptomatic indicator of the plurality of symptomatic indicators, based on a score for the symptomatic indicator. The computing device and/or the user device may be in communication with (and/or comprise) a machine learning module (e.g., the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b>/the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b>). The machine learning module may include contemporaneous determined and stored user health data (e.g., from screening questions, the user profile, etc.). The machine learning module may comprise a collection of clinical data/information, such as historical symptoms, diagnoses and outcomes, along with time development of health/medical issues and symptomatic indicators. The clinical data/information may be coded and/or encoded and input into the machine learning module to populate and/or train the network with clinical data/information that may be used to determine, derived, and/or predict clinical, medical, health, and diagnostic outcomes, such as one or more alerts conditions. When new data/information (e.g., clinical information, responses to screening questions, etc.) is provided to the machine learning module, the network may update any stored data/information and adapt to any changing parameters associated with the clinical data/information. The machine learning module may verify conclusions, diagnoses, and/or the like for accuracy and/or significance. The machine learning module may store test cases, appropriate outcomes and the relative occurrence of misidentification of the proper outcome and/or diagnosis. The machine learning module may establish a threshold of acceptable misidentifications or misdiagnoses.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some cases, when an alert condition (and/or any other condition associated with the plurality of screening questions) is determined, such as based on a score for a symptomatic indicator of the plurality of symptomatic indicators, a clinical device (e.g., the clinical device <b>107</b>, a server, etc.) and/or an associated clinician may be determined. In some cases, the user device, based on determining the alert condition, may determine the clinical device and/or an associated clinician. For example, an application associated with and/or installed on the user device, based on determining the alert condition, may determine the clinical device and/or an associated clinician. In some cases, the computing device, based on determining the alert condition, may determine the clinical device and/or an associated clinician.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some instances, the device identifier associated with the user device and/or the identifier associated with the user may be used to determine the clinical device and/or an associated clinician. For example, the device identifier associated with the user device and/or the identifier associated with the user may be used to determine the user profile. The user profile may indicate one or more clinical devices and/or clinicians associated with the user and/or user device. The one or more clinical devices and/or clinicians may each be associated with a symptomatic indicator (or one or more symptomatic indicators) of the plurality of symptomatic indicators. In some instances, the one or more clinical devices and/or clinicians may be determined based on a symptomatic indicator of the plurality of symptomatic indicators, such as based on a score derived from the plurality of medical questions for a particular symptomatic indicator of the plurality of symptomatic indicators. For example, each symptomatic indicator of the plurality of symptomatic indicators may be associated with one or more clinical devices and/or clinicians. The one or more one or more clinical devices and/or clinicians may be associated with a respective symptomatic indicator of the plurality of symptomatic indicators based on a clinical ability of a clinician associated with a clinical device to respond to, treat, diagnose, provide care for, and/or otherwise address any issue relating to and/or associated with the symptomatic indicator. The one or more clinical devices and/or clinicians may each be ranked based on a clinical ability of a clinician associated with a clinical device to respond to, treat, diagnose, provide care for, and/or otherwise address any issue relating to and/or associated with the symptomatic indicator. The rank associated with the clinical device and/or an associated clinician may be used to determine the clinical device and/or an associated clinician.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In some instances, the clinical device (e.g., the clinical device <b>107</b>, a server, etc.) and/or an associated clinician may receive a notification (e.g., a signal, a message, an email, a text, etc.). In some cases, the user device, based on determining the alert condition, may send the notification to the clinical device. For example, an application associated with and/or installed on the user device, based on determining the alert condition, may send the notification to the clinical device. In some cases, the computing device, based on determining the alert condition, may send the notification to the clinical device. The notification may be sent to the clinical device via a long-range communication technique (e.g., Internet, cellular, satellite, and the like), via a short-range communication technique (e.g., BLUETOOTH&#xae;, ZigBee, Z-wave, near-field communication, infrared, etc.), and/or via any communication technique. The notification may be sent to the clinical device via an application associated with and/or installed on the user device, associated with the computing device, and/or the like. For example, the notification may be sent to the clinical device via an application program interface (API) associated with the user device, the computing device, the clinical device, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The notification may cause the clinical device to perform an action. For example, the notification may cause the clinical device to schedule an appointment (e.g., via an appointment scheduling system, online/web-based system, etc.) to meet with the clinician and/or a clinical staff associated with the clinical device. The notification may cause the clinical device to send data/information associated with the user of the user device to the user device and/or computing device. The data/information associated with the user of the user device may include appointment reminders, health and/or medical advice/instructions, information relating to a symptomatic indicator of the plurality of symptomatic indicators, and/or the like. The data/information associated with the user may include any data/information.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">At <b>550</b>, the user profile may be compared and/or associated with a plurality of profiles. The user device (and/or the computing device) may analyze data/information from a plurality of user profiles to determine commonalities among users. The user device (and/or the computing device) may compare demographics, responses to screening questions, and any other related data/information to determine, for particular symptom (symptomatic indicator) and/or health related issue, commonalities among users. Commonalities among users may be used to determine why a particular symptom (symptomatic indicator) and/or health related issue is occurring.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">At <b>560</b>, a target area may be determined. The user device (and/or the computing device) may determine a target area. For example, the user device (and/or the computing device), via machine learning (e.g., the machine learning and analysis module <b>138</b>/the machine learning-based classifier <b>230</b>), may analyze data/information associated with the user profile along with a plurality of user profiles associated with a plurality of users to determine and/or identify one or more target areas (e.g., geographical areas) where individuals likely may be associated with one or more symptomatic indicators. The user device (and/or the computing device) may predict and/or determine target areas (e.g., geographical areas) where there may a statistically relevant occurrence of a particular symptom (symptomatic indicator) and/or health related issue. For example, a target area may have a high rate of suicide. Other target areas may have a statistically high occurrence of people with cancer, blindness, deafness, or any other occupational or regional induced symptom and/or health issue. Target areas may identify any occurrence of a health, medical, or mental issue, as well as reasons for such occurrences. For example, the user device (and/or the computing device) may determine a target area where individuals experience a high rate of suicide. By correlating multiple user profile from users that may have worked, been stationed in, or otherwise been exposed to the target area, the user device (and/or the computing device) may determine why the target area has such a high suicide rate for such users. For example, responses to screening questions provided from users that may have worked, been stationed in, or otherwise been exposed to the target area may indicate that many post-traumatic stress inducing events occurred in the target area and thus results in a high suicide rate for the target area. The user device (and/or the computing device) may cause display of the target area or multiple target areas.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example computing device for implementing comprehensive symptom analysis.
