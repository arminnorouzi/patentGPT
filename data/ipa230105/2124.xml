These cups are often formed of a resilient material and may include features that make it easier for children to drink from the vessel, such as attached drinking straws, sealed lids with spouts, and the like. Cups that are designed with child users in mind also generally have features to prevent or guard against spills and accidental leaks. Additionally, parents are constantly multi-tasking and transporting small children to different locations and need drinking solutions that are portable, easy to secure and easy to use. Many of these cups are touted as easy to clean, however, repeated use of these cups may lead to the accumulation of mold, mildew, or other undesirable microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. Straws, in particular, are notoriously difficult to clean and the user may never actually clean the interior surface of the straw.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, there is a need for a cup assembly which is portable, easy to use, easy to clean and has a built-in design that promotes independent and safe use by a child or adult user.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present subject disclosure presents a simplified summary of the subject disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects thereof.

Using biodegradable plastics is advantageous in that they maintain their mechanical strength during practical use but break down into low-weight compounds and non-toxic byproducts at the end of their lifecycle. Such materials can be obtained through chemical synthesis, fermentation by microorganisms, and/or from chemically modified natural products.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The cup assembly <b>10</b> may include a bio-assimilator compound. One example of a bio-assimilator compound may be ECLIPSE&#x2122;. Traditional plastic materials like PE may be difficult to degrade in the environment. A bio-assimilator is a compound that degrades plastic to a molecular weight that can be consumed by living organisms. This is a final and conclusive stage of plastic biodegradation that leaves behind no microplastic remnants. The addition of a bio-assimilator can be tailored to ensure a useful-life performance before degrading according to a set timetable. For example, a bio-assimilator may be added with a simple inclusion rate between .01-2% concentration (w/w=mass of solute/mass of solution&#xd7;100) in the masterbatch or at any time during the manufacturing process. Additionally, a bio-assimilator may comprise between .01-10% concentration of the plastic formulation used to manufacture the cup assembly <b>10</b>. The cup assembly <b>10</b> may be adapted to degrade between 1 and 60 months after the predetermined useful-life time frame. In one embodiment the cup assembly <b>10</b> may be adapted to degrade between 18-24 months. In another embodiment the cup assembly <b>10</b> may be adapted to degrade in approximately 36 months.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cup assembly <b>10</b> may include the bio-assimilator to facilitate anaerobic biodegradation. The anaerobic degradation of the cup assembly <b>10</b> may meet or exceed the standards described in ASTM D.5511-02, ASTM D.5526-94 and ISO 15985 and ISO 14853. The bio-assimilator may be made from bio-sourced or artificial materials and may be included in standard or customized masterbatch formulations incorporated in the production process. The bio-assimilator may include manganese stearate in its formulation as a transition metal that serves as a catalyst to trigger the free-radical process within a polymer. Manganese stearate, or a similar catalyst, may be added at up to 4% to masterbatches of the Bio-assimilation additive, which may then be incorporated into plastic masterbatches at levels up to 1%. Alternatively, Manganese stearate may be added at up to 10% to masterbatches of the Bio-assimilation additive, which may then be incorporated into plastic masterbatches at levels between .01-3.0%.

The cap <b>62</b> or the straw body <b>64</b> may include a bite-proof portion (not shown) having a different thickness or tougher durometer relative to the rest of the straw assembly <b>60</b> in order to protect from the bite of a user.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-B</figref>, the seam <b>67</b> may extend only partially along the length of the straw body <b>64</b>. As shown in FIG, <b>23</b>A, the seam <b>67</b> ends at the flange <b>61</b> and does not extend into the neck portion <b>77</b>.
