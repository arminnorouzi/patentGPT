No. 7,605,772 issued to Syrstad, which discloses an electronic display panel having a combination of aligned and connected forwardly located panels to which a plurality of rearwardly located LED modules easily and readily secure using three-point attachment to form an electronic display panel suitable for accommodation by and for securing to the structure and framework of a sign system. Configured spacer brackets offer mutual spaced support between the front and rear panels and are constructed using arcuate geometry for dimension minimalizing to prevent interference with the viewing of the LED pixels. Notches are located along the bottom edge of the electronic display panel for simple engagement, such as with an arcuate surface of a pivot bar incorporated in a lower structure of a sign system.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">(2) U.S. Pat. No. 7,716,861 issued to Stadjuhar, which discloses an outdoor display sign has a display enclosure. The display enclosure has a number of shades that reduce the solar loading on the display enclosure. The outdoor display sign has shades covering the top, back, sides and parts of the front of the sign. The shades are offset from the display enclosure to allow natural airflow between the shade and the display enclosure.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">(3) U.S. Pat.

A communication network provides a communication path between the information centers. The communication network is National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) compliant. A sign controller is in communication with the information centers through the communication network. A first sign has a first address with a local control link to the sign controller. The local control link is not National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol compliant. A second sign has a second address with a second local control link to the sign controller. The second local control link is not National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol compliant.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">(4) U.S. Pat.
