id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A hydroponic growing system is presented. The system can include multiple growing trays in a vertical arrangement, where a pump supplies the top-most tray and each lower tray is supplied by the overlying tray, and where the plumbing elements for supply and drainage are arranged to one side of the system. The system includes variations to support different crop types within the same system, including removable growing structures for root vegetable, microgreens and supports for vining crops. The system can monitor and adjust the nutrients and other features of the systems water profile to concurrently group multiple crops in differing developing stages.</p></abstract><drawings

Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present disclosure will now be described with reference to the figures, which in general relate to hydroponics. Some embodiments disclosed herein include or may be part of a continuous flow hydroponic system suitable for the indoor growing multiple crops of different type at the same time. The hydroponic system can include a single layer or multiple layers of growing trays arranged over a pump. The pump directly supplies the top-most tray with water including from a tank, with each of the lower trays being supplied from drainpipe of the tray above, in an embodiment. The bottom tray drains back to the tank, in an embodiment. An auxiliary drainpipe runs to all of the trays to provide overflow protection, where any overflow can run down the auxiliary drainpipe to the tank, in an embodiment. The auxiliary drainpipe can also be used as a conduit for the supply line from the pump to the top-most tray, in an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To simplify the plumping arrangements, the drainpipe for each tray and the shared auxiliary drainpipe and supply line conduit are located along the same side of the trays, in an embodiment. The trays have a rectangular shape with the drainpipes located along one of the shorter sides, in an embodiment. The trays have a lateral barrier that separates the tray's water input area from its drain region, where the lateral barrier extends from the side with the drainpipes towards the opposite short side, leaving a gap to allow water to flow from the input to the drain, in an embodiment. The floor of the main region of the tray, over which the plants are held, is flat, with a dam placed between the main region and the drain to maintain a water in the main growing region of the tray, in an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The trays can be held in housings and mounted in a vertical arrangement in a support such as a rack, frame or cabinet. The housings can include a light source on its bottom side for an underlying tray. The trays are covered with lids that include openings in which net cups can be placed for holding the plants.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">To support vining plants or other plants needing support, the hydroponic system can include a trellis and plant supports. The plant supports can be individual attached to each net cup, which is attached to the cup to provide plant support. This allows for the individual cups to be used either with or without the plant support so that a number of different plants and different plant stages can use the hydroponic system concurrently.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A hydroponic system may re-circulate water that contains plant nutrients. The hydroponic system may contain multiple different types of plants (also referred to a crops), which may need different plant nutrients. The hydroponic system may potentially expose these multiple types of plants to the same water, and hence the same nutrients. It can be difficult for a user to determine suitable nutrients to add to the water in the hydroponic system in view of the wide range of nutrient needs of the various types of plants. This problem is made more difficult due to the possibility that plants may be in different growth stages, thereby affecting the nutrient needs. Embodiments disclosed herein determine suitable nutrients to add to a hydroponic system that re-circulates water that is exposed to multiple types of plants that have different nutrient needs.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">One embodiment disclosed herein includes a central controller that may determine suitable plant nutrients to add to a hydroponic system. The central controller may provide this information to numerous remote electronic devices such that a user in control of the remote electronic device may learn what nutrients to add to their hydroponic system. In one embodiment, the central controller collects plant observations from the user of the hydroponic systems. These plant observations may include the amount of time that a certain type of plant to reach a specific growth stage. The central controller uses these plant observations to modify how the central controller determines what plant nutrients that the users should add to their respective hydroponic systems, in an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The hydroponic system may contain multiple different types of plants (also referred to a crops), which may need different interactions with respect to the water that flow or re-circulated is in the hydroponic system. For example, some plants may grow well with their roots bathed constantly in the water. Other plants, such as root vegetables, may need room to grow to maturity without their root being in constant contact with the water. Still other plants, such as microgreens may need to develop roots prior to being in contact with the water that contains plant nutrients. Also, microgreens may need special surface, such as a hydroponic mat to grow well.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the hydroponic system has multiple types of removable growing structures. These growing structures may be added or removed to trays in the hydroponic system to allow different types of plants to be grown. One embodiment includes a removable growing structure that allows plants to be grown with their roots constantly bathed in water that is re-circulated in the hydroponic system. One embodiment includes a removable growing structure that allows root vegetables to be grown to maturity without their roots coming into contact with water that is re-circulated in the hydroponic system. One embodiment includes a removable growing structure that allows microgreens to develop roots prior to coming into contact with the water that is re-circulated in the hydroponic system. The removable growing structure may support a hydroponic mat to allow micro-greens or the like to be grown in the hydroponic system. The removable growing structures provide a user with tremendous flexibility in selecting a wide variety of plants to grow in a hydroponic system.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without the use of soil. A hydroponic system may use water containing plant nutrients to facilitate plant growth. Herein, the plants nutrients that are delivered in water may also be referred to as hydroponic nutrients. In some embodiments, the plants nutrients are dissolved in the water. For example, salts may be dissolved into water to provide various ions, which serve as the plants' nutrients. However, it is not required that the plants nutrients be dissolved in the water. For example, some of the plants' nutrients may be particles that are suspended in water.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Herein, an &#x201c;aqueous hydroponic nutrient&#x201d; refers to a mixture of water and plant nutrients. The plant nutrients may be dissolved in the water, suspended in the water, or a combination of some nutrients dissolved in the water and some nutrients suspended in the water. Thus, in one embodiment, the aqueous hydroponic nutrient is a solution in which water is the solvent. For example, the plant nutrients may include ions dissolved in water. The aqueous hydroponic nutrient may be made by dissolving salts in water. However, it is not required that the plant nutrients are dissolved in water. In one embodiment, the aqueous hydroponic nutrient is an aqueous suspension. In one embodiment, the aqueous hydroponic nutrient is an aqueous colloidal suspension.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, the aqueous hydroponic nutrient is an inorganic aqueous solution. For example, nitrogen may be provided by KNO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>), HNO<sub>3</sub>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>or (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. Other hydroponic nutrients may be provided by other inorganic compounds, as is known in the art. In one embodiment, the aqueous hydroponic nutrient includes organic particles mixed into the water. For example, nitrogen may be provided by mixing bloodmeal, bonemeal, manure, etc. into water. Other hydroponic nutrients may be provided by mixing organic particles into water, as is known in the art. In one embodiment, the water includes both inorganic particles (e.g., KNO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>), HNO<sub>3</sub>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) and organic particles (e.g., bloodmeal, bonemeal, manure) mixed into the water.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Herein the term &#x201c;water profile&#x201d; is used to refer to the composition of water (e.g., the composition of the aqueous hydroponic nutrient) in the hydroponic system. In one embodiment, the water profile is described by the concentration of various ions in the water that is circulated in the hydroponic system. The water profile may also include the pH of the water that is circulated in the hydroponic system.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Herein, the term aqueous hydroponic nutrient may be used to refer to both the water (containing the plant nutrient) that is circulated within the hydroponic system, as well as a much more concentrated aqueous hydroponic nutrients that are diluted with water to provide the aqueous hydroponic nutrient that is circulated within the hydroponic system.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the hydroponic system uses a growing medium (also referred to as a &#x201c;hydroponic growing medium&#x201d;) to support the plants. The hydroponic growing medium typically does not provide plant nutrients, as soil might provide. In some embodiments, the hydroponic growing medium is a soil-less growing medium. A &#x201c;soil-less growing medium&#x201d; does not contain soil. A hydroponic growing medium may contain organic and/or inorganic material. Examples of hydroponic growing mediums include, but are not limited to, sphagnum peat moss, coco peat, rice husks, perlite, vermiculite, pumice, sand, gravel, polystyrene, and a hydroponic growing mat. In one embodiment, the hydroponic growing mat is referred to as a microgreen mat. In some cases, the hydroponic growing medium may be placed into a net-cup. A net-cup is a container having an open top, a bottom and a surface between the top and bottom. Both the bottom and the surface between the top and the bottom have holes, slots, openings or the like.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a high-level diagram of an embodiment for some of the elements of a hydroponic system <b>100</b>, where many of the illustrated components are developed in more detail in the following discussion. One or more trays <b>101</b> are arranged to each hold one or more plants suspended above a layer of water so that roots of the plants can absorb the water and nutrients in the water. The content of the water and nutrients, or &#x201c;water profile&#x201d;, can be chosen based upon the plants being grown and their stages of development. Above each tray a light source <b>103</b> can be provided over the tray. In an outdoor use, natural lighting can be used, but the light sources <b>103</b> can be used to augment or replace natural lighting in situations with insufficient natural lighting. The following will mainly consider embodiments for indoor usage and include a light source <b>103</b> above each tray <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To provide the water (e.g., aqueous hydroponic nutrient) to the trays, a water re-circulation system is used. The water re-circulation system can include a pump <b>113</b> to supply the water and plant nutrients from a water reservoir or tank <b>111</b>. The pump <b>113</b> is connected to the water tank <b>111</b> to supply trays <b>101</b> and can supply one or more of the trays <b>101</b> directly or a tray can be supplied from another tray. In the embodiments mainly presented in the follow discussion, the trays <b>101</b> are arranged vertically so that the pump <b>113</b> will supply the top-most tray <b>101</b> directly, which will in turn supply a lower lying tray <b>101</b> in a gravity fed arrangement. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a top-most tray <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> is fed directly, that will feed a lower tray <b>101</b>-<b>2</b>, that will in turn feed a lower lying tray, and so on to the lowest lying tray <b>101</b>-<i>n</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the pump <b>113</b> feeding a series of multiple trays, but other embodiment may have only a single tray, in which case the lowest lying tray <b>101</b>-<i>n </i>will be the only tray and fed directly from the <b>113</b>. In other embodiments, a single water re-circulation system can feed more than one series of trays, each series having one or more trays and where the number of trays in the different series can differ.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition to the pump <b>113</b> and tank <b>111</b>, the water re-circulation system includes the plumbing to deliver the water (e.g., aqueous hydroponic nutrient) from the tank to the trays <b>101</b> from the tank <b>111</b> and deliver the water back to the tank <b>111</b>. In the multi-tray, gravity fed series arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pump <b>113</b> supplies the top-most tray <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> from the tank <b>111</b> with a supply tube <b>115</b>. For example, the supply tube <b>115</b> can be plastic or other flexible tubing, or PVC or metal piping. The following embodiments will mainly describe a flexible plastic tubing, as this is often convenient and easy to install. The diameter of the supply tube <b>115</b> can be chosen based upon the capability of the pump <b>113</b> and height of the tray <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> that it is supplying directly.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the supply tube <b>115</b> runs up though a pipe <b>119</b> that extends upward through the vertically arranged trays <b>101</b> to the top-most tray <b>101</b>-<b>1</b>, serving as a conduit for the supply tube <b>115</b> and also as an auxiliary or overflow drainpipe. For this purpose, the conduit/auxiliary drainpipe <b>119</b> is arranged so that any of the water (e.g., aqueous hydroponic nutrient) that flows into conduit/auxiliary drainpipe <b>119</b> will flow back into the water tank <b>111</b>. When the trays <b>101</b> are arranged vertically one over the other, the conduit/auxiliary drainpipe <b>119</b> can be a set of straight pipe sections, such as formed of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), stacked one above the other as a vertical column. In other embodiments, the supply tube <b>115</b> need not use the auxiliary drainpipe <b>119</b> as a conduit, in which case the pipe <b>119</b> may be eliminated; or the pipe <b>119</b> may serve only as a conduit for the supply tube <b>115</b>, without serving as an auxiliary drain pipe for overflow protection; however, the following discussion will mainly refer to embodiments using a combined conduit and auxiliary drainpipe function for the pipe <b>119</b>, as this can provide overflow protection as well as provide a convenient path from the pump <b>113</b> to the top-most tray <b>101</b>-<b>1</b>. In the following, the pipe <b>119</b> will mainly be referred to as an auxiliary or overflow drainpipe.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each tray <b>101</b> will have a (primary) drain opening to which is connected a drainpipe <b>117</b>. For the lower-most tray <b>101</b>-<i>n</i>, the corresponding drainpipe <b>117</b>-<i>n </i>can drain directly back into the tank <b>111</b>. For the higher trays, the drain pipe of each tray can supply the tray of the next lower level in a gravity fed series arrangement, so that, for example, the drainpipe <b>117</b>-<b>1</b> from tray <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> supplies tray <b>101</b>-<b>2</b> and the lower-most tray <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> can be supplied by the drain pipe <b>117</b>-(<i>n</i>&#x2212;1) of the preceding tray of the series. The drainpipes can again be made of PVC pipe sections, such as a straight pipe section that ends in an elbow when supplying an underlying tray. In a single layer embodiment with only one tray, the single tray would be supplied directly from supply tube <b>115</b> and then its drainpipe would flow directly back to the tank <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Embodiments of the hydroponic system <b>100</b> can include control circuitry <b>121</b> of varying levels of automation. For example, the control circuitry <b>121</b> can be connected for controlling the pump <b>113</b> and lighting elements <b>103</b>. The system can also include a water level sensor <b>125</b> to monitor the level of water (e.g., aqueous hydroponic nutrient) in the tank <b>111</b>.

In other embodiments, these values can alternately or additionally be determined manually. Based on the monitoring, the water profile can be adjusted manually or automatically by adding nutrients and pH agents. In some embodiments, based on the monitoring the control circuitry <b>121</b> can automatically adjust the water profile by use of pumps <b>135</b> connected to supply the tank <b>111</b> from reservoirs <b>133</b> for nutrients and pH agents.

The hydroponic systems <b>100</b> may be implemented by any of the hydroponic systems <b>100</b> disclosed herein, but are not limited thereto. In some embodiments, a hydroponic system <b>100</b> contains one or more sensors <b>131</b> to collect information about the water in the hydroponic system <b>100</b>. Examples of the one or more sensors <b>131</b> include a pH sensor, a water level sensor, and an EC sensor. The hydroponic systems <b>100</b> may be configured to report the information collected by the sensors to an electronic device <b>1910</b>. In one embodiment, wireless communication is used. For example, a hydroponic system <b>100</b> and an electronic device <b>1910</b> may each have Bluetooth capability. The one or more sensors <b>131</b> are not required, as a user could make measurements manually.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The electronic devices <b>1910</b> comprise a hydroponic client <b>1908</b>, which may be software that is executed on the electronic device <b>1910</b>. The electronic devices <b>1910</b> have a display/interface <b>123</b> that may be used to display information to a user, as well as allow the user to input information. The electronic devices <b>1910</b> could be a device such as, but not limited to, a smart phone, a laptop computer, a notepad computer, desktop computer, or a personal digital assistant. In one embodiment, the hydroponic clients <b>1908</b> are configured to collect information about the plants in the hydroponic systems <b>100</b> and report that information to the central controller <b>1902</b>. In one embodiment, the hydroponic client <b>1908</b> receives information such as what types of plants are being grown in a hydroponic system <b>100</b>, as well as the stages of plant growth. Examples of stages of plant growth include, but are not limited to, germination, mid growth, flower, fruit, and harvest. A user may provide this information by way of an interface provided in a display screen <b>123</b> of the electronic device <b>1910</b>. In one embodiment, the hydroponic client <b>1908</b> receives plant observations by way of the interface. An example of a plant observation is how long it took a plant to reach a certain growth stage. Another example plant observation is leaf condition (e.g., leaf color, leave drop). The hydroponic client <b>1908</b> is configured to provide the information it collects to the central controller <b>1902</b>. For example, each electronic device <b>1910</b> and the central controller <b>1902</b> may communicate by means of one or more communication networks <b>1912</b> such as the Internet. The one or more networks <b>1912</b> allow a particular computing device to connect to and communicate with another computing device.

The water profile calculator <b>1904</b> is configured to calculate a water profile for a hydroponic system <b>100</b> based on the information received from an electronic device <b>1910</b>, as well as information in the plant tables <b>2000</b>. The central controller <b>1902</b> provides the water profile to the electronic device <b>1910</b>, such that the hydroponic client <b>1908</b> can either control the hydroponic system <b>100</b> to achieve the water profile, or provide instructions to a user as to what nutrients and/or pH adjustments to make to achieve the water profile. Note that an electronic device <b>1910</b> can also have a water profile calculator <b>1904</b>, wherein the electronic device <b>1910</b> could calculate the water profile without the assistance of the central controller <b>1902</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The central controller <b>1902</b> has a plant observation aggregator <b>1906</b> that is configured to aggregate the plant the observations from the electronic devices <b>1910</b>. The central controller <b>1902</b> is configured to modify the information in the plant tables <b>2000</b>, in an embodiment. For example, the plant observation aggregator <b>1906</b> could modify the nutrient needs of a certain type of plant, based on the collected observations. The plant observation aggregator <b>1906</b> is further configured to determine a value for a parameter that is used by the water profile calculator <b>1904</b>. For example, based on the plant observations, the plant observation aggregator <b>1906</b> may determine that the time that it takes a certain type of plant to reach a certain growth stage should be adjusted from 60 days to 58 days. This may cause the water profile calculator <b>1904</b> to access a different plant table <b>2000</b>, in some cases.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">A net impact is that this change in parameter value may result in a different water profile from the water profile calculator <b>1904</b> for a given set of data. For example, the data may include the amount of time that has passed since a given type of plant (e.g., tomato plant) was started in a hydroponic system <b>100</b>. The plant may have different nutrient requirements after it reaches this growth stage. Thus, the change from 60 days 58 days to reach the growth stage means that the water profile will change at 58 days instead of at 60 days. Therefore, by aggregating plant observations from many users the accuracy of the water profile can be improved.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The central controller <b>1902</b> may be implemented with a computer system having a processor and non-transitory memory. The water profile calculator <b>1904</b> and plant observation aggregator <b>1906</b> may be implemented by software that is stored in the non-transitory memory and executed on the processor. In one embodiment, the central controller <b>1902</b> is referred to as a web server.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is table <b>2000</b> that defines example conditions and nutrient needs of various types of plants that might be grown in a hydroponic system <b>100</b>. The table <b>2000</b> is for one particular growth stage. There may be a similar table for other growth stages. For example, table <b>2000</b> could be for the harvest stage. There may be similar tables for germination, mid-growth, flower, and fruit stages. The table <b>2000</b> has a row for each of numerous types of plants (which may also be referred to as &#x201c;crops&#x201d;). The rank multiplier is a factor that indicates how much weight is given to the plant in that row during a calculation of a water profile for a hydroponic system <b>100</b> that contains multiple types of crops, and will be discussed in more detail below. The pH is a target water pH for the plant in that row, for this stage of plant growth. This example is simplified in that different plants may have a different target pH. The EC (electrical conductivity) is a maximum water EC for the plant in that row, for this stage of plant growth. This example is simplified in that different plants may have a different target EC. Note that the pH and the EC refer to the water that re-circulates in the hydroponic system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The columns labeled &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d;, and &#x201c;C&#x201d; are for different plant nutrient mixtures. Each nutrient mixture provides a different mix of plant nutrients. In one embodiment, one of the plant nutrient mixtures contains at least one plant nutrient not found in the other two plant nutrient mixtures. For example, one of the plant nutrient mixtures may contain magnesium, whereas the other two do not. In one embodiment, two of the plant nutrient mixtures contain the same plant nutrients, but the concentrations of at least some of the plant nutrients are different. For example, one of the mixtures may provide a much larger amount of potassium than the other. In one embodiment, the plant nutrient mixtures are hydroponic nutrient solutions. A hydroponic nutrient solution is a concentrated aqueous solution that contains plant nutrients.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In one embodiment, two of the plant nutrient mixtures provide Fe, N, Ca, and K. However, the concentration (in ppm) of at least some of these plant nutrients is different. For example, the concentration of N and Ca might be higher in nutrient mixture A than in nutrient mixture C; however, the concentration of K might be higher in nutrient mixture C. It is not required for all of the plant nutrients to have different concentrations. For example, the concentration of Fe might be the same in nutrient mixture A and nutrient mixture C.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In one embodiment, one the plant nutrient mixtures provides Mg, S, B, Cu, Zn, Mn, Mo, Na, K, and P. For example, nutrient mixture B might contain these plant nutrients, whereas plant nutrient mixture A and plant nutrient mixture C might not contain any of these. However, plant nutrient mixture A and/or plant nutrient mixture C could contain one or more of Mg, S, B, Cu, Zn, Mn, Mo, Na, K, and P.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">There could be more than three different plant nutrient mixtures. In one embodiment, only two different plant nutrient mixtures are used. There are a multitude of ways that plant nutrient mixtures may be formulated such that each plant nutrient mixture provides a different mix of plant nutrients.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The values in the rows in the plant nutrient mixture columns may be referred to herein as &#x201c;Nutrient Ratios.&#x201d; The Nutrient Ratio is expressed as A/B/C, in one embodiment. For example, the nutrient ratio in table <b>2000</b> for lettuce is 1/1/0. In this example, the nomenclature &#x201c;Nutrient Ratio A&#x201d; will be used to refer to the value of &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;Nutrient Ratio B&#x201d; will be used to refer to the value of &#x201c;B&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Nutrient Ratio C&#x201d; will be used to refer to the value of &#x201c;C.&#x201d; For example, for lettuce, Nutrient Ratio A has a value of 1, Nutrient Ratio B has a value of 1, and Nutrient Ratio C has a value of 0. As noted above, the plant nutrient mixtures in table <b>2000</b> are hydroponic nutrient solutions, in one embodiment.

The process <b>2100</b> is implemented by the central controller <b>1902</b>, in one embodiment. Step <b>2102</b> includes the central controller <b>1902</b> receiving plant observations from electronic devices <b>1910</b>. The plant observations are provided by a user of a hydroponic system <b>100</b>, in an embodiment. In one embodiment, the plant observations include data on how long it took a type plant to reach a certain growth stage. For example, the plant observations from one user may include data of how many days it took a tomato plant to reach the fruit stage. If the user has multiple tomato plants, the user might provide data for each plant. Another example observation is leaf conditions. For example, if a user notices that a plant has leaves that brown, this may be an indication of a problem with the water profile (e.g., the plant nutrients or pH). If many user's report such problems, this may be an indication that the central controller <b>1902</b> should change the water profile it provides, at least for hydroponic systems <b>100</b> that might be impacted by the foregoing problem with leaves turning brown.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Step <b>2104</b> includes the central controller <b>1902</b> modifying a technique for determining a water profile of one of more types of plants are determined based on the collective observations. One way in which the water profile may be specified is by table <b>2000</b> (or a similar table for other plant stages). With respect to table <b>2000</b>, the water profile may include some or all of pH, EC, Nutrient Ratio A, Nutrient Ratio B, Nutrient Ratio C. The water profile could be specified in another manner, such as ppm of various plant nutrients. One way to modify the technique for determining the water profile is to change one or more values in table <b>2000</b> (or a similar table for other plant stages). Another way to modify the technique for determining the water profile is to change what table <b>2000</b> is selected. For example, the central controller may determine that, based on the collective observations, tomato plants are reaching the fruit stage sooner than expected. Thus, the central controller <b>1902</b> may access a different plant table <b>2000</b> to determine the nutrient needs of tomatoes. As another example, the collective observations may be that a certain type of plant being grown in hydroponic systems <b>100</b> are exhibiting brown leaves, which may be an indication that the nutrition for that plant is not correct. Thus, the central controller <b>1902</b> may modify the nutrient needs (e.g., the values in columns labeled &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;C&#x201d;) in table <b>2000</b> to correct the nutrient problem.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Step <b>2106</b> includes providing a water profile for plants grown in a hydroponic system <b>100</b> to at least one of the electronic devices <b>1910</b> based on the modified technique for determining the water profile for the specified type of plant. The water profile may be specified in a number of ways. In one embodiment, the water profile is specified as a first amount of Nutrient mixture A, a second amount of Nutrient mixture B, and third amount of Nutrient mixture C. In this example, the amount of one or two of the nutrient mixtures may be zero. The water profile could be specified in terms of ppm of various plant nutrients. The water profile could be specified in terms of amounts of various salts that provide the plant nutrients.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a flowchart of one embodiment of a process <b>2200</b> of providing a water profile for plants grown in a hydroponic system <b>100</b>.
