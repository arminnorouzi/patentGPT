For example, a hydraulic fracturing system may be configured to fracture a formation by pumping a fracturing fluid into a well at high pressure and high flow rates. Some fracturing fluids may take the form of a slurry including water, proppants, and/or other additives, such as thickening agents and/or gels. The slurry may be forced via one or more pumps into the formation at rates faster than can be accepted by the existing pores, fractures, faults, or other spaces within the formation. As a result, pressure may build rapidly to the point where the formation may fail and may begin to fracture. By continuing to pump the fracturing fluid into the formation, existing fractures in the formation are caused to expand and extend in directions away from a well bore, thereby creating additional flow paths to the well bore. The proppants may serve to prevent the expanded fractures from closing or may reduce the extent to which the expanded fractures contract when pumping of the fracturing fluid is ceased. Once the formation is fractured, large quantities of the injected fracturing fluid may be allowed to flow out of the well, and the production stream of hydrocarbons may be obtained from the formation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prime movers may be used to supply power to hydraulic fracturing pumps for pumping the fracturing fluid into the formation. For example, a plurality of gas turbine engines and/or reciprocating-piston engines may each be mechanically connected to a corresponding hydraulic fracturing pump via a transmission and operated to drive the hydraulic fracturing pump. The prime mover, hydraulic fracturing pump, transmission, and auxiliary components associated with the prime mover, hydraulic fracturing pump, and transmission may be connected to a common platform or trailer for transportation and set-up as a hydraulic fracturing unit at the site of a fracturing operation, which may include up to a dozen or more of such hydraulic fracturing units operating together to perform the fracturing operation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Partly due to the large number of components of a hydraulic fracturing system, it may be difficult to efficiently and effectively control the output of the numerous hydraulic fracturing units and related components. For example, at times during a fracturing operation, there may be an excess or deficit of power available to perform the fracturing operation. Thus, when excess power exists, efficiency may be reduced by operating more of the hydraulic fracturing units than necessary to perform the fracturing operation. Alternatively, an operator of the hydraulic fracturing system may idle one or more of the hydraulic fracturing units to save energy. However, operating the prime movers at idle for an extended period of time may result in premature wear of the prime mover requiring more frequent maintenance. If, alternatively, a deficit of available power exists, an operator may cause the prime movers to operate at maximum power (or close to maximum power), which may lead to premature wear or failure of the prime mover, resulting in maintenance or replacement, as well as undesirable down time for the fracturing operation. In addition, because the conditions associated with a fracturing operation may often change during the fracturing operation, the power necessary to continue the fracturing operation may change over time, resulting in changes in the required power output to perform the fracturing operation. In such situations, it may be difficult for an operator to continuously monitor and change the outputs of the prime movers according to the changing conditions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, Applicant has recognized a need for systems and methods that provide improved operation of hydraulic fracturing units during hydraulic fracturing operations. The present disclosure may address one or more of the above-referenced drawbacks, as well as other possible drawbacks.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As referenced above, due to the complexity of a hydraulic fracturing operation and the high number of machines involved, it may be difficult to efficiently and effectively control the power output of the prime movers and related components to perform the hydraulic fracturing operation, particularly during changing conditions. In addition, manual control of the hydraulic fracturing units by an operator may result in delayed or ineffective responses to instances of excesses and deficits of available power of the prime movers occurring during the hydraulic fracturing operation. Insufficiently prompt responses to such events may lead to inefficiencies or premature equipment wear or damage, which may reduce efficiency and lead to delays in completion of a hydraulic fracturing operation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure generally is directed to systems and methods for semi- or fully-autonomously operating hydraulic fracturing units to pump fracturing fluid into a wellhead.

In some embodiments, one or more of the hydraulic fracturing units <b>12</b> may include a hydraulic fracturing pump <b>16</b> driven by an internal combustion engine <b>18</b>, such as a gas turbine engine or a reciprocating-piston engine and/or a non-gas turbine engine, such as a reciprocating-piston diesel engine. For example, in some embodiments, each of the hydraulic fracturing units <b>12</b> may include a directly-driven turbine (DDT) hydraulic fracturing pump <b>16</b>, in which the hydraulic fracturing pump <b>16</b> is connected to one or more GTEs that supply power to the respective hydraulic fracturing pump <b>16</b> for supplying fracturing fluid at high pressure and high flow rates to a formation. For example, the GTE may be connected to a respective hydraulic fracturing pump <b>16</b> via a transmission <b>20</b> (e.g., a reduction transmission) connected to a drive shaft, which, in turn, is connected to a driveshaft or input flange of a respective hydraulic fracturing pump <b>16</b>, which may be a reciprocating hydraulic fracturing pump. Other types of engine-to-pump coupling arrangements are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, one or more of the GTEs may be a dual-fuel or bi-fuel GTE, for example, capable of being operated using of two or more different types of fuel, such as natural gas and diesel fuel, although other types of fuel are contemplated. For example, a dual-fuel or bi-fuel GTE may be capable of being operated using a first type of fuel, a second type of fuel, and/or a combination of the first type of fuel and the second type of fuel. For example, the fuel may include gaseous fuels, such as, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), natural gas, field gas, pipeline gas, methane, propane, butane, and/or liquid fuels, such as, for example, diesel fuel (e.g., #2 diesel), bio-diesel fuel, bio-fuel, alcohol, gasoline, gasohol, aviation fuel, and other fuels as will be understood by those skilled in the art. Gaseous fuels may be supplied by CNG bulk vessels, a gas compressor, a liquid natural gas vaporizer, line gas, and/or well-gas produced natural gas. Other types and associated fuel supply sources are contemplated. The one or more internal combustion engines <b>18</b> may be operated to provide horsepower to drive the transmission <b>20</b> connected to one or more of the hydraulic fracturing pumps <b>16</b> to safely and successfully fracture a formation during a well stimulation project or fracturing operation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the fracturing fluid may include, for example, water, proppants, and/or other additives, such as thickening agents and/or gels. For example, proppants may include grains of sand, ceramic beads or spheres, shells, and/or other particulates, and may be added to the fracturing fluid, along with gelling agents to create a slurry as will be understood by those skilled in the art. The slurry may be forced via the hydraulic fracturing pumps <b>16</b> into the formation at rates faster than can be accepted by the existing pores, fractures, faults, or other spaces within the formation. As a result, pressure may build rapidly to the point where the formation fails and begins to fracture. By continuing to pump the fracturing fluid into the formation, existing fractures in the formation may be caused to expand and extend in directions away from a well bore, thereby creating additional flow paths to the well. The proppants may serve to prevent the expanded fractures from closing or may reduce the extent to which the expanded fractures contract when pumping of the fracturing fluid is ceased. Once the well is fractured, large quantities of the injected fracturing fluid may be allowed to flow out of the well, and the water and any proppants not remaining in the expanded fractures may be separated from hydrocarbons produced by the well to protect downstream equipment from damage and corrosion. In some instances, the production stream may be processed to neutralize corrosive agents in the production stream resulting from the fracturing process.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hydraulic fracturing system <b>10</b> may include one or more water tanks <b>22</b> for supplying water for fracturing fluid, one or more chemical additive units <b>24</b> for supplying gels or agents for adding to the fracturing fluid, and one or more proppant tanks <b>26</b> (e.g., sand tanks) for supplying proppants for the fracturing fluid. The example fracturing system <b>10</b> shown also includes a hydration unit <b>28</b> for mixing water from the water tanks <b>22</b> and gels and/or agents from the chemical additive units <b>24</b> to form a mixture, for example, gelled water. The example shown also includes a blender <b>30</b>, which receives the mixture from the hydration unit <b>28</b> and proppants via conveyers <b>32</b> from the proppant tanks <b>26</b>. The blender <b>30</b> may mix the mixture and the proppants into a slurry to serve as fracturing fluid for the hydraulic fracturing system <b>10</b>. Once combined, the slurry may be discharged through low-pressure hoses <b>34</b>, which convey the slurry into two or more low-pressure lines <b>36</b> in a frac manifold <b>38</b>. In the example shown, the low-pressure lines <b>36</b> in the frac manifold <b>38</b> feed the slurry to the hydraulic fracturing pumps <b>16</b> through low-pressure suction hoses <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The hydraulic fracturing pumps <b>16</b>, driven by the respective internal combustion engines <b>18</b>, discharge the slurry (e.g., the fracturing fluid including the water, agents, gels, and/or proppants) at high flow rates and/or high pressures through individual high-pressure discharge lines <b>42</b> into two or more high-pressure flow lines <b>44</b>, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;missiles,&#x201d; on the fracturing manifold <b>38</b>. The flow from the high-pressure flow lines <b>44</b> is combined at the fracturing manifold <b>38</b>, and one or more of the high-pressure flow lines <b>44</b> provide fluid flow to a manifold assembly <b>46</b>, sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;goat head.&#x201d; The manifold assembly <b>46</b> delivers the slurry into a wellhead manifold <b>48</b>. The wellhead manifold <b>48</b> may be configured to selectively divert the slurry to, for example, one or more wellheads <b>50</b> via operation of one or more valves. Once the fracturing process is ceased or completed, flow returning from the fractured formation discharges into a flowback manifold, and the returned flow may be collected in one or more flowback tanks as will be understood by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one or more of the components of the fracturing system <b>10</b> may be configured to be portable, so that the hydraulic fracturing system <b>10</b> may be transported to a well site, quickly assembled, operated for a relatively short period of time until completion of a fracturing operation, at least partially disassembled, and transported to another location of another well site for use.
