description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a computer implemented system and method to self-organize the online workers in an online platform and marketplace for a group freelance service provisioning and multi-tier incentive or bonus distribution.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In current time, the internet has become the venue for displaying or selling each and every product, content, service and even skills which attract tremendous number of online workers, freelancers, independent contractors, content creators and so on to join the internet based freelance platforms and exhibition channels to exhibit their skills or work remotely using the internet. For example, freelance experts are increasingly joining the Internet sales channel and platforms to enhance awareness of their services. Online work marketplaces and platforms help clients and contractors, i.e. freelance experts, across the country, region, or globe, to connect with each other and work for each other.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">But, the problem with the present online work marketplaces and platforms is that they use a referral method but with one-time bonus or commission for the freelancers or contractors who promotes the platform and joins other skilled persons with the platform as a service provider which normally fails to motivate the freelancer to bring more skilled freelancer to join with the platform resulting in negative growth rate of the platform.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Even as the online platform grows, a fundamental problem that the platform has to solve is how to organize the online workers so that they can provide the best services to clients or platform visitors. Without such help, the growth of freelance workers on the platform slows down and the quality of services provided by the platform deteriorates. Also, with independent working of every freelancer over the online platform decreases growth rate and competitiveness of freelancer as compared to working of freelancers in a group.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The platform availability fails because of the reason that they don't allow the freelancers to form a group or a team with other freelancers of the platform or refrain one group to connect with other group over the platform to share information with each other resulting in decrease in potential of service provisioning in the online platform.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, the hiring process of online workers is not only time consuming, but it is also error-prone since it is usually difficult to thoroughly assess the qualifications of each and every online worker (e.g. education and work experience from schools and companies that are unknown), thereby hard to guarantee quality of services provided to clients. Understanding and modelling the hiring of online workers is challenging not only due to the variety of skills and expertise of online workers globally and the diversity of them, but also due to the heterogeneity of work requirements of clients.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there exist a need of a computer implemented platform with an incentive module and scheme to provide commissions, incentives and bonus to freelancer for successful working with other members of the group that may encourage the freelancer to further promote the platform. Further, there exist a need of a self-organizing freelance platform that may allow freelancers to form and work in a team to provide better service to clients. Moreover, there exist a need of a self-organizing platform that may allow a freelancer to select the mentor, select the group and/or change the mentor or group to better handle the dynamics of client's demand.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various implementations of methods within the scope of the appended claims each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for the desirable attributes described herein. Without limiting the scope of the appended claims, some prominent features are described herein. Details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a computer implemented system and method for automated multi-tier self-organizing of freelancers on any platform or marketplace over web to provide high-quality freelance services over said platform or marketplace in a group and to share the commission or bonus from working of other members of group as well as from working of down-line freelance workforce of multi-tier organization.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one embodiment, the system of the present invention is made of a computer implemented web based self-organizing freelance (SOF) system, and hardware components including an input/output user interface, a processor, a memory module and a database all of which are interconnected and communicatively coupled with each other, wherein the user interface allows user to access the system to input data and to receive notifications from the system. The processor is configured within the servers of the system to carry out the instructions stored within the memory of the system over the data of users of the system. Also, it saves the said processed data over databases of the system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one embodiment, the system includes a computer programs instructions stored within the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium (memory) provided to direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to execute said computer program instruction for working of each module of the self-organizing freelance system, wherein the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium is any device used for storing the data including Read Only Memory (ROM), Random Access Memory (RAM), Magnetic Disk Storage Medium, Optical Storage Medium, or Flash Memory Devices etc.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one embodiment, the system of automatic self-organizing of freelancers in multiple tiers is provided to encourage any freelancers, content creators or any other contractors to promote the marketplace through their own channels by providing proper incentives for the freelancers for their own work as well as for other members of multi-tier arrangement down to the said freelancers. This incentive scheme of present system motivates the freelancers to attract other people such as their friends, colleagues to join said freelancer and work on a project together as a group. The system allows others to join the hierarchy of a first freelance worker or automatically arranges the workforce in a manner such that the freelancer may also have the commission earning for the work done by other members of the group over the internet.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one embodiment, the self-organizing freelance system of present invention includes or is made of a mentorship module or a group formation module, a group evolution module, and a payment calculation module. According to one embodiment of present invention, the group formation module is provided to allow a mentor freelancer, aka group head, to create a group by promoting and sharing referral to potential freelance workers to join the platform and the group of said mentor freelancer over the self-organizing freelance platform of present invention thus allowing the mentor freelancer to earn a reward earning or bonus from the earning of all the freelance members of the group.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one embodiment, the system may request the user for the referral of the mentor under which the user desires to join. According to one embodiment, the Group Formation Module of present system allows the mentor to share the referral, which may be in the form of a clickable link or a code, using which the user may join the online marketplace as a downline or as a team member to said mentor freelancer, wherein the mentor freelancer may be a member of another group of the platform.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one aspect of present invention, the mentorship module, aka the group formation module, is further provided to allow freelancer to form teams automatically to work on freelance jobs on the freelance platform which in turn may provide better service to client over the platform, as in most cases, services provided by a team is better than an individual freelancer. Further, the group formation module may allow at least one team of the platform to be connected with the at least one other team through group head of one team so that they may share information with each other using a communication tool, thereby forming a complete network working on the online platform.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one embodiment, the group evolution module of the multi-tier freelance platform of present invention is configured to allow any user or a group member to change the mentor or a mentor to kick out a member of his group. Further, the group evolution module of present invention is provided to allow the automatic evolution of teams so that they may better handle the dynamics of client demands. According to one embodiment, the group evolution module of present system further facilitates change of group members in the group which includes adding a new group member, removing an existing group member, transferring a group member into another group, and banning a group member from participating group activities for a period of time or permanently.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one embodiment, the payment calculation module of present system is made of a freelance earning calculation module and a multi-tier incentive calculation module, wherein the freelance earning calculation module is provided to calculate direct earnings of the freelancer while the incentive calculation module is configured to calculate incentive for freelancers for recruitment of others into the multi-level self-organizing freelance platform as a downline freelancer and forming own working group, thereby becoming the mentor of the recruited freelancers and the group mentor. Also, the incentive calculation module also allows a freelancer to earn compensation on the earnings of other freelancers.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one embodiment, this commission and incentive schemes by the incentive calculation module of present system encourages hiring of more skilled team members by the group or joining more skilled teams by the freelancers, which indirectly increases efficiency of the group to successfully complete the tasks and fulfill the requirements of the clients/visitors over the platform thus helping with growth of each freelancers, groups as well as platform itself. Also, hiring of capable team members by the existing freelancers/mentors over the platform eliminates need of exhaustive examination of the freelancer by the administration team of the system of present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The system of present invention allows freelancers in the group to discuss a project or ask for help using chat and/or email and/or any other communication tool provided by the present system. Further, the system and present self-organizing freelance platform allows the freelancer members of a group to form a forum or meeting where they may learn from each other thus creating a micro eco-system in each group which may increase work bonding and understanding between the members. According to one embodiment, each mentor freelancer of the group may also be a group member to other group which enables information sharing between two groups through the mentor and vice versa in exchange of incentive to the mentor freelancer.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates interface diagram of user with one embodiment of the invented system.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a detailed example diagram of the invented system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows functional components of the invented system</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a self-organized multi-tier freelancer tree structure of the multi-level SOF platform of present system</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. is an exemplary flow diagram illustrating method of mentorship change in the Group Evolution Module of present system</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. illustrates an exemplary flow diagram illustrating a method of Multi-Tier Incentive Calculation Module</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The technology of the present application is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements.

The Multi-Tier Incentive Calculation Module <b>305</b> first determines the group commission of a mentor, aka group head <b>601</b> using an indirect earnings function. For example, a freelancer may earn a group commission from the earnings of the members in his downline freelancers on his multi-tier organization or tree. In one example of the invention, said group commission can be a percentage of the freelance earnings of each downline freelance member. For example, group commission can be 10% of the freelance earnings of all directly hired freelance members, i.e. the freelancers on the first level of the recruiting tree of the mentor freelancer. In another example of the invention, the percentage of the freelance earnings of each downline freelance member used to determine the group commission may be a function of the level on the recruiting tree of this mentor freelancer. For example, group commission can be the total of 10% of the freelance earnings of all freelances on the first level, plus 5% of the freelance earnings of all freelancers on the second level, plus 2.5% of the freelance earnings of all freelancers on the third level.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment of the invention, when the Multi-Tier Incentive Calculation Module <b>305</b> determines mentor's group commission, the Multi-Tier Incentive Calculation Module <b>305</b> may first examine if the mentor freelancer and his group meet certain performance criterion and pays the group commission to the mentor freelancer only if said performance criterion is met. In one example, said performance criterion can be a minimum number of new freelancers that needs to be recruited in a certain period of time. In another example, said performance criterion can be a minimum number of freelance jobs that needs to be completed in a certain period of time by either the mentor freelancer or his group. In one example, said performance criterion can be a minimum amount of total freelance earnings that needs to be achieved by the mentor freelancer or his group members in a certain period of time.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The Multi-Tier Incentive Calculation Module <b>305</b> may further determine the mentor's society bonus <b>602</b> using a second indirect earnings function only if the group of the mentor meets certain society criterion. Additional incentive payment can be paid to the mentor if his group becomes a society. In one example of the embodiment, the society criterion is that the total number of freelancers on the recruiting tree of the mentor freelancer needs to exceed a number, e.g. 100. In another example of the embodiment, the society criterion is that the total number of freelancers on the first level of the recruiting tree of the mentor freelancer needs to exceed a number, e.g. 50. In another example of the embodiment, a group is elevated to a society if the total number of freelancers on the first level of the recruiting tree of the mentor freelancer exceeds a number, e.g. 50 and the society is degraded to a group if the total number drops below another lower number, e.g. 40. In one example of the embodiment, the society criterion is the total amount of freelance earnings of all the freelancers on the recruiting tree of the mentor freelancer in a predetermined period should exceed a number, e.g. 1000 USD. In one more example of the embodiment, the society criterion is the total amount of freelance earnings of all the freelancers on the first level of the recruiting tree of the mentor freelancer in a predetermined period should exceed a number, e.g. 1000 USD.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">To reward a mentor freelancer that has made the extraordinary contribution of building a society, the Multi-tier Incentive Calculation Module <b>305</b> determines that the mentor's society bonus may be paid to the mentor freelancer which is calculated using an indirect earnings function. For example, a freelancer may earn a society bonus calculated based on using the earnings of the members in his downline freelancers on his recruiting tree. In one example of the invention, said society bonus is a percentage of the freelance earnings of each downline freelance member. For example, the society bonus is 5% of the freelance earnings of all directly hired freelance members, i.e. the freelancers on the first level of his recruiting tree. In another example of the embodiment, the percentage of the freelance earnings of each downline freelance member used to determine the society bonus may be a function of the level on the recruiting tree. For example, society bonus is the total of 5% of the freelance earnings of all freelances on the first level, plus 4% of the freelance earnings of all freelancers on the second level, plus 3% of the freelance earnings of all freelancers on the third level. In another example of the embodiment, said society bonus is a percentage of the total of the group commissions plus society bonuses of all directly hired freelance members, i.e. the freelancers on the first level of the recruiting tree.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment of the invention, when the Multi-tier Incentive Calculation Module <b>305</b> determines mentor's society bonus, the Multi-tier Incentive Calculation Module <b>305</b> may first examine if the mentor freelancer and his group meet certain society activity criterion and pays the society bonus to the mentor freelancer only if said society activity criterion is met. In one example, said society activity criterion may be a minimum number of new freelancers that needs to be recruited in a certain period of time. In another example, said society activity criterion can be a minimum number of freelance jobs that needs to be completed in a certain period of time by either the mentor freelancer or his group. In one example, said society activity criterion may be a minimum amount of total freelance earnings that needs to be achieved by the mentor freelancer or his group in a certain period of time.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to one embodiment of the invention, the Multi-tier Incentive Calculation Module <b>305</b> also determines a Member Commission for members on the recruiting tree of the mentor freelancer based on using an indirect earnings function of earnings of other group members of the mentor freelancer. For example, the Member Commission can be a function of Group Commission and Society Bonus of the mentor freelancer. The idea being, that each freelancer will work to help other group members of his mentor to increase the freelance earnings of the whole group, thereby increasing the Member Commission of the freelancer himself. This motivates the creation of a self-organizing freelance groups where each freelancer helps each other. Freelancers will also tend to join groups where each freelancer performs well and mentors will be more willing to accept freelancers that can contribute to the freelance community.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one example of the embodiment, the Member Commission of a freelancer can be a function of Group Commission and Society Bonus of the freelancer's mentor. For example, the Member Commission of a freelancer may be a percentage of Mentor's Group Commission plus Mentor's Society Bonus divided by number of direct group members of the mentor. In one embodiment of the invention, when the Multi-tier Incentive Calculation Module <b>305</b> determines freelancer's Member Commission, the Multi-tier Incentive Calculation Module <b>305</b> may first examine if the freelancer meets certain performance criterion and pays the Member Commission to the freelancer only if said performance criterion is met.
