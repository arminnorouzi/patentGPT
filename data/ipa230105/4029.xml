For example, some automobile glass is integrated with a color-changing or a transparency-regulating function to regulate a color and transparency of glass according to a user's instruction or a change of the ambient environment (e.g., temperature, light intensity or the like). There is also some glass integrated with the functions such as lighting, display, heating, communication, host-guest interaction, or the like. For the glass integrated with a function of regulating a color or transparency, currently some automobile glass uses an electric control functional layer arranged in a laminated glass to form a functional glass. Since the electric control functional layer for example based on an electrochromic material, an electro-induced transparency-changing material or a host-guest liquid crystal material has characteristics such as electrochromic or electro-induced transparency-changing, the transparency and/or color of the functional glass using the electric control functional layer can be regulated by regulating the voltage applied to the electric control functional layer, to achieve a purpose such as privacy protection.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional electric control functional layers are mostly based on polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC). The PDLC is liquid crystal with micron-sized droplets dispersed in an organic solid polymer substrate. Since the optical axes of the droplets composed of liquid crystal molecules are in free orientation, their refractive indices do not match the refractive index of the substrate. Upon passing through the substrate, light is strongly scattered by the droplets and presents an opaque milky white state or a translucent state. The orientations of optical axes of the liquid crystal droplets may be regulated by applying an electric field through a controller, and when the refractive indices of the liquid crystal droplets and the substrate match, the liquid crystal presents a transparent state. After the electric field is removed, the liquid crystal droplets present an initial light diffusion state, thereby displaying.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most of the traditional controllers regulate the electrical signal applied to the functional glass by regulating the amplitude of the voltage to thereby regulate the parameters such as optical characteristic of the functional glass.

Definitions of terms are consistent throughout the specification unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With the continuous development of technology, glass also needs to integrate various functions to meet people's needs. The glass as mentioned herein may refer to glass used in transportation vehicles (such as automobiles, trains, ships, airplanes, and aircrafts), display glass, or architectural glass. The following description will mainly take automobile glass as an example to describe the concept of the present disclosure. It should be appreciated that the glass used in other aspects is similar to automobile glass, and will not be described hereunder respectively.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At present, the glass integrated with various functions is generally referred to as a functional glass <b>200</b>. A more common type of functional glass <b>200</b> is a dimming glass. Currently, most dimming glasses available on the market are integrally formed by placing a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) layer between two layers of glass, and then forming a single piece by high temperature and high pressure integrally gluing.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer comprises a polymer layer and liquid crystal droplets dispersed in the polymer layer. The polymer layer is made of a polymeric material. The polymer layer generally uses a material whose refractive index matches an ordinary refractive index of the liquid crystal droplets. The matching of refractive indices here means that the refractive index of the polymer layer is the same as the ordinary refractive index of the liquid crystal droplets (i.e., the refractive index of the liquid crystal droplets in a long-axis direction), or a ratio of the refractive index of the polymer layer to the ordinary refractive index of the liquid crystal droplets (i.e., the refractive index of the liquid crystal droplets in a long-axis direction) is in the range of 0.9 to 1.1.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Control electrodes are formed on surfaces of the two layers of glass facing the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer. An electric field is formed in the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer by applying a voltage to the control electrodes. Changes of the magnitude of the electric field may control the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer to switch between a transparent state and an opaque state to achieve the purpose of dimming.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, in the PDLC system, nematic liquid crystal is uniformly dispersed in a solid organic polymer substrate in a form of micron-sized droplets. When no voltage is applied, the optical axis of each small liquid crystal droplet is in a preferred orientation, whereas the optical axes of all droplets are in a disorderly orientation state. Since liquid crystal is a material with strong optical and dielectric anisotropy, its effective refractive index does not match the refractive index of the substrate (with a large difference). At this time, the incident light can be strongly scattered and present an opaque or translucent milky white state, as shown on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. When an external electric field is applied, the directions of the optical axes of the nematic liquid crystal molecules are uniformly along the direction of the electric field, and the ordinary refractive index of the liquid crystal droplets matches the refractive index of the substrate to a certain extent. The light may pass through the substrate and the substrate is in transparent or semi-transparent state, as shown on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. After the external electric field is removed, the liquid crystal particles return to their original scattered state under the action of the elastic energy of the substrate. Therefore, the polymer dispersed liquid crystal film has an electric control optical switching property under the action of the electric field.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The light transmission performance may be characterized by haze for example. The &#x201c;haze&#x201d; refers to the scattering capability of light. Specifically, a haze value is a ratio of a luminous flux of scattering light deflecting from the incident light direction through samples to a luminous flux of transmitting light, expressed as a percentage. For example, the greater the haze value, the stronger the material's ability to scatter light, and the less clear people's eyes can see. The haze value shown in the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> described above is at the maximum.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition to the haze value, an important parameter describing optical characteristics such as light transmittance performance is light transmittance. Light transmittance is a physical term, which means a capacity of light passing through a medium, and a percentage of the luminous flux of light through a transparent or translucent body to the luminous flux of the incident light. That is to say, contrary to the haze, the higher the light transmittance, the more transparent the medium (e.g., the electric control functional layer). The lower the light transmittance, the less clear people's eyes can see.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Taking the haze as an example, the haze value of the electric control functional layer changes along with the amplitude of the voltage applied to the electric control functional layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically shows a case in which the haze changes along with the amplitude of the voltage applied to the electric control functional layer. The abscissa of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> represents the amplitude of the applied voltage, and the ordinate represents the haze value. It may be seen that the change in haze with the applied voltage is not linear. For example, when the voltage value is between about 5V and 15V, the haze changes abruptly. However, when the applied voltage is below 5V and above 15V, the haze changes very slowly.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the following, for ease of description, the concept of &#x201c;transition rate&#x201d; will be introduced. The transition rate refers to, for example, a degree of change in the optical characteristics per unit time when the optical characteristics are regulated. The greater the rate, the greater the change in optical characteristics such as the haze per unit time, as shown in a region between about 5V and 15V of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The smaller the rate is, the smaller the degree of optical characteristics changes with the electrical signal per unit time, as shown in regions below 5V and above 15V of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">One of the problems brought about by this is failure to more finely regulate the optical characteristics of a functional glass, thereby providing users with more regulating options to meet diverse needs of users. The required mode may comprise a gradual regulation mode or an abrupt-change regulation mode. For example, since the change curve of the haze with the amplitude of the voltage is the curve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it is currently impossible to finely regulate the haze of the functional glass. For example, if the haze value needs to be regulated from 50% to 60%, the change of the voltage amplitude needs to be made very small. The regulation of such a very small voltage amplitude brings about a huge error, which makes it difficult to finely regulate the haze of the functional glass.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Through continuous research, the Inventor has discovered that in addition to the voltage amplitude, the frequency of the alternating current acting on the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> also affects the changes in the optical characteristics such as the haze of the functional glass. This brings an opportunity to finely regulate the optical characteristics and even other parameters of the functional glass <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, regulating the amplitude of the voltage applied to the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> alone cannot achieve fine regulation of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>, such as providing more transparency regulating options. However, the Inventor has discovered that changes in frequency can also cause changes in parameters such as light transmittance and haze of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>. The Inventor has conducted further research on the simultaneous regulations of the amplitude and frequency of the voltage acting on the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Through further research, the Inventor proposes a regulating device <b>100</b> for regulating the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> to solve or at least partially solve the above or other potential problems in the prior art. With the obtained electrical signal of which the voltage amplitude and frequency are double-regulated by introducing the frequency regulating, the change curve of the haze relative to the electrical signal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be adjusted, that is, the change of the haze becomes gentle (the slope of the curve becomes smaller) relative to the change of electrical signal of which the voltage amplitude and frequency are double-regulated, so that the characteristics of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may be regulated more finely.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should be appreciated that the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> mentioned herein is a layer whose some parameters will change by applying different electrical signals to the functional layer. For example, in some embodiments, the electrical signal may be used to regulate the optical characteristics of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electrical signal mentioned herein may refer to a voltage signal with a certain amplitude and frequency in some embodiments. The frequency here may be 0 in some embodiments, that is to say, the electrical signal may refer to a direct current electrical signal. In addition, in some embodiments, additionally or alternatively, the electrical signal may also refer to any one of a rising edge, a falling edge, a peak value, or a valley value in the voltage signal. That is, in some embodiments, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may also be regulated in response to the rising edge, the falling edge, the peak value, or the valley value of the voltage applied to the layer. For ease of description, the concept of the present disclosure will be mainly introduced below with an example where the electrical signal is alternating current. The situation where the electrical signal belongs to the rising edge, the falling edge, the peak value or the valley value of the voltage signal is similar to this, and will not be repeated in the following.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition to the above-mentioned regulation of transparency or haze, the regulating device according to embodiments of the present disclosure may further comprise regulating other optical characteristics including but not limited to color or degree of coloring. In other words, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may be a liquid crystal-based functional layer capable of changing optical characteristics such as light transmittance, haze, color, or degree of coloring. For example, the electric control functional layer may comprise one of an electrochromic (EC) material, an electro-induced transparency-changing material or a host-guest liquid crystal material in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, in some embodiments, the polymer in the electro-induced transparency-changing material may be transparent or colored. Dichroic dyes may be added to the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer, so that the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer appears colorful or black when no voltage is applied. Depending on types of dichroic dyes added, the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer may present a variety of different colors, such as green and red, when no voltage is applied. When a voltage is applied to the electric control functional layer, the degree of coloring of color or black of the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer decreases. As the voltage applied to the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> increases, the degree of coloring of the polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer gradually decreases, and tends to be colorless.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Certainly, it should be appreciated that the above-mentioned implementations of the change in the degree of coloring are only illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. Any other suitable way is also possible. For example, in some alternative embodiments, an electrochromic material may also be used for implementation. The electrochromic material refers to a material whose color may change under an action of external electric field and current. Its essence is that the chemical structure of the material changes under the action of the electric field, which in turn causes the change in the absorption spectrum of the material. According to the process of color change, the electrochromic material may be classified into irreversible color-changing materials with unidirectional color change, and reversible color-changing materials with more application value whose color may change in both directions.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some alternative embodiments, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may further comprise a host-guest liquid crystal material. The host-guest liquid crystal material is a liquid crystal material based on the host-guest effect (also referred to as the guest-host effect). The host-guest effect is an effect taking dichroic dyes with different absorptions of visible light along the long axis direction and the short axis direction as the guest, dissolved in the aligned liquid crystal host. The dichroic dye molecules (guest) will be arranged in the same direction as the nematic liquid crystal molecules (host) in a way that &#x201c;the guest changes with the host&#x201d;. When the arrangement of the liquid crystal molecules as the host changes under the action of the electric field, the arrangement direction of the dichroic dye molecules will also change accordingly, that is, the absorption of incident light by the dichroic dye will also change. That is to say, with the effect of re-arrangement of polychromatic dye molecules (guest) and nematic liquid crystal molecules (host) under the action of the electric field to cause color changes, the regulating of colors is enabled through the difference of the electrical signal acting on the electric control functional layer based on the host-guest liquid crystal.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Additionally or alternatively, in addition to the above-mentioned parameters related to optical characteristics that can be regulated, the parameters of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> that can be regulated may further comprise other various suitable parameters such as parameters for changing the heating intensity, luminous intensity through electric control, or parameters related to communication, display or host-guest interaction. For example, in some embodiments, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may also be a heating functional layer or a light emitting functional layer. The heating intensity of the heating functional layer or the luminescence intensity of the light-emitting functional layer is regulated more finely by controlling the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Hereinafter, the concept of the present disclosure will be described by taking the regulation of optical characteristics such as light transmittance, haze, color, or degree of coloring of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> as an example. Regarding the regulation of other parameters of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> such as parameters of the heating intensity and luminous intensity, or parameters related to communication, display or host-guest interaction, the principle is the same and will not be repeated in the following.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the electro-induced transparency-changing material may comprise one of the following types: suspended particle device (SPD), polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC), polymer network liquid crystal (PNLC), or polymer stabilized liquid crystal (PSLC). In comparison with PDLC, the liquid crystal in PNLC is not spherical (or ellipsoidal) droplets, but is distributed in a three-dimensional polymer network to form a continuous channel network. In case where a certain electrical signal is applied, the liquid crystal molecules with dielectric anisotropy are subjected to electric field torque, and their director direction will remain the same as the electric field, the incident light can transmit, and the PNLC film is in a bright state.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The polymer network stabilized liquid crystal film is a new type of photoelectric composite material in which a small amount of polymer forms a network to stabilize the orientation of liquid crystal. Unlike ordinary polymer dispersed liquid crystal film, since the refractive index changes due to different arrangement orientations of liquid crystal molecules in the polymer network, the PSLC film is in a transparent state when no electric field is applied. When a proper electric field is applied, due to the anchoring effect between the polymer network and the liquid crystal, the reorientation of some liquid crystals in the electric field will be restricted, so that the liquid crystal molecules are disorderly arranged, show different refractive indices, and scatter the incident light to cause the PSLC film to be in a fuzzy state. The regulating method and the regulating device <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the present disclosure may be applied to the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> based on the above-mentioned liquid crystal material, resulting in a wider application range.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A suspended particle device (also referred to a light valve) is a film in which liquid suspension droplets are distributed. Light-absorbing particles are dispersed in a liquid suspension. These randomly-oriented microscopic particles are usually made of black ceramic pigments (iron chromium oxide, copper chromium oxide or bismuth manganese oxide). These particles can reflect heat, especially near infrared radiation. The film is encapsulated between two glass or plastic plates coated with a transparent conductive material. When there is no voltage; the particles absorb light and prevent the light from passing through the film. When a voltage is applied, the particles are re-arranged so that light may pass through. By using a simple switch or other control device to regulate the voltage, the user may immediately regulate the light, glare, and heat emitted by a product such as a window. This gives users a certain range of transparency, where the light transmittance may be quickly changed according to the applied electrical signal.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, at least one of the electrochromic (EC) material, the electro-induced transparency-changing material, or the host-guest liquid crystal material mentioned above is forward, reverse, or bistable. Wherein &#x201c;forward&#x201d; means that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when a voltage is applied to the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> will transit from an opaque state to a transparent state. The &#x201c;reverse&#x201d; is the opposite, that is, when a voltage is applied to the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> will transit from a transparent state to an opaque state. In the above two cases, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> will return to the original opaque or transparent state after the applied voltage is removed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">&#x201c;Bistable&#x201d; means that even if the applied voltage is removed, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> will remain in the state when the voltage is applied. For example, in case where the haze of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> becomes 50% when a voltage of a certain amplitude and frequency is applied, even if the voltage is removed, the &#x201c;bistable&#x201d; electric control functional layer <b>201</b> will continue to maintain the haze, until the voltage of other amplitude and frequency acts on it. Therefore, the use of bistable liquid crystal materials can achieve more stable and energy-saving control.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted that in the following, the concept of the present disclosure will be described mainly by taking the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> comprising forward polymer dispersed liquid crystal as an example. For the case where the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> comprises the above-mentioned other materials, the principle is the same, and will not be repeated in the following.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example in which such an electric control functional layer <b>201</b> is applied to glass to form a functional glass <b>200</b>. The glass comprises a first glass <b>202</b> and a second glass <b>203</b> arranged on both sides of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>. Both the first glass <b>202</b> and the second glass <b>203</b> are single-layer glass. In the production process, various types of glass produced by existing different technologies, such as float glass, flat glass, tempered glass or the like, may be used. The shapes of the first glass <b>202</b> and the second glass <b>203</b> may be flat glass or curved glass with a certain curvature. The first glass <b>202</b> and the second glass <b>203</b> have certain transparency.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The electric control functional layer <b>201</b> is arranged between the first glass <b>202</b> and the second glass <b>203</b>.

For example, in some embodiments, the functional glass <b>200</b> may comprise a plurality of electric control functional layers <b>201</b> which are arranged between the glasses in a certain pattern. By separately controlling the plurality of electric control functional layers <b>201</b> to present different changes in light transmittance, haze, color or degree of coloring, the functional glass <b>200</b> as a whole may present different patterns or textures, such as gradation patterns.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition to being arranged between the glasses, in some embodiments, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may also be arranged on a side of the functional glass <b>200</b> by way of an adhesive, for example. In addition, in some alternative embodiments, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may also be used alone.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Next, how to regulate the above-mentioned electric control functional layer <b>201</b> by the regulating device <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the present disclosure will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of the regulating device <b>100</b>. As shown, in general, the regulating device <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the present disclosure comprises a voltage regulator <b>101</b> and a controller <b>103</b>. The regulating device <b>100</b> may be applied to any appropriate occasions where it can control the electrical signals acting on the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>, for example, applied in vehicles such as automobiles, trains, ships, aircrafts or the like, or inside buildings or the like.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The voltage regulator <b>101</b> may be coupled to, for example, a power supply on an automobile to receive an input voltage. The voltage regulator <b>101</b> may regulate the amplitude and frequency of the input voltage to generate an electric signal which is to act on the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>. For example, the voltage regulator <b>101</b> may convert a DC power input from the automobile power supply into an AC power or an electrical signal with a certain frequency and amplitude, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The above describes the case where the voltage connected to the voltage regulator <b>101</b> is, for example, the DC voltage of an automobile. For the case where the electrical signal is alternating current, in some embodiments, the alternating current may refer to alternating current having a sinusoidal waveform. In some alternative embodiments, the alternating current acting on the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may also have at least one of a square wave, a triangular wave, a trapezoidal wave, or any other appropriate waveform.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Certainly, it should be appreciated that when the regulating device <b>100</b> is applied in a building with AC power, the voltage regulator <b>101</b> may also directly regulate the amplitude and frequency of the input AC power to generate the alternating current which will act on the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The controller <b>103</b> is coupled to the voltage regulator <b>101</b>, and can receive a regulating signal and control the voltage regulator <b>101</b> according to the regulating signal to regulate the amplitude and frequency of the input voltage. Specifically, the controller <b>103</b> sends a control signal including an amplitude parameter and a frequency parameter of the voltage to the voltage regulator <b>101</b> according to the regulating signal to regulate the amplitude and frequency of the input voltage. In this way, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may be regulated as needed with the regulating signal.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Besides referring to a target amplitude and a target frequency corresponding to target characteristics such as optical characteristics to be regulated by the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>, the amplitude parameter and frequency parameter of the voltage mentioned herein further comprise all process amplitude parameters and process frequency parameters needed for the regulation from initial characteristics to target characteristics. For example, the control signal sent by the controller <b>103</b> not only comprises the target amplitude and target frequency corresponding to the target characteristics to be regulated, but also comprises the process amplitude parameters and frequency parameters corresponding to a regulating mode (e.g., a gradual regulation mode or an abrupt-change regulation mode) and required in the change from the initial amplitude and frequency to the target amplitude and frequency. It should be appreciated that the process amplitude parameter and the frequency parameter may be obtained in any appropriate manner such as manual preset, calculation according to a specific functional relationship, which will not be described in detail in the following.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Different from conventional solutions, the regulating device <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the present disclosure may simultaneously control the amplitude and frequency of the input voltage to regulate the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> more finely. For example, in the conventional solutions with amplitude regulation only, the haze may only be regulated with a gradation of 10% or even 20% near a voltage between about 5V and 15V. In the regulating device <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the present disclosure, the optical characteristics such as the haze of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may achieve finer regulation with a gradation of 5% or even less than 1%. That is to say, the user may incrementally or degressively regulate the transparency of the glass with the gradation of 5% or even less than 1%, thereby bringing about more diversified regulating options to users.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Such a more diversified and finer regulation can bring about a more comfortable experience to the human senses. That is, the user's experience is improved. At the same time, the realization of this fine regulation may enable more diversified control of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>, which will be further discussed later.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, the realization of the fine regulation also enables the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> to be regulated in any appropriate manner or mode. For example, in some embodiments, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may be regulated linearly gradually, abruptly, or in any desired mode at a certain transition rate. For example, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may also be regulated in a curve gradual regulation mode (i.e., at a changing transition rate). The curve gradual regulation mode is similar to the linear gradual regulation mode, as long as a corresponding transition rate parameter is duly set, which will be further discussed in the following. To facilitate understanding, the following will mainly take the linear gradual regulation mode as an example to describe the concept of the present disclosure, and other regulation modes are similar to the linear gradual regulation mode and will not be described in detail hereunder.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">How such desired regulation is implemented will be described hereunder with the changes of the haze. The principles for the light transmittance, color or degree of coloring are similar to that for the haze.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As mentioned above, when the haze of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> is changed only by regulating the amplitude of the voltage, the change tendency of the haze presents the curve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. According to the Inventor's discovery from research, the lower the frequency of the voltage applied to the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>, the lower the haze. As the frequency increases, the haze will gradually increase, and the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> will change from transparent to opaque.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">With this discovery, for example, in order to achieve fine regulation of the optical characteristics of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b>, in an area where the haze changes greatly relative to the amplitude of the voltage (e.g., the area between 5V&#x2dc;15V as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the degree of such transition of the haze (namely, the transition rate) can be effectively flattened (namely, the transition rate becomes smaller) by increasing the frequency of the voltage. Likewise, in areas where the haze changes small relative to the amplitude of the voltage (e.g., areas below 5V and above 15V as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the transition rate is increased by decreasing the frequency of the voltage.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">It may be seen that the regulating device according to embodiments of the present disclosure realizes fine regulation of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> by making the control signal comprise the amplitude parameter and frequency parameter of the voltage.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">For example, on an occasion with strong external light, after a user gives an instruction to make the functional glass <b>200</b> become transparent, it is possible to set a small transition rate of the change in optical characteristics, i.e., to make the functional glass <b>200</b> transit to transparent slowly, to enable the user to adapt the transition. In some embodiments, when the user regulates the haze with a button, for example, the transition rate may be made larger, so that the haze changes quickly.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition to comprising the amplitude parameter and frequency parameter of the voltage, the control signal may additionally or alternatively comprise at least one of a waiting time parameter for the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> to activate the transition or a transition rate parameter at which the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> transitions in some embodiments. Such a configuration enables the regulating device <b>100</b> to further improve user experience.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, mis-regulation caused by user's mis-operation can be effectively prevented by setting a waiting time. That is, a user may adjust his/her input error within the waiting time so that the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may be regulated in a correct and desired manner. For example, taking the forward PDLC as an example and assuming that a user expects to achieve a semi-transparent effect, that is, the target light transmittance equals to 50%, it may be determined by setting the waiting time to 2 seconds that the electric control functional layer is energized after 2 seconds or the electric control functional layer is applied with the target voltage amplitude and frequency after 2 seconds. Such a setting can effectively prevent mis-operation, that is, the user can completely change the possible mis-operation within the 2 seconds. At the same time, setting the waiting time may also meet a user's different needs and improve user experience. For example, when a user presses the button, the optical characteristics may be regulated abruptly after waiting for a predetermined waiting time, to improve the user experience.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The finer regulation of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> is also embodied in the capability of regulating the transition rate of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> as needed. As mentioned above, the transition rate may be regulated according to the user's preferences or automatically regulated according to the intensity of the external light or the like. In addition, in the case of implementing fine regulation, the transition rate may be set to be larger, smaller or variable as needed (that is, corresponding to the curve gradual regulation mode described in the preceding text). For example, in some embodiments, the abrupt-change mode may be achieved by making the above-mentioned transition rate larger. For example, if the control signal sent by the controller <b>103</b> according to the regulating signal is to change the haze from 50% to 0 within the one-second transition time in the abrupt-change mode, the sent control signal comprises the transition rate for implementing the change and the desired amplitude and frequency of the voltage corresponding thereto, thereby achieving the above function. In addition, in some alternative embodiments, the abrupt-change mode may also refer to directly regulating the amplitude and frequency of the voltage to the amplitude and frequency corresponding to the required optical characteristics after the predetermined waiting time.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The above-mentioned control signal may be sent by the controller <b>103</b> in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, these control signals may be built in a memory or controller <b>103</b> of the regulating device <b>100</b> when the functional glass <b>200</b> is shipped or the regulating device <b>100</b> is shipped. For example, the corresponding parameters may be set according to the requirements put forward by the customer, and the control signal may be built in the controller <b>103</b> or a memory coupled thereto. Thus, the controller <b>103</b> may send a built-in control signal to regulate the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> according to the received regulating signal.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, the regulating signal received by the controller <b>103</b> may be provided to the controller <b>103</b> through an interaction unit <b>104</b>. In other words, the regulating device <b>100</b> may further comprise the interaction unit <b>104</b>. The interaction unit <b>104</b> is coupled to the controller <b>103</b> and can receive user's instructions and provide the regulating signals to the controller <b>103</b> according to the user's instructions.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, in some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the interaction unit <b>104</b> may be a touch device integrated into the functional glass <b>200</b>. The touch device may be a strip-shaped touch device arranged on a surface of the glass or between the glasses. For example, the user may slide a finger from one end of the strip-shaped touch device to the other end (for example, from left to right or from bottom to top) to realize the function of increasing the haze of the functional glass <b>200</b>. When a user wants to reduce the haze, he/she may slide his/her finger from right to left or from top to bottom on the strip-shaped touch device. In other words, the user's instructions may be input through the touch device.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In addition, the touch device may adopt various touch technologies, such as, but not limited to, capacitive touch, resistive touch, surface acoustic wave touch, or infrared touch.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition to the one-way sliding mentioned above, the touch device may also receive a touch gesture and provide the regulating signal according to the touch gesture. For example, in some embodiments, the touch device may receive a plurality of touch gestures, and each touch gesture corresponds to a predetermined level of the haze or light transmittance. For example, a double-tap touch gesture corresponds to a haze value of 100%, that is, double-tapping the touch device will make the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> present an opaque state. For example, the haze value of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> may be changed stepwise by a multi-tap touch gesture. For example, with each tap, the haze increases by 10%, so that the haze value switches cyclically between 0%, 10%, 20%, . . . , and 100%. That is to say, the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> switches gradually and cyclically between the transparent state and the opaque state.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">It should be appreciated that the foregoing embodiments where the interaction unit <b>104</b> is a touch device are only illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. Any other suitable manners or means are also possible. For example, in some embodiments, the interaction unit <b>104</b> may also comprise but is not limited to: at least one of a light sensor, a gesture sensor, a voice sensor, a regulating knob, an operating button, or an operating handle.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, in some embodiments, the interaction unit <b>104</b> may be a voice sensor. For example, if a user wants to increase the haze of the functional glass when driving, he/she only needs to say &#x201c;increase the haze&#x201d; or other similar voice control commands. The voice command can be captured by the voice sensor. The voice sensor is coupled to a controller on the automobile or has a controller itself, and the controller can parse and decode the voice command and convert it into a regulating signal that can be recognized by the controller <b>103</b> of the regulating device <b>100</b>. Thus, the controller <b>103</b> may increase the haze of the electric control functional layer <b>201</b> according to the regulating signal.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Since the linear gradual regulation of the haze is realized, during linear changing of the haze according to a user's voice control command, if the user feels the current haze is more comfortable, he/she may stop the change of the haze through the voice sensor at any time. For example, in case where a user wants to increase the haze to 80% through voice control, when the haze is changing and changing to 50%, which makes the user feel just proper, he/she may stop the change of the haze through voice control and keep the haze at the desired 50%. Therefore, it can be seen that through linear gradual regulation and appropriate interaction means, diversified control is achieved and user experience is improved.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Hereinafter, a circuit that performs the above-mentioned functions will be described by way of example.
