Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to of electronic game, electronic gaming, and apparatus and systems for enabling an improved process for executing the traditional game of GO.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Background of the Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Go is usually played on a standard 19&#xd7;19 grid, or board. There are usually nine marked points on the board. These points are usually referred to as the star points. They serve as reference points as well as markers on which the handicap stones are placed in handicap games.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The rules of GO are standard, even though it has been known to slightly vary the size of the boards to as few as 8&#xd7;8 grids, with the game content remaining the same (e.g., https://www.britgo.org/intro/intro2.html). The basic of the game are basically that the game of Go starts with an empty board. Each player has an effectively unlimited supply of pieces (called stones), one taking the black stones, the other taking white. The main object of the game is to use your stones to form territories by surrounding vacant areas of the board. It is also possible to capture your opponent's stones by completely surrounding them.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Players take turns, placing one of their stones on a vacant point at each turn, with Black playing first. Note that stones are placed on the intersections of the lines rather than in the squares and once played stones are not moved. However, they may be captured, in which case they are removed from the board, and kept by the capturing player as prisoners.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The game is extraordinarily popular in some regions of the world. It is actually broadcast live in some countries, and even displayed on live billboards for the public to watch.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is impossible to have a commercially viable casino (even a processor in an electronic gaming machine, known as an EGM) versus player gaming event because of the length of time needed in play and the fact that skill can be too favorable to one side versus the other. Even reducing the grid to the smallest typical grid of 8&#xd7;8 squares does not speed up the game and allow sufficient numbers of games/minute to enable both a profit for the casino and reasonable chance of players winning over a reasonable period of time, such as in ten (10) games.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present technology provides a system of executing competitive games of GO, especially in a gaming environment, by using software that enhances and improves execution of game play in both offering a lower degree of skill requirement for players to still win individual game outcomes and yet maintain a reasonable profit margin for the casino or on-line administrator with on-line gaming.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010"

alternative placement of visually different stones in squares to capture an opposing player's stones or to control enclosed squares;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0028">b) placing stones for each of the two players, with at least three stones (preferably 4-10 stones) being placed by random placement (of an approximately equal number of stones for each player, such as &#xb1;1 or &#xb1;2 stones for the &#x201c;house&#x201d; player) or from a template for each player, with no player beginning the method with two or more stones than another player;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0029">c) each player being allotted a specific number of additional stones for alternative placement in open squares on the game board, but with insufficient numbers of stones to fill the game board;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0030">d) each player exhausting their respective allotted stones;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0031">e) after the two players have exhausted all respective allotted stones, determining a total absolute number value of how many stones have been captured by each player and how many spaces are controlled by each player's stones, with each player's total being compared either to the other player's total or against a paytable to determine a winning or losing outcome for the board game.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0032">As is known in GO, &#x201c;control&#x201d; of a space is determined by a fact that a continuous line of a single player's stones defines an enclosed area where the opponent or other player cannot insert a stone. For example, where a player forms a rectangle enclosing spaces adjacent a side of the grid structure, the enclosed number of squares are controlled and score points.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0033">In the method, the game of GO may be executed on an electronic gaming machine including a processor, a video display with a touchscreen, in communication with the processor a value-in-value-out system selected from the group consisting of a currency receiver having a motor drive and a reader, a ticket-in-ticket out acceptor/printer having a motor drive to receive printed tickets and deliver tickets printed in the electronic gaming machine, and a near-field communication sensor, the processor in communication with the video display to display credits available for wagering and amount of credits wagered and/or won at the conclusion of each board game displayed as a virtual board game. The game may be electronically played on an electronic gaming machine, an electronic gaming table or on-line with a game manager. In the method, the grid may be a virtual grid of from 4&#xd7;4 to 6&#xd7;6 squares (with or without handicap dots shown, as known in the GO art), displayed on the display screen, and the processor provides a random combination of the two-player's stones as virtual stones on the video screen and assigns a fixed number of allotted stones to a first player at a player controls and to the processor as a virtual player in competition with the player at the player controls, the player at the player controls placing one virtual stone at a time by contacting the touchscreen on open squares to place, and the processor placing virtual stones in open spaces on the virtual grid. When the processor is acting as the virtual player, that virtual player may be assigned from 0-4, 0-3, 1-3 -r 2-3 stones for placement in addition to the already placed stones. The player at the player controls typically enters a wager from credit stored in a memory in the processor to initiate the game. The points attained by the player at the player controls are preferably compared against a paytable to determine a winning amount to be credited on the processor.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0034">In an alternative method, the grid is a virtual grid of from 4&#xd7;4 to 6&#xd7;6 squares, displayed on the display screen, and the processor provides a template of a predetermined distribution of the two-player's stones as virtual stones on the video screen and assigns a fixed number of allotted stones to a first player at a player controls and to the processor as a virtual player in competition with the player at the player controls, the player at the player controls placing one virtual stone at a time by contacting the touchscreen on open squares to place, and the processor placing virtual stones in open spaces on the virtual grid.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0035">The player at the player controls may enter a wager stored in a memory in the processor to initiate the game. The points attained by the player at the player controls are compared against a paytable to determine a winning amount to be credited on the processor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0000">There are at Least Three Ways in which the Board can be Populated:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0036">Templates are used where the stones are pre-populated.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0037">Random placement of both white and black stones on the board. (can be awkward)</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0038">Small patterns of stones populate the board with additional single stones filling in random spaces after the patterns have been placed. Think Tetris shaped pieces filling in the board first, then single stones falling into some of the empty spaces.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0039">The use of templates seems to be the best method to protect the templates and the math could for all of the templates with zero, one, two and three additional stones. Since it is still desirable to have these boards and allowing players to make stone placements, the format will then still make sense to GO players, It may be the best way to capture the stones to take sections of the board from real GO games played in the internet. Depending on how many templates are needed to be captured for template use, it might be best to write a computer program to screen, capture and create our 100,000-1,000,000 boards.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Scoring:</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0040">Scoring will consist of counting the number of stones in the player's color and multiplying their stone count by the number of stones they captured.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0041">Optional: In traditional GO play, space that is cordoned off by stones of one color is counted as controlled by that player (because when playing with unlimited stones, that player would eventually capture that space). Since Mini GO is played with limited stones one option was to NOT allow players to score by blocking off areas, but it might be so ingrained in players' concept of the game of GO that the design of the gaming event may have to allow it for the players to accept the game. This is therefore an option included in scoring in the gaming event.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>&#x2014;Mini go is a faster, single player version of the traditional game of GO. The goal of the game is to control as much real estate on the board and to capture as many of the opposite colored stones as possible from a random or pre-determined array of white and black stones on a grid. To begin the game, the player makes a bet. (It is optional for the player to choose which color to play, white or black, before the board is revealed).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a schematic for an electronic system for enabling play of the gaming method described herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows another schematic for an electronic system for enabling play of the gaming method described herein.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>&#x2014;Once the wager is made, a random or predetermined distribution of black and white stones is placed in the grid. The grid may range in size from 3&#xd7;3 to the traditional 19&#xd7;19. In this example, the player's color is black and the processor's (casino's) color is White.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>&#x2014;After the placement of the black and white stones, any stones that are automatically captured by the opposite color are removed. A stone or group of stones are captured when they are surrounded by stones of the opposite color and have no liberties (free intersections adjacent to them.) In this example, black automatically captures one white stone in the bottom left corner.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>&#x2014;The player may now place their stones on the grid to try to capture more of the opposite color stones. In this example, the player moves the first stone into the open space near the top left of the grid to capture two additional white stones. (In the alternate versions, players may have to make a choice between capturing stones or controlling more of the board.)</p><p id="p-0037" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>&#x2014;The player placed the next stone to partially block a white stone.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>&#x2014;The player places the final black stone to capture one additional white stone.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>&#x2014;After the player's final stone is placed, the game tabulates a score based on the winning parameters of the game.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0051">In this example, each captured stone of the opposite color is worth 50 credits for a total win of 200 credits.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0052">Another gaming network that may be used to implement some aspects of the invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.

The top box <b>1004</b> may also be used to house these peripheral systems.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0054">The master gaming controller <b>1008</b> controls the game play on the gaming machine <b>1002</b> according to instructions and/or game data from game server <b>1022</b> or stored within gaming machine <b>1002</b> and receives or sends data to various input/output devices <b>1011</b> on the gaming machine <b>1002</b>. In one embodiment, master gaming controller <b>1008</b> includes processor(s) and other apparatus of the gaming machines described above. The master gaming controller <b>1008</b> may also communicate with a display <b>1010</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0055">A particular gaming entity may desire to provide network gaming services that provide some operational advantage. Thus, dedicated networks may connect gaming machines to host servers that track the performance of gaming machines under the control of the entity, such as for accounting management, electronic fund transfers (EFTs), cashless ticketing, such as EZPay&#x2122; marketing management, and data tracking, such as player tracking. Therefore, master gaming controller <b>1008</b> may also communicate with EFT system <b>1012</b>, EZPay&#x2122; system, and player tracking system <b>1020</b>. The systems of the gaming machine <b>1002</b> communicate the data onto the network <b>1022</b> via a communication board <b>1018</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0056">It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that embodiments of the present invention could be implemented on a network with more or fewer elements than are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. For example, player tracking system <b>1020</b> is not a necessary feature of some implementations of the present invention. However, player tracking programs may help to sustain a game player's interest in additional game play during a visit to a gaming establishment and may entice a player to visit a gaming establishment to partake in various gaming activities. Player tracking programs provide rewards to players that typically correspond to the player's level of patronage (e.g., to the player's playing frequency and/or total amount of game plays at a given casino). Player tracking rewards may be free meals, free lodging and/or free entertainment. Player tracking information may be combined with other information that is now readily obtainable by an SBG system.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0057">Moreover, DCU <b>1024</b> and translator <b>1025</b> are not required for all gaming establishments <b>1001</b>. However, due to the sensitive nature of much of the information on a gaming network (e.g., electronic fund transfers and player tracking data) the manufacturer of a host system usually employs a particular networking language having proprietary protocols. For instance, 10-20 different companies produce player tracking host systems where each host system may use different protocols. These proprietary protocols are usually considered highly confidential and not released publicly.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0058">Further, gaming machines are made by many different manufacturers. The communication protocols on the gaming machine are typically hard-wired into the gaming machine and each gaming machine manufacturer may utilize a different proprietary communication protocol. A gaming machine manufacturer may also produce host systems, in which case their gaming machines are compatible with their own host systems. However, in a heterogeneous gaming environment, gaming machines from different manufacturers, each with its own communication protocol, may be connected to host systems from other manufacturers, each with another communication protocol. Therefore, communication compatibility issues regarding the protocols used by the gaming machines in the system and protocols used by the host systems must be considered.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0059">A network device that links a gaming establishment with another gaming establishment and/or a central system will sometimes be referred to herein as a &#x201c;site controller.&#x201d; Here, site controller <b>1042</b> provides this function for gaming establishment <b>1001</b>. Site controller <b>1042</b> is connected to a central system and/or other gaming establishments via one or more networks, which may be public or private networks. Among other things, site controller <b>1042</b> communicates with game server <b>1022</b> to obtain game data, such as ball drop data, bingo card data, etc.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0060">In the present illustration, gaming machines <b>1002</b>, <b>1030</b>, <b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b> and <b>1036</b> are connected to a dedicated gaming network <b>1022</b>. In general, the DCU <b>1024</b> functions as an intermediary between the different gaming machines on the network <b>1022</b> and the site controller <b>1042</b>. In general, the DCU <b>1024</b> receives data transmitted from the gaming machines and sends the data to the site controller <b>1042</b> over a transmission path <b>1026</b>. In some instances, when the hardware interface used by the gaming machine is not compatible with site controller <b>1042</b>, a translator <b>1025</b> may be used to convert serial data from the DCU <b>1024</b> to a format accepted by site controller <b>1042</b>. The translator may provide this conversion service to a plurality of DCUs.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0061">Further, in some dedicated gaming networks, the DCU <b>1024</b> can receive data transmitted from site controller <b>1042</b> for communication to the gaming machines on the gaming network. The received data may be, for example, communicated synchronously to the gaming machines on the gaming network.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0062">Here, CVT <b>1052</b> provides cashless and cashout gaming services to the gaming machines in gaming establishment <b>1001</b>. Broadly speaking, CVT <b>1052</b> authorizes and validates cashless gaming machine instruments (also referred to herein as &#x201c;tickets&#x201d; or &#x201c;vouchers&#x201d;), including but not limited to tickets for causing a gaming machine to display a game result and cash-out tickets. Moreover, CVT <b>1052</b> authorizes the exchange of a cashout ticket for cash. These processes will be described in detail below. In one example, when a player attempts to redeem a cash-out ticket for cash at cashout kiosk <b>1044</b>, cash out kiosk <b>1044</b> reads validation data from the cashout ticket and transmits the validation data to CVT <b>1052</b> for validation. The tickets may be printed by gaming machines, by cashout kiosk <b>1044</b>, by a stand-alone printer, by CVT <b>1052</b>, etc. Some gaming establishments will not have a cashout kiosk <b>1044</b>. Instead, a cashout ticket could be redeemed for cash by a cashier (e.g. of a convenience store), by a gaming machine or by a specially configured CVT.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of a network device that may be configured for implementing some methods of the present invention. Network device <b>1160</b> includes a master central processing unit (CPU) <b>1162</b>, interfaces <b>1168</b>, and a bus <b>1167</b> (e.g., a PCI bus). Generally, interfaces <b>1168</b> include ports <b>1169</b> appropriate for communication with the appropriate media. In some embodiments, one or more of interfaces <b>1168</b> includes at least one independent processor and, in some instances, volatile RAM. The independent processors may be, for example, ASICs or any other appropriate processors. According to some such embodiments, these independent processors perform at least some of the functions of the logic described herein. In some embodiments, one or more of interfaces <b>1168</b> control such communications-intensive tasks as encryption, decryption, compression, decompression, packetization, media control and management. By providing separate processors for the communications-intensive tasks, interfaces <b>1168</b> allow the master microprocessor <b>1162</b> efficiently to perform other functions such as routing computations, network diagnostics, security functions, etc.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0064">The interfaces <b>1168</b> are typically provided as interface cards (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;linecards&#x201d;). Generally, interfaces <b>1168</b> control the sending and receiving of data packets over the network and sometimes support other peripherals used with the network device <b>1160</b>. Among the interfaces that may be provided are FC interfaces, Ethernet interfaces, frame relay interfaces, cable interfaces, DSL interfaces, token ring interfaces, and the like. In addition, various very high-speed interfaces may be provided, such as fast Ethernet interfaces, Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, ATM interfaces, HSSI interfaces, POS interfaces, FDDI interfaces, ASI interfaces, DHEI interfaces and the like.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0065">When acting under the control of appropriate software or firmware, in some implementations of the invention CPU <b>1162</b> may be responsible for implementing specific functions associated with the functions of a desired network device. According to some embodiments, CPU <b>1162</b> accomplishes all these functions under the control of software including an operating system and any appropriate applications software.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0066">CPU <b>1162</b> may include one or more processors <b>1163</b> such as a processor from the Motorola family of microprocessors or the MIPS family of microprocessors. In an alternative embodiment, processor <b>1163</b> is specially designed hardware for controlling the operations of network device <b>1160</b>. In a specific embodiment, a memory <b>1161</b> (such as non-volatile RAM and/or ROM) also forms part of CPU <b>1162</b>. However, there are many different ways in which memory could be coupled to the system. Memory block <b>1161</b> may be used for a variety of purposes such as, for example, caching and/or storing data, programming instructions, etc.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0067">Regardless of network device's configuration, it may employ one or more memories or memory modules (such as, for example, memory block <b>1165</b>) configured to store data, program instructions for the general-purpose network operations and/or other information relating to the functionality of the techniques described herein. The program instructions may control the operation of an operating system and/or one or more applications, for example.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0068">Because such information and program instructions may be employed to implement the systems/methods described herein, the present invention relates to machine-readable media that include program instructions, state information, etc. for performing various operations described herein. Examples of machine-readable media include, but are not limited to, magnetic media such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD-ROM disks; magneto-optical media; and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and perform program instructions, such as read-only memory devices (ROM) and random access memory (RAM). The invention may also be embodied in a carrier wave traveling over an appropriate medium such as airwaves, optical lines, electric lines, etc. Examples of program instructions include both machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher-level code that may be executed by the computer using an interpreter.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0069">Although the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates one specific network device of the present invention, it is by no means the only network device architecture on which the present invention can be implemented. For example, an architecture having a single processor that handles communications as well as routing computations, etc. is often used. Further, other types of interfaces and media could also be used with the network device. The communication path between interfaces may be bus based (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) or switch fabric based (such as a cross-bar).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0070">The term digital wallet is a blanket descriptor for a range of technologies that let you perform many tasks. In general, though, a digital wallet (also sometimes called an e-wallet) is a transformation in the way individuals pay for things.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0071">Many digital wallet services work through apps on smartphones. At the supermarket, for instance, the phone is simply tapped to a compatible check-out register to pay instantly. For others, all you need to enter is a mobile phone number and a PIN (personal identification number).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0072">No matter what form it takes, a digital wallet is based on encryption software that substitutes for old software, analog wallet during monetary transactions. There are benefits in the protection and convenience. Merchants benefit because they're more protected against fraud and they sell more products, faster.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0073">A smartphone digital wallet will help pay for anything, but it will also store concert tickets, bus and subway passes, gift cards and in the present technology, credit stored, transferred or received from an electronic gaming machine. Casinos will reward loyalty by offering instant freebies, discounts and coupons.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0074">Digital wallets can be broken into two broad categories: client-side and server-side. Within both categories are wallets that function only with specific vendors (either online or offline) and others that will work with just about any merchant.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0075">Client-side wallets generally refer to those maintained by the customer, the end user. They download and install a program and then enter all of pertinent payment and shipping information, all of which is stored on a personal computer. Then, when it is decided to check out at a compatible Web site, the wallet's software completes most of the basic information so the customer doesn't have to. Suddenly, gaming gets faster and advantageous to the casino. A mobile digital wallet&#x2014;that is, one on a smartphone&#x2014;could transform the way customers pay no matter where they are in the casino.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0076">More than half of Americans now own smartphones, and experts say that number will only continue to rise and more of those phones are equipped with an NFC (near-field communication) chip, which is a vital component to the mobile digital wallet infrastructure. It was estimated that around half of smartphones could have NFC by 2015. NFC technology may be seen everywhere very soon.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0077">In marketing to consumers, two hot-button words always appear: security and privacy. It's easy for people to imagine all of the ways criminals or even casinos could abuse digital wallets. Those could hack into the account, exhaust the account and run up credit card balances, or maybe steal an identity.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0078">Concerns are heightened when laypeople are considering the complexity of a digital-wallet transaction, especially compared to the simplicity of cash or straight credit. In the case of a smartphone, data passes through not only the smartphone's hardware and operating system but then also through a specific payment app, and finally the source of the payment, such as a bank or PayPal account. Casinos will be falling all over themselves to get player digital wallet business. Household names such as Google, Visa, MasterCard, Verizon, Apple, AT&#x26;T, PayPal and Square will be vying for players' attention.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0079">All of these organizations will position themselves for the upper hand, in part by creating alliances with other corporate players in the gaming industry. PayPal started with Home Depot. Square teamed up with Starbucks. Google Wallet first matched with MasterCard. Ifs all part of the plan to slowly build their way into the casinos' normal operation. They know that if they can convince players and casinos to use their form of wallet first, players and casinos be unlikely to switch for an extended period a time.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0080">Eventually, digital will complete its takeover and it is likely most wagering (with the exception of craps and roulette) will be using virtual money. Whether that's a good thing remains to be seen. In the meantime, players fumble with cash, tickets, coins and paper transactions with cashiers, all of which are remnants of a pre-digital economy and are primitive (and sometimes aggravating) simply by the nature of their design. Digital, of course, will have its own set of frustrations, and until they are confronted, the industry will not be assured they are worth the trouble of giving up cash.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0081">A Google Wallet is inherently no different from any other money wallet. The basics behind all the wallets are the same. Each wallet is a bank account in some banking system. The entire eco system of wallet users, are simply a singular branch. If the name &#x201c;PayPal&#x201d; is changed, it depicts very well how a digital money wallet works. Among technical disclosures of electronic payment systems are US Patent Application.

A screen <b>506</b> displays game content captured at a craps game table <b>512</b> and stored and transmitted through the cloud <b>510</b>. Individual players may enter wagers through personal data devices <b>504</b> (e.g., smartphones, pad, notebook, PCs, or dedicated wagering devices). Furthermore, the system may include one or more interface devices or programmable devices <b>504</b> apt to allow an interaction between a gamer and said game surface <b>512</b> existing in said relocated game site <b>516</b>. To make clear the modes to promote the real time remote game, the complete cycle which is performed by the gamer in this context is described hereinafter. The cycle starts when a gamer enters the room of the remote site <b>518</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) and, after acquiring the information reported inside the room and after viewing the live game session, coming from the relocated site <b>516</b>, projected on one or more monitors/tv sets <b>204</b><i>a </i>of the room itself, wishes to attend the game. Each programmable electronic device comprises <b>504</b> a display, and it is configured for reproducing on said display information related to the game surface <b>512</b> existing in the relocated game site <b>516</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0083">Furthermore, advantageously, the programmable electronic device is programmed so as to allow the gamer to attend the game from said remote site <b>518</b>. For example, by exploiting current smartphones (pads or tablets or the like), the gamer is allowed, following registration on a web platform, to download an Application for accessing the game on his/her own smartphone or tablet (hereinafter such Application will be referred to with the short-term App).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0084">At this point, the gamer may load the funds he/she wishes on his/her own game account and he/she is ready to attend the available games. As previously mentioned, the means <b>504</b> for the audio and video reproduction comprises one or more cameras <b>514</b> arranged at the relocated game site <b>518</b> and/or one or more monitors/tv sets arranged at the remote game site <b>518</b>. In this way, to improve the game experience of the gamer, the live broadcast of the game session really performed by a croupier operating at the relocated side <b>518</b>, is made available on a big monitor/tv set, which the gamer may attend through his/her own game App available on his/her own mobile device (smartphone or tablet or the like). For example, in case of the roulette game, the gamer has available on his/her own mobile device an App reproducing chips and game table, therethrough he/she may perform bets by touching the table area of interest.

In particular, a cash station <b>240</b><i>a </i>is shown, which will be handled by an operator of the game site <b>200</b> a, usable for example by the gamers for the preliminary procedures of loading funds onto their own game account. The cash station <b>240</b><i>a </i>provides a personal computer <b>216</b><i>a</i>, thereto a scanner <b>214</b><i>a </i>and a printer <b>212</b><i>a </i>are advantageously connected for the administrative type requirements (registration of gamers, scanning of identity documents, etc.). The cash station <b>240</b><i>a </i>could further be equipped with a router <b>204</b><i>a </i>(preferably of wireless type) for accessing a local network. Furthermore, in order to improve the game experience of the gamer and to promote the socialization with other people present in the room, inside the same there are means for virtually repeating the game surface <b>512</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>.

In particular, the game table surface <b>512</b> comprises a horizontal, preferably high-definition monitor, whereon an image is reproduced, shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, updated in real time, of the game surface <b>512</b>, existing in the relocated game site <b>518</b>, and a QR-Code of the room identifying the table, shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0087">Each bet performed by the gamer through his/her own App is repeated even onto the horizontal monitor, which reproduces the game layout of the craps table or roulette table itself (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). Said horizontal monitor has no interactive feature, but it reproduces exclusively what made individually by each gamer on his/her own mobile device.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0088">Furthermore, as it is still visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the game table surface <b>512</b> in turn comprises apparatuses to be connected, preferably in wireless mode, to the local network and, by means of internet, to the relocated game site. To this purpose, a processor <b>216</b><i>a </i>may be provided, thereto an access point <b>202</b><i>a</i>, for the connection to Internet, and a router <b>204</b><i>a</i>, for the connection to the local network, are connected, for example by means of a switch <b>203</b><i>a</i>. Furthermore, an additional monitor <b>300</b>, arranged in the room of the remote game site <b>516</b>, may be connected to the processor <b>209</b><i>a</i>, in case by means of an additional personal computer <b>201</b><i>a</i>, for enjoying a live broadcast by the gamers and/or other present people. Other multimedia devices, such as for example loudspeaker baffles <b>302</b>, may be connected to the monitor. Advantageously, by means of the cash PC <b>216</b>, positioned in the cash station, the operator is capable to handle the devices constituting the system. For example, he/she could turn off and/or re-start the table, turn-off or re-start the PC for the live broadcast, change the camera for displaying the live broadcast from the casino. The game table <b>5</b><i>a </i>inside the room has a shape very similar to that of a real casino-like table (<b>508</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). The table is capable of improving the game experience of the gamer by favoring the socialization thereof with other people present in the room, by allowing the following procedures: i) receiving the gamers and the devices and drinks thereof; ii) reproducing the QR-Code of the room identifying the table; iii) reproducing the layout for the performed casino-like game bets; iv) reproducing the winning number (or the hand) and of the game statistics; v) reproducing the bets performed by the gamers present in the room.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0089">Furthermore, it is equipped with stools to make the gamers to sit down around the periphery thereof, by offering the latter the possibility of positioning their own drinks in suitable housing and resting easily their own smartphones or tablets during the succession of the several game sessions.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0090">At the end of the game, the gamer who wishes to withdraw the funds existing on his/her own game account may do it by using the technological infrastructures supporting the electronic money instruments existing in the room itself</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Phase for Registering on the Web Platform</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0091">The mechanism provided for registering the gamer onto the web platform, according to one embodiment, is the following;</p><p id="p-0081" num="0092">The not registered gamer goes to a registration point (or cash station), wherein it provides to an operator his/her own identity card, fiscal code, mobile phone number and e-mail address.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0093">The operator positions the documents under an OCR and the recording software acquires the included data and uses them to compile, automatically, a customer registration form, apart from the possibility of inserting possible missing data, such as for example e-mail address, by an operator in manual mode.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0094">Furthermore, the software, still automatically, generates a username (obtained by means a code for processing the customer data) and a password, not visible by the operator himself/herself.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0095">In this phase, the operator's software interacts with that of the Web platform to verify the correctness and uniqueness of the entered data. In particular, username and password are checked, which, if validated, are proposed to the customer printed on a receipt.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0096">Once the data have been validated, the customer enters username and password&#x2014;by copying them from the print received from the operator&#x2014;onto the App to perform the first access. With such identifying credentials, the App downloads and proposes to the customer the corresponding game contract which may be accepted as in case of a software license.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0097">After the contract acceptance, which is communicated to the system by electronic means, the gamer is registered on the game platform.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Step of Downloading and Starting the App for Accessing the Game</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0098">As said previously, in order to access the on-line game platform, the gamer downloads an App on his/her own device, by following the instructions provided to him by the operator at a registration point, which will have also indicated how activating and configuring the room's Wi-Fi connection on his/her own device.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0099">The game App is the App which the gamer has available on his/her own smartphone or tablet or the like (both of Android and iOS type) to attend the on-line game session inside the room.

The table present in the room may be used only to implement a visual effect. In particular, the gamer starts the game App installed on his/her own smartphone or tablet or the like, he/she takes a picture of the QR-Code and selects the color of the chips therewith his/her own bets will be reproduced onto the game table <b>5</b>. The user may choose a determined color among the available ones, or decide if making him/her to be assigned one in a casual way. In the first case, the user is sent directly to the game application, whereas in the second case (by selecting the function &#x201c;Skip this passage&#x201d;), the user is assigned a casual chip color, which he/she may decide to be confirmed or modified.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0124">At this point, the App re-addresses the user automatically to the website managed by the licensee wherein, by entering his/her own credentials, he/she accesses the game application.

As soon as the gamer performs a bet onto the platform of the game App, the latter, by means of a communication system (for example of Wi-Fi type), transmits it to the game table, whereon it is reproduced exactly, so that all gamers present in the room and those attending the same game session may view it.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0134">If a gamer is no longer connected to the Wi-Fi of the VLT room, he/she could no longer interact with the game table and the bets he/she performs will no longer be reproduced thereon.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0135">The bets of the several gamers are reproduced onto the game table with chips with different colors, depending upon the color selected by each one of them on the App. In this way, the chips of each gamer on the game table corresponds a unique color and each one is able to distinguish their bets from those performed by the other ones. The game table reproduces immediately the bet performed in a temporary flashing state. When the table has received the message of occurred bet acceptance, sent by the central system, the reproduced chips will cease to flash, to show that the bet has been accepted and it results to be valid. On the contrary, if within a certain period of time the table does not receive the message of occurred bet acceptance, the reproduced chips disappear, to show that the bet has not been accepted.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0000">Mode for Withdrawing Funds from the Game Account</p><p id="p-0115" num="0136">To give the gamer the possibility of withdrawing the funds present on his/her own game account, the following procedure, according to one embodiment, is provided.

The card delivery system is in communication with the controller by wired or wireless communication methods. Communication between the various system components is not limited to electronic or electrical signals, but may include optical signals, audio signals, magnetic transmission or the like.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0150">The individual player position processors (not shown) are preferable graphics processors and not full content CPUs as a cost saving, space saving, and efficiency benefit. With the reduced capacity in the processor as compared to a CPU, there is actually reduced likelihood of tampering and fraudulent input.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0151">A video gaming machine of the present invention may include a main cabinet, which generally surrounds the machine interior and is viewable by users. The main cabinet includes a main door on the front of the machine, which opens to provide access to the interior of the machine. Attached to the main door are player-input switches or buttons, a coin acceptor, and a bill validator, a coin tray, and a display area including a mechanical gaming system (or less preferably a separate electronic game). There may be an overlay of touchscreen functionality on the separate electronic game or some of the buttons may be functional on the separate mechanical gaming system. That separate mechanical gaming system may be in a relatively vertical viewing position as shown, or in a more horizontal (table like) display unit. Viewable through the main door is a video display monitor and an information panel. The display monitor will typically be a cathode ray tube, high resolution flat-panel LCD, LED, plasma screen or other conventional electronically controlled video monitor. The information panel may be a back-lit, silk screened glass panel with lettering to indicate general game information including, for example, a game denomination (e.g. $0.25 or $1). The bill validator, player-input switches, video display monitor, and information panel are devices used to play a game on the game machine. The devices are controlled by circuitry (e.g., the master gaming controller) housed inside the main cabinet of the machine.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0152">Many different types of games, including mechanical slot games, video slot games, video poker, video black jack, video pachinko and lottery, may be provided with gaming machines of this invention. In particular, the gaming machine may be operable to provide a play of many different instances of games of chance. The instances may be differentiated according to themes, sounds, graphics, type of game (e.g., slot game vs. card game), denomination, number of paylines, maximum jackpot, progressive or non-progressive, bonus games, etc. The gaming machine may be operable to allow a player to select a game of chance to play from a plurality of instances available on the gaming machine. For example, the gaming machine may provide a menu with a list of the instances of games that are available for play on the gaming machine and a player may be able to select from the list a first instance of a game of chance that they wish to play.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0153">The various instances of games available for play on the gaming machine may be stored as game software on a mass storage device in the gaming machine or may be generated on a remote gaming device but then displayed on the gaming machine. The gaming machine <b>2</b> may executed game software, such as but not limited to video streaming software that allows the game to be displayed on the gaming machine. When an instance is stored on the gaming machine, it may be loaded from the mass storage device into a RAM for execution. In some cases, after a selection of an instance, the game software that allows the selected instance to be generated may be downloaded from a remote gaming device, such as another gaming machine.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0154">The typical gaming machine includes a top box, which sits on top of the main cabinet. The top box houses a number of devices, which may be used to add features to a game being played on the gaming machine, including speakers, a ticket printer which prints bar-coded tickets, a key pad for entering player tracking information, a florescent display for displaying player tracking information, a card reader for entering a magnetic striped card containing player tracking information, and a video display screen. The ticket printer may be used to print tickets for a cashless ticketing system. Further, the top box may house different or additional devices than discussed. For example, the top box may contain a bonus wheel or a back-lit silk-screened panel which may be used to add bonus features to the game being played on the gaming machine. As another example, the top box may contain a display for a progressive jackpot offered on the gaming machine. During a game, these devices are controlled and powered, in part, by circuitry (e.g. a master gaming controller) housed within the main cabinet of the machine.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0155">Understand that gaming machine <b>2</b> is but one example from a wide range of gaming machine designs on which the present invention may be implemented. For example, not all suitable gaming machines have top boxes or player tracking features. Further, some gaming machines have only a single game display&#x2014;mechanical or video, while others are designed for bar tables and have displays that face upwards. As another example, a game may be generated in on a host computer and may be displayed on a remote terminal or a remote gaming device. The remote gaming device may be connected to the host computer via a network of some type such as a local area network, a wide area network, an intranet or the Internet. The remote gaming device may be a portable gaming device such as but not limited to a cell phone, a personal digital assistant, and a wireless game player. Images rendered from 3-D gaming environments may be displayed on portable gaming devices that are used to play a game of chance. Further a gaming machine or server may include gaming logic for commanding a remote gaming device to render an image from a virtual camera in a 3-D gaming environments stored on the remote gaming device and to display the rendered image on a display located on the remote gaming device. Thus, those of skill in the art will understand that the present invention, as described below, can be deployed on most any gaming machine now available or hereafter developed.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0156">Some preferred gaming machines are implemented with special features and/or additional circuitry that differentiates them from general-purpose computers (e.g., desktop PC's and laptops). Gaming machines are highly regulated to ensure fairness and, in many cases, gaming machines are operable to dispense monetary awards of multiple millions of dollars. Therefore, to satisfy security and regulatory requirements in a gaming environment, hardware and software architectures may be implemented in gaming machines that differ significantly from those of general-purpose computers. A description of gaming machines relative to general-purpose computing machines and some examples of the additional (or different) components and features found in gaming machines are described below.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0157">At first glance, one might think that adapting PC technologies to the gaming industry would be a simple proposition because both PCs and gaming machines employ microprocessors that control a variety of devices. However, because of such reasons as 1) the regulatory requirements that are placed upon gaming machines, 2) the harsh environment in which gaming machines operate, 3) security requirements and 4) fault tolerance requirements, adapting PC technologies to a gaming machine can be quite difficult. Further, techniques and methods for solving a problem in the PC industry, such as device compatibility and connectivity issues, might not be adequate in the gaming environment. For instance, a fault or a weakness tolerated in a PC, such as security holes in software or frequent crashes, may not be tolerated in a gaming machine because in a gaming machine these faults can lead to a direct loss of funds from the gaming machine, such as stolen cash or loss of revenue when the gaming machine is not operating properly.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0158">For the purposes of illustration, a few differences between PC systems and gaming systems will be described. A first difference between gaming machines and common PC based computers systems is that gaming machines are designed to be state-based systems. In a state-based system, the system stores and maintains its current state in a non-volatile memory, such that, in the event of a power failure or other malfunction the gaming machine will return to its current state when the power is restored. For instance, if a player was shown an award for a game of chance and, before the award could be provided to the player the power failed, the gaming machine, upon the restoration of power, would return to the state where the award is indicated. As anyone who has used a PC, knows, PCs are not state machines and a majority of data is usually lost when a malfunction occurs. This requirement affects the software and hardware design on a gaming machine.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0159">A second important difference between gaming machines and common PC based computer systems is that for regulation purposes, the software on the gaming machine used to generate the game of chance and operate the gaming machine has been designed to be static and monolithic to prevent cheating by the operator of gaming machine. For instance, one solution that has been employed in the gaming industry to prevent cheating and satisfy regulatory requirements has been to manufacture a gaming machine that can use a proprietary processor running instructions to generate the game of chance from an EPROM or other form of non-volatile memory. The coding instructions on the EPROM are static (non-changeable) and must be approved by a gaming regulators in a particular jurisdiction and installed in the presence of a person representing the gaming jurisdiction. Any changes to any part of the software required to generate the game of chance, such as adding a new device driver used by the master gaming controller to operate a device during generation of the game of chance can require a new EPROM to be burnt, approved by the gaming jurisdiction and reinstalled on the gaming machine in the presence of a gaming regulator. Regardless of whether the EPROM solution is used, to gain approval in most gaming jurisdictions, a gaming machine must demonstrate sufficient safeguards that prevent an operator or player of a gaming machine from manipulating hardware and software in a manner that gives them an unfair and some cases an illegal advantage. The gaming machine should have a means to determine if the code it will execute is valid. If the code is not valid, the gaming machine must have a means to prevent the code from being executed. The code validation requirements in the gaming industry affect both hardware and software designs on gaming machines.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0160">A third important difference between gaming machines and common PC based computer systems is the number and kinds of peripheral devices used on a gaming machine are not as great as on PC based computer systems. Traditionally, in the gaming industry, gaming machines have been relatively simple in the sense that the number of peripheral devices and the number of functions the gaming machine has been limited. Further, in operation, the functionality of gaming machines was relatively constant once the gaming machine was deployed, i.e., new peripherals devices and new gaming software were infrequently added to the gaming machine. This differs from a PC where users will go out and buy different combinations of devices and software from different manufacturers and connect them to a PC to suit their needs depending on a desired application. Therefore, the types of devices connected to a PC may vary greatly from user to user depending in their individual requirements and may vary significantly over time.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0161">Although the variety of devices available for a PC may be greater than on a gaming machine, gaming machines still have unique device requirements that differ from a PC, such as device security requirements not usually addressed by PCs. For instance, monetary devices, such as coin dispensers, bill validators and ticket printers and computing devices that are used to govern the input and output of cash to a gaming machine have security requirements that are not typically addressed in PCs. Therefore, many PC techniques and methods developed to facilitate device connectivity and device compatibility do not address the emphasis placed on security in the gaming industry.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0162">To address some of the issues described above, a number of hardware/software components and architectures are utilized in gaming machines that are not typically found in general purpose computing devices, such as PCs. These hardware/software components and architectures, as described below in more detail, include but are not limited to watchdog timers, voltage monitoring systems, state-based software architecture and supporting hardware, specialized communication interfaces, security monitoring and trusted memory.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0163">A watchdog timer is normally used in gaming machines to provide a software failure detection mechanism. In a normally operating system, the operating software periodically accesses control registers in the watchdog timer subsystem to &#x201c;re-trigger&#x201d; the watchdog. Should the operating software fail to access the control registers within a preset timeframe, the watchdog timer will timeout and generate a system reset. Typical watchdog timer circuits contain a loadable timeout counter register to allow the operating software to set the timeout interval within a certain range of time. A differentiating feature of the some preferred circuits is that the operating software cannot completely disable the function of the watchdog timer. In other words, the watchdog timer always functions from the time power is applied to the board.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0164">Gaming computer platforms preferably use several power supply voltages to operate portions of the computer circuitry. These can be generated in a central power supply or locally on the computer board. If any of these voltages falls out of the tolerance limits of the circuitry they power, unpredictable operation of the computer may result. Though most modem general-purpose computers include voltage monitoring circuitry, these types of circuits only report voltage status to the operating software. Out of tolerance voltages can cause software malfunction, creating a potential uncontrolled condition in the gaming computer. Gaming machines typically have power supplies with tighter voltage margins than that required by the operating circuitry. In addition, the voltage monitoring circuitry implemented in gaming computers typically has two thresholds of control. The first threshold generates a software event that can be detected by the operating software and an error condition generated. This threshold is triggered when a power supply voltage falls out of the tolerance range of the power supply, but is still within the operating range of the circuitry. The second threshold is set when a power supply voltage falls out of the operating tolerance of the circuitry. In this case, the circuitry generates a reset, halting operation of the computer.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0165">The standard method of operation for slot machine game software is to use a state machine. Different functions of the game (bet, play, result, points in the graphical presentation, etc.) may be defined as a state. When a game moves from one state to another, critical data regarding the game software is stored in a custom non-volatile memory subsystem. This is critical to ensure the player's wager and credits are preserved and to minimize potential disputes in the event of a malfunction on the gaming machine.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0166">In general, the gaming machine does not advance from a first state to a second state until critical information that allows the first state to be reconstructed is stored. This feature allows the game to recover operation to the current state of play in the event of a malfunction, loss of power, etc. that occurred just prior to the malfunction. After the state of the gaming machine is restored during the play of a game of chance, game play may resume and the game may be completed in a manner that is no different than if the malfunction had not occurred. Typically, battery backed RAM devices are used to preserve this critical data although other types of non-volatile memory devices may be employed. These memory devices are not used in typical general-purpose computers.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0167">As described in the preceding paragraph, when a malfunction occurs during a game of chance, the gaming machine may be restored to a state in the game of chance just prior to when the malfunction occurred. The restored state may include metering information and graphical information that was displayed on the gaming machine in the state prior to the malfunction. For example, when the malfunction occurs during the play of a card game after the cards have been dealt, the gaming machine may be restored with the cards that were previously displayed as part of the card game. As another example, a bonus game may be triggered during the play of a game of chance where a player is required to make a number of selections on a video display screen. When a malfunction has occurred after the player has made one or more selections, the gaming machine may be restored to a state that shows the graphical presentation at the just prior to the malfunction including an indication of selections that have already been made by the player. In general, the gaming machine may be restored to any state in a plurality of states that occur in the game of chance that occurs while the game of chance is played or to states that occur between the play of a game of chance.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0168">Game history information regarding previous games played such as an amount wagered, the outcome of the game and so forth may also be stored in a non-volatile memory device. The information stored in the non-volatile memory may be detailed enough to reconstruct a portion of the graphical presentation that was previously presented on the gaming machine and the state of the gaming machine (e.g., credits) at the time the game of chance was played. The game history information may be utilized in the event of a dispute. For example, a player may decide that in a previous game of chance that they did not receive credit for an award that they believed they won. The game history information may be used to reconstruct the state of the gaming machine prior, during and/or after the disputed game to demonstrate whether the player was correct or not in their assertion.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0169">Another feature of gaming machines, such as gaming computers, is that they often contain unique interfaces, including serial interfaces, to connect to specific subsystems internal and external to the slot machine. The serial devices may have electrical interface requirements that differ from the &#x201c;standard&#x201d; EIA 232 serial interfaces provided by general-purpose computers. These interfaces may include EIA 485, EIA 422, Fiber Optic Serial, optically coupled serial interfaces, current loop style serial interfaces, etc. In addition, to conserve serial interfaces internally in the slot machine, serial devices may be connected in a shared, daisy-chain fashion where multiple peripheral devices are connected to a single serial channel.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0170">The serial interfaces may be used to transmit information using communication protocols that are unique to the gaming industry. For example, the Netplex&#x2122; system of IGT is a proprietary communication protocol used for serial communication between gaming devices. As another example, SAS is a communication protocol used to transmit information, such as metering information, from a gaming machine to a remote device. Often SAS is used in conjunction with a player tracking system.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0171">Gaming machines may alternatively be treated as peripheral devices to a casino communication controller and connected in a shared daisy chain fashion to a single serial interface. In both cases, the peripheral devices are preferably assigned device addresses. If so, the serial controller circuitry must implement a method to generate or detect unique device addresses. General-purpose computer serial ports are not able to do this.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0172">Security monitoring circuits detect intrusion into a gaming machine by monitoring security switches attached to access doors in the slot machine cabinet. Preferably, access violations result in suspension of game play and can trigger additional security operations to preserve the current state of game play. These circuits also function when power is off by use of a battery backup. In power-off operation, these circuits continue to monitor the access doors of the slot machine. When power is restored, the gaming machine can determine whether any security violations occurred while power was off, e.g., via software for reading status registers. This can trigger event log entries and further data authentication operations by the slot machine software.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0173">Trusted memory devices are preferably included in a gaming machine computer to ensure the authenticity of the software that may be stored on less secure memory subsystems, such as mass storage devices. Trusted memory devices and controlling circuitry are typically designed to not allow modification of the code and data stored in the memory device while the memory device is installed in the slot machine. The code and data stored in these devices may include authentication algorithms, random number generators, authentication keys, operating system kernels, etc. The purpose of these trusted memory devices is to provide gaming regulatory authorities a root trusted authority within the computing environment of the slot machine that can be tracked and verified as original. This may be accomplished via removal of the trusted memory device from the slot machine computer and verification of the secure memory device contents is a separate third party verification device. Once the trusted memory to retract tickets (or currency) and printed and eject tickets or currency is verified as authentic, and based on the approval of the verification algorithms contained in the trusted device, the gaming machine is allowed to verify the authenticity of additional code and data that may be located in the gaming computer assembly, such as code and data stored on hard disk drives. A few details related to trusted memory devices that may be used in the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,685,567 titled &#x201c;Process Verification,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein in its entirety and for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0174">Mass storage devices used in a general purpose computer typically allow code and data to be read from and written to the mass storage device. In a gaming machine environment, modification of the gaming code stored on a mass storage device is strictly controlled and would only be allowed under specific maintenance type events with electronic and physical enablers required. Though this level of security could be provided by software, gaming computers that include mass storage devices preferably include hardware level mass storage data protection circuitry that operates at the circuit level to monitor attempts to modify data on the mass storage device and will generate both software and hardware error triggers should a data modification be attempted without the proper electronic and physical enablers being present.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0175">Returning to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when a user wishes to play the gaming machine <b>2</b>, he or she inserts cash through the coin acceptor or bill validator or ticket-in-ticket out reading and printing drive with a motor to rtr. Additionally, the bill validator may accept a printed ticket voucher which may be accepted by the bill validator as an indicia of credit when a cashless ticketing system is used. At the start of the game, the player may enter playing tracking information using the card reader, the keypad <b>22</b>, and the florescent display <b>16</b>. Further, other game preferences of the player playing the game may be read from a card inserted into the card reader. During the game, the player views game information using the video display. Other game and prize information may also be displayed in the video display screen located in the top box.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0176">During the course of a game, a player may be required to make a number of decisions, which affect the outcome of the game. For example, a player may vary his or her wager on a particular game, select a prize for a particular game selected from a prize server, or make game decisions which affect the outcome of a particular game. The player may make these choices using the player-input switches, the video display screen or using some other device which enables a player to input information into the gaming machine. In some embodiments, the player may be able to access various game services such as concierge services and entertainment content services using the video display screen and one more input devices.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0177">During certain game events, the typical gaming machine may display visual and auditory effects that can be perceived by the player. These effects add to the excitement of a game, which makes a player more likely to continue playing. Auditory effects include various sounds that are projected by the speakers. Visual effects include flashing lights, strobing lights or other patterns displayed from lights on the gaming machine or from lights within the separate mechanical (or electronic) separately, individually wagerable gaming system. After the player has completed a game, the player may receive game tokens from the coin tray or the ticket from the printer, which may be used for further games or to redeem a prize. Further, the player may receive a ticket for food, merchandise, or games from the printer.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0178">Another gaming network that may be used to implement some aspects of the invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Gaming establishment <b>1001</b> could be any sort of gaming establishment, such as a casino, a card room, an airport, a store, etc. In this example, gaming network <b>1077</b> includes more than one gaming establishment, all of which are networked to game server <b>1022</b>. Here, gaming machine <b>1002</b>, and the other gaming machines <b>1030</b>, <b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b>, and <b>1036</b>, include a main cabinet <b>1006</b> and a top box <b>1004</b>. The main cabinet <b>1006</b> houses the main gaming elements and can also house peripheral systems, such as those that utilize dedicated gaming networks. The top box <b>1004</b> may also be used to house these peripheral systems.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0179">The master gaming controller <b>1008</b> controls the game play on the gaming machine <b>1002</b> according to instructions and/or game data from game server <b>1022</b> or stored within gaming machine <b>1002</b> and receives or sends data to various input/output devices <b>1011</b> on the gaming machine <b>1002</b>. In one embodiment, master gaming controller <b>1008</b> includes processor(s) and other apparatus of the gaming machines described above. The master gaming controller <b>1008</b> may also communicate with a display <b>1010</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0180">A particular gaming entity may desire to provide network gaming services that provide some operational advantage. Thus, dedicated networks may connect gaming machines to host servers that track the performance of gaming machines under the control of the entity, such as for accounting management, electronic fund transfers (EFTs), cashless ticketing, such as EZPay&#x2122; marketing management, and data tracking, such as player tracking. Therefore, master gaming controller <b>1008</b> may also communicate with EFT system <b>1012</b>, EZPay&#x2122; system, and player tracking system <b>1020</b>. The systems of the gaming machine <b>1002</b> communicate the data onto the network <b>1022</b> via a communication board <b>1018</b>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0181">It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that embodiments of the present invention could be implemented on a network with more or fewer elements than are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. For example, player tracking system <b>1020</b> is not a necessary feature of some implementations of the present invention. However, player tracking programs may help to sustain a game player's interest in additional game play during a visit to a gaming establishment and may entice a player to visit a gaming establishment to partake in various gaming activities. Player tracking programs provide rewards to players that typically correspond to the player's level of patronage (e.g., to the player's playing frequency and/or total amount of game plays at a given casino). Player tracking rewards may be free meals, free lodging and/or free entertainment. Player tracking information may be combined with other information that is now readily obtainable by an SBG system.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0182">Moreover, DCU <b>1024</b> and translator <b>1025</b> are not required for all gaming establishments <b>1001</b>. However, due to the sensitive nature of much of the information on a gaming network (e.g., electronic fund transfers and player tracking data) the manufacturer of a host system usually employs a particular networking language having proprietary protocols. For instance, 10-20 different companies produce player tracking host systems where each host system may use different protocols. These proprietary protocols are usually considered highly confidential and not released publicly.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0183">Further, gaming machines are made by many different manufacturers. The communication protocols on the gaming machine are typically hard-wired into the gaming machine and each gaming machine manufacturer may utilize a different proprietary communication protocol. A gaming machine manufacturer may also produce host systems, in which case their gaming machines are compatible with their own host systems. However, in a heterogeneous gaming environment, gaming machines from different manufacturers, each with its own communication protocol, may be connected to host systems from other manufacturers, each with another communication protocol. Therefore, communication compatibility issues regarding the protocols used by the gaming machines in the system and protocols used by the host systems must be considered.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0184">A network device that links a gaming establishment with another gaming establishment and/or a central system will sometimes be referred to herein as a &#x201c;site controller.&#x201d; Here, site controller <b>1042</b> provides this function for gaming establishment <b>1001</b>. Site controller <b>1042</b> is connected to a central system and/or other gaming establishments via one or more networks, which may be public or private networks. Among other things, site controller <b>1042</b> communicates with game server <b>1022</b> to obtain game data, such as ball drop data, bingo card data, etc.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0185">In the present illustration, gaming machines <b>1002</b>, <b>1030</b>, <b>1032</b>, <b>1034</b> and <b>1036</b> are connected to a dedicated gaming network <b>1022</b>. In general, the DCU <b>1024</b> functions as an intermediary between the different gaming machines on the network <b>1022</b> and the site controller <b>1042</b>. In general, the DCU <b>1024</b> receives data transmitted from the gaming machines and sends the data to the site controller <b>1042</b> over a transmission path <b>1026</b>. In some instances, when the hardware interface used by the gaming machine is not compatible with site controller <b>1042</b>, a translator <b>1025</b> may be used to convert serial data from the DCU <b>1024</b> to a format accepted by site controller <b>1042</b>. The translator may provide this conversion service to a plurality of DCUs.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0186">Further, in some dedicated gaming networks, the DCU <b>1024</b> can receive data transmitted from site controller <b>1042</b> for communication to the gaming machines on the gaming network. The received data may be, for example, communicated synchronously to the gaming machines on the gaming network.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0187">Here, CVT <b>1052</b> provides cashless and cashout gaming services to the gaming machines in gaming establishment <b>1001</b>. Broadly speaking, CVT <b>1052</b> authorizes and validates cashless gaming machine instruments (also referred to herein as &#x201c;tickets&#x201d; or &#x201c;vouchers&#x201d;), including but not limited to tickets for causing a gaming machine to display a game result and cash-out tickets. Moreover, CVT <b>1052</b> authorizes the exchange of a cashout ticket for cash. These processes will be described in detail below. In one example, when a player attempts to redeem a cash-out ticket for cash at cashout kiosk <b>1044</b>, cash out kiosk <b>1044</b> reads validation data from the cashout ticket and transmits the validation data to CVT <b>1052</b> for validation. The tickets may be printed by gaming machines, by cashout kiosk <b>1044</b>, by a stand-alone printer, by CVT <b>1052</b>, etc. Some gaming establishments will not have a cashout kiosk <b>1044</b>. Instead, a cashout ticket could be redeemed for cash by a cashier (e.g. of a convenience store), by a gaming machine or by a specially configured CVT.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of a network device that may be configured for implementing some methods of the present invention.

For example, by exploiting current smartphones (or tablets or the like), the gamer is allowed, following registration on a web platform, to download an Application for accessing the game on his/her own smartphone or tablet (hereinafter such Application will be referred to with the short-term App). At this point, the gamer may load the funds he/she wishes on his/her own game account and he/she is ready to attend the available games.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0209">As previously mentioned, the means <b>4</b> for the audio and video reproduction comprises one or more cameras <b>6</b> arranged at the relocated game site <b>3</b> and/or one or more monitors/tv sets arranged at the remote game site <b>2</b>. In this way, in order to improve the game experience of the gamer, the live broadcast of the game session really performed by a croupier operating at the relocated side <b>3</b>, is made available on a big monitor/tv set, which the gamer may attend through his/her own game App available on his/her own mobile device (smartphone or tablet or the like). For example, in case of the roulette game, the gamer has available on his/her own mobile device an App reproducing chips and game table, therethrough he/she may perform bets by touching the table area of interest.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0210"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows, schematically, the main components of a remote game site <b>2</b> according to one embodiment. In particular, a cash station <b>100</b> is shown, which will be handled by an operator of the game site <b>2</b>, usable for example by the gamers for the preliminary procedures of loading funds onto their own game account.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0211">The cash station <b>100</b> provides a personal computer <b>101</b>, thereto a scanner <b>102</b> and a printer <b>103</b> are advantageously connected for the administrative type requirements (registration of gamers, scanning of identity documents, etc.). The cash station <b>100</b> could further be equipped with a router <b>104</b> (preferably of wireless type) for accessing a local network. Furthermore, in order to improve the game experience of the gamer and to promote the socialization with other people present in the room, inside the same there are means for virtually repeating the game surface <b>10</b>. Said means comprises a game table <b>5</b>, also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0212">The game table is equipped with apparatuses for implementing the function thereof of repeating the game surface <b>10</b>. In particular, the game table <b>5</b> comprises a horizontal, preferably high-definition monitor, whereon an image is reproduced, updated in real time, of the game surface <b>10</b>, existing in the relocated game site <b>3</b>, and a QR-Code of the room identifying the table. Thanks to the help of such means, each bet performed by the gamer through his/her own App is repeated even onto the horizontal monitor, which reproduces the game layout of the baccarat table. Said horizontal monitor has no interactive feature, but it reproduces exclusively what made individually by each gamer on his/her own mobile device. Furthermore, as it is still visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the game table <b>5</b> in turn comprises apparatuses to be connected, preferably in wireless mode, to the local network and, by means of internet, to the relocated game site. To this purpose, a processor <b>200</b> may be provided, thereto an access point <b>201</b>, for the connection to Internet, and a router <b>204</b>, for the connection to the local network, are connected, for example by means of a switch <b>203</b>.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0213">Furthermore, an additional monitor <b>300</b>, arranged in the room of the remote game site <b>2</b>, may be connected to the processor <b>200</b>, in case by means of an additional personal computer <b>202</b>, for enjoying a live broadcast by the gamers and/or other present people. Other multimedia devices, such as for example loudspeaker baffles <b>301</b>, may be connected to the monitor.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0214">Advantageously, by means of the cash PC <b>101</b>, positioned in the cash station, the operator is capable to handle the devices constituting the system. For example, he/she could turn off and/or re-start the table, turn-off or re-start the PC for the live broadcast, change the camera for displaying the live broadcast from the casino.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0215">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>5</b>B</figref>, an illustrative system for implementing a mobile app wagering event of the present technology may include a device <b>240</b><i>a </i>having a processor <b>216</b><i>a </i>with a memory, one or more input peripherals <b>514</b>, and one or more output peripherals <b>212</b><i>a</i>. System <b>240</b><i>a </i>may also include a network connection <b>204</b>, and one or more remote computers <b>209</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0188" num="0216">Ana illustrative device <b>504</b> is a smartphone or a tablet computer, although any other consumer electronic device can be used. The processor can comprise a microprocessor such as an Atom or A4 device. The processor's operation is controlled, in part, by information stored in the memory, such as operating system software, application software (e.g., &#x201c;apps&#x201d;), data, etc. The memory may comprise flash memory, a hard drive, etc.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0217">The input peripherals <b>514</b> may include a camera, buttons, contact switch, pressure switch and/or a microphone. The peripherals (or device <b>512</b> itself) may also comprise an interface system by which analog signals sampled by the camera/microphone are converted into digital data suitable for processing by the system. Other input peripherals can include a touch screen, keyboard, etc. The output peripherals <b>512</b> <b>212</b><i>a </i>can include a display screen, speaker, etc. The network connection to the cloud <b>510</b> can be wired (e.g., Ethernet, etc.), wireless (WiFi, 4G, Bluetooth, etc.), or both.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0218">In an exemplary operation, device <b>216</b><i>a </i>receives a set of digital content data, such as through a wireless interface, through the network connection to the cloud <b>510</b>, or otherwise. The content data may be of any type, but video content is required at a minimum, and audio is exemplary of additional content.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0219">The system <b>240</b><i>a </i>preferably processes the digital content data to generate corresponding identification data. This may be done, e.g., by applying a password, digital watermark decoding process, or a fingerprinting algorithm&#x2014;desirably to data representing the sonic or visual information itself, rather than to so-called &#x201c;out-of-band&#x201d; data (e.g., file names, header data, etc.). The resulting identification data serves to distinguish the received content data from other data of the same type (e.g., other audio or other video components).</p><p id="p-0192" num="0220">By reference to this identification data, the system determines corresponding software that should be invoked and even open access to an online account that can be accessed by the player/user on the device. One way to do this is by indexing a table, database, or other data structure with the identification data, to thereby obtain information identifying the appropriate software. An illustrative table is shown conceptually in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0221">In some instances the data structure may return identification of a single software program. In that case, this software is launched&#x2014;if available. (Availability does not require that the software be resident on the device. Cloud-based apps may be available.) If not available, the software may be downloaded (e.g., from an online repository, such as the iTunes store or an online wagering company), installed, and launched. (Or, the device can subscribe to a software-as-service cloud version of the app.) Involvement of the user in such action(s) can depend on the particular implementation: sometimes the user is asked for permission; in other implementations such actions proceed without disturbing the user.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0222">Sometimes the data structure may identify several different software programs. The different programs may be specific to different platforms, in which case, device <b>12</b> may simply pick the program corresponding to that platform (e.g., Android G2, iPhone 4, etc.). Or, the data structure may identify several alternative wagering programs that can be used on a given platform. In this circumstance, the device may check to determine which&#x2014;if any&#x2014;is already installed and available. If such a program is found, it can be launched. If two such programs are found, the device may choose between them using an algorithm (e.g., most-recently-used; smallest memory footprint; etc.), or the device may prompt the user for a selection. If none of the alternative programs is available to the device, the device can select and download one&#x2014;again using an algorithm, or based on input from the user. Once downloaded and installed, the application is launched.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0223">Sometimes the data structure may identify different programs that serve different functions&#x2014;all related to the content. One, for example, may be an app for discovery of hints or suggestions for moves within the game. Another may be an app for purchase of the content (e.g., pay for a hint, especially if the display provides a signal that a &#x201c;better move&#x201d; is available. Again, each different class of software may include several alternatives.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0224">Note that the device may already have an installed application that is technically suited to work with the received content (e.g., to render an active video file, operate a preapproved or licensed gaming content, MPEG4 or an MP3 file). For certain types of operations, there may be dozens or more such programs that are technically suitable. However, the content may indicate that only a subset of this universe of possible software programs should be used.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0225">Software in the device <b>240</b><i>a </i>may strictly enforce the content-identified software selection. Alternatively, the system may treat such software identification as a preference that the user can override. In some implementations the user may be offered an incentive to use the content-identified software. Or, conversely, the user may be assessed a fee, or other impediment, in order to use software other than that indicated by the content.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0226">Sometimes the system may decline to render certain content on a device (e.g., because of lack of suitable app or hardware capability), but may invite the user to transfer the content to another user device that has the needed capability, and may implement such transfer.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0227">Instead of absolutely declining to render the content, the system may render it in a limited fashion. For example, a video might be rendered as a series of still key frames (e.g., from scene transitions). Again, the system can transfer the content where it can be more properly enjoyed, or&#x2014;if hardware considerations permit (e.g., screen display resolution is adequate)&#x2014;needed software can be downloaded and used.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0228">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>5</b></figref> (which data structure may be resident in the memory of processor <b>216</b><i>a</i>, or in a remote computer system <b>209</b><i>a</i>), the indication of software may be based on one or more contextual factors&#x2014;in addition to the content identification data. (Only two context factors are shown; more or less can of course be used.)</p><p id="p-0201" num="0229">One formal definition of &#x201c;context&#x201d; is &#x201c;any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity (a person, place or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves.&#x201d; Another is the allowable or active state of the gaming event, as either a social event or a legal on-line wagering event.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0230">Context information can be of many sorts, including computing context (network connectivity, memory availability, processor type, CPU contention, etc.), user context (user profile, location, actions, preferences, nearby friends, social network(s) and situation, etc.), physical context (e.g., lighting, noise level, traffic, etc.), temporal context (time of day, day, month, season, etc.), history of the above, etc.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0231">In the technology, information data rows may correspond to the same content (i.e., same content ID), but they indicate different software should be used&#x2014;depending on whether the user's context is indoors or outdoors. (The software is indicated by a symbol hex identifier; the content is identified by multiple hex symbols. Identifiers of other forms, and longer or shorter in length, can of course be used.) Row 36 shows a software selection that includes two items of software&#x2014;both of which are invoked. (One includes a further descriptor&#x2014;an identifier of a gaming event video that is to be loaded by software &#x201c;FF245.&#x201d;) This software is indicated for a user in a daytime context, and for a user in the 20-25 age demographic.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0232">Information displayed may include user location (zip code) and gender as contextual data. The software for this content/context is specified in the alternative (i.e., four identifiers &#x201c;OR&#x201d;d together, as contrasted with the &#x201c;AND&#x201d; in other rows). The same content ID can correspond to different codecs&#x2014;depending on the device processor (Atom or A4).</p><p id="p-0205" num="0233">(By point of comparison, consider the procedure by which codecs are presently chosen in an exemplary-only manner. Typically, the user isn't familiar with technical distinctions between competing codecs, and the artist has no say. Codec selection is thus made by neither party that is most vitally interested in the choice. Instead, default codecs come bundled with certain media rendering software (e.g., Windows Media Player). If the defaults are unable to handle certain content, the rendering software typically downloads a further codec&#x2014;again with no input from the parties most concerned.)</p><p id="p-0206" num="0234">It will be understood that the software indicated by the content can be a stand-alone app, or a software component&#x2014;such as a codec, driver, etc. The software can render the content, or it can be a content companion&#x2014;providing other information or functionality related to the content. In some implementations the &#x201c;software&#x201d; can comprise a URL, or other data/parameter that is provided to another software program or online service (e.g., a YouTube video identifier).</p><p id="p-0207" num="0235">All such software identified in the table may be chosen by the proprietor (e.g., game designer, layout artist, content creator or copyright-holder) of the content with which it is associated. This affords the proprietor a measure of artistic control that is missing in most other digital content systems. (The proprietor's control in such matters should be given more deference than, say, that of a content distributor&#x2014;such as Double Deal&#x2122; internet gaming, AOL or iTunes. Likewise, the proprietor's choice seems to merit more weight than that of the company providing word processing and spreadsheet software for the device.)</p><p id="p-0208" num="0236">The popularity of content can lead associated software to become similarly popular, which is why the ambience of the present game may channel a feel like that of the popular baccarat games. This can induce other content proprietors to consider such software for use with their own content, since wide deployment of that software may facilitate consumer exposure to the other proprietor's content.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0237">(The software may be changed over time, such as through the course of a games' release cycle. When a new symbol image becomes desirable (as by modifying the game to holiday-reflective content), the table-specified software may include an app intended to introduce the new symbols to the public. After the gaming format has become popular and the game has become better known, a different software selection may be indicated.)</p><p id="p-0210" num="0238">Presently, game discovery and other content-related applications are commonly performed by application software. Operating system (OS) software provides a variety of useful services&#x2014;some of which (e.g., I/O) are commonly used in content-related applications. However, commercial OS software has not previously provided any services specific to content processing or identification. In accordance with a further aspect of the present technology, operating system software is provided to perform one or more services specific to content processing or identification.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0239">In one particular implementation, an OS application programming interface (API) takes content data as input (or a pointer to a location where the content data is stored), and returns fingerprint data corresponding thereto. Another OS service (either provided using the same API, or another) takes the same input, and returns watermark information decoded from the content data. (An input parameter to the API can specify which of plural fingerprint or watermark processes is to be applied. Alternatively, the service may apply several different watermark and/or fingerprint extraction processes to the input data, and return resultant information to the calling program. In the case of watermark extraction, the resultant information can be checked for apparent validity by reference to error correction data or the like.)</p><p id="p-0212" num="0240">The same API, or another, can further process the extracted fingerprint/watermark data to obtain XML-based content metadata that is associated with the content (e.g., text giving the title of the game, the name of the provider or designer, the intellectual property holder, etc.). To do this it may consult a remote metadata registry, such as maintained by a distal third party.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0241">Such a content-processing API can establish a message queue (e.g., a playing/wagering queue) to which results of the fingerprint/watermark extraction process (either literally, or the corresponding metadata) are published. One or more application programs can monitor (hook) the queue&#x2014;listening for certain identifiers. One app may be to alert to sizes of wagers, length of time in which gaming is active, and other relevant gaming information. When such content is detected, the monitoring app&#x2014;or another&#x2014;can launch into activity&#x2014;logging the event, acting to complement the media content, offering a buying opportunity, offering side bets, offering a progressive jackpot wager, etc. Alternatively, such functionality can be implemented apart from the operating system. One approach is with a subscription model, by which some apps publish capabilities (e.g., looking for a particular type of gaming content event). By these arrangements, loosely-coupled applications can cooperate to enable a similar ecosystem.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0242">One application of the present technology is to monitor media to which a user is exposed&#x2014;as a background process. That is, unlike song identification services such as Shazam, the user need not take any action to initiate a discovery operation to learn the identity of a particular game or related game, but may request on-line transfer to that related game. (Of course, the user&#x2014;at some point&#x2014;must turn on the device, and authorize this background functionality.) Instead, the device listens for a prolonged period&#x2014;much longer than the 10-15 seconds of Shazam-like services, during the course of the user's day. As content is encountered, it is processed and recognized.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0243">The recognition information is logged in the device, and is used to prime certain software to reflect exposure to such content&#x2014;available the next time the user's attention turns to the device. In some implementations the device can prime software applications with information that is based, at least in part, on the content identification data. This priming may cause an associated app to show a thumbnail corresponding to a gaming video for a game identified as similar by the processor or the player, readying it for selection. Likewise, a 90 second sample video clip may be downloaded to the iPod music player app&#x2014;available in a &#x201c;Recent Encounters&#x201d; folder. An email from the game designers might be added to the user's email InBox. Such data is resident locally (i.e., the user needn't direct its retrieval, e.g., from a web site), and the information is prominent to the user when the corresponding app is next used&#x2014;thereby customizing these apps per the user's content experiences.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0244">Social media applications can serve as platforms through which such information is presented, and shared. The present specification is directed towards multiple embodiments. The following disclosure is provided in order to enable a person having ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention. Language used in this specification should not be interpreted as a general disavowal of any one specific embodiment or used to limit the claims beyond the meaning of the terms used therein. The general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Also, the terminology and phraseology used is for the purpose of describing exemplary embodiments and should not be considered limiting. Thus, the present invention is to be accorded the widest scope encompassing numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents consistent with the principles and features disclosed. For purpose of clarity, details relating to technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0245">For purposes of this application, a social network is an on-line community defined by a first set of data, organized into an account in a mobile application or a set of web pages, that are controlled by and defining the interests, profile, images, video, audio, or other information of a first user (collectively first user data), and a second set of data, organized into an account in a mobile application or a set of web pages, each controlled by and defining the interests, profile, images, video, audio, or other information of a second user (collectively second user data), where the first user can selectively grant to the second user access to the first user data and/or where the second user can selectively grant to the first user access to the second user data. It should be appreciated that the selective granting of data access can be applied by any number of first users by and among any number of second users. It should further be appreciated that when a first user grants to the second user access to the first user data, the first user is &#x201c;connected&#x201d; to the second user.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0246">For purposes of this application, a mobile platform is an operating system programmed to execute on a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet computer, and connect with a remotely hosted e-commerce store for enabling a user to access a plurality of applications. The operating system defines a plurality of procedures, calls, methods, and other programmatic tools which, if adopted and integrated into the applications, permit the application to be purchased, downloaded, and used on the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0247">Both the mobile platform and social network are further defined in that they provide users with a single point of purchase functionality. Even though each may provide access to thousands of products and services, primarily software of different types from different vendors, they provide users with a single point of purchase functionality that is typically actuated by just inputting an identifier, unique to the user of the mobile platform or social network, which triggers a purchase process by authorizing the use of a stored set of billing processes, such as a bank withdrawal or credit card charging process. In this manner, a user of the mobile platform or social network need not engage with multiple different billing systems or re-input billing information every time the user wishes to purchase a software application from a new or different vendor. The mobile platform and social network provide a single purchase functionality that is integrated into the software for hosting the social network and its e-commerce store and integrated into the software for the mobile device operating system and its remotely hosted e-commerce store.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0248">For purposes of this application, a mini-game is any digital content which can be interacted with by a first user to create a challenge for a plurality of second users. A mini-game differs from a conventional wagering game or gaming event in that it typically only includes a single level, a single life, and/or a single interaction screen and is designed to obtain an output which is reformatted as a challenge to a plurality of second users, without placing value at risk. The term mini-game may include abbreviated versions of conventional games such as question and answer games, chain games, fantasy games, arcade games, online video games, bingo, racing games, sporting games, football, baseball, tennis, bowling, ping pong, boxing, basketball, rowing, sailing, shooting, archery, judo, equestrian, gymnastics, wrestling, skiing, hockey, volleyball, cycling, fencing, golf, dominoes, baccarat, word games, crosswords, Scrabble, role play, casino games, roulette, craps, dice games, canasta, chess, checkers, simulation games, mah jong, any card games, including poker, all fives, blackjack, old maid, bridge, pai gow, rummy, 21, crazy eights, or cribbage, or any variations thereof.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0249">It should be appreciated that all of the gaming systems described herein are operated by hosting servers, executing programmatic code, communicating in a wired or wireless manner with programmatic code on a client device being operated by a user, such as a mobile phone, tablet computer, personal computer, laptop or other computing device.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0250">In an embodiment, the gaming site of the present specification provides users with an option to play one or more wagering events or gaming events or mini-games with one or more virtual opponents via the gaming website, via a social networking website such as Facebook&#xae; system, or via a mobile phone operating system, such as Apple&#xae; iOS or Google&#xae;, Android&#xae; systems and the like. In an embodiment, in order to play via a smart phone, a user is prompted to download and install a gaming application by first opening the gaming site on the phone and subsequently clicking on a link provided therein, especially security and verification information components and functions of the gaming events.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0251">In an embodiment, a user may elect to play the game provided by the hosting gaming site via their social network sites such as Facebook&#xae; system. In an embodiment, a user may perform a search for the gaming application on his/her Facebook&#xae; system page and commence gameplay via opening the application, while still being on Facebook&#xae; system. This feature allows the user to play with one or more of his/her Facebook&#xae; system friends that happen to be online at that time by inviting such friends to play. The invite may be sent to the accounts or profile pages of friends. The user may also post updates on his/her homepage notifying everyone, or his/her friends, a time and date when the user would be playing the online game, thereby allowing other individuals to join the user's game at the notified times.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0252">While accessing the gaming application via a social networking site, such as Facebook&#xae; system, a user is informed that the application would be accessing the user's basic information which may be made available by the networking site. The online gaming system of the present specification uses this basic information, such as the user's name and photo, as well as the user's friends list in order to enable the user to see and play with online friends. The gaming application also requests permission to send emails to the user by using the email (or texting or instant messaging) provided by the user to the networking site, in order to send the user alerts on the receipt of gifts, neighbor invitations, and occasionally information on new features, games and special offers, including virtual goods. The user may specify whether the application can send e-mails. Further the user may change the permission granted at any time. The gaming application also requests permission to post to the user's profile page (or &#x2018;wall&#x2019;) on the networking site for sharing gaming information and rewards with friends. The user may specify whether the application can make such postings. In addition, the user is informed that the gaming application may access the user's profile information provided on the networking site. For example, the gaming application may obtain the user's birth date from the profile information provided to ensure that the user receives age-appropriate content from the gaming application.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0253">The user may also choose to play a mini-game (e.g., non-wagering or social app) selected from a set of games hosted by the gaming website via the website itself. In this case, the user is required to log-in to a social network from within the gaming site, in order to enable play, gift-sharing, etc. with his/her friends. In one embodiment, if a user does not have an account on any social networking site, the user is prompted to create one prior to commencing gameplay.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0254">Architecture Overview&#x2014;In one embodiment, the online gaming system of the present specification provides a user, which may be an individual, a company, a partnership, a charity, or any other legal entity, with an option of initiating certain mini-games that, when played, interconnected personal playstations, electronic gaming machines or personal devices <b>1002</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, ease or expand the number of individuals that are part of the users' social network. That social network is visually described as a tree, but it may take any form that has some element of hierarchy embedded within it where an initiating user (the trunk, community owner, or social network owner) is at the base and other members are either directly connected to the initiating user or indirectly connected to the initiating user through other users.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0255">In one embodiment, the tree trunk represents the player that initiates the game, also known as the first user or the initiating user. In one embodiment, branches, also known as a second (or third, fourth, etc.) user or one who was invited to play the game by the another user, represent all players that choose to progress in the game by receiving and engaging in a mini-game challenge from another user and distributing mini-game challenges to another set of users. In another embodiment, leaves represent all players that choose to remain in the game by receiving and engaging in a mini-game challenge from another user but not distributing any challenges from mini-games themselves. In one embodiment, branches and limbs are used interchangeably. In one embodiment, several trees, or several communities, form a forest.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0256">Mini-games and wagering event gaming may comprise multiple different types of content, as described above, and, within each type of content, multiple different formats. A format may comprise of several types of media, including but not limited to text, audio, images, or video media. In one embodiment, the content is a question and answer game that is passed along among the &#x201c;initiating player&#x201d; and &#x201c;subsequent players&#x201d;. Thus, the content may comprise multiple different formats, including a multiple game content selector, multiple choice selections of virtual symbols (i.e. text, video and/or audio) or a series of images. An &#x201c;initiating user&#x201d; can select from many different types of content and corresponding formats through which their game is entered and for subsequent players to engage in. In addition, within each content type, there are several themes, which are genres or sub-genres. Different types of content, formats, symbol themes, and game themes are described below. While throughout this text, examples are provided with respect to &#x201c;questions&#x201d;, it should be noted that this is for illustrative and descriptive purposes only and that any content type of any format may be used with the present invention as described in the present specification.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0257">An intercom-flowchart may assist the general flow between participants in the mini-game described in the present specification. A user (also referred to as an &#x201c;initiating user&#x201d;) requests to initiate a mini-game and creates a challenge for other users/players. The request may take the form of the user signing into the game, the user accessing the gaming site via their electronic device, and/or the user selecting a button or other indicator to start the game. For a first-time user, they may be routed to a sign-up screen. If the user is a return user that has already logged in, then they will be taken to the home screen. In response to the request, the system presents an initiating user with a first piece of content, in at least one of a plurality of formats, as described below, thereby starting the social network hierarchy.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0258">In one embodiment, in step <b>106</b>, the initiating user inputs their response to the first piece of content or first question, where the response generally relates to the initiating user. The first piece of content or first question is modified in accordance with that response, for subsequent users to answer. In one embodiment, and described in greater detail below, the response is format dependent. For example, the response may be a personal answer to a question, a preference, an opinion, a time score value or any other response appropriate to the format. For example, in a puzzle mini-game, the response may include something such as the &#x201c;time to beat&#x201d;. If the response is something in the nature of &#x201c;time to beat&#x201d; then a &#x201c;correct&#x201d; response to that content would be a better time value (i.e. a shorter time spent to beat the game challenge).</p><p id="p-0231" num="0259">The present specification may provide to a first user (the initiating user) a plurality of mini-games which that user can use to create a social network hierarchy which permits that first user to connect with and/or communicate directly with, all individuals within that social network hierarchy. Further, it should be noted that this hierarchy can be through dozens, hundreds, thousands, and an infinite number of levels, all of which may be communicated to or with by the initiating user. There is no requirement that this hierarchy be linear, in fact, as represented by the example of a tree, it can contain several branches and limbs all stemming from the initiating user. When any player invites a subsequent player to become part of the social network hierarchy, the subsequent player has the choice of whether to opt-in. While a first player may personally know the initiating user, and responds to the content (and in this example, question) with the knowledge that he will be in that initiating user's network when he engages in the game, this may not be true for subsequent users such as the third player, fourth player, etc. That person may not know the initiating user and may not want to be part of their mini-game community. Thus, in one embodiment, an opt-in is provided. It should be noted herein that each mini-game and its participants form a &#x201c;social network&#x201d; or &#x201c;community&#x201d; and that these terms may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0260">In step <b>110</b>, the first player(s) is prompted to answer the modified first piece of content or question that is presented to them. If a first player(s) responds to the modified content (or answers the first question) correctly based upon the initiating user's personal response, the first player(s) is prompted to input their response to the original content (in one embodiment, the original first question), or a new piece of content (in one embodiment, a second question) which may be selected in the same manner as described above, and send that modified first question or modified new content (a second question) to one or more of his or her members (a second set of one or more receiving users, also referred to as second player(s)) to which he or she is connected on one or more social networking sites, so that the second player(s) can answer that question. The second set of one or more receiving users may be selected by the first player(s), may be randomly selected from the first player(s)'s list of friends or contacts, and/or may be selected from the first player(s)'s established followers or fans, as indicated within the gaming system. In a wagering format, individual players may agree to contribute to a pot or jackpot, and the pot is distributed among the players according to a standing on points, wins and the like. The distal processor/server may (where legal) take a commission from the pot for managing the gaming event.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0261">Thus, the second player(s) receive(s) the content when the gaming site presents the first player's challenge, as described above, to be responded to by the second player(s). Alternatively, multiple pieces of additional content (or multiple second questions, in one embodiment) can be selected and sent out to multiple second players from, by, or on behalf of the first player(s). In step <b>116</b>, the second player(s) is prompted to respond to the content presented to them. Content that is correctly responded to enables the second player responding to the content to forward that content to a second set of one or more receiving users (or third player(s)), in the same manner described above. The goal of the mini-game is to keep the community growing as long as possible, from the initiating user to nth player(s).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0262">Am APP operating system <b>10</b> of the present disclosure may include an APP operating device and an APP output device.

For example, assuming that the display unit has a full size of 10&#xd7;10, the APP operating unit may output a screen having a size of 10&#xd7;10 according to the received input signal and may change a size of the running APP to a size of 20&#xd7;20.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0299">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the APP operating unit may allocate additional data to the expanded area. The APP operating unit may perform data processing for an area which is not currently displayed on the display unit through background processing to thereby support a data update of the corresponding area. Consequently, the APP operating unit may set the APP screen to have a larger size in the memory, and may perform data writing suitable for the set size of the APP screen. Meanwhile, the APP operating unit may support an output of only the area corresponding to the size of the display unit and may support data updating for the remaining area. The APP operating unit may control a memory allocation size for an adjustment of the above-described APP screen. Namely, the APP operating unit may expand and allocate the memory area to write data having a size larger than the display unit.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0300">The APP data collecting unit collects APP data generated while the APP operating unit operates at least one APP. For example, if APP data is recorded in the memory by APPs activated by the APP operating unit, then the APP data collecting unit may collect the corresponding APP data. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the APP data collecting unit may collect the whole APP data of all APPs recorded in the memory. Alternatively, the APP data collecting unit may also collect only some of the APP data of all the APPs. For example, if five APPs are in an activation status, then the APP data collecting unit may collect the respective five APP data. Alternatively, the APP data collecting unit may collect only some APP data selected to be transmitted to the APP output device among the five APP data.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0301">Meanwhile, if the APP data is updated after the APP data collecting unit collects the respective APP data, then the APP data collecting unit may collect only the updated APP. The respective APP data collected by the APP data collecting unit may be transferred to the APP output device through the connection interface. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the APP data collecting unit may provide, to the APP output device, the APP data including index information or identification information to be differentiated by the APP output device. Further, the buffer operating unit may allocate separate distinguishable buffers so as to provide the respective APP data to the APP output device. The APP data collecting unit may record the corresponding APP data in the respective buffers to provide the APP data to the APP output device. For example, the buffer operating unit may allocate buffers to five APPs, respectively, and the APP data collecting unit may record APP data of the APPs in the respective buffers. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, during the process of the buffer operating unit allocating buffers for the respective APP data, the buffer operating unit may allocate a new buffer when a new APP is activated, and may withdraw the allocated buffer when the APP in an activation status is terminated.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0302">The APP data transmitting unit may transmit the APP data collected by the APP data collecting unit to the APP output device. Further, the APP data transmitting unit may transmit the updated APP data collected by the APP data collecting unit to the APP output device. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the APP data transmitting unit may control formation of a communication channel with the APP output device connected to the connection interface. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the APP data transmitting unit may control formation of at least one of a wired communication channel and a wireless communication channel. The APP data transmitting unit may use at least one communication channel for transmission of the respective APP data. For example, the APP data transmitting unit may create at least one of various communication channels including a WiFi communication channel, a USB communication channel, a UART communication channel, a BT communication channel, and/or the like between the APP data transmitting unit and the APP output device. The APP data transmitting unit may transmit some of the APP data to the APP output device through a USB communication channel and may transmit other APP data to the APP output device through a BT communication channel. Further, the APP data transmitting unit may transmit the remaining APP data to the APP output device through a WiFi communication channel, a UART communication channel, and/or the like.
