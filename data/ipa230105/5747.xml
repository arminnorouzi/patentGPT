Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following description relates to a mask layout and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device using the same, and more particularly, a mask layout used in a level shifter block of a display driver IC and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device using the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A level shifter circuit refers to a circuit that changes the voltage level inside a semiconductor chip such as a display driver IC (DDI). For example, a level shift circuit is used to change a low voltage (LV) signal to a middle voltage (MV) or a high voltage (HV) signal. That is, a level shift circuit is a circuit which is located between the dissimilar voltages having different voltages.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">ESD events involving IC can cause damage or destruction of the circuitry thereon if it is not otherwise protected. As is further discussed below, some ESD circuits may be designed according to a human body model (HBM), while others may be designed according to a charged device model (CDM). Such circuits may have different characteristics that, when used together, allow both the discharge of significant amounts of electrical current as well as keeping discharge paths open for a sufficient duration. A high voltage operating device and a low voltage operating device are fabricated in one chip. In a level shifter circuit, a high voltage-operating device is implemented using an Extended Drain MOS (EDMOS) structure. Electrical Overstress (EOS) related failures caused by charged device model (CDM) are easily observed in an n-type EDMOS (hereinafter referred to as an nEDMOS semiconductor device) used in a level shifter. EOS refers to damage to a device when a voltage or current over a limitation of tolerance is generated. If EOS stress level is increased excessively, EOS related failure may occur in a middle voltage level shifter in a channel decoder. Thus, when a failure occurs in the middle voltage level shifter, which is a chip core block, the abnormal display data decide a source output due to a level shifter failure, causing line dim failure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A failure caused by EOS is known to occur in the silicide region of an EDMOS device, for example. It is presumably due to a migration of the silicide existing in the gate electrode due to the excessive current. Therefore, EOS may be easily introduced into the source region, which is located closer to the gate electrode, and a failure occurs. The silicide region lowers the resistance and helps the current flow. The silicide region is disposed on most of the source region, and the gate-source resistance becomes lower than the gate-drain resistance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, the design of a silicide blocking region may be desired to reduce the current toward the source region when EOS occurs.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.
