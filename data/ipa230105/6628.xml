The electronic device may include isolation circuitry (e.g., an electrical balanced duplexer (EBD) or a phase balanced duplexer (PBD)) that isolates the transmitter from reception signals received over a first frequency, and isolates the receiver from transmission signals sent over a second frequency (e.g., thus implementing frequency division duplex (FDD) operations). In this manner, a duplexer may reduce interference between the transmission and reception signals.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, effectiveness of the isolation between the transmitter and the receiver may be based on an impedance of an antenna associated with each of the transmitter and the receiver. For a radio frequency device, the current at the input of the antenna (e.g., passing through an antenna input impedance (Z<sub>L</sub>)) should be equal to or approximately equal to the current at the output of the antenna (e.g., passing through an antenna output impedance (Z<sub>O</sub>)) to efficiently transmit the transmission signals and receive the reception signals while maintaining a threshold level of isolation between the transmitter and the receiver. To provide an acceptable level of isolation, an impedance tuner of the electronic device may attempt to match, as closely as possible, an impedance of the antenna. However, determining the impedance of the antenna may be difficult.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A summary of certain embodiments disclosed herein is set forth below. It should be understood that these aspects are presented merely to provide the reader with a brief summary of these certain embodiments and that these aspects are not intended to limit the scope of this disclosure. Indeed, this disclosure may encompass a variety of aspects that may not be set forth below.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aspect of the disclosure provides an electronic device. The electronic device includes an antenna, a transmitter communicatively coupled to the antenna, a receiver communicatively coupled to the antenna, a duplexer communicatively coupled to the transmitter and the receiver, a voltage standing wave ratio detector coupled to the duplexer and the antenna, and a processing circuitry communicatively coupled to the impedance tuner. The duplexer includes an impedance tuner. The voltage standing wave ratio detector determines an antenna impedance at the antenna. The processing circuitry adjusts the impedance tuner based on the antenna impedance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another aspect of the disclosure provides an electronic device that includes an antenna, a transmitter communicatively coupled to the antenna and that sends a transmission signal via the antenna, a receiver communicatively coupled to the antenna and that receives a reception signal via the antenna, isolation circuitry communicatively coupled to the transmitter and the receiver, and a processing circuitry. The isolation circuitry isolates the transmitter from the reception signal and isolates the receiver from the transmission signal. The isolation circuitry incudes an impedance tuner that outputs an impedance that correlates to an antenna impedance of the antenna. The processing circuitry applies multiple test impedance settings to the impedance tuner. Moreover, the processing circuitry determines multiple transmitter leakage values and multiple receiver leakage values based on applying the multiple test impedance settings. The processing circuitry also estimates the antenna impedance as an estimated antenna impedance based on the multiple transmitter leakage values and the multiple receiver leakage values, and adjusts the impedance tuner based on the estimated antenna impedance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the disclosure provides an isolation circuitry of an electronic device. The isolation circuitry includes a balanced duplexer system communicatively coupled to a transmitter and a receiver of the electronic device, processing circuitry, and a machine-learning model. The balanced duplexer system includes an impedance tuner that outputs an impedance. The processing circuitry determines a transmitter leakage of the transmitter and a receiver leakage of the receiver, and determines a matching impedance based on the transmitter leakage and the receiver leakage. The machine-learning model determines a tuning state of the impedance tuner based on the matching impedance. The impedance tuner outputs the impedance based on the tuning state.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various refinements of the features noted above may exist in relation to various aspects of the present disclosure. Further features may also be incorporated in these various aspects as well. These refinements and additional features may exist individually or in any combination. For instance, various features discussed below in relation to one or more of the illustrated embodiments may be incorporated into any of the above-described aspects of the present disclosure alone or in any combination.

In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Additionally, it should be understood that references to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; of the present disclosure are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. Use of the term &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; &#x201c;near,&#x201d; &#x201c;about&#x201d;, and/or &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; should be understood to mean including close to a target (e.g., design, value, amount), such as within a margin of any suitable or contemplatable error (e.g., within 0.1% of a target, within 1% of a target, within 5% of a target, within 10% of a target, within 25% of a target, and so on).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This disclosure is directed to tuning an impedance tuner to match or approximately match (e.g., correlate to) an antenna impedance. As previously mentioned, a radio frequency device (e.g., electronic device) may transmit transmission signals and receive reception signals simultaneously or concurrently on different frequencies. The radio frequency device may include an isolation circuitry (e.g., an electrical balanced duplexer or a phase balanced duplexer) that isolates a transmitter from the reception signals and a receiver from the transmission signals. However, effectiveness of the isolation between the transmitter and the receiver may be based on an impedance tuner of the isolation circuitry matching an impedance of an antenna (e.g., antenna impedance) associated with the transmitter and the receiver. To provide an acceptable level of isolation, an impedance tuner of the radio frequency device may match or correlate to the impedance of the antenna (e.g., tuner impedance). However, determining the antenna impedance may be difficult. Moreover, using previous impedance tuner settings for the matching may result in overshooting or unnecessarily tuning the impedance tuner, resulting in a mismatched tuner impedance and therefore poorer isolation performance. In such circumstances, the radio frequency device may inefficiently retune the impedance tuner until the threshold isolation is achieved.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments herein provide various apparatuses and techniques for efficiently and accurately determining the antenna impedance. To do so, the embodiments disclosed herein include a radio frequency device including a power detector to determine a leakage signal of the transmitter (e.g., a transmitter leakage) and a post-processing unit to determine a leakage signal of the receiver (e.g., a receiver leakage). The radio frequency device may determine if isolation is acceptable (e.g., above a predetermined isolation threshold) based on the transmitter and receiver leakages.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the radio frequency device may include at least one device for determining the antenna impedance. For example, the radio frequency device may include a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) detector or a like device that is suitable for measuring the antenna impedance. In such embodiments, in response to isolation performance not being acceptable, the radio frequency device determines (e.g., measures) the antenna impedance using the VSWR detector. The radio frequency device may determine and apply impedance tuner settings (e.g., capacitor and/or inductor values of the impedance tuner) for a target tuner impedance based on the antenna impedance (e.g., matching or approximately matching the antenna impedance).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In embodiments in which the radio frequency device does not include the at least one device for determining the antenna impedance, in response to the isolation not being acceptable, the radio frequency device may select three test tuner settings for test signals to be transmitted and received at a target frequency. That is, the radio frequency device may select three capacitor and/or inductor values for the impedance tuner at the target frequency. The radio frequency device may subsequently send and receive test signals at the target frequency using the three test settings, resulting in three sets of transmitter leakage and receiver leakage values. The radio frequency device may determine three reflection coefficients based on the three sets of transmitter leakage and receiver leakage values, and determine an estimated antenna impedance at the target frequency based on the three reflection coefficients. Moreover, the radio frequency device may determine and apply impedance tuner settings based on the estimated antenna impedance.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In additional embodiments in which the electronic device does not include the at least one device for determining the antenna impedance, the radio frequency device may iteratively determine antenna impedance, such as by using an optimization algorithm (e.g., downhill simplex and/or gradient descent algorithms). Specifically, the radio frequency device may provide the transmitter leakage and the receiver leakage at a target frequency to an algorithm control unit of the radio frequency device that executes the optimization algorithm. The algorithm control unit may provide a matching impedance correlating to the antenna impedance to a machine-learning model. The machine-learning model may apply an inverse model that receives the matching impedance and the target frequency to determine impedance tuner settings (e.g., capacitor and/or inductor values of the impedance tuner) that output the matching impedance at the target frequency. In this manner, the radio frequency device may efficiently and accurately determine the impedance tuner settings for the matching impedance (e.g., in a single tuning) instead of unnecessarily making numerous tuning adjustments until the transmitter and receiver are sufficiently isolated (e.g., within an acceptable level of isolation). The radio frequency device may then tune the capacitor values (e.g., apply impedance tuner settings) of the impedance tuner using the determined impedance tuner settings.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Additionally, rather than using a single machine-learning model (which may be complex and use excessive computing resources to execute), the radio frequency device may store multiple smaller models in a lookup table that correspond to different reflection coefficients. The radio frequency device may determine a reflection coefficient, and use the corresponding model of the multiple models to determine and apply the impedance tuner settings.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With the foregoing in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an electronic device <b>10</b> (e.g., a radio frequency device), according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
