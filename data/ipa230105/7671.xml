A wireless multiple-access communications system may include a number of base stations or network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE). These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple UEs by sharing the available system resources (such as time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A mobile communication device may be configured to operate within a reduced portion of an available system bandwidth referred to as a bandwidth part (BWP). By operating in the BWP, the mobile communication device may reduce its consumption of processing and power resources because it does not need to monitor the entire available bandwidth to communicate with other devices, such as a base station. When the mobile communication device uses analog beamforming, to operate in different BWPs and in different directions, the mobile communication device utilizes multiple processing chains which are each configured for a different, discrete directional communication beam. Additionally, for a base station to communicate with multiple UEs in the same direction via different BWPs, or with multiple UEs in different directions, multiple processing chains are utilized by the base station. For each of the UEs and the base station, increasing the number of processing chains increases cost and power consumption of the respective device. Additionally, as a mobile communication device moves between beam directions with respect to the base station, the mobile communication device may transition from monitoring a first BWP associated with a first beam to monitoring a second BWP associated with a second beam. If the two BWPs are sufficiently far apart in the frequency domain, the change in frequency may result in errors or communication failure as the mobile communication device transitions to using a different processing chain to account for the change in communication beams and BWP.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following summarizes some aspects of the present disclosure to provide a basic understanding of the discussed technology.

The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band (or spectrum) in documents and articles, despite being different than the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band. With the above aspects in mind, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; or the like if used herein may broadly represent frequencies that may be less than 6 GHz, may be within FR1, or may include mid-band frequencies. Further, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; or the like if used herein may broadly represent frequencies that may include mid-band frequencies, may be within FR2, or may be within the EHF band.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A mobile communication device may be configured to operate within a reduced portion of an available system bandwidth referred to as a bandwidth part (BWP). By operating in the BWP, the mobile communication device may reduce its consumption of processing and power resources because it does not need to monitor the entire available bandwidth to communicate with other devices, such as a base station. A mobile communication device may also utilize millimeter wave (mmWave) communication techniques for transmission and reception, which often rely on analog beamforming. However, when the mobile communication device uses analog beamforming, the analog beamforming typically results in a communication beam that points in one direction. Accordingly, to operate in different BWPs and in different directions, the mobile communication device utilizes multiple processing chains which increases a cost of the mobile communication device as well as power consumption at the mobile communication device and at a base station serving the mobile communication device. A mobile communication device that includes multiple processing chains may include a respective processing chain configured for each different, discrete directional communication beam. In addition to increasing costs and power consumption at mobile communication devices such as user equipments (UEs), supporting communication with UEs in different directions and via different BWPs increases costs at a base station. To illustrate, a single processing chain of a base station is typically capable, through use of analog beamforming techniques, to transmit or receiving signaling or data to one or more UEs in a single direction and via a single BWP. To communicate with multiple UEs in the same direction via different BWPs, or with multiple UEs in different directions, multiple processing chains are utilized by the base station. Similar to a UE, increasing the number of processing chains at a base station increases a cost of the base station and power consumption at the base station.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally, supporting communications between a base station and UEs in multiple directions or via multiple BWPs increases signaling overhead in a wireless network. To illustrate, a mobile communication device that includes multiple processing chains may configure the multiple processing chains based on radio resource control (RRC) signaling from the base station, such as to achieve particular directions of communication or to monitor particular BWPs. After configuration of the multiple processing chains, the mobile communication device may move within a coverage area of the base station. If the mobile communication device moves far enough from an original position, the mobile communication device, the base station, or both may change communication beams to beams having different directions based on changing channel conditions as the mobile communication device moves. In order to change a configuration of a processing chain, the mobile communication device typically implements a new configuration that is received via signaling from the base station, which increases signaling overhead and delays communication between the mobile communication device and the base station. Additionally, as a mobile communication device moves between beam directions with respect to the base station, the mobile communication device may transition from monitoring a first BWP associated with a first beam to monitoring a second BWP associated with a second beam. If the two BWPs are sufficiently far apart in the frequency domain, the change in frequency may result in errors or communication failure as the mobile communication device transitions to using a different processing chain to account for the change in direction and BWP.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present disclosure provides systems, apparatus, methods, and computer-readable media for BWP switching. In some particular aspects, a base station may transmit, to a user equipment (UE), mapping information that indicates, for each BWP of multiple BWPs, a mapping between a respective beam direction of multiple beam directions and the BWP. For example, the mapping information may indicate that a first BWP maps to a first beam direction, and a second BWP maps to a second beam direction. The multiple beam directions may correspond to a single beam or to multiple beams, and the mapping may be UE-specific, such that a beam refers to a transmit beam or a receive beam of the UE, or cell-specific, such that a beam refers to resources used by the base station to communicate, such as synchronization signal blocks (SSBs) or channel state information (CSI) reference signals (CSI-RSs). The UE may configure the first BWP as an active BWP and communicate, with the base station via the first BWP, one or more first messages using a beam having the first beam direction. After the configuration of the first BWP as the active BWP, the base station may transmit, to the UE, a change indicator associated with the second BWP of the multiple BWPs or the second beam direction of the multiple beam directions. The UE may use the mapping information to determine, based on the change indicator, the second BWP and the second beam direction. The UE may then configure the second BWP as the active BWP and communicate, with the base station via the second BWP, one or more second messages using a beam (either the same beam after adjustment or a different beam) having the second beam direction.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages. In some aspects, the present disclosure provides techniques for BWP switching may result in a UE experiencing few errors or communication failures due to large frequency shifts that would be experienced in wireless communication systems that do not support this granularity of mapping between beam directions and BWPs. To illustrate, different UEs may be allocated different BWPs and in different directions with reduced complexity, such that a wireless communication devices of the present disclosure may be configured to use a single processing chain to communicate via multiple different BWPs in different beam directions instead of requiring wireless communication devices to include individual processing chains for each discrete directional communication beam and for each discrete BWP associated with a same direction as with conventional techniques. Reducing the number of processing chains included in wireless communication devices reduces complexity, cost and power consumption by the wireless communication devices. The present disclosure also provides techniques for efficient BWP switching such that a UE may gradually, on a more granular level, adjust or change a BWP as the UE moves and changes position with respect to the base station, as compared to other wireless communication systems. Furthermore, the described mapping information may be communicated during an association process or at another time, instead of being communicated as the UE changes each BWP or beam direction, thereby reducing the signaling overhead. Additionally or alternatively, the base station may transmit a message, such as a downlink control information (DCI) or a medium access control-control element (MAC-CE), to initiate the UE to change a BWP or beam direction as the UE changes position within an area covered by one beam, such that the UE may gradually change BWPs being monitored as the UE changes beam directions with respect to the base station instead of being handed off from one beam to another in order to change BWPs or to change directions. By enabling a more gradual change of BWP during movement, the UE may experience fewer errors or communication failures due to large frequency shifts that would be experienced in wireless communication systems that do not support this granularity of mapping between beam directions and BWPs.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">This disclosure relates generally to providing or participating in authorized shared access between two or more wireless communications systems, also referred to as wireless communications networks.

UTRA includes wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and low chip rate (LCR). CDMA2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95, and IS-856 standards.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A TDMA network may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). 3GPP defines standards for the GSM EDGE (enhanced data rates for GSM evolution) radio access network (RAN), also denoted as GERAN. GERAN is the radio component of GSM or GSM EDGE, together with the network that joins the base stations (for example, the Ater and Abis interfaces, among other examples) and the base station controllers (for example, A interfaces, among other examples). The radio access network represents a component of a GSM network, through which phone calls and packet data are routed from and to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Internet to and from subscriber handsets, also known as user terminals or UEs. A mobile phone operator's network may include one or more GERANs, which may be coupled with UTRANs in the case of a UMTS or GSM network. Additionally, an operator network may include one or more LTE networks, or one or more other networks. The various different network types may use different radio access technologies (RATs) and radio access networks (RANs).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An OFDMA network may implement a radio technology such as evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.20, flash-OFDM and the like. UTRA, E-UTRA, and GSM are part of universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). In particular, long term evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA. UTRA, E-UTRA, GSM, UMTS and LTE are described in documents provided from an organization named the &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; (3GPP), and cdma2000 is described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project 2&#x201d; (3GPP2). These various radio technologies and standards are known or are being developed. For example, the 3GPP is a collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations that aims to define a globally applicable third generation (3G) mobile phone specification. 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) is a 3GPP project aimed at improving the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) mobile phone standard. The 3GPP may define specifications for the next generation of mobile networks, mobile systems, and mobile devices. The present disclosure may describe certain aspects with reference to LTE, 4G, 5G, or NR technologies; however, the description is not intended to be limited to a specific technology or application, and one or more aspects described with reference to one technology may be understood to be applicable to another technology. Indeed, one or more aspects the present disclosure are related to shared access to wireless spectrum between networks using different radio access technologies or radio air interfaces.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">5G networks contemplate diverse deployments, diverse spectrum, and diverse services and devices that may be implemented using an OFDM-based unified, air interface. To achieve these goals, further enhancements to LTE and LTE-A are considered in addition to development of the new radio technology for 5G NR networks. The 5G NR will be capable of scaling to provide coverage (1) to a massive Internet of things (IoTs) with an ultra-high density (such as &#x2dc;1M nodes per km2), ultra-low complexity (such as &#x2dc;10s of bits per sec), ultra-low energy (such as &#x2dc;10+years of battery life), and deep coverage with the capability to reach challenging locations; (2) including mission-critical control with strong security to safeguard sensitive personal, financial, or classified information, ultra-high reliability (such as 99.9999% reliability), ultra-low latency (such as &#x2dc;1 millisecond (ms)), and users with wide ranges of mobility or lack thereof; and (3) with enhanced mobile broadband including extreme high capacity (such as &#x2dc;10 Tbps per km2), extreme data rates (such as multi-Gbps rate, 100+Mbps user experienced rates), and deep awareness with advanced discovery and optimizations.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">5G NR devices, networks, and systems may be implemented to use optimized OFDM-based waveform features. These features may include scalable numerology and transmission time intervals (TTIs); a common, flexible framework to efficiently multiplex services and features with a dynamic, low-latency time division duplex (TDD) or frequency division duplex (FDD) design; and advanced wireless technologies, such as massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO), robust mmWave transmissions, advanced channel coding, and device-centric mobility. Scalability of the numerology in 5G NR, with scaling of subcarrier spacing, may efficiently address operating diverse services across diverse spectrum and diverse deployments. For example, in various outdoor and macro coverage deployments of less than 3 GHz FDD or TDD implementations, subcarrier spacing may occur with 15 kHz, for example over 1, 5, 10, 20 MHz, and the like bandwidth. For other various outdoor and small cell coverage deployments of TDD greater than 3 GHz, subcarrier spacing may occur with 30 kHz over 80 or 100 MHz bandwidth. For other various indoor wideband implementations, using a TDD over the unlicensed portion of the 5 GHz band, the subcarrier spacing may occur with 60 kHz over a 160 MHz bandwidth. Finally, for various deployments transmitting with mmWave components at a TDD of 28 GHz, subcarrier spacing may occur with 120 kHz over a 500 MHz bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The scalable numerology of 5G NR facilitates scalable TTI for diverse latency and quality of service (QoS) requirements. For example, shorter TTI may be used for low latency and high reliability, while longer TTI may be used for higher spectral efficiency. The efficient multiplexing of long and short TTIs to allow transmissions to start on symbol boundaries. 5G NR also contemplates a self-contained integrated subframe design with uplink or downlink scheduling information, data, and acknowledgement in the same subframe. The self-contained integrated subframe supports communications in unlicensed or contention-based shared spectrum, adaptive uplink or downlink that may be flexibly configured on a per-cell basis to dynamically switch between uplink and downlink to meet the current traffic needs.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For clarity, certain aspects of the apparatus and techniques may be described below with reference to example 5G NR implementations or in a 5G-centric way, and 5G terminology may be used as illustrative examples in portions of the description below; however, the description is not intended to be limited to 5G applications.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Moreover, it should be understood that, in operation, wireless communication networks adapted according to the concepts herein may operate with any combination of licensed or unlicensed spectrum depending on loading and availability.

A macro cell generally covers a relatively large geographic area, such as several kilometers in radius, and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscriptions with the network provider. A small cell, such as a pico cell, would generally cover a relatively smaller geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscriptions with the network provider. A small cell, such as a femto cell, would also generally cover a relatively small geographic area, such as a home, and, in addition to unrestricted access, may provide restricted access by UEs having an association with the femto cell, such as UEs in a closed subscriber group (CSG), UEs for users in the home, and the like.

In an unlicensed frequency portion of the shared radio frequency spectrum band, the UEs <b>115</b> or the base stations <b>105</b> may traditionally perform a medium-sensing procedure to contend for access to the frequency spectrum. For example, the UE <b>115</b> or base station <b>105</b> may perform a listen-before-talk or listen-before-transmitting (LBT) procedure such as a clear channel assessment (CCA) prior to communicating in order to determine whether the shared channel is available. A CCA may include an energy detection procedure to determine whether there are any other active transmissions. For example, a device may infer that a change in a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of a power meter indicates that a channel is occupied. Specifically, signal power that is concentrated in a certain bandwidth and exceeds a predetermined noise floor may indicate another wireless transmitter. In some implementations, a CCA may include detection of specific sequences that indicate use of the channel.

The BS may transmit a CSI-RS using each transmit beam for beam management. To enable the UE to perform receive (Rx) beam sweeping, the BS may use a transmit beam to transmit (e.g., with repetitions) each CSI-RS at multiple times within the same RS resource set so that the UE can sweep through receive beams in multiple transmission instances. For example, if the BS has a set of K transmit beams and the UE has a set of L receive beams, the CSI-RS may be transmitted on each of the K transmit beams L times so that the UE may receive L instances of the CSI-RS per transmit beam. In other words, for each transmit beam of the BS, the UE may perform beam sweeping through the receive beams of the UE. As a result, the first beam management procedure may enable the UE to measure a CSI-RS on different transmit beams using different receive beams to support selection of BS transmit beams/UE receive beam(s) beam pair(s). The UE may report the measurements to the BS to enable the BS to select one or more beam pairs for communication between the BS and the UE.

When a transmitted signal is not frequency selective in a wireless channel (e.g., a bandwidth of a transmission waveform is approximately the same as a coherent bandwidth of the wireless channel), a receiver device, such as a UE <b>120</b>, receives a signal that is frequency flat (e.g., each frequency component of the transmission waveform experiences approximately the same behavior with respect to, for example, fading).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">However, in a true-time-delay array, which may also be referred to as a &#x201c;true-time-delay analog array&#x201d;, a &#x201c;true-time-delay architecture&#x201d;, or a &#x201c;true-time-delay analog array architecture&#x201d;, among other examples, the transmitter device applies a set of different time delays, in addition to the different beamforming weights, to repetitions of the signal. For example, assume a wideband (e.g., spanning multiple tones) signal S that is to be transmitted by an array of antenna elements, where each antenna element i multiplies signal S by its respective beamforming weight, w<sub>i</sub>, as mentioned above. In this true-time-delay architecture, each antenna element i would, in addition to multiplying signal S by its respective beamforming weight, apply a time delay, d<sub>i</sub>. In one mathematical representation, each antenna element i would transmit signal Y<sub>i</sub>, where signal Y<sub>i </sub>(t)=w<sub>i</sub>, *S(t-d<sub>i</sub>). A fixed time delay or time shift, d<sub>i</sub>, across the antenna elements in time domain can result in a frequency dependent phase shift in the frequency domain. As such, the time delay, d<sub>i</sub>, applied to each antenna element can be understood as a different frequency domain phase offset value being introduced to each tone of signal S. This phase offset can result in each tone being transmitted in a different direction. As such, when the transmitter device transmits using a true-time-delay array, the transmitter device transmits using beamforming that is frequency selective with respect to different transmit directions. While the signal S has been described above as being multiplied by beamforming weights, it is understood that such a multiplication in mathematical terms may be implemented in hardware in an antenna array, or circuitry associated with an antenna array, using different components such as phase shifters, power amplifiers, or the like.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example <b>500</b> of true-time-delay beamforming according to one or more aspects. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, signals associated with different portions of a frequency are pointed in different directions. For example, a transmitter device may transmit a first sub-band of a frequency band in a first direction and a second sub-band of the frequency band in a second direction that is different than the first direction. In one example, each sub-band within the frequency band can correspond to a resource element, such that each resource element has a different frequency but is transmitted at a same time. In this way, a BS <b>105</b> may concurrently transmit a plurality of repetitions of a communication in different frequency sub-bands, which may correspond to the sub-bands of the frequency band that are covered by different signals transmittable using a true-time-delay array. Similarly, the BS <b>105</b> may receive signals from different directions concurrently from a plurality of UEs <b>120</b> using a true-time-delay array, which may be referred to as a &#x201c;receive true-time-delay array&#x201d; or an &#x201c;Rx true-time-delay array&#x201d;, among other examples. In this case, a receive direction of a first communication may correspond to a transmit direction of a second communication that triggered the first communication. Further, sub-bands used for transmission may correspond to sub-bands used for reception so that the BS <b>105</b> transmits a repetition of a communication on a particular sub-band using the true-time-delay array and receives a response to the communication on the particular sub-band.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above, to perform beam management or beam refinement procedures, a BS may transmit a plurality of discrete, frequency division multiplexed reference signals for measurement by a UE. The UE may report a result of one or more measurements to enable the BS to determine a beam direction, a transmit power, or a beam angle, among other examples. However, a granularity of such beam management or beam refinement procedures may be limited by a quantity of discrete reference signals that are transmitted.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Some aspects described herein enable a BS to use a true-time-delay analog array to transmit a wideband, frequency-selective beam across a plurality of different resource elements and directions such that each direction of the plurality of directions is associated with a different resource element of the plurality of resource elements where the plurality resource elements can be defined by a plurality of resource element (RE) offsets relative to a reference RE. In this case, the UE may perform measurements of the beam at the plurality of RE offsets and report a result of the measurements to the BS or a control node to enable a beam management or beam refinement procedure. Based at least in part on using measurements of different RE offsets of a wideband, frequency-selective beam rather than measurements of a plurality of discrete frequency division multiplexed reference signals, the BS may achieve a finer level of beam management or beam refinement.
