In some embodiments, the turn-off circuits can control excessive ringing that may exist when an external silicon controller gate driver is used to drive a GaN power switch.

It is understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of certain inventive embodiments.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the AC-DC flyback power converter circuit <b>100</b> can include a GaN power transistor <b>102</b>. The AC-DC converter can further include an input circuit <b>108</b>, a transformer <b>110</b> and an output circuit <b>112</b>. The input circuit <b>108</b> can condition a universal input voltage and feed it into the primary side of the transformer <b>110</b>. The converter circuit <b>100</b> can also include a controller IC <b>114</b> to drive the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>. The controller IC <b>114</b> can provide a gate drive voltage to the gate <b>106</b> of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, a turn-off circuit <b>104</b> can control the turn-off behavior of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>. The turn-off circuit <b>104</b> can be employed to reduce excessive ringing in the drain-to-source current of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> when the GaN transistor <b>102</b> turns off, resulting in improved EMI performance of the power converter circuit <b>100</b>. GaN power transistors can turn off much faster than their silicon counterparts, thus without proper control of the GaN power transistor, the fast turn-off of the GaN power transistor can cause excessive ringing due to parasitic inductances which are inherent in circuit boards. Controller IC <b>114</b> can provide a pull-down (PD) signal <b>119</b> at terminal <b>118</b> to the turn-off circuit <b>104</b>, which can be used by the turn-off circuit <b>104</b> to control the gate voltage of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>. In various embodiments, the turn-off circuit <b>104</b> can be formed in the same die as the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>, while in other embodiments the turn-off circuit can be formed as part of the same die as the controller IC <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, controller IC <b>114</b> can be formed in a silicon substrate.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In order to better appreciate the features and aspects of turn-off circuits according to the present disclosure, further context for the disclosure is provided in the following section by discussing one particular implementation of turn-off circuits according to embodiments of the present disclosure. These embodiments are for example only and other embodiments can be employed in other power converter circuits such as, but not limited to DC-DC power converters employing GaN power devices.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a more detailed view of turn-off circuit <b>104</b> of power converter circuit <b>100</b> is illustrated. The turn-off circuit <b>104</b> can include three segments: a first segment <b>240</b> which includes transistor <b>202</b> that can be connected between the gate <b>106</b> of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> and ground; a second segment <b>208</b> which includes a transistor <b>204</b> and a diode-connected transistor <b>206</b>, where transistors <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> can be arranged in a cascode configuration; and a third segment <b>242</b> which can include a pull down transistor <b>214</b> and its gate drive circuit <b>210</b>. The three segment configuration of the turn-off circuit can mitigate EMI emissions during the turn-off of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> without sacrificing performance or adding significant die size. In some embodiments, when pull down signal <b>119</b> (PD_GaN) goes high, first segment transistor <b>202</b> can turn on and can provide a constant discharge of the gate <b>106</b> of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>. The second segment transistor <b>204</b> can also turn-on when PD_GaN signal goes high. Transistor <b>204</b> can be used for fast discharging of the gate voltage of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>. Resistor <b>230</b> can be used to set the bias point for the operation of transistor <b>206</b>. During turn-off of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>, the voltage on its gate <b>106</b> can be pulled down by the second stage to within one threshold voltage above ground. The third segment transistor <b>214</b> can also turn-on when PD_GaN goes high, however due to the presence of the resistor <b>224</b> (R<sub>1</sub>) and capacitor <b>222</b> (C<sub>1</sub>) the turn-on of the transistor <b>214</b> can be delayed by a time constant R<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>. As an example, the R<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1 </sub>delay can be 10 to 20 ns. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure the value of the delay can be set to any suitable value. A diagram of the voltage of gate <b>106</b> during turn-off is described further below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The size of the transistor <b>214</b> can be designed such that when the gate <b>106</b> of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> is pulled down, the gate <b>106</b> is prevented from going high again due to presence of high rate of change of voltage as a function of time (dv/dt) at the drain of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>, i.e., the drain the of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> can rise rapidly and have an overshoot. The gate-to-drain capacitance of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> can couple the drain voltage (which is overshooting to the high side) onto its gate voltage, and cause the gate voltage to go high (from a low state) and cause the GaN power transistor to turn back on. Thus, transistor <b>214</b> is designed such that it can overcome the gate-to-drain capacitance of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>, for example, the size of the transistor <b>214</b> can be designed to be 7% to 10% the size of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>. Proper sizing of transistor <b>214</b> can enable transistor <b>214</b> to hold the gate of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> in low-state during turn-off. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure the any suitable ratio of sizes of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> and transistor <b>214</b> can be used.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The R<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1 </sub>network (resistor <b>224</b> and capacitor <b>222</b>) connected at the gate of transistor <b>214</b> can add a delay to the turn-off of transistor <b>214</b>, which may cause shoot-through when the gate <b>106</b> of the GaN power transistor is turning on. To address this shoot-through, a diode connected transistor <b>218</b> and a transistor <b>216</b> can be connected in parallel with the resistor <b>224</b> (R<sub>1</sub>). Transistors <b>218</b> and <b>216</b> can be utilized to discharge the gate of transistor <b>214</b> rapidly such that transistor <b>214</b> can be turned off rapidly so as to prevent shoot-through. The gate of the transistor <b>216</b> can be controlled by the signal PD_GaN with a delay added by the resistors <b>232</b> (R<sub>2</sub>) and capacitor <b>220</b> (C<sub>2</sub>). In this way, the R<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2 </sub>time delay can cause the voltage at the gate of transistor <b>216</b> to be held at the value of PD_GaN signal. As an example, the value of R<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2 </sub>delay can be 20 to 30 ns. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure the value of the delay can be set to any suitable value.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an example diagram <b>300</b> of the gate voltage of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> as a function of time is shown. More specifically, graph <b>304</b> shows the gate voltage of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> with the turn-off circuit connected to it gate, while graph <b>302</b> shows the gate of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> with a single pull down transistor but without the turn-off circuit. In diagram <b>300</b>, the gate voltage drops from 6 V to 0 V to turn off transistor <b>102</b>. As can be seen in graph <b>302</b>, without the turn-off circuit, the gate of the GaN power transistor drops rapidly from high-state to low-state. This can cause ringing of its drain-to-source current and cause EMI emission.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Graph <b>304</b> shows that three distinct sections exist when the turn-off circuit <b>104</b> is connected to the gate <b>106</b> of the GaN power transistor. During the first section <b>310</b>, the gate voltage drops rapidly from the on-state voltage <b>316</b> to a first intermediate voltage <b>318</b>. This is caused by the turn-on of the transistor <b>204</b>. This rapid drop minimizes delay time. During the second section <b>312</b>, the gate voltage drops from the first intermediate voltage <b>318</b> to a second intermediate voltage <b>320</b> at a slower rate. This slow down can result in a significant reduction in EMI by keeping the gate voltage between the first and the second intermediate voltages. The slow-down of the rate of drop of the gate voltage in the second section slows down the discharge of the gate, which reduces ripple in the drain-to-source current of the GaN power transistor. Transistor <b>202</b> can set the duration of time between T<b>1</b> to T<b>2</b>, where transistor <b>202</b> holds the voltage on gate <b>106</b> at a low state. During second section <b>312</b>, voltage of gate <b>106</b> can drop to a value of one threshold voltage of the transistor <b>206</b>, since the transistor <b>206</b> is in diode-connected configuration, for example the voltage of gate <b>106</b> can drop from 6 V to around 1.5 V. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure the initial gate voltage and the threshold voltage of the transistor <b>206</b> can be adjusted to any suitable values. In the third section <b>314</b>, after T<b>2</b>, the dv/dt event has passed and the gate voltage drops rapidly to a low state and can be held in a low state by the pull-down transistor <b>214</b>. The pull-down transistor <b>214</b> can prevent the gate of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> from going high again, which can occur due to the gate <b>106</b> capacitively coupling to the drain of the transistor <b>102</b>. As described earlier, the third section is dominated by the turn-on of the pull-down transistor <b>214</b> because transistor <b>214</b> turns on after a time delay due to R<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1 </sub>network. The three stage drop in the gate voltage of the GaN power transistor during turn-off can reduce ringing and improve EMI, while keeping switching power losses low in the power converter <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The turn-off circuit can effectively mitigate EMI emissions without increasing die size significantly. For example, the size of the transistors <b>206</b> and <b>204</b> can be 20% of the size of transistor <b>214</b>, and the size the transistor <b>202</b> can be 20% the size of the transistor <b>204</b>. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure the value of the ratio of transistor sizes can be any suitable size. Thus, the die area of the turn-off circuit can be minimal. Furthermore, the turn-off circuit does not require complicated or extra control signals, thus saving die area. Moreover, the die area consumed by the R<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1 </sub>network can be minimal, for example the delay of R<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1 </sub>network can be 10 to 20 ns, which would use small values for resistor R<sub>1 </sub>and capacitor C<sub>1</sub>. As appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure the value of the time delay of R<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1 </sub>network and the values for resistor R<sub>1 </sub>and capacitor C<sub>1 </sub>can be any suitable values. As further appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the turn-off circuit can have fewer or a greater number of stages, the rate of turn off, the total time of turn off and other characteristics can be different than described herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a graph <b>400</b> of gate voltage, drain current of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> as a function of time is shown.

Graph <b>404</b> shows the gate voltage of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b> with the turn-off circuit connected to its gate <b>106</b>, while graph <b>402</b> shows the gate without the turn-off circuit being connected. As can be seen in graph <b>402</b>, the gate of the GaN power transistor drops rapidly from high to low. This can cause ringing of its drain current and cause EMI emission.

As can be seen, the turn-off circuit reduces the ringing in the drain current of the GaN power transistor <b>102</b>. This in turn can reduce EMI emission in frequency ranges which are to be protected (in the electromagnetic spectrum). With the majority of ringing removed, the remaining ringing in the drain current may cause emissions in frequency ranges which are not of concern.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, gate voltage <b>508</b> and drain voltage <b>504</b> as a function of time <b>502</b> for GaN power transistor <b>102</b> are illustrated according to embodiments of the disclosure.
