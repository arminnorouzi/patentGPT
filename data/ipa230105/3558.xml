At least a portion of the surface of the resin cover part is cross-linked. This cross-linked portion is hard. Therefore, the resistance of the sensor device to external damage is improved.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Second Aspect</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a second aspect, as with the above-described first aspect, the at least a portion of the surface of the resin cover part may be electron beam cross-linked. Even if a resin for cross-linking is not added to a resin for forming the resin cover part, the at least a portion of the surface of the resin cover part is electron beam cross-linked.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Third Aspect</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a third aspect, as with the above-described first or second aspect, the at least a portion of the surface of the resin cover part may have the highest crosslink density. Since the surface of the resin cover part has a high crosslink density, the resistance to external damage is improved.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Fourth Aspect</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a fourth aspect, as with any one of the first to third aspects described above, the resin cover part may include a primary molded part that holds the sensor element, and a secondary molded part that covers the primary molded part, and at least a portion of the surface of the secondary molded part may be cross-linked. Since at least a portion of the surface of the secondary molded part is cross-linked, the resistance of the sensor device to external damage is improved.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Fifth Aspect</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a fifth aspect, as with the above-described fourth aspect, the primary molded part may include a rib portion that protrudes toward the secondary molded part, and a portion that extends from the at least a portion of the surface of the secondary molded part to a leading end of the rib portion may be cross-linked.

The hole can be used as a hole for a positioning pin for positioning the primary molded part when molding the secondary molded part using a metal mold. Since the portion that extends from the at least a portion of the surface of the secondary molded part to the leading end of the rib portion is cross-linked, ingress of water via the hole is effectively prevented.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The following will describe specific examples of the sensor device according to the present disclosure with reference to the drawings. Note that the present disclosure is not limited to the examples but is defined by the claims, and all modifications within the meaning and scope equivalent to the claims are intended to be included.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Hereinafter, a sensor device according to Embodiment 1 will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a side view showing a sensor device <b>10</b> according to Embodiment 1.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The sensor device <b>10</b> includes a sensor element <b>20</b> and a resin cover part <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The sensor element <b>20</b> is an element that detects a physical quantity of magnetism, light, temperature, or the like, or an amount of change thereof. Here, the sensor element <b>20</b> includes an element body part <b>22</b> and a lead part <b>24</b>. The element body part <b>22</b> is rectangular, for example. The lead part <b>24</b> is an elongated part made of metal or the like. The lead part <b>24</b> extends outward from the element body part <b>22</b>. An output signal is output from the sensor element <b>20</b> to the outside via the lead part <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A core wire <b>52</b> of a wire <b>50</b> is connected to the lead part <b>24</b>. The connection between the core wire <b>52</b> and the lead part <b>24</b> may be realized by soldering or pressure bonding, for example.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The resin cover part <b>30</b> covers the sensor element <b>20</b>. The resin cover part <b>30</b> may cover the entire periphery of the element body part <b>22</b> of the sensor element <b>20</b>. A portion of the element body part <b>22</b> may be exposed from the resin cover part <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example in which the entirety of the element body part <b>22</b> is covered by the resin cover part <b>30</b>. The portion of the element body part <b>22</b> that is covered by the resin cover part <b>30</b> is protected by the resin cover part <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">At least a portion of a surface <b>32</b> of the resin cover part <b>30</b> is cross-linked. Here, &#x201c;cross-linked&#x201d; refers to a state in which polymers, which are constituent components, are bonded to each other. Here, the entirety of the surface <b>32</b> of the resin cover part <b>30</b> is cross-linked. This resin cover part <b>30</b> may be made of, for example, PE (polyethylene), polyamide, PBT (polybutylene terephthalate), or the like.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The cross-linked portion of the surface <b>32</b> of the resin cover part <b>30</b> is preferably obtained by electron beam cross-linking. Electron beam cross-linking refers to a method of irradiating polymers with an electron beam so that the polymers are bonded to each other, and have a three-dimensional structure. When a resin is electron beam cross-linked, polymers are three-dimensionally bonded to each other, and heat resistance is improved. Specifically, an electron beam cross-linked resin has an advantage that it is unlikely to soften and remains hard even under a high temperature.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Electron beam cross-linking is realized by, for example, irradiating the surface <b>32</b> of the resin cover part <b>30</b> with an electron beam in a state in which the sensor element <b>20</b> is covered by the resin cover part <b>30</b>. At this time, a configuration is possible in which a region of the resin cover part <b>30</b> that does not reach the element body part <b>22</b> of the sensor element <b>20</b> is cross-linked. With this, it is possible to prevent the sensor element <b>20</b> from being damaged by electron beams.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the surface <b>32</b> of the resin cover part <b>30</b> is irradiated with an electron beam, the surface <b>32</b> of the resin cover part <b>30</b> is irradiated with the largest amount of energy. Therefore, at least a portion of the surface <b>32</b> of the resin cover part <b>30</b> has the highest crosslink density. The crosslink density decreases inward from the surface <b>32</b> of the resin cover part <b>30</b>. Note that a crosslink density refers to the proportion of cross-linking points present in cross-linked polymers to the structural unit as a whole. Electron beams may affect the sensor element <b>20</b> provided inside to some extent. Therefore, a portion of the resin cover part <b>30</b> that reaches the sensor element <b>20</b> is preferably not electron beam cross-linked.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is not essential that the resin cover part <b>30</b> is electron beam cross-linked, and a configuration is also possible in which the resin cover part <b>30</b> is chemically cross-linked. Electron beam cross-linking has an advantage that a cross-linking agent or the like does not need to be added to the material for forming the resin cover part <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the present embodiment, at least a portion of the surface <b>32</b> of the resin cover part <b>30</b> is cross-linked. This cross-linked portion is hard. Therefore, the resistance of the sensor device <b>10</b> to external damage is improved.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Also, the cross-linked portion is likely to remain hard even when the temperature increases. Therefore, the resistance to external damage in a high temperature environment can be maintained.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The following will describe a sensor device <b>110</b> according to Embodiment 2. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> are perspective views showing the sensor device <b>110</b> according to Embodiment 2. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are perspective views showing a sensor element <b>120</b> and a primary molded part <b>131</b> of the sensor device <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view showing the sensor element <b>120</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line VII-VII in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a partially enlarged cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The sensor device <b>110</b> includes the sensor element <b>120</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>6</b></figref>, and <b>7</b>) and a resin cover part <b>130</b>.

Hereinafter, a description will be given assuming that the sensor element <b>120</b> is a magnetic sensor. A magnetic field is unlikely to be affected by a resin, which is a nonmagnetic material. Therefore, when the sensor element <b>120</b> is a magnetic sensor, the entire periphery of the sensor element <b>120</b> may also be covered by the resin cover part <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sensor element <b>120</b> includes an element body part <b>122</b> and a lead part <b>124</b>. The element body part <b>122</b> has the shape of a flat rectangular plate, for example. The element body part <b>122</b> outputs a signal that corresponds to the magnitude, direction, or the like of a surrounding environment such as a surrounding magnetic field. The lead part <b>124</b> extends from the element body part <b>122</b>. Here, two lead parts <b>124</b> extend parallel to each other from the element body part <b>122</b>. Here, the lead parts <b>124</b> have the shape of an elongated plate. A detection output is output from the element body part <b>122</b> to the outside via the two lead parts <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The output of the sensor element <b>120</b> is transmitted via a cable <b>150</b>. The cable <b>150</b> includes a plurality of (here, two) wires <b>152</b> and an outer covering <b>151</b>. The wires <b>152</b> are commonly-used covered wires in which a covering <b>154</b> is formed around a core wire <b>153</b>. The outer covering <b>151</b> covers the two wires <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The outer covering <b>151</b> is removed at an end of the cable <b>150</b> and the two wires <b>152</b> are exposed. At an end of each of the two wires <b>152</b>, the covering <b>154</b> is removed and the core wire <b>153</b> is exposed. The ends of the two wires <b>152</b> are arranged along the two lead parts <b>124</b>, and the core wires <b>153</b> of the wires <b>152</b> are electrically and mechanically connected to the lead parts <b>124</b>. Here, the core wires <b>153</b> are soldered to the lead parts <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is not essential that the wires connected to the sensor element <b>120</b> are gathered together by the outer covering or the like. The wires connected to the sensor element may be individually drawn to the outside. The number of wires connected to the sensor element may be increased or decreased depending on the number of lead parts of the sensor element, for example. It is not essential that wires are connected to the sensor element, and a configuration is also possible in which another FPC (flexible printed circuit) or the like is connected to the sensor.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The resin cover part <b>130</b> covers the sensor element <b>120</b>.

When coming into contact with the surface of the primary molded part <b>131</b>, the heated and molten resin is abruptly cooled and solidified. At the leading ends of the annular rib portions <b>133</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>135</b><i>a</i>, and <b>135</b><i>b </i>(hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on&#x201d;), the heated and molten resin is not abruptly cooled compared to the case where it comes into contact with the surface of the primary molded part <b>131</b>. Therefore, the heated and molten resin for forming the secondary molded part <b>140</b> can be fused to the leading ends of the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on. That is to say, when the secondary molded part <b>140</b> is molded using a metal mold with the primary molded part <b>131</b> serving as an insert member, there is a risk that an interface may be formed at a boundary between a wide flat surface of the primary molded part <b>131</b> and the secondary molded part <b>140</b>. However, at the leading ends of the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on, portions are likely to be formed in which a resin forming the primary molded part <b>131</b> and a resin forming the secondary molded part <b>140</b> are fused into one piece. Specifically, if the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on are formed so as to have a smaller width toward the leading end side in the projection direction, the leading ends of the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on are likely to be fused to the resin for forming the secondary molded part <b>140</b>. Accordingly, at the boundary between the primary molded part <b>131</b> and the secondary molded part <b>140</b>, more complete water stopping will be realized along the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on. Such annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on may also be referred to as melt ribs. Preferably, the primary molded part <b>131</b> and the secondary molded part <b>140</b> are made of the same material so that the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on and the secondary molded part <b>140</b> are easily fused together.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Specifically, when the holes <b>141</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>144</b> for use in positioning are formed, the boundary between the primary molded part <b>131</b> and the secondary molded part <b>140</b> is exposed to the outside via the holes <b>141</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>144</b>. Therefore, the rib portions <b>133</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>135</b><i>a</i>, and <b>135</b><i>b </i>are formed so as to surround the holes <b>141</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>144</b>.

Therefore, it is preferable that a portion (portion P extending to a position indicated by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) extending from at least a portion of the surface <b>140</b>F of the secondary molded part <b>140</b> to the leading ends of the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on is cross-linked. With this, the state in which the leading ends of the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on and the resin forming the secondary molded part <b>140</b> are fused together is more reliably maintained. Specifically, even under a high temperature environment, the fused state is more reliably maintained.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the sensor device <b>110</b> having such configurations, at least a portion of the surface <b>140</b>F of the resin cover part <b>130</b> has been hardened by being cross-linked. Therefore, the resistance of the sensor device <b>110</b> to external damage is improved.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Specifically, a case is assumed in which the sensor device <b>110</b> is used as a sensor that is provided around a wheel of an automobile and detects the wheel speed using a magnetic field or the like. In this case, there is a risk that while the automobile is traveling, a flying stone or the like may hit the sensor device <b>110</b>. If at least a portion of the surface <b>140</b>F of the resin cover part <b>130</b> has been hardened by being cross-linked, the sensor device <b>110</b> will be unlikely to be damaged. Also, there is a risk that regions around the wheels of an automobile may be in a high temperature environment during the travel. If at least a portion of the surface <b>140</b>F of the resin cover part <b>130</b> has been hardened by being cross-linked, the hardened state will be maintained even under a high temperature environment, and the resistance to external damage will be maintained.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">To improve the resistance to external damage under a high temperature environment, it is also conceivable to cover the sensor element with, for example, a heat resistant resin. In this case, it is conceivable to use a resin excellent in heat resistance. However, if such a resin is used, the molding temperature of the resin that covers the sensor element will be high, and the sensor element may be affected by heat. In the present embodiment, it is sufficient that a normal resin is used to form the resin cover part <b>130</b> so as to cover the sensor element <b>120</b>, and thus the molding temperature need not be as high as that in the above-described case. Therefore, the sensor element is unlikely to be affected by heat.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Also, in the present embodiment, at least a portion of the surface <b>140</b>F of the resin cover part <b>130</b> is electron beam cross-linked. The purpose of the electron beam cross-linking is to harden the surface <b>140</b>F of the resin cover part <b>130</b>, and thus it is sufficient that a region of the resin cover part <b>130</b> that does not reach the sensor element <b>120</b> provided inside is cross-linked. Therefore, the sensor element <b>120</b> is unlikely to be affected by electron beams. Even if also the portion in which the leading ends of the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on and the resin forming the secondary molded part <b>140</b> are fused together is electron beam cross-linked, it is sufficient that a region of the resin cover part <b>130</b> that does not reach the sensor element <b>120</b> provided inside is cross-linked. Therefore, the sensor element <b>120</b> is unlikely to be affected by electron beams.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Also, such a case where at least a portion of the surface <b>140</b>F of the resin cover part <b>130</b> is electron beam cross-linked has an advantage that a cross-linking agent or the like does not need to be added to the resin for forming the resin cover part <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Also, if the crosslink density of at least a portion of the surface <b>140</b>F of the resin cover part <b>130</b> is higher than the crosslink density of a region behind that portion, this is advantageous for improving the resistance to external damage. Here, since the crosslink density of the at least a portion of the surface <b>140</b>F of the resin cover part <b>140</b> is higher than the crosslink density of a region behind that portion, the resistance to external damage is improved.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Also, since the cross-linking of the resin cover part <b>130</b> is made in the region that extends from the surface <b>140</b>F thereof to the leading ends of the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on, there is an advantage that the water stopping effects using the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on are likely to be maintained.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Also, the annular rib portions <b>133</b> and so on are formed so as to surround the holes <b>141</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, and <b>144</b> in the surface of the primary molded part <b>131</b>.
