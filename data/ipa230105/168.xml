The aerosol provision system <b>100</b> is shown in a transverse cross-sectional view. The aerosol provision system <b>100</b> comprises an aerosol generating component <b>120</b>. The aerosol generating component <b>120</b> is for generating an aerosol from an aerosol generating material. The aerosol provision system <b>100</b> also comprises a consumable <b>130</b> comprising aerosol generating material <b>140</b>. The consumable <b>130</b> comprises a corrugated surface <b>132</b> having troughs <b>134</b> extending along the consumable <b>130</b> in an axial direction. The troughs <b>134</b> are provided with aerosol generating material <b>140</b>. The aerosol generating component <b>120</b> is arranged to supply heat to selected one or more troughs <b>134</b>, such that at a given time, heat is directly applied to the selected one or more troughs <b>134</b> by the aerosol generating component <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The aerosol generating component <b>120</b> may be a heating element. The aerosol generating component <b>120</b> may be a heating mechanism or part of a heating mechanism. In an example, the aerosol generating component <b>120</b> may be a heater for providing heat to the aerosol generating material in the consumable <b>130</b>. The aerosol generating component <b>120</b> may be a resistive heater to provide heat to the consumable <b>130</b> from a current passed through it by an electrically connected power source. The aerosol generating component <b>120</b> may be made of metal or ceramic or the like. Alternatively or additionally, the aerosol generating component <b>120</b> may be an induction heater or a part of an inductive heating system for providing heat to the consumable <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The consumable <b>130</b> may have aerosol generating material such as tobacco or the like arranged in the troughs <b>134</b> of the corrugated surface <b>132</b>. The consumable <b>130</b> may be formed from placing aerosol generating material <b>140</b> onto a surface and subsequently corrugating the surface, by for example deforming the surface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The heating element (otherwise referred to as &#x201c;aerosol generating component&#x201d;) <b>120</b> may be formed to substantially conform to the troughs <b>134</b> of the corrugated surface <b>132</b> of the consumable <b>130</b>. This enables the heating element <b>120</b> to project into the gaps in the corrugations in the surface <b>132</b>. This in turn allows for more efficient heat transfer to the surface <b>132</b> and therefore to the aerosol generating material <b>140</b> arranged on the surface <b>132</b>. Accordingly, this allows for less power to be used during any one smoking session than for a less correspondingly-shaped heating element and therefore leads to a longer charge life of the aerosol provision system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The aerosol provision system <b>100</b> may have a housing <b>110</b> or the like within which the heating element <b>120</b> and the consumable <b>130</b> are arranged or inserted prior to use. The heating element <b>120</b> may be arranged within the consumable <b>130</b>. The heating element <b>120</b> may be arranged external to or outside the consumable <b>130</b>, but within the housing <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The surface <b>132</b> may be formed of a material which is thermally conductive to more easily allow heat to pass from the heating element <b>120</b> to the aerosol generating material <b>140</b> on the surface <b>132</b>. In an example, the surface <b>132</b> may be formed of an inductive material, such as aluminum. This may allow for heating of the aerosol generating material <b>140</b> to occur via induction.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The heating element <b>120</b> may be a work coil which may work with an aluminum surface (or aluminum susceptor as part of the surface) to provide thermal energy to the aerosol generating material <b>140</b> in the consumable <b>130</b>. Heating element <b>120</b> may be a collar which is moved to heat portions of the aerosol generating material <b>140</b> of the consumable <b>130</b>. The collar may be made of any suitable material, such as ceramic or metal.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, an aerosol provision system <b>200</b> is shown.

The heating element <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is shown projecting between two troughs T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>. The heat from the heating element <b>220</b> will provide thermal energy to the aerosol generating material <b>240</b> within those troughs and cause aerosolization of said aerosol generating material <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The movement of the heating element <b>220</b> between specific troughs allows the heating element <b>220</b> to selectively heat portions of the aerosol generating material <b>240</b> on the surface <b>232</b>. The aerosol generating material <b>240</b> may vary on the surface <b>232</b> (and therefore troughs <b>234</b>), for example different formulations may be provided in different troughs. For example, one trough may contain nicotine-containing aerosol generating material. In an example, another trough may contain a glycerol-containing aerosol generating material. In an example, a further trough may contain an acid-containing aerosol generating material.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The heating element <b>220</b> can be controlled to heat specific troughs thereby producing a specific aerosol. In this way, a personalized aerosol may be produced for inhalation by a user. The user experience of the system <b>200</b> is thereby improved.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a specific example, the movement mechanism is arranged to provide relative movement between the heating element <b>220</b> and the consumable <b>230</b> along a line between heating element <b>220</b> and the consumable <b>230</b> to provide contact between the heating element <b>220</b> and the consumable <b>230</b>.
