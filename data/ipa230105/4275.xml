To help the clinician or doctor (i.e., orthodontist) design and plan the subject's treatment plan, a three-dimensional (3D) digital model of the subject's teeth, dentition, and gingiva can be constructed from a 3D scan of the subject's mouth, teeth, dentition, and gingiva. The 3D model of the subject's teeth and dentition can be displayed graphically to the doctor on a display using a computing system with memory and software.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would be desirable to provide the doctor with the ability to easily visualize and compare various 3D models of the subject's teeth at different stages of the treatment along with the effect of various features that can be used during the treatment.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The methods and apparatuses (e.g., systems, devices, etc.) described herein may relate to orthodontic treatment planning, including the visualization of teeth for modifying, enhancing and improving treatment plans. In particular, described herein are methods and apparatuses for reviewing, analyzing and/or modifying orthodontic treatment plans. These methods may include one or more user interfaces that are configured to improve review and modification of orthodontic treatment planning.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example a method may include: displaying a staging toolbar on a first portion of a display, wherein the staging toolbar comprises a plurality of digital buttons that correspond to a plurality of three dimensional (3D) digital models of a subject's dentition, wherein the plurality of 3D models includes a first model that shows an arrangement of a subject's teeth before receiving a treatment, one or more intermediate models that show an arrangement of the subject's teeth during a stage of the treatment, and a final model that shows an arrangement of the subject's teeth after receiving the treatment; displaying a displayed 3D model corresponding to one of the plurality of 3D models; changing the displayed 3D model to correspond to whichever digital button is selected by a user; adjusting a view of the displayed 3D model shown on the display based on a user input, wherein the view of the displayed 3D model is applied to the changed displayed 3D model as the user selects the digital buttons.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The staging toolbar may be a virtual toolbar including the plurality of digital buttons, which may be arranged within the display (screen, touchscreen, virtual display, augmented reality display, etc.). For example, the staging toolbar may be an arrangement of virtual buttons on the top, side(s) and/or bottom of the display that may be selected by a user, e.g., by clicking on them or otherwise selecting them.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The digital model of the subject's dentition may include a 3D surface (or in some variations surface and volumetric) model of the subject's upper and/or lower arch, including teeth and in some variations gingiva (e.g., particularly the portion of gingiva around the teeth). The 3D model may be segmented into individual teeth that may be separately selected and/or moved by the user or system. The system or method may store user inputs and/or generate user output, e.g., modifications to the display, based on user selections from the controls and the processing by the system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">At least some of the digital buttons may correspond to overcorrection stages. The digital buttons that correspond to the overcorrection stages may be hidden or revealed by user-controlled switch (e.g., a virtual button on the display that allows the user to toggle between showing and hiding the overcorrection stages), and/or selecting the overcorrecting stages as part of an actual treatment plan.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The user input may include adjustments to the display of the 3D model, including one or more of: a rotation, a zoom, or a pan of the displayed 3D model. Additional tools may include showing the surface of the 3D model, showing a wireframe of the 3D model, changing the color of the 3D model, etc.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The user input may include selecting from a set of preset views, such as showing the 3D model of the upper and/or lower jaw in a frontal view, a left side view, a right side view, a back view, etc.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The user input may include selecting to display or hide on the view of the teeth of the 3D model one or more of: tooth numbering, attachments, interproximal reduction spacing, and pontics. These display options may be separately controlled, e.g., by including one or more virtual controls (e.g., buttons, switches, etc.) that allows the selection of each of these features individually or collectively. The system may include processing to determine or suggest one or more of these features (e.g., determining automatically or semi-automatically tooth numbering, position, number and/or orientation of attachments, hooks, ramps, etc.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Changing the displayed 3D model to correspond to whichever digital button is selected by a user may include calculating the viewing angle and magnification from a current displayed 3D model and applying the calculated viewing angle and magnification to a new 3D model from the plurality of 3D models corresponding to the digital button selected by the user.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Also described herein are systems configured to perform any of the methods described herein. These systems may include one or more processors and may include a memory coupled to the one or more processors configured to store computer-program instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, perform the methods.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, A system (e.g., for assisting in treatment planning, for visualizing a subject's teeth, for reviewing and/or modifying a treatment plan) may include: one or more processors; a memory coupled to the one or more processors, the memory configured to store computer-program instructions, that, when executed by the one or more processors, perform a computer-implemented method comprising: displaying a staging toolbar on a first portion of a display, wherein the staging toolbar comprises a plurality of digital buttons that correspond to a plurality of three dimensional (3D) digital models of a subject's dentition, wherein the plurality of 3D models includes a first model that shows an arrangement of a subject's teeth before receiving a treatment, one or more intermediate models that show an arrangement of the subject's teeth during a stage of the treatment, and a final model that shows an arrangement of the subject's teeth after receiving the treatment; displaying a displayed 3D model corresponding to one of the plurality of 3D models; changing the displayed 3D model to correspond to whichever digital button is selected by a user; and adjusting a view of the displayed 3D model shown on the display based on a user input, wherein the view of the displayed 3D model is applied to the changed displayed 3D model as the user selects the digital buttons.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Any of the methods and apparatuses described herein may be configured to also or alternatively display multiple 3D models, including multiple treatment plans (each having the same or a different number of treatment stages), and/or display a 3D model (e.g., surface model) of an initial (unmodified) arrangement of the subject's teeth with one or more treatment plans (each having multiple treatment stages). The system and method may enhance review of the treatment plan(s) by allowing the user to make changes in the appearance (angle, zoom, pan, etc.), and/or selection of a displayed treatment stage when displaying multiple treatment plans, of one of the displayed 3D models and concurrently making the same (or similar) changes in the other treatment plans.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Any of these systems and methods may also address the problem of complexity associated with the display of one or more treatment plans, in which each treatment plan includes a large number of stages, and multiple potential &#x2018;treatments&#x2019; at each stage, such as changes in the tooth position, angle, etc., as well as the components of the treatment applied or to be applied, such as interproximal reduction, extraction, ramps, attachments, hooks, etc. These components may be different at different stages of each treatment plan and may be widely different or similar between different treatment plans. The methods an apparatuses may provide simplified techniques for controlling the otherwise complicated and information-dense displays. For example, in some variations the methods and apparatuses may include informative controls that allow toggling of display options on or off, but may also include information about these features being displayed or features related to those being displayed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, described herein are methods comprising: displaying, side-by-side on a display, a first three dimensional (3D) model of a subject's dentition that shows an arrangement of the subject's teeth before receiving a treatment, and a second 3D model that shows an arrangement of the subject's teeth subject to a first orthodontic treatment; wherein the second 3D model is displayed at either a final stage or an intermediate treatment stage of the first orthodontic treatment; adjusting a view of both of the first 3D model and the second 3D model based on a user input modifying a view of one of the first 3D model or the second 3D model; displaying a staging toolbar on a portion of a display, wherein the staging toolbar comprises a plurality of digital buttons that correspond to a plurality of treatment stages of the first orthodontic treatment; and changing the displayed stage of the second 3D model to correspond to a stage selected by the user from the staging toolbar.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Any of these methods may also include displaying a plurality of buttons corresponding to treatment features, wherein the buttons visually indicate the presence of the treatment feature in the first orthodontic treatment and further wherein the buttons visually indicate that that treatment feature is actively being displayed on either or both the first 3D model and the second 3D model.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The plurality of treatment features may include: tooth numbering, attachments, interproximal reduction spacing, and pontics. The user input may include one or more of: a rotation, a zoom, or a pan of the displayed 3D models.

To help the clinician or doctor (i.e., orthodontist) design and plan the subject's treatment plan, a 3D digital model of the subject's teeth, dentition, and gingiva can be constructed from a 3D scan of the subject's mouth, teeth, dentition, and gingiva. The 3D model of the subject's teeth and dentition can be displayed graphically to the doctor on a display using a computing system with memory and software. Input devices such as a mouse and/or keyboard allows the doctor to manipulate the 3D model. The systems and methods described herein are particularly well suited to be used in procedures involving aligners, but the systems and methods are also suitable for use with staging other types of orthodontic devices.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, the 3D model of the can be rotated in any axis and can be zoomed into and out as desired. Each individual tooth can be a separate object in the 3D model that can be manipulated by the doctor. From the initial teeth position, the doctor can manipulate the teeth using the input devices into a desired final teeth position. The computer system can then determine the appropriate intermediate stages that can be used to move the teeth from the initial teeth position to the final teeth position. The initial, final, and intermediate teeth position stages can be displayed to the doctor.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">One or more graphical toolbars can be displayed to the doctor to facilitate making adjustments to the teeth and arch. The toolbars can have buttons to perform various actions to the 3D model. For example, one toolbar can have buttons that allow the doctor to manipulate the viewing angle and perspective of the 3D model.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Another toolbar can have buttons for making various tooth adjustments, such as extrusion/intrusion, bucco-lingual translation, mesio-distal translation, rotation, crown angulation, bucco-lingual root torque, bucco-lingual crown tip, and mesio-distal crown tip. In some embodiments, when one tooth is adjusted, some or all the other teeth in the same arch will automatically adjust in response. In some embodiments, the doctor can lock and keep a particular tooth at a desired position, and designate a tooth as unmovable for the duration of a treatment (e.g. crowns, implants).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Another toolbar can have buttons for making attachments and precision cuts. These buttons allow the doctor to add conventional attachments and precision cuts by simply dragging and dropping the attachment or cut to the tooth of choice, and the doctor can easily remove attachments and precision cuts by dragging them to the trash can. The buttons also allow the doctor to adjust the placement and rotate conventional attachments, and change the size, prominence and degree of beveling of rectangular attachments. In addition, the button allow the doctor to fine-tune the mesiodistal position of button cutouts.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Another toolbar can have buttons for posterior arch expansion and contraction. This toolbar allows the doctor to expand or contract posterior arches by expanding or contracting the upper arch only, the lower arch only, or both arches. As above, when an arch modification is made on the 3D model, some or all other teeth in the adjusted arch will automatically adjust in response.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Another toolbar can have buttons for interproximal reduction (IPR) and space management. With the IPR and spacing toolbar, the doctor can choose to (1) select the auto adjust option: IPR and space automatically adjusts as you make adjustments on the 3D model; (2) select the keep current option: to preserve the current IPR configuration; (3) select the no IPR option: all existing IPR will be removed, and no IPR will be added; and (4) manually adjust IPR and space on the 3D model (add, remove or lock for specific teeth).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Additional features that can be include in a toolbar include occlusal contacts, which identifies and displays to the doctor all or a subset of inter-arch occlusal contacts, and resolves heavy occlusal contacts directly on the 3D model. Another feature can be dual view, where modifications made using 3D Controls may be compared side-by-side with the original set up. Another feature is a Bolton analysis tool that provides reference information pertaining to tooth size discrepancy that is useful for planning how to address tooth interdigitation and arch coordination. Another tool positions the 3D model on a grid that allows linear tooth movements to be measured and provides more precise control to the doctor to make measurements on the 3D model. Another feature is a superimposition toolbar that superimposes tooth position at any stage in relation to tooth position at any other stage, and control which stage is blue (or another color) and which stage is white (or another different color) for a better visualization between stages.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Dual View</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the display can provide the doctor a dual view that shows and compares in one screen or display a first 3D model of the teeth position before the treatment (initial malocclusion) with a second 3D model of the teeth position at any stage of the treatment, such as an intermediate stage or the final stage. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates in the first 3D model <b>200</b> on the left side of the display the initial malocclusion, while the right side of the display shows a 3D model <b>202</b> of the dentition at the 10<sup>th </sup>stage of treatment. A toolbar <b>204</b> at the bottom of the screen allows the doctor to select the stages to be displayed in dual view. The stages to be viewed can be selected by simply clicking the corresponding button on the toolbar <b>204</b>. In some embodiments, a default stage that is typically shown is the initial stage that shows the initial malocclusion. In some embodiments, the default stage can be changed to an intermediate stage. For example, the doctor can drag and drop a button representing one of the intermediate stages over the default 3D model shown on the left side of the screen in order to replace the initial stage with an intermediate stage. Using dual view the doctor can understand how the treatment goes from stage to stage in comparison to the initial malocclusion. In some embodiments, the first 3D model can be an intermediate stage and the second 3D model can be a subsequent intermediate stage or the final stage.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Using additional tools in the dual view gives the doctor additional details for the treatment in comparison to the initial malocclusion and teeth position and allows the doctor to view the effect of a particular action on teeth movement on any particular stage and allows the comparison between the initial malocclusion with any stage of the treatment. Any of the tools described herein can be used in dual view to manipulate either of the 3D models shown in dual view. For example, using the occlusal view tool when in dual view gives the doctor the ability to view and compare maxillary and mandibular occlusal view for the initial malocclusion with the maxillary and mandibular occlusal view at any stage of the treatment.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Using other tools (e.g., Attachments, IPR, Pontic) in dual view gives the doctor additional information about the used features for the treatment and in comparison to the initial malocclusion, and the doctor can more easily and quickly analyze how these features work and whether there is a clinical reason to use them for this particular treatment.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a diagram showing an example of a treatment plan review and/or modification system <b>100</b>A. The modules of the system <b>100</b>A may include one or more engines and datastores. A computer system can be implemented as an engine, as part of an engine or through multiple engines. As used herein, an engine includes one or more processors or a portion thereof. A portion of one or more processors can include some portion of hardware less than all of the hardware comprising any given one or more processors, such as a subset of registers, the portion of the processor dedicated to one or more threads of a multi-threaded processor, a time slice during which the processor is wholly or partially dedicated to carrying out part of the engine's functionality, or the like. As such, a first engine and a second engine can have one or more dedicated processors or a first engine and a second engine can share one or more processors with one another or other engines. Depending upon implementation-specific or other considerations, an engine can be centralized or its functionality distributed. An engine can include hardware, firmware, or software embodied in a computer-readable medium for execution by the processor. The processor transforms data into new data using implemented data structures and methods, such as is described with reference to the figures herein.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The engines described herein, or the engines through which the systems and devices described herein can be implemented, can be cloud-based engines. As used herein, a cloud-based engine is an engine that can run applications and/or functionalities using a cloud-based computing system. All or portions of the applications and/or functionalities can be distributed across multiple computing devices, and need not be restricted to only one computing device. In some embodiments, the cloud-based engines can execute functionalities and/or modules that end users access through a web browser or container application without having the functionalities and/or modules installed locally on the end-users' computing devices.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As used herein, datastores are intended to include repositories having any applicable organization of data, including tables, comma-separated values (CSV) files, traditional databases (e.g., SQL), or other applicable known or convenient organizational formats. Datastores can be implemented, for example, as software embodied in a physical computer-readable medium on a specific-purpose machine, in firmware, in hardware, in a combination thereof, or in an applicable known or convenient device or system. Datastore-associated components, such as database interfaces, can be considered &#x201c;part of&#x201d; a datastore, part of some other system component, or a combination thereof, though the physical location and other characteristics of datastore-associated components is not critical for an understanding of the techniques described herein.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Datastores can include data structures. As used herein, a data structure is associated with a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently within a given context. Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by an address, a bit string that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, some data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations; while other data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself. Many data structures use both principles, sometimes combined in non-trivial ways. The implementation of a data structure usually entails writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The datastores, described herein, can be cloud-based datastores. A cloud-based datastore is a datastore that is compatible with cloud-based computing systems and engines.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">An example of a treatment plan review and/or modification system <b>100</b>A such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> may include a computer-readable medium <b>102</b>, view modification user input engine(s) <b>104</b>, staging toolbar engine(s) <b>106</b>, display output engine(s) <b>108</b>, an untreated 3D model datastore <b>110</b>, one or more treated 3D model datastore(s) <b>112</b>, an overcorrection stage engine <b>114</b>, an informative button engine <b>116</b>, and an occlusal contact engine <b>118</b>. One or more of the modules of the system <b>100</b>A may be coupled to one another (e.g., through the example couplings shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) or to modules not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.

The system may coordinate (e.g., as part of a view coordination engine, not shown) the display of each of the 3D models concurrently being displayed so that changes in one model by the user are reflected in all or some of the other models, including changes in the position, etc. In various implementations, the view modification engine(s) <b>104</b> may implement one or more automated agents configured to coordinate (in conjunction with the display output engine(s) <b>108</b>) the 3D virtual representations of the patient's dental arches.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some variations, the view modification user input engine includes digital controls (e.g., digital buttons), such as the informative buttons (and may therefore interact with the informative button engine <b>116</b>). In some variations one or more buttons may include, for example, tooth numbering. Tooth numbering may be determined by the system or may be read as information about the tooth numbering in each 3D model (e.g., stored as part of the 3D model datastores). For example, a 3D model datastore (e.g., untreated 3D model or treated 3D model datastore) may be configured to store one or more tooth type identifiers of different tooth types. In some implementations, the tooth type identifiers correspond to numbers of a Universal Tooth Numbering System, character strings to identify tooth types by anatomy, images or portions thereof to identify tooth types by geometry and/or other characteristics, etc.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The staging toolbar engine <b>106</b> coordinates the user selection of one or more stages of the treatment plan represented by one or more of the 3D digital models of the subject's teeth. The stating toolbar engine may map selected staging buttons (e.g., buttons labeled numerically and/or alphanumerically with one or more treatment stage indicators) to the display of a corresponding stage in each of the 3D models (or in comparison to the untreated 3D model).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In general, the display output engine <b>108</b> is configured to coordinate the display of 3D model(s) of the subject's teeth with each other and with changes made by the user (e.g., physician, doctor, dentist, dental technician, etc.).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The overcorrection stage engine <b>114</b> may determine and/or coordinate display of one or mover overcorrection stages, as will be described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">An informative button engine <b>116</b> may coordinate the use of one or more informative buttons that may be modify the information specific to each (or all) of the treatment plan 3D digital models and may process this information into a user-selectable button that both shows the status of the button (e.g., on/off) as well as information that is based on all or a subset of the treatment plans, including that all or some of the treatment plan includes one or more features (e.g., treatment features, such as interproximal reduction (IPR), attachments, hooks, tooth ramps, etc.).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The system may include one or more datastores, including an untreated 3D (digital) model datastore <b>110</b> that may store the 3D model of the patient's untreated teeth, e.g., upper and/or lower arch. The 3D model of the patient's untreated teeth may be imported (e.g., from an external file, remote server, etc.), scanned, e.g., using an intraoral scanner from a patient or a model of a patient's teeth and stored, or otherwise acquired by the system. Similarly, the system may include a treated 3D (digital) model datastore <b>112</b> for storing one or more 3D models of the patient's teeth during each stage of a treatment plan, including the final stage. The datastore may also store information specific to the treatment plan, including features used to achieve tooth movement (including location on the teeth, etc.), number of stages, etc., or any other meta-information related to the referenced treatment plan. The treated 3D (digital) models may be generated by the system or a separate system and imported/entered into the datastore. Any number of treatment 3D models (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.) may be stored and used, including selection by a user of which ones to show or display.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Any of these systems may also include an occlusal contact engine <b>118</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a schematic example of another type of occlusal contact engine <b>118</b>. In this example the occlusal contact engine may be invoked by a user command (e.g., selection of a user input such as a digital button, switch, etc.). The occlusal contact engine may include an occlusal view display engine <b>120</b> that may receive an instruction to switch between a current view of one or more digital model(s) (e.g., a plurality of concurrently displayed digital models) into a view showing occlusal surfaces of one or both upper and/or lower arch surfaces. The system may translate the current 3D model display(s) into occlusal views, with the upper and lower arch, when both are shown concurrently, arranged with the upper arch above the lower arch, and both spread essentially flat. The occlusal contact engine may also include a collision contact engine <b>122</b> for calculating (or receiving from an outside source that has already pre-calculated) the occlusal contact between the teeth of the upper and lower jaws. The collision contact engine may estimate, from the 3D models, the normal intercuspation for each of the upper and lower jaws, and may determine where the intercuspation results in collision or contact between the teeth of the upper jaw and the teeth of the lower jaw. Both location and severity of collision may be estimated by the collision contact engine. If the collisions are predetermined and passed to the occlusal contact engine, they may be stored in an equivalent datastore (e.g., a collation contact datastore, not shown); alternatively the collision contact information calculated by the collision contact engine may be stored in a collision contact datastore. A collision scoring engine <b>124</b> may score the extent of the collision between the teeth of the upper and lower arch during intercuspation. The score may be qualitative and/or quantitative. The scoring engine may apply a threshold (e.g., from the collision threshold engine <b>128</b>) to determine if a collision is mild, extreme, etc. The scoring engine may apply a threshold based on, e.g., a patient set threshold. For example, the collision threshold engine <b>128</b> may present a control on the display that the user may adjust to set or change the threshold (this may be reflected dynamically in real time in the display of the occlusal collisions). The occlusal contact engine may also include a collision display engine <b>126</b> that coordinates the display of the determined collisions onto the 3D model(s) of the patient's teeth. For the treatment plan 3D models the occlusion(s) may be graphically illustrated on all of the treatment stages or in just the last (e.g., final) treatment stage(s).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Any of these systems may also include a modification engine (not shown) configured to receive user modification of one or more treatment plans, which may be used to submit for the generation of new treatment plan(s). Any of these systems may also include a final approval and fabrication engine(s), not shown. An aligner fabrication engine(s) may implement one or more automated agents configured to fabricate an aligner. Examples of an aligner are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,975,893, and in published PCT application WO 98/58596, which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes. Systems of dental appliances employing technology described in U.S. Pat.

Dual view in this case helps the doctor visualize and analyze this information in comparison to the initial malocclusion view:</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the dual view mode, the doctor is able to switch the right 3D model to any stage of the treatment using staging toolbar <b>204</b> at the bottom of the window in order to visualize and compare treatment details of the desired stage to the initial malocclusion (i.e., initial teeth position). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, stage <b>10</b> is selected by selecting the #10 button on the staging toolbar <b>204</b>.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Tools With Additional Indicators</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, when the doctor reviews a case with multiple treatment plans available, multiple treatment plans (MTP) can be shown in one screen. The doctor can also select one of the plans to obtain further details of the plan and switch to a single plan view. The various features used or not used in the various treatment plans, such as attachments, IPR/spaces, pontics and/or information about occlusal contacts, can be shown simultaneously in the multiple view mode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>H</figref>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Tools, such as toolbars with icons and button with special indicators, can indicate to the doctor whether a particular feature is present or absent in the plan/plans shown in the screen. Even if the doctor switches some features visualization OFF, he/she will clearly understand by indicator's color whether this feature is used in the treatment or absent. For example, if a feature is used in the treatment, the indicator for that feature (e.g., a circle, square, triangle, or other shaped object on the button) can be colored and filled in, and when the feature is not used, the indicator can be empty and uncolored.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">This information is especially useful in the MTP view when the doctor is switching between alternative treatment plans using filters with clinical parameters and features. The state of the tool buttons for the various features allows the doctor to quickly determine whether that feature is present or absent in a particular treatment plan. For example, if in the previous search some features were absent (indicator is empty or uncolored and for example tool is switched OFF), but in the new search this feature is present (the tool button still is switched OFF but the indicator shows that the feature is present now because the indicator becomes colored), the doctor will see a changed indicator and will understand if he needs to review details regarding the changed feature, and the related feature tool may be switched ON to visualize this information on the 3D model.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the attachment filter <b>508</b> is set to &#x201c;yes&#x201d; which means that attachments are used in the treatment plans, and the attach tool/button <b>500</b> and the IPR tool/button <b>502</b> is switched ON, which means that information for those features (i.e., attachments <b>501</b> and values for interproximal reductions <b>503</b>) are shown on the 3D models for the treatment plans. In addition, the occlus tool/button <b>504</b> and pontic tool/button <b>506</b> are switched OFF, meaning that information for those features are hidden and not displayed on the 3D models. Furthermore, the attach tool/button <b>500</b> and the IPR tool/button <b>502</b> have filled/colored indicators (shown on the button as a filled circle) which means that the treatment plans shown in these views have these features used in the treatment. In contrast, the occlus tool/button <b>504</b> and the pontic tool/button <b>506</b> have an empty indicator (shown on the button as an empty circle) which means that these features are absent in the shown treatment plans.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the attachment filter <b>508</b> has been set to &#x201c;no&#x201d; in both treatment plans, which means that attachments aren't used in the treatment plans. Consequently, although the attach tool/button <b>500</b> is still switched ON, the attach tool/button <b>500</b> indicator is empty, which means that attachments are not used in either plan, which is confirmed by visualization of the 3D models which do not show attachment object anymore.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">When the MTP case is opened, in some embodiments by default all features present in any treatment plan selected for the MTP view will be visualized on the 3D models and related tools will be switched ON by default. These tools also have a colored indicator, meaning that these features are used in one of the treatment plans shown or in all plans shown in the MTP view.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C and <b>5</b>D</figref> illustrate how a particular feature can be hidden or removed from the 3D model even though the feature is present in the treatment plan. This can be useful for simplifying the view of the 3D model when focusing on another feature. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, the attach button <b>500</b> is selected &#x201c;ON&#x201d; (indicated by the colored icon on the button) and the attach button indicator is filled which means that attachments <b>501</b> are present in the treatment plan and viewable on the 3D model since the attach button <b>500</b> is &#x201c;ON&#x201d;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>, to hide the attachments <b>501</b> from 3D models, the attach button <b>500</b> can be switched &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; by clicking the button to toggle the button from one state to another. Note that the attach button indicator is still filled and colored, which means that the attachment features are present in the treatment plans even if their visualization in the 3D models is switched OFF. Similarly, other features can be hidden as well by toggling the feature button to an OFF state.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>E-<b>5</b>G</figref> illustrate how filters can be used to select treatment plans using or not using various features, such as attachments and IPR. The use of a feature in a treatment plan can be quickly determined by looking at the feature indicators (filled indicator means feature used and empty indicator means feature not used). For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, the attachment filter <b>508</b> is be set to &#x201c;No&#x201d;, which causes the attach button <b>500</b> indicator to be empty, which means attachments are not being used in the treatment plans. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>, the attachment filter <b>508</b> is changed to &#x201c;Yes&#x201d;, which causes the attach button <b>500</b> indicator to be filled, meaning attachments are used in the treatment plan but are not shown in the model because the attach button <b>500</b> is deselected. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref>, the attachment filter <b>508</b> is changed back to &#x201c;No&#x201d;, which causes the attach button <b>500</b> indicator to revert back to being empty as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, meaning attachments are not used in the treatment plans.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some embodiments, tool button states are not changed when searching/filtering for specific treatment plans. Therefore, if a tool button is in an &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; state, it will keep that &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; state for the new searched/filtered plans. Similarly, if the tool button is in an &#x201c;ON&#x201d; state, it will keep the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; state for the new searched/filter plans. However, the indicators for those buttons will change between filled and empty to indicate whether the feature is present or absent from the new searched/filtered treatment plans.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some embodiments, one or more feature button can have an indicator with more than 2 states, such as 3 states. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> illustrate the 3 states of the occlus button <b>600</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the occlus button <b>600</b> has an empty indicator which means that there are not any normal occlusal contacts or heavy interarch collisions. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the occlus button <b>600</b> has a green indicator which means that the treatment plans shown in the screen have only normal occlusal contacts. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, the occlus button <b>600</b> has a red indicator which means that the treatment plans have heavy inter-arch collisions.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, when the doctor wants to review details for one of the treatment plans shown in the MTP view and clicks on the view button <b>700</b>, the selected treatment plan will be opened in the single treatment plan (STP) view. Toolbar buttons state (switched ON or switched OFF) will not be changed but indicators can be changed to show actual information about features availability for this particular plan. For example, in the MTP view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, only one of the treatment plans had attachments <b>703</b> used in the treatment. In the MTP view, the toolbar showed a green indicator for attach button <b>702</b> because one of the plans has attachments <b>703</b>. Switching to the STP view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> for the plan which doesn't have attachments used in the treatment, the attach button <b>702</b> won't change its state, but its indicator shall become empty because the selected plan does not have this feature used in the treatment.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Visualization of Overcorrection Stages</heading><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>, the doctor can visualize or hide overcorrection stages in the treatment using a tool/button placed next to or integrated into the end of the staging toolbar <b>800</b> that represents the treatment stages.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, the overcorrection stages <b>804</b> are visible in the staging toolbar <b>800</b> as blue lines (although other colors or patterns can be used to distinguish the overcorrection stages from the other stages). The doctor can review the details of the overcorrection stages <b>804</b> or the normal stages by selecting the stage using the staging toolbar <b>800</b>. An &#x201c;X&#x201d; button <b>806</b> can be clicked or selected to hide the overcorrection stages.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some embodiments, an overcorrection technique is used for example for virtual c-chain with aligners which simulates the effect of using elastic c-chains in bracket and wire treatments. In some embodiments, a treatment form can be displayed on the screen as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> to the doctor as a prompt or reminder for asking about and/or using overcorrection stages. In some embodiments, overcorrection stages are used to provide additional (extra) forces for specific tooth movements. In some embodiments, in the overcorrection stages teeth continue moving in the same direction as originally planned. They are requested for some particular teeth movements in order to achieve ideal treatment results.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Occlusal View and Occlusal Contacts Visualization</heading><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the system can display on a screen an occlusal view of the subject's dentition in an open mouth configuration where the upper arch <b>1000</b> is shown on the top of the screen and the lower arch <b>1002</b> is shown at the bottom of the screen, and this view can be combined and overlaid with the inter-arch contacts <b>1004</b> visualization which are shown in the figure as colored (e.g., green for normal occlusal contacts and red for heavy inter-arch collisions) areas on the teeth. Using this view the doctor can clearly see teeth alignment for both arches in the initial teeth position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> on the left, in final teeth position and in any stage of the treatment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> in the middle and on the right. In addition to this information the doctor also can visualize and investigate inter-arch contacts on both arches simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Occlusal contacts <b>1004</b> visualization on the initial teeth position are very important and may be critical for doctors to verify that the bite has been set correctly. After this feature implementation the doctors have a special tool to check that the initial bite setup is correct based on the pattern of occlusal contacts.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Occlusal contacts visualization on the final teeth position gives the doctor an understanding of whether the treatment will be efficacious and whether the subject will have or not have heavy inter-arch contact collisions after the treatment.

With the occlusal view, the doctor is able to compare teeth alignment for both arches for different treatment plans selected in MTP view and compare it with the initial teeth position shown on the initial malocclusion 3D model.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the 3D models can be simultaneously rotated by selecting the rotate button <b>1200</b>. Rotating the 3D models allows the doctor to view and analyze any side of the 3D model and check inter-arch contacts in detail if needed. Rotating one 3D model will rotate the others in the MTP view simultaneously, with all 3D models presented at the same angle and perspective.
