As the electronic devices become more and more complex, the power requirements thereof increases and heat generated is increased. Thus, cooling requirements increase.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several techniques have been developed for dissipating heat from electronic devices. One such technique is an air-cooling system, wherein a heat exchanger is in thermal contact with the heat generating devices for transporting heat away from the devices, and air flowing over the heat exchanger cools the heat exchanger and thereby removes heat from the heat exchanger. One type of heat exchanger includes a plurality of fins extending from a base plate. The plurality of fins increases the rate of heat transfer via convection to the environment of the heat exchanger by increasing the surface area of a heat source in thermal contact with the heat exchanger. Heat is transferred from the heat source to the base plate, the base plate to the plurality of fins and the environment, and the plurality of fins to the environment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The heat transfer may be aided by a fan, blower, or any other device that increases air flow over the fins, or heat can be transferred by natural heat loss due to convection. In natural convection, the heated temperature air is less dense than the surrounding air (environment) and rises from the heat exchanger and plurality of fins. For natural convection to be effective, the heat exchanger and orientation of the plurality of fins during operation are positioned in a direction that will not impede air movement. When positioned horizontally, the plurality of fins face upward, and when positioned vertically, the plurality of fins are oriented to allow higher temperature air to rise.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The thermal performance of the plurality of fins of the heat exchangers is dependent on heat transfer effectiveness. Thus, shape, thickness, material, and other structural enhancements contribute to the thermal performance of the plurality of fins. One type of enhancement is a closed-looped system, wherein a vacuum area carries heat from the heat source by evaporation of a working fluid which is spread by a vapor flow filling the vacuum. The vapor flow condenses over cooler surfaces, and, as a result, the heat is distributed from a heat source evaporation interface surface to a larger condensation cooling surface area. Flow instabilities occur inside the enhanced heat exchangers due to the heat input at the heat source end and heat output at the cooling surface end. Thereafter, condensed fluid flows back to the evaporation surface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When a closed-looped heat exchanger is positioned vertically, the plurality of fins are aligned such that higher temperature air can rise. However, the added weight of the closed-looped enhancement requires costly attachments to couple the fins to the heat source and/or non-standard attachment mechanisms. Also, due to the vertical alignment, heat transfer efficiency of the closed-looped enhancement decreases along the mounted surface of the heat exchanger the further the mounted surface is away from ground due to the inefficiency of the working fluid to rise against gravity. Thus, the occurrence of dry-out is increased, causing the electronic devices to overheat, fail or be damaged. In some electronic device that operate vertically (e.g., longitudinal dimension is oriented vertical to the ground or base), there are more than one source of heat and thus more than one heat source areas (on the heat exchanger) which will need cooling by the heat exchanger. Operating temperature allowance for relatively lower-powered electronic devices is less than that of relatively higher-powered electronic devices. The lower-powered electronic devices may be positioned closer to ground (e.g. at a lower position) compared to the higher-powered electronic devices due to rising of higher temperature air. For certain heat exchangers, improved heat dissipation efficiency is often observed in portions of the heat exchanger that are closer to ground, since the working fluid accumulates there due to gravity.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying figures.

In an embodiment, a heat exchanger includes a plurality of heat exchanger fins and a base plate. Each heat exchanger fin comprises an exchanger enhancement having channels therein. The channels are formed by first and second metal sheets. The channels are under vacuum and have a working fluid therein. The channels decrease the volume of working fluid and facilitates the creation of non-equilibrium pressure conditions, strengthening self-sustaining turbulent driving forces within each heat exchanger fin for heat dissipation. The channels (or a portion thereof) of the heat exchangers, according to embodiment of the disclosure, provide improved efficiency in dissipating heat from both low-power, low operating temperature heat sources and from high-power, high operating temperature heat sources. The low-power, low operating temperature heat sources and the high-power, high operating temperature heat sources are positioned vertically separated from each other, wherein the low-power, low operating temperature heat sources are placed at a lower level (below) the high-power, high operating temperature heat sources on an heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic front elevation view of a heat exchanger <b>500</b>, according to embodiments of the disclosures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram of a right side view of a fin <b>100</b> of the heat exchanger <b>500</b>, according to embodiments of the disclosure. The heat exchanger <b>500</b> is used to cool one or electronic devices. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the heat exchanger <b>500</b> includes a plurality of heat exchanger fins <b>100</b> and which are thermally coupled to a base plate <b>190</b>.

The base plate <b>190</b> includes a top or mounting surface <b>191</b> and a bottom or contact surface <b>199</b> opposite the mounting surface <b>191</b>. The mounting surface <b>191</b> has a plurality of mounting grooves <b>192</b> thereon, substantially parallel to each other and spaced apart at desired intervals.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The dimensions (e.g., length, breadth, thickness), depth, and number of mounting grooves <b>192</b> correspond to the dimensions (e.g., length, breadth, thickness), height and number of fins <b>100</b>. Each fin base <b>119</b> of each heat exchanger fin <b>100</b> is thermally and mechanically coupled to each mounting groove <b>192</b> using suitable techniques such as brazing techniques, for instance. However, other techniques can also be used as long as heat may be efficiently and effectively transferred from the base plate <b>190</b> to the plurality of heat exchanger fins <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, each fin base <b>119</b> is hemmed, thereby reinforcing the strength thereof and increasing the surface area for conductive heat transfer from the base plate <b>190</b> to the plurality of heat exchanger fins <b>100</b>.

As an example, the fins <b>100</b> occupy a smaller area when the fins <b>100</b> are closely positioned. This results in an empty, non-occupied portion of the mounting surface <b>191</b> that does not include fins <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">One or more electronic devices generating heat (heat sources) are attached to the contact surface <b>199</b>, for example by fasteners (e.g., nuts, screws, bolts, pins, clips etc.) or by other means such as thermal paste as long as heat from the electronic device is efficiently and effectively transferred from the one or more electronic source to the base plate <b>190</b>.

The working fluid is distributed in the form of liquid vapor slugs/bubbles throughout the channels <b>116</b>. Each heat exchanger fin <b>100</b> includes a main evaporator region (e.g., second evaporator region <b>130</b>), a main condenser region (e.g., second evaporator region <b>150</b>), vapor flow channels <b>116</b> extending from the main evaporator region and the main condenser region, and working fluid condenser channels (e.g., condensation channel <b>162</b>), working fluid transport channels (e.g., connecting channel <b>172</b>), and working fluid evaporator channels (e.g., evaporation channel <b>122</b>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When heat from a first heat source <b>182</b> and a second heat source <b>188</b> is applied to the first and second evaporator regions <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> (fin base <b>119</b>), the heat converts the working fluid to vapor and the vapor bubbles increase within the second evaporator region <b>130</b>. Meanwhile, at the second condenser region <b>150</b>, heat is removed and the bubbles decrease. The volume expansion due to vaporization and the contraction due to condensation cause an oscillating motion within the channels (e.g., one or more of the channels <b>116</b>, the condensation channel <b>162</b>, the connecting channel <b>172</b>, and the evaporation channel <b>122</b>). The volume of the second condenser region <b>150</b> is at least equal to or greater than the volume of the second evaporator region <b>130</b>, facilitating the oscillating motion. The net effect of the temperature gradient between the second evaporator region <b>130</b> and second condenser region <b>150</b> and the difference in vapor pressure in the channels <b>116</b> and working fluid channels (e.g., condensation channel <b>162</b>, one connecting channel <b>172</b>, and evaporation channel <b>122</b>) creates a non-equilibrium pressure condition. The increased output pressure gain in downward working fluid flow to the condensation channel <b>162</b>, increases upward oscillation driving forces throughout the connecting channel <b>172</b> and the evaporation channel <b>122</b>, and thus improves the heat transfer efficiency rate along each fin edge <b>111</b> for electronic devices that operate vertically, thereby improving thermal performance. The evaporation channel end <b>121</b> is spaced from the ground compared to the condensation channel end <b>171</b> to facilitate the working fluid from the downward working fluid flow to be driven upward into the second evaporator region <b>130</b> from the evaporation channel <b>122</b>. Thermo-fluidic transport is provided within each heat exchanger fin <b>100</b> via the self-sustaining oscillation driving forces, whereby the pressure pulsations are thermally driven.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, when the amount of working fluid in the condensation channel <b>162</b>, the connecting channel <b>172</b>, and the evaporation channel <b>122</b>, and channels <b>116</b> of the second evaporator region <b>130</b> and second condenser region <b>150</b> is around 40% to around 80% (also referred to as a filling ratio), the amount of working fluid for efficient and effective thermal performance is reduced by 40% to 60% when compared to prior art heat exchangers that do not include the condensation channel <b>162</b>, the connecting channel <b>172</b>, and the evaporation channel <b>122</b>, and channels <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Weight of the plurality of heat exchanger fins <b>100</b> is reduced, eliminating the need for more costly attachment materials or non-standard attachment mechanisms. Furthermore, via the evaporation channel <b>122</b> and channels <b>116</b> of the evaporator region <b>130</b>, an increased amount of working fluid is contained in the evaporator region <b>130</b> further away from ground. Thus, heat dissipation efficiency is driven upward, opposite the direction of gravity, mitigating dry-out from occurring, causing the electronic device to overheat, fail or be damaged. Even more, the lesser maximum operating temperature allowance for lower-powered electronic devices is more compatibly met via the evaporation channel <b>122</b>, and the greater maximum operating temperature allowance for lower-powered electronic devices is more compatibly met via the upward driven increase in heat dissipation efficiency. When there are more than one heat source, as an example, three heat sources, a first heat source, a second heat source, and a third heat source between the first and second heat sources, heat dissipation efficiency is increased for the second heat source, closest to the upper outer perimeters of the second evaporator region <b>130</b> and second condenser region <b>150</b>, when compared to existing heat exchangers. Thus, electronic devices are limited from overheating, failing or being damaged via the more compatible matching of heat dissipation efficiency and power output and maximum heat tolerance of the heat sources attached to the contact surface <b>199</b> of the base plate <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The shape and width of the dividing obstructer <b>113</b>, and lengths of the second evaporation and condensation sides <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> may be varied depending upon application and design requirements as long as the top end <b>147</b> of the dividing obstructer <b>113</b> is closer to the upper edge <b>118</b> than the bottom end <b>149</b>, and the volume of the channels <b>116</b> of the second condenser region <b>150</b> is at least equal to or greater than the volume of the braided channels <b>116</b> of the second evaporator region <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a heat exchanger fin <b>300</b>, according to embodiments of the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a plan view of the heat exchanger fin <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, according to embodiments of the disclosure.

The through holes <b>814</b> define a network of channels <b>816</b> (also referred to as braided channels). The airflow through holes <b>814</b> are generally circular-shaped and arranged in a staggered configuration. However, the shape and size of the holes <b>814</b> is not limited to any particular shape and size. For instance, the holes <b>814</b> can be polygonal shape. The holes <b>814</b> can be arranged in any desired configuration (staggered or non-staggered) and the separation (pitch) between adjacent holes <b>814</b> can be varied (increased or decreased) as required by application and design.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the absence of the through holes <b>814</b>, air between adjacent heat exchanger fins <b>851</b> insulates the surfaces of the adjacent facing heat exchanger fins <b>851</b> and the base plate surfaces therebetween. This air is relatively stagnant and does not flow freely between the fins. As a result, heat dissipation is poor and thus thermal performance of heat exchangers decreases. The availability of only natural convection and the reduced distance between the heat exchanger fins further decrease heat dissipation. The plurality of airflow through holes <b>814</b>, according to embodiments of the disclosure, result in air flowing through in the through holes <b>814</b> and between adjacent fins <b>851</b>. This air flow is transverse to the air flowing longitudinally across the surfaces of each heat exchanger fin <b>851</b> along the fin base <b>119</b>. The transverse air flows create a turbulent airflow and thus reduces the presence of stagnant air between heat exchanger fins <b>851</b>. By reducing stagnant air using the plurality of airflow through holes <b>814</b>, the distance (separation) between the plurality of heat exchanger fins <b>100</b> can be reduced without sacrificing heat dissipation and thermal performance even when only natural convection is available.

In general, each heat exchanger fin <b>851</b> includes an evaporator region, a condenser region, and vapor flow channel regions extending between the evaporator region and the condenser region. When heat from at least one heat source is applied to the evaporator region, the heat converts the working fluid to vapor and the vapor expands within the heat exchanger fin <b>851</b>. Meanwhile, at the condenser region, heat is being removed and the vapor is condensed. The volume expansion due to vaporization and the contraction due to condensation cause a turbulence motion via the channels <b>816</b>. The net effect of the temperature gradient between the evaporator region and the condenser region, and the driving forces due to the different vapor flow paths created by the channels <b>816</b> creates a non-equilibrium pressure condition. Thus, thermo-fluidic transport is provided via self-sustaining turbulent driving forces, having pressure pulsations being fully thermally driven.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The plurality of heat exchanger fins <b>100</b> under vacuum and including a working fluid in the channels <b>816</b> increases heat dissipation and thermal performance of the fins <b>100</b> compared to heat exchanger fins not including a working fluid.

The auxiliary channels <b>147</b> and the connecting channels <b>127</b> can be orientated at any desired angle as long as working fluid in the auxiliary channels <b>147</b> and the connecting channels <b>127</b> flows in a downward direction during operation when the heat exchanger <b>1200</b> is installed in an upright position.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Although only a single condensation channel <b>137</b> and a single evaporation channel <b>153</b> are discussed herein, embodiments are not limited in this regard and the heat exchanger <b>1200</b> can include more than one condensation channel <b>137</b> and more than one evaporation channel <b>153</b>, without departing from the scope of the disclosure. When more than one condensation channel <b>137</b> and evaporation channel <b>153</b> are installed, the connecting channels <b>127</b> are in fluid contact with each evaporation channel <b>153</b> and the auxiliary channels are in fluid contact with each condensation channel <b>137</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some embodiments, a volume of the working fluid that flows through unit volumes of the condensation channel <b>1237</b> and the evaporation channel <b>1253</b> is generally uniform across the entirety of each channel and is around two times the flow volume the channels <b>147</b> and the connecting channels <b>127</b>.

The working fluid is in the form of liquid vapor slugs/bubbles throughout the auxiliary channel <b>1247</b> of the auxiliary enhancement region <b>1213</b> and the connecting channel <b>1227</b> and the evaporation channel <b>1253</b> of the exchanger enhancement portion <b>1215</b>. Each heat exchanger fin <b>1250</b> includes an evaporator region (including the evaporation channel <b>1253</b>), a condenser region (including the condensation channel <b>1237</b>), vapor flow region (including the auxiliary channels <b>147</b> and the connecting channels <b>127</b>) extending from the evaporator region and condenser region, respectively.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">When heat from the first heat source <b>1282</b> and the second heat source <b>1288</b> is applied to the contact surface <b>1299</b> of the base plate <b>1290</b>, the heat converts the working fluid to vapor and the vapor bubbles increase in size and number within the vapor flow region. Meanwhile, at the condenser region, heat is removed (dissipated) and the bubbles are reduced. The volume expansion of the working fluid due to vaporization and the contraction due to condensation causes an oscillating motion within the condensation channel <b>1237</b>, the auxiliary channels <b>1247</b>, the connecting channels <b>1227</b>, and the evaporation channel <b>1253</b>. The volume of the condenser region is at least equal to or greater than the volume of the evaporator region, thereby facilitating the oscillating motion. The net effect of the temperature gradient between the evaporator region and condenser region and the pressure differences introduced throughout the condensation channel <b>1237</b>, the auxiliary channels <b>1247</b>, the connecting channels <b>1227</b>, and the evaporation channel <b>1253</b> creates a non-equilibrium pressure condition. As a result of the increased output pressure gain in downward working fluid flow through the auxiliary channels <b>1247</b>, a portion of the connecting channels <b>1227</b> boosts upward oscillation driving forces throughout the evaporation channel <b>1253</b> and other portion of the connecting channels <b>1227</b>, and increased surface area of the auxiliary enhancement portion <b>1213</b>, improving the heat transfer efficiency rate for the heat sources (electric devices). Thermo-fluidic transport is thus provided within each heat exchanger fin <b>1250</b> via the self-sustaining oscillation driving forces, whereby the pressure pulsations are thermally driven.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Those of ordinary skill in the relevant art will appreciate that the shape, width and lengths of the condensation channel <b>1237</b> and the auxiliary channels <b>1247</b> of the auxiliary enhancement portion <b>1213</b> and the connecting channels <b>1227</b> and the evaporation channels <b>1253</b> of the exchanger enhancement portion <b>1215</b> may be varied, such as having a wavy shape, having increased or decreased widths, having longer or shorter lengths, or any combination thereof, depending upon application and design requirements, without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The plurality of heat exchanger fins <b>1250</b> under vacuum and including a working fluid in the condensation channel <b>1237</b>, the auxiliary channels <b>1247</b>, the connecting channels <b>1227</b>, and the evaporation channel <b>1253</b> increases the heat dissipation and thermal performance of each heat exchanger fin <b>1250</b> when compared existing heat exchanger fins that do not include the channel structure including a working fluid. Also, the auxiliary enhancement portion <b>1213</b> increases the surface area of the heat source(s) (e.g., electronic devices) in thermal contact with the heat exchanger while keeping the space occupied by the heat exchanger minimal. Thus, the rate of convective heat transfer is further improved while preventing formation of a layer of heated air on the surface of base plate <b>1290</b> that impedes heat transfer.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some embodiments, each heat exchanger fin <b>1250</b> is made of aluminum, or an aluminum-alloy or the like, and formed by roll-bonding. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a manufacturing method <b>1500</b> of the heat exchanger fin <b>1250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref>, according to embodiments of the disclosure.
