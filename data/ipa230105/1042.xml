Hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding in the brain, are commonly caused by vascular malformation, such as brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) or by acquired vascular diseases such as brain aneurysm, dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) and others. Despite the remarkable advancement in the field of endovascular treatment, which is a new technology treating the cerebrovascular diseases from inside the vessels using catheters, these conditions remain to be serious diseases and it is partially due to the limitations of currently available devices and materials.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Liquid embolic material (LEM) is an important treatment tool used in the field of neuro-endovascular treatment. It plays a major role for the treatment of brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM), dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) as well as intracranial tumors. The two major LEMs used in the current practice include 1) acrylic adhesive (e.g., n-butyl cyanoacrylate: nBCA) and 2) ethylene vinyl alcohol polymers (EvOH) dissolved in the organic solvent called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Onyx&#xae; Embolic System). The latter, a non-adhesive LEM, was initially developed to overcome the limitation of acrylic adhesives, which has a strong adhesiveness causing the risk of catheter-entrapment during the procedure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are currently several different solutions (liquid embolic materials) to treat cerebrovascular diseases, e.g., bAVM, dAVF, and also in part, brain aneurysms (BA).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There remains a need for an embolic material offering sufficient mechanical durability without toxicity or such strong adhesiveness that causes catheter entrapment.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The materials and methods described herein provide a liquid embolic composition of natural polymers, water, and angiographic contrast agents that improve neurovascular interventions, making them more reliable, safe, and affordable.

In some embodiments, no alginate is present in the composition. This gellan-based liquid embolic material is characterized by its rapid coagulation process upon the contact with calcium ions in blood.

Gellan gum has not yet been approved for medical and pharmaceutical uses. However, given the federal regulation history of this material, it is likely to have chemically and biologically inert profiles to the human body.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0065">Gellan gum can be applied as a stabilizer and thickener for food products, including jams, jellies, low-fat spreads, microwavable foods, and structured foods as indicated in [US Department of Agriculture, Technical Evaluation Report (Feb. 10, 2006)], the formulations of which involve this polysaccharide typically at the concentrations above 1%, plus 10% calcium chloride, if the mechanical property of the food produced needs to be stabilized.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0066">The hydrogel texture of gellan gum, hence, forms instantly upon the addition of divalent cations, otherwise the elevated concentration of the polysaccharides (commonly recognized as greater than 0.5 wt %) can induce a spontaneous gelation even in the absence of divalent cations. Usually the blood calcium concentration are in a range of 2.5 mM-5.0 mM, which corresponds to 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>-2.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>%.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0067">When considering the application of this material for endovascular treatment, administrating the gellan gum followed by relatively high concentration (10%, for example) of calcium is not feasible because the sudden increase of the blood calcium concentration can cause systemic problems. Therefore, the reinforcement of the gellan coagulates or hydrogels in the blood vessel is conclusively achieved through the elevated concentration of the polysaccharide added to the GBLEM.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0068">The option indicated above, the elevated concentration of gellan gum, consequently draws a trade-off: the GBLEM is not injectable through the micro-catheter lumen, due to a spontaneous, calcium-free gelation at the concentration of gellan gum above 0.5%, which is the upper limit as claimed in the patent specification in the prior art (alginate-based LEM [WO2019163012]).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0069">The inventors have found a solution for the trade-off, by adding the gelling suppressor compounds to the GBLEM.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0070">Gelling Suppressor and Thixotropy Reducers&#x2014;Polyols and Choices</p><p id="p-0066" num="0071">A phenomenon that low molecular weight, dimeric or monomeric sugars often inhibit gelation of the high molecular weight polysaccharides has been known since several decades ago in the food processing industry. The reference [Sucrose as a gelation inhibitor of commercially frozen <i>papaya </i>puree, Harry Y. Yamamoto and Winfred Inouye, Technical Progress Report No. 137, an archive from Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Station, College of Tropical Agriculture, University of Hawaii, January 1963] is a typical example that indicates utilization of a dimeric sugar compound, sucrose (&#x3b2;-D-fructofuranosyl-(2-&#x3e;1)-&#x3b1;-D-glucopyranoside), for the fluidity improvement of a fruit homogenate, in which intermolecular association of high molecular mass pectin-related polysaccharides potentially induce the gelation via formation of hydrogen bonds or physical entanglements among the polymeric molecular chains.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0072">Thus, low molecular weight, polyhydroxylated organic compounds (polyols) prevent the polymer chains from interacting with each other in a dose-dependent manner along with the molar stoichiometry of sugar residues embedded in the pectin chain against the free sucrose molecules, as seen in reference [Sucrose as a gelation inhibitor of commercially frozen <i>papaya </i>puree, Harry Y. Yamamoto and Winfred Inouye, Technical Progress Report No. 137, an archive from Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Station, College of Tropical Agriculture, University of Hawaii, January 1963], implying a mechanism that excess sucrose molecules frequently interrupt the direct association of polymer chains, with mediating water molecules in between.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0073">The interruption effect of polyols mentioned above can also be adopted in the case of gellan gum in order to retain the GBLEM in a sol and fluid state before injection into the vascular environment, where the contact between gellan and calcium ions triggers the coagulation of the polysaccharide molecules to form a rigid hydrogel. The hydrogelation of gellan gum solution has been thoroughly investigated [Gelation of gellan&#x2014;A review, Edwin R. Morris, Katsuyoshi Nishinari, Marguerite Rinaudo, Food Hydrocolloids 28: 373-411 (2012)], and currently, there are two different models to demonstrate the gelation process in the absence of calcium ions, both of which involve two steps of different phase transition upon annealing the solution from the dissolution temperature at approximately 90&#xb0; C., then descending the temperature around 20&#xb0; C.; the first step is a fibril formation to increase the solution viscosity (45-55&#xb0; C. transition 1), followed by another step as inter-fibrillar association (15-25&#xb0; C., transition 1l), to form a macroscopic hydrogel texture with almost no fluidity.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0074">Polyol molecules probably retain the physicochemical state of the gellan molecules in aqueous solution in between the phase transitions I and II, which means that the polyol molecules interrupt the fibrils interaction with each other. In one embodiment, when 1.2 wt % gellan aqueous solution containing 9 wt % D-glucose (a polyol) was prepared via dissolution at 95&#xb0; C., during the annealing time course, the viscosity gradually increased and the homogenous solution turned to a transparent, thixotropic fluid at ca 30&#xb0; C. &#x201c;Thixotropy&#x201d; is a term of rheology, which defines a fluid that has a time-dependent viscosity, and is distinguished from the &#x201c;shear thinning (pseudoplastic) fluid&#x201d;, which can instantly gain up the storage modulus as the shear stress is released, likely seen in reference [An injectable shear-thinning biomaterials for endovascular embolization, Reginald K. Avery, Hassan Albadawi, Mohsen Akbari, Yu Shrike Zhang, Michael J. Duggan, Dushyant V. Sahani, Bradley D. Olsen, Ali Khademhosseini, Rahmi Oklu, Science Translational Medicine 8: 365ra156 (12 pages) (2016)].</p><p id="p-0070" num="0075">In consequence, thixotropic behavior corresponds to an intermediate state between a non-Newtonian fluid and plastic sol, as well as exhibits a non-zero time in decreasing the fluidity gradually. In the case of the GBLEM containing 1.36 wt % gellan and 3.6 wt % D-glucose, thixotropic behavior was observed around 30-40&#xb0; C. with a highly viscous nature but turning into a smooth sol when shaken, while, as increasing the concentration of D-glucose up to 9-10 wt %, the GBLEM mostly retains fluidity around 30-40&#xb0; C. the observation of which indicates that D-glucose reduces the thixotropic property. This also suggests that D-glucose molecules reversibly associate and dissociate with the gellan fibrils in an intermediate state between the phase transitions I and II, and as a result of the equilibrium, it makes the GBLEM fully injectable via microcatheter even in the presence of a lowered concentration of D-glucose as 3.6 wt %, by a conventional microwave oven heating just for a couple of seconds, as demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0076">In the presence of 9 wt % D-glucose as a pre-injection gelling suppressor, 1.2 wt % gellan aqueous solution (plus 0.1 wt % blue-dextran for visualization) instantly coagulates to form a hydrogel upon contact with an artificial blood plasma (0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris&#x22c5;HCl, pH 8.0, 5.0 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>), as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0077">The polyols already tested as gelling suppressors are monomeric hexoses, D-glucose and D-mannose, and their corresponding sugar alcohols, glucitol and mannitol, in the range of 3.0-10 wt %. As well, the polyols are potentially selected one from a group of other hexoses, pentoses, and corresponding sugar alcohols, including ribose, arabinose, and xylose. The polyol chemicals can be selected to avoid stimuli that induce any physiologically negative situations, and the polyol concentration is adjustable for regulation of the blood osmotic pressure.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0078">Angiographic Components&#x2014;how to Adjust the Radiopacity</p><p id="p-0074" num="0079">Any of water-soluble angiographic compounds are adaptable to the GBLEM. Two of conventional iodine-type angiographic chemicals, iohexol isomers and iopamidol are commercially available chemicals for the radiopaque components. Omnipaque&#x2122; and Iopamiron&#x2122; are trademarks of frequently used angiographic contrast agents and contain iohexol isomers and iopamidol, respectively as the radiopaque compounds, of which end products are provided as &#x201c;ready-to-use&#x201d;, transparent solutions in plastic bottles. Both iohexol isomers and iopamidol are derivatives of N-acyl-5-amino-2,4,6-triode isophthalamide, and the iodine contents in Omnipaque&#x2122; and Iopamiron&#x2122; are the radiopacity intensity indicators, which are clearly marked, for example &#x201c;Iopamiron 300&#x201d;, on the bottle labels, for which the example indicates that the iodine content [I] is equivalent to 300 mg/mL.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0080">While the [I] is an &#x201c;equivalent&#x201d; value just for the content of iodine elements in the end product, the actual concentration of iohexol isomers or lopamidol are separately calculated on the basis of the iodine mass percentages in each of the contrasts' molecular formulae. For instance in a case of Omnipaque300, the iodine mass percentage (% I) in the molecular formula weight of lohexol isomer (Fw=821 g/mol) is 46.4%1, which leads to the solute concentration as [iohexol]=300/0.464 mg/mL=647 mg/mL=0.79 mol/L (M). Iopamiron300 also has an iopamidol (Fw=777 g/mol) concentration of [iopamidol]=612 mg/mL=0.79 M.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0081">The concentrations, [iohexol] and [iopamidol] as indicated above for the cases of [I]=300 mg/mL, correspond to the solute mass percentages as 64.7 wt % and 61.2 wt %, respectively. Omnipaque contains a subcomponent, 0.1 mg/mL of disodium calcium ethylenediamine-N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraacetate (EDTA&#x22c5;2Na&#x22c5;Ca, aka calcium disodium edetate, Fw=374 g/mol), and the calcium ion concentration is [Ca<sup>2</sup>]=0.27 mM. When the gellan gum powder is added to Omnipaque solution at 90&#xb0; C., the gellan gum was not completely dissolved at 0.8-1.3 wt %, due to the presence of calcium disodium edetate, indicating that this approach did not work to prepare the GBLEM with satisfactory radiopacity under fluoroscopy. Calcium free medium, therefore, is used to dissolve gellan gum at the preferred concentration.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0082">Iohexol or iopamidol has to be directly dissolved in hot distilled (calcium free) water, but here is also a trade-off. The highly elevated mass percentage of iohexol, for instance as seen in that [1]=300 mg/mL is equal to [iohexol]=64.7 wt %, leaves the fraction of 35.3 wt % mass ratio for other components including gellan, polyols, and water as the medium/solvent of the GBLEM. If the mass percentage of gellan gum and polyol occupy 1.3 wt % and 10 wt %, respectively, available room for water is just 24 wt %, in which the mass ratio between gellan and water is 1.3:24, meaning that the net concentration of gellan is 5.1 wt %. Under such a net concentration of gellan gum, the gelling suppression action of polyols no longer works, and, in fact, the trials for preparing the GBLEM as described above resulted in a composite having no fluidity at 30-40&#xb0; C., which means that the composite was not injectable.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0083">The inventors finally found that the injectable composite can be prepared only when the iohexol concentration does not exceed to 49 wt %, which corresponds to [I]=230 mg/mL as the maximum value of the radiopacity indicator. As a conclusion, working mass percentage of iodine based angiographic agents is ranging from [I]=100-230 mg/mL, in the presence of 0.8-1.3 wt % gellan gum and 3-10 wt % of polyols. The comparison of radiopacity is demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0084">Another approach to exert the radiopacity of the GBLEM is to add fine tantalum (Ta) powder to the composite. The mass ratio of Ta powder is 8-12 wt % and the BCTC principle is still working by an observation of instant hydrogelation of the GBLEM (gellan 1.2 wt %, D-glucose 9 wt %), as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Other heavy metals, commonly used in the field of endovascular devices, such as tungsten, platinum, gold, or cobalt-chrome, can be also potentially used as radiopaque materials. Bismuth-containing compounds, for instances, bismuth oxides or bismuth citrates, and can also be selected as the radiopaque materials, which do not inhibit the BCTC principle.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0085">Potential Subcomponents to Modify the Gelling Rate and Injectability</p><p id="p-0081" num="0086">The fibril structure of gellan gum is formed via a double helix type association of two parallel chains of the molecule, where the pitch of the rotational periodicity is ca 5.6 nm [Gelation of gellan&#x2014;A review, Edwin R. Morris, Katsuyoshi Nishinari, Marguerite Rinaudo, Food Hydrocolloids 28: 373-411 (2012)]. Formation of the ordered structure is potentially interrupted when coexisting high polymers of another kind have an electrically neutral nature. A super high molecular weight preparation of glucomannan or xanthan gum is the candidate as fibril formation inhibitors, leading to modify the gelling rate at 30-40&#xb0; C. for a better inject-ability due to a lowered viscosity of the GBLEM. A highly acylated grade preparation, so called &#x201c;native gellan gum&#x201d; is also a candidate for modifying a gelling property of the GBLEM. The GBLEM containing native gellan gum was tested in an animal experiment, and it was found that the native gellan gum can improve mechanical durability of the material after deployment in a blood vessel. This result is described later in detail (animal experiments using rabbit renal artery).</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 2: Preparation of GBLEM, Dissolution Sequences of Components</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0087">This example describes gellan gums as an active ingredient for the BCTC principle, polyols and amino acids as phase transition modifiers, and dissolution of the components of GBLEM in water.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0088">Following are commercially available gellan gums, which are specified with the identical registry numbers of Chemical Abstract Service (CAS RN): a reagent grade of gellan gum (deacetylated, CAS RN, 71010-52-1) for plant tissue culture (FujiFilm Corporation, Japan); other trade names, Kelcogel&#xae; (CP Kelco, US, Inc., CAS RN, 71010-52-1), Geirite (FujiFilm Corporation, CAS RN, 71010-52-1), Phytagel&#x2122; (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS RN, 71010-52-1), or CultureGelm (PhytoTechnology Laboratories, CAS RN, 71010-52-1).

These polyols are water-soluble, and hence can be combined with the gellan gum preparations as above. The polyols are also selected and combined with gellan gum, as long as its biocompatibility in the human body is confirmed.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0091">Several kinds of low molecular weight amino acids are also effective to retain the fluidity of GBLEM before injection. Glycine, sarcosine (N-methyl glycine), N,N-dimethyl glycine, betaine (N,N,N-trimethyl glycine), alanine, proline, trans-4-hydroxyproline (and the isomers), &#x3b2;-alanine, glutamate, aspartate, pyroglutamate, serine, threonine are confirmed to be capable of suppressing gelation for the GBLEM. The common feature of the amino acids is that the compound has one primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary amino group and one carboxyl group in the molecular formulae. The primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary amino groups of these compounds can interact with the carboxyl group on the glucuronic acid residue in the gellan's molecular backbone, resulting in the inhibition of the filament formation between gellan molecules via the glucuronic acid residues. The N-end amino group on the peptides, hence for instance serylserine, are also able to suppress the gelation of GBLEM. The concentration of the amino acids or peptides in the GBLEM can be set from 0.01-20 wt %, where any of physiological stimuli to the human body will be avoided.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0092">The amino acids (or peptides) can be combined with polyols to enhance the effects on the gelation suppression.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0093">Preparation of GBLEM&#x2014;Dissolution of the Components in Water</p><p id="p-0089" num="0094">The concentrations of the components are represented in weight percentage (wt %). As mentioned in the roles of the gelation suppressor, polyols and amino acids have to be dissolved in water prior to the dissolution of gellan gum. A typical procedure of the GBLEM preparation involves the following steps. Distilled and deionized water (DDW) (7.00 g) is placed in a glass vial and D-glucose (0.5 g) was dissolved at room temperature. Gellan gum (0.12 g) was added to the solution, and with stirring, the dissolution temperature is elevated to 85-90&#xb0; C. It typically takes for a couple of hours for complete dissolution of gellan gum, and then finally iohexol (2.38 g) is added to the solution. The final concentrations in the total mass of 10 grams are 1.2 wt % for gellan gum, 5 wt % for D-glucose, and 23.8 wt % for iohexol ([I]=110 mg/mL).
