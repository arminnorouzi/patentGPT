Bearings can include a low friction material interfacing between two or more components, which are movable with respect to one another in an assembly. Further, some bearings include flanged bearings, which include either one or two flanges. Bearings may be used in assemblies with applications in the vehicle industry, for example, for door, hood, and engine compartment hinges, seats, steering columns, flywheels, balancer shaft bearings, etc., or may be used for non-automotive applications. Some hinge assemblies may include a coating including, but not limited to, paint coatings that may be done through e-painting or other methods. In some areas, the bearing and other components in the hinge assembly may include gaps that may lead to over coating which results in cracks, corrosion, and debris/contamination in the hinge assembly. Therefore, despite advances in the art, there is an ongoing need for improved bearings that have a longer lifetime, improved effectiveness, improved corrosion protection, and overall improved performance within an assembly.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure may be better understood, and its numerous features and advantages made apparent to those skilled in the art by referencing the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> includes a stepwise forming process;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is an illustration of a bearing material according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is an illustration of a bearing material according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is an illustration of a bearing material according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is an illustration of a bearing material of a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> is an illustration of a bearing material according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is an illustration of a manufacturing process for forming a blank into a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">FIG. <b>4</b>B<b>1</b> is an illustration of a manufacturing process for forming a blank into a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">FIG. <b>4</b>B<b>2</b> is an illustration of a manufacturing process for forming a blank into a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">FIG. <b>4</b>C<b>1</b> is an illustration of a manufacturing process for forming a blank into a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">FIG. <b>4</b>C<b>2</b> is an illustration of a manufacturing process for forming a blank into a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">FIG. <b>4</b>C<b>3</b> is an illustration of a manufacturing process for forming a blank into a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">FIG. <b>4</b>C<b>4</b> is an illustration of a manufacturing process for forming a blank into a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">FIG. <b>4</b>C<b>5</b> is an illustration of a manufacturing process for forming a blank into a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">FIG. <b>4</b>D<b>1</b> is an illustration of a manufacturing process for forming a blank into a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">FIG. <b>4</b>D<b>2</b> is an illustration of a manufacturing process for forming a blank into a bearing according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref> is an illustration of a bearing material according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is an illustration of a bearing within an assembly according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is an illustration of a bearing within an assembly according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an illustration of a bearing within an assembly according to a number of embodiments;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an illustration of a bearing within an assembly according to a number of embodiments; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an illustration of a bearing within an assembly according to a number of embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Skilled artisans appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the bearing <b>100</b> may be a sliding bearing. The bearing <b>100</b> may extend in the axial direction relative to a central axis <b>500</b>. The central axis <b>500</b> may be longitudinal down the length of the bearing <b>100</b>. The bearing <b>100</b> may include a sidewall <b>102</b> forming an annular shape having a first axial end or edge <b>150</b> and a second axial end or edge <b>152</b>. The sidewall <b>102</b> may have an inner radial end or edge <b>126</b> along a radially inner surface <b>130</b>, and an outer radial end or edge <b>128</b> along a radially outer surface <b>132</b>.

The flange <b>116</b> may be contiguous with and extend from an axial end <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> of the body <b>114</b>. In a number of embodiments, the outer radial end <b>128</b> may form the outer radius OR of the bearing <b>100</b> when measured radially from the central axis <b>500</b>. In a number of embodiments, the inner radial end <b>126</b> may form the inner radius IR of the bearing <b>100</b> when measured radially from the central axis <b>500</b>. In other words, the radial width of the radial flange <b>116</b> W<sub>RF </sub>may be the distance from the difference in distance of the outer radius OR and the inner radius IR. In a number of embodiments, the radial flange <b>116</b> may include an axial split <b>170</b>. The axial split <b>170</b> may provide a gap in the radial flange <b>116</b>. In certain embodiments, the axial split <b>170</b> can be contiguous with the axial gap <b>160</b> in the sidewall <b>102</b>. The axial split <b>170</b> may include a first circumferential edge <b>172</b> and a second circumferential edge <b>174</b>. In a number of embodiments, the substrate <b>119</b> has a reduced thickness at the first circumferential edge <b>172</b>, or the second circumferential edge <b>174</b> such that the substrate <b>119</b> is not exposed along at least one of the first circumferential edge <b>172</b> or the second circumferential edge <b>174</b>. The bearing <b>100</b> may be tapered to provide a better interface with a mating component. In a number of embodiments, the radial flange <b>116</b> may form an interface with a housing (outer component) and/or a shaft (inner component). In a number of embodiments, the bearing may have a plurality of radial flanges which may each form an interface with a housing (outer component) and/or a shaft pin (inner component).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a number of embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the bearing <b>100</b> can have an overall length, L, from first axial end <b>150</b> to the second axial end <b>152</b>, and L can be &#x2265;0.5 mm, &#x2265;0.75 mm, &#x2265;1 mm, &#x2265;2 mm, &#x2265;5 mm, or &#x2265;10 mm. The length L can be &#x2264;10 mm, such as &#x2264;7.5 mm, &#x2264;5 mm, &#x2264;2.5 mm, or &#x2264;1 mm.
