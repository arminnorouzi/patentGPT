ASRS systems may be utilized in a variety of material handling applications including storage facilities, manufacturing plants, order fulfilment centers and the like. Such systems may comprise conveyors (e.g., planar conveyor belts, powered or unpowered rollers, and/or the like) to move objects from one place to another and may employ various mechanisms for retrieving and transporting objects such as a retrieval apparatus comprising one or more arm mechanisms. An example arm mechanism may extend or retract from one or more surfaces of a retrieval apparatus and may comprise one or more elements configured to engage a surface of an object in order to move the object (e.g., laterally or perpendicular to a travel direction along an example conveyor) during operations.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In various examples, retrieval apparatuses (e.g., shuttles, robots, motorized vehicles, combinations thereof, and/or the like) may be used to convey objects from one location to another within a system. In such examples, the retrieval apparatuses may rely on operational data/information provided by another computing entity in electronic communication therewith in order to navigate its environment. For example, the retrieval apparatus may receive a control indication to cause the retrieval apparatus (e.g., via one or more arm mechanisms) to perform retrieval operations (e.g., based on stored operational data describing locations of objects and the like). Additionally, in response to receiving the control indication, the retrieval apparatus may request and/or receive operational data describing locations of objects and system mapping/routing information. As such, the example retrieval apparatus may rely on data/information provided by another computing entity to facilitate retrieval operations. Thus, the example retrieval apparatus may be incapable of autonomously generating or updating operational data (e.g., object information and/or location/mapping information, including data indicative of object characteristics (e.g., length, width, height, cross-sectional area, shape, weight and/or the like).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some examples, an object may be positioned in a location that is different from that which is indicated in stored operational data or operational data provided by a computing entity (e.g., in conjunction with a retrieval request) such that the retrieval apparatus is unable to fulfil retrieval requests. In another example, the object characteristics and dimensions may be inaccurate. In such examples, attempts by the example retrieval apparatus to retrieve or pick the object may damage system components or result in a faulted state which may halt further operations until, for example, an object is manually repositioned or a retrieval apparatus can be repaired. Such faulted states may result in reduced throughput and operational inefficiencies.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure, example methods, apparatuses, computer program products and systems are provided.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, the present disclosure may provide a retrieval apparatus comprising at least one moveable arm mechanism configured to engage a surface of at least one of the plurality of objects, at least one sensing element configured to obtain sensor data describing locations and characteristics of at least some of the plurality of objects as the retrieval apparatus traverses an environment associated with the plurality of objects. The example retrieval apparatus may comprise a controller component in electronic communication with the at least one moveable arm mechanism and the at least one sensing element, wherein the controller component is configured to modify operational data based at least in part on the sensor data. In some examples, the controller component is configured to, in response to receiving a retrieval request, cause the at least one moveable arm mechanism to engage a surface of at least one of the plurality of objects based at least in part on the modified operational data. In some examples, the retrieval apparatus comprises a receiving frame, and the at least one moveable arm mechanism may be configured to retrieve at least one of the plurality of objects and place it on the receiving frame. In some examples, the sensor data describes at least a first gap between at least two of the plurality of objects in a first direction, and at least a second gap between the at least two of the plurality of objects in a second direction that is parallel to the first direction. In some examples, the at least one sensing element comprises one or more light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, radio detection and ranging (RADAR) sensors, infrared (IR) cameras, 3D cameras, 360&#xb0; cameras, photoelectric sensors or proximity sensors. In some examples, the at least one sensing element is attached to at least a surface of the at least one moveable arm mechanism. In some examples, the at least one sensing element comprises at least one location sensor. In some examples, the retrieval request comprises the operational data, and wherein the retrieval request is provided by a computing entity in electronic communication with the retrieval apparatus. In some examples, the operational data comprises object location information and object characteristics associated with the plurality of objects. In some examples, the controller component is further configured to determine whether the operational data is sufficient for facilitating retrieval operations, and transmit an indication requesting additional operational data in an instance in which the operational data is deemed insufficient for facilitating the retrieval operations.

In such examples, the computing entity may perform at least a portion of the analysis and provide (e.g., transmit or send) the results of the analysis to the processing component of the retrieval apparatus. In some examples, the processing component and/or computing entity may analyze sensor data pursuant to an image segmentation and/or object pose estimation techniques. For example, a computer vision algorithm(s) (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN), computer vision segmentation algorithms such as region-based segmentation, edge detection or clustering techniques) may be utilized by the processing component and/or other computing entity to determine locations and characteristics of one or more objects captured in example image data. In some examples, identifying object characteristics may comprise identifying a respective label, stock-keeping unit, barcode, packaging and/or the like corresponding with a respective item.

As noted above, operational data may comprise object information and/or location or mapping information, including data indicative of object characteristics (e.g., length, width, height, cross-sectional area, shape, weight and/or the like). Accordingly, modifying the operational data may comprise auditing operational data (e.g., by comparing operational data and sensor data) to confirm accuracy of the operational data that may, in some examples, be stored in memory. By way of example, if the processing circuitry determines that stored operational data is associated with a timestamp that is prior to a timestamp associated with sensor data, the processing circuitry may update the stored operational data based at least in part on the sensor data.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Subsequent to step/operation <b>705</b>, the example method <b>700</b> proceeds to step/operation <b>707</b>.

In some cases, the processing circuitry may determine that stored and/or received operational data (e.g., operational data received with a retrieval request) and/or sensor data for a particular location is associated with a time period (e.g., timestamp) that is prior to a pre-determined threshold time period (e.g., two hours) and/or that there is no available sensor data associated with the location.
