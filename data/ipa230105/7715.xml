It should be noted that the configurations described in the following exemplary embodiments are merely examples, and the present invention is not limited to the illustrated configurations.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a configuration of a network in which a communication apparatus <b>102</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment participates. The communication apparatus <b>102</b> is an access point (AP) having the role of constructing a network <b>101</b>. The network <b>101</b> is a wireless network. In the present exemplary embodiment, if the communication apparatus <b>102</b> constructs a plurality of networks, all the networks may have the same basic service set identifier (BSSID) or different BSSIDs. The BSSID is an identifier for identifying a network. In the networks, the communication apparatus <b>102</b> may present the same service set identifier (SSID) or different SSIDs. The SSID is an identifier for identifying an AP.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A communication apparatus <b>103</b> is a station (STA) having the role of joining the network <b>101</b>. The communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> each support the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11be (Extremely High Throughput or Extreme High Throughput (EHT)) standard, and can perform wireless communication compliant with the IEEE 802.11be standard via the network <b>101</b>. The communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> can communicate in 2.4-, 5-, and 6-GHz frequency bands. The frequency bands to be used by the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> are not limited thereto, and different frequency bands such as a 60-GHz band may be used. The communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> can communicate using bandwidths of 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 MHz.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> can implement multi user (MU) communication where signals of a plurality of users are multiplexed, by performing orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) communication compliant with the IEEE 802.11be standard. In OFDMA communication, a frequency band is subdivided into parts (Resource Units [RUs]), which are assigned to STAs in a non-overlapping manner so that carrier waves assigned to the STAs are orthogonal to each other. The AP can thus communicate with a plurality of STAs in parallel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> also perform multi-link communication where links are established and communication is performed via a plurality of frequency channels. As employed herein, a frequency channel refers to one defined by IEEE 802.11 series standards and capable of wireless communication compliant with the IEEE 802.11 series standards. The IEEE 802.11 series standards define a plurality of frequency channels in each of the 2.4-, 5-, and 6-GHz frequency bands. In the IEEE 802.11 series standards, each frequency channel is defined to have a bandwidth of 20 MHz. Adjoining frequency channels may be bonded to use a bandwidth of 40 MHz or more on one frequency channel For example, the communication apparatus <b>102</b> can establish a first link <b>104</b> via a first frequency channel in the 2.4-GHz band and a second link <b>105</b> via a second frequency channel in the 5-GHz band with the communication apparatus <b>103</b>, and communicate via both the links <b>104</b> and <b>105</b>. In such a case, the communication apparatus <b>102</b> maintains the second link <b>105</b> via the second frequency channel in parallel with the first link <b>104</b> via the first frequency channel. The communication apparatus <b>102</b> can thus improve throughput of the communication with the communication apparatus <b>103</b> by establishing links via a plurality of frequency channels with the communication apparatus <b>103</b>. The communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may establish a plurality of links of different frequency bands in the multi-link communication. For example, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may establish a third link in the 6-GHz band in addition to the first link <b>104</b> in the 2.4-GHz band and the second link <b>105</b> in the 5-GHz band. Alternatively, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may establish the links via a plurality of different channels included in the same frequency band. For example, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may establish the first link <b>104</b> via a first channel (1ch) of the 2.4-GHz band and the second link <b>105</b> via a fifth channel (5ch) of the 2.4-GHz band. Links of the same frequency band and links of different frequency bands may be established together. For example, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may establish a third link via a thirty-sixth channel (36ch) of the 5-GHz band in addition to the first link <b>104</b> via 1ch of the 2.4-GHz band and the second link <b>105</b> via 5ch of the 2.4-GHz band. By establishing a plurality of connections of different frequency bands with the communication apparatus <b>103</b>, the communication apparatus <b>102</b>, if one of the bands is congested, can communicate with the communication apparatus <b>103</b> in another band. This can prevent a drop in the throughput of the communication with the communication apparatus <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the multi-link communication, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> can establish a plurality of links at least using respective different frequency channels. Channel spacing between the frequency channels of the plurality of links for the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> to establish in the multi-link communication can be at least greater than 20 MHz. While, in the present exemplary embodiment, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> are described to establish the first link <b>104</b> and the second link <b>105</b>, three or more links may be established.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In performing the multi-link communication, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> divide a piece of data and transmit divided pieces of data to each other via the plurality of links. Alternatively, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may transmit the same data via the plurality of links so that the communication via one of the links serves as a backup communication for the communication via the other of the links. Specifically, suppose that the communication apparatus <b>102</b> transmits the same data to the communication apparatus <b>103</b> via the first link <b>104</b> on the first frequency channel and the second link <b>105</b> on the second frequency channel In such a case, even if an error occurs in the communication via the first link <b>104</b>, the communication apparatus <b>103</b> can receive the data transmitted from the communication apparatus <b>102</b> since the same data is transmitted via the second link <b>105</b>. Alternatively, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may use the links depending on the type of frame or data to be communicated. For example, the communication apparatus <b>102</b> may transmit a management frame via the first link <b>104</b> and transmit a data frame including data via the second link <b>105</b>. Specific examples of the management frame include a Beacon frame, Probe Request/Response frames, and Association Request/Response frames. In addition to these frames, a Disassociation frame, an Authentication frame, a De-Authentication frame, and an Action frame are also referred to as management frames. The Beacon frame is a frame for notifying network information. The Probe Request frame is a frame for requesting network information. The Probe Response frame is a response thereto, and is a frame for providing network information. The Association Request frame is a frame for requesting connection. The Association Response frame is a response thereto, and is a frame for indicating a connection approval or an error. The Disassociation frame is a frame for disconnecting the connection. The Authentication frame is a frame for authenticating the other apparatus. The De-Authentication frame is a frame for discontinuing authentication of the other apparatus and disconnecting the connection. The Action frame is a frame for performing an additional function other than the foregoing. The communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> transmit and receive management frames compliant with the IEEE 802.11 series standards. If, for example, the communication apparatus <b>102</b> transmits data on a captured image, meta information such as a date, imaging parameters (aperture value and shutter speed), and position information may be transmitted via the first link <b>104</b>, and pixel information may be transmitted via the second link <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may be capable of performing multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communication. In such a case, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> include a plurality of antennas each, and one of the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> transmits different signals from the respective antennas using the same frequency channel The receiving apparatus simultaneously receives all the signals arriving from a plurality of streams using the plurality of antennas, separates the signals of the respective streams, and decodes the separated signals. By performing the MIMO communication, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> can thus communicate a greater amount of data in the same period of time than that when the MIMO communication is not performed. The communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may perform the MIMO communication using some of the links during the multi-link communication.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With the links of the multi-link communication established, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment each store information about operation of the links. Examples of the information about the operation of the links include the number of spatial streams used in the MIMO communication and communication bandwidths. Such operation-related parameters are determined when the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> establish the links, and can be changed after the links are established. For example, if frequency channels adjoining the frequency channel used by an intended link get congested, the bandwidth can be changed to be narrower. As another example, if the frequency channel used by the link is getting congested, the MIMO communication in operation can be ended. When the operation parameters of the multi-link communication are thus changed, the communication apparatus <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> desirably share new operation parameters quickly. The communication apparatus <b>102</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment transmits new operation-related information to the communication apparatus <b>103</b> via a link different from the one to change the operation parameters of, whereby the new operation-related information can be more quickly shared with the communication apparatus <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">While the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> are described to support the IEEE 802.11be standard, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may support at least one of legacy standards that are standards preceding the IEEE 802.11be standard in addition to the IEEE 802.11be standard. The legacy standards refer to the IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax standards. In the present exemplary embodiment, at least one of the IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be standards is referred to as IEEE 802.11 series standard. In addition to the IEEE 802.11 series standard(s), the communication apparatuses <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may support other communication standards. Examples thereof include Bluetooth&#xae;, Near Field Communication (NFC), Ultra Wide Band (UWB), Zigbee, and Multi Band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) Alliance (MBOA). UWB includes Wireless Universal Serial Bus (USB), Wireless 1394, and WiNet. Wired communication standards such as a wired local area network (LAN) may also be supported.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Specific examples of the communication apparatus <b>102</b> include a wireless LAN router and a personal computer (PC). However, the communication apparatus <b>102</b> is not limited thereto. The communication apparatus <b>102</b> can be any communication apparatus that can perform the multi-link communication with another communication apparatus. The communication apparatus <b>102</b> can be an information processing apparatus capable of performing wireless communication compliant with the IEEE 802.11be standard, such as a wireless chip. Specific examples of the communication apparatus <b>103</b> include a camera, a tablet, a smartphone, a PC, a mobile phone, and a video camera.
