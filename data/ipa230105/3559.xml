The mounting member <b>30</b> is mounted by being co-fastened by a fastening device <b>2</b> for mounting the ball screw <b>10</b> to the equipment <b>1</b>, and the sensor <b>20</b> is mounted to the mounting member <b>30</b> by a sensor mounting device <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The sensor <b>20</b> includes an enclosure for housing a sensor board, a shielded cable connected to the sensor board, and a cable bush that is mounted to one end of the shielded cable and fixedly holds the shielded cable in the enclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The enclosure is preferably constituted in a divided manner of a divided body consisting of an upper case and a lower case, and the upper case and the lower case are preferably formed of metal such as an aluminum alloy. With the upper case and the lower case, a sensor board housing portion for housing a sensor board is formed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the ball screw <b>10</b> to which the mounting member <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment is mounted has a screw shaft <b>11</b> as a shaft member which extends in a longitudinal direction and in which a spiral ball rolling groove <b>13</b> is formed, a nut member <b>12</b> as a moving member in which a load rolling groove <b>14</b> corresponding to the ball rolling groove <b>13</b> is formed, and a return pipe <b>15</b> fixed to the nut member <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The nut member <b>12</b> is mounted to be axially movable with respect to the screw shaft <b>11</b> via balls <b>16</b> that roll between the ball rolling groove <b>13</b> and the load rolling groove <b>14</b>. The nut member <b>12</b> has a flange <b>17</b> extended radially on the axial end face, and fastening holes <b>18</b> are formed at predetermined intervals in the flange <b>17</b>. Note that in the nut member <b>12</b> of the ball screw <b>10</b> to which the mounting member <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment is mounted, three fastening holes <b>18</b> are formed on each side of the flange <b>17</b> and symmetrically with respect to the central axis of the screw shaft <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The return pipe <b>15</b> is fixed to the nut member <b>12</b> so as to jump over the ball rolling groove <b>13</b> of the screw shaft <b>11</b> by several turns, and the ball <b>16</b> which is scooped up from the ball rolling groove <b>13</b> of the screw shaft <b>11</b> by the end portion of such a return pipe <b>15</b> is configured to be sent through the return pipe <b>15</b> to the ball rolling groove <b>13</b> located several turns before, which causes the ball <b>16</b> to infinitely circulate in the nut member <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The return pipe <b>15</b> is preferably constituted by combining a pair of pipe half-bodies formed to have a substantially semicircular cross-sectional shape, and it is further preferable if each pipe half-body is produced by injection molding of a synthetic resin. Further, it is also preferable if, while a concave groove that serves as a ball return passage is formed in each pipe half-body, a guide groove that guides a retainer for holding a plurality of balls <b>16</b> is formed in this concave groove. As an infinite circulation method, a method using a return pipe has been described, but the infinite circulation method is not limited to the return pipe, and various circulation methods can be adopted, for example, the end plate mounted to the axial end portion of the nut member <b>12</b> may have a circulation structure, or a scheme in which the balls <b>16</b> are returned by a predetermined number of turns using a deflector may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, the mounting member <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment will be described. The mounting member <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment is formed to correspond to one side of the flange <b>17</b> of the nut member <b>12</b>, and is formed with fixing portions <b>31</b> which are configured to correspond to the fastening holes <b>18</b>, and a sensor mounting portion <b>32</b> in which sensor mounting holes <b>33</b> for mounting the sensor <b>20</b> are formed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the fixing portion <b>31</b> is formed to correspond to the upper and lower fastening holes <b>18</b> out of the three fastening holes <b>18</b> of the nut member <b>12</b>, and on the surface facing the nut member <b>12</b> of the sensor mounting portion <b>32</b>, a relief portion <b>34</b> that prevents contact with the fastening device <b>2</b> to be fastened to the fastening hole <b>18</b> at the center is formed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, by forming a fixing portion <b>31</b> corresponding to two or more fastening holes <b>18</b> that are not adjacent to each other, it is possible to mount the sensor <b>20</b> without removing the other fastening device <b>2</b> even when the fastening device <b>2</b> is removed from the equipment <b>1</b>, so that positional deviation of the nut member <b>12</b> is unlikely to occur, thus allowing the mounting accuracy to be maintained. Further, by forming a fixing portion <b>31</b> and a relief portion <b>34</b> in this way, it becomes possible to secure the mounting surface of the sensor <b>20</b> and maintain the sensor sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sensor mounting portion <b>32</b> is formed such that the mounting surface of the sensor <b>20</b> is flat in order to maintain the sensitivity of the sensor <b>20</b> to be mounted. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a thickness T of the sensor mounting portion <b>32</b> is preferably formed to be thick to ensure the sensor sensitivity. However, if the sensor mounting portion <b>32</b> is too thick, the stroke amount of the nut member <b>12</b> decreases, and therefore in order that both the sensor sensitivity and the stroke amount are concurrently secured, the thickness T of the sensor mounting portion <b>32</b> is preferably configured to be substantially 1.2 times the thickness of the sensor <b>20</b> to be mounted, and more preferably configured to be substantially 1.5 times the thickness of the sensor <b>20</b> to be mounted.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, when the cap member <b>19</b> or the like is protrudingly mounted to the axial end face of the nut member <b>12</b>, it is preferable that an interference prevention groove <b>35</b> that prevents interference with the cap member <b>19</b> is formed. The shape of such an interference prevention groove <b>35</b> can be appropriately changed according to the shape of the cap member <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next, the mounting procedure of the mounting member <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. First, the sensor <b>20</b> is mounted to the mounting member <b>30</b> by fastening the sensor mounting device <b>21</b> to the sensor mounting hole <b>33</b> formed in the sensor mounting portion <b>32</b>. Thereafter, the fastening device <b>2</b> that performs co-fastening to mount the mounting member <b>30</b> is removed from the ball screw <b>10</b> mounted to the equipment <b>1</b> via the fastening device <b>2</b>. At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, it is preferable to remove the fastening device <b>2</b> from two of the upper and lower fastening holes <b>18</b> that are not adjacent to each other among the three fastening holes <b>18</b> formed on one side.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, the mounting member <b>30</b> is mounted to the flange <b>17</b> of the nut member <b>12</b>, and the fastening device <b>2</b> is inserted through the fixing portion <b>31</b> to be co-fastened with the nut member <b>12</b>. At this time, the fastening device <b>2</b> may use the removed fastening device <b>2</b> as it is, or may use a fastening device that is longer than the removed fastening device <b>2</b> by a thickness of the fixing portion <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At this time, the fastening device <b>2</b> fastened to the fastening hole <b>18</b> located between the fastening holes <b>18</b> corresponding to the fixing portions <b>31</b> is mounted so as to be straddled by the relief portion <b>34</b> of the mounting member <b>30</b> so that interference between the fastening device <b>2</b> and the mounting member <b>30</b> is prevented.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, since the sensor <b>20</b> can be mounted together with the mounting member <b>30</b> to the nut member <b>12</b> after the sensor <b>20</b> is mounted to the mounting member <b>30</b>, the sensor <b>20</b> can be mounted without compromising workability.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, since the fixing portion <b>31</b> is formed at two positions and the fastening device <b>2</b> located between the fixing portions <b>31</b> is configured to be straddled by the relief portion <b>34</b>, the removal of the fastening device <b>2</b> associated with mounting of the sensor <b>20</b> can be performed only by two of the fastening devices <b>2</b> corresponding to the fixing portions <b>31</b>, and the other fastening device <b>2</b> can be kept fastened to the equipment <b>1</b>, it becomes possible to mount the sensor <b>20</b> to the nut member <b>12</b> without occurrence of positional deviation in the nut member <b>12</b> associated with the removal of the fastening device <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, since the fastening hole <b>18</b> used for co-fastening can share a fastening hole <b>18</b> for fastening the nut member <b>12</b> to the equipment <b>1</b>, it becomes possible to mount the sensor <b>20</b> to the ball screw <b>10</b> while it is mounted to the equipment <b>1</b> without performing post-processing such as tapping.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the above described embodiment, the case where a ball screw was used as a motion guidance apparatus has been described, but the motion guidance apparatus may adopt, without being limited to the ball screw, for example, a ball spline in which a spline axis is used for the shaft member and which includes a moving member movable along the spline axis. Moreover, in the above described embodiment, description has been made on a case where three on each side, and a total of six fastening holes <b>18</b> are formed in the nut member <b>12</b>, but the number of fastening holes is not limited to this, but can be appropriately changed to, for example, 4, 8, and the like.
