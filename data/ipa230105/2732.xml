The binding of PD-L1 to its receptor PD-1 dampens T cell activation, decreases proliferation and cytotoxicity, and induces apoptosis. The immuno-regulatory property of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) is enhanced upon increased expression of PD-L1. PD-L1 has been described in cancer immunotherapy for its role in blocking T cell activation and proliferation. More specifically, PD-L1 is capable of preventing T cell activation through competition for costimulatory molecules on the T cell (e.g. B7-1 and/or B7-2) and through direct engagement of PD1 on the T cell. Therefore, PD-L1 is capable of regulating T-cell activation in a cell contact dependent fashion. Moreover, the therapeutic potential of HSPC-based immunotherapies appears to be limited by the inherently low expression levels of PD-L1.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While increased levels of PD-L1 on HSPCs have been observed after culturing ex vivo, prolonged culture periods can result in replicative stress, stochastic cellular defects, and chromosomal abnormalities.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">IDO-1 (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) is an enzyme which catalyzes the degradation of the essential amino acid tryptophan (TRP). The depletion of tryptophan in the microenvironment halts T-cell proliferation, induces TH1 cell apoptosis, and activates regulatory T cells. This method of immune suppression is also naturally used by many other immunosuppressive cells, and is also used by many tumors to escape immune-activation. Although IDO enzymes are intracellular and not secreted, the metabolic effects of IDO-1 initially provide local effect, as neighboring cells respond to the reduced access to TRP. However, as the microenvironment is depleted of TRP, cells in proximity, but not in contact with the IDO-1 expressing cell are affected. Thus, in an autoimmune situation IDO-1 prevents T cell activation and proliferation by depleting TRP from the inflammatory microenvironment, and activates regulatory T cell suppression of the immune response. Expression of IDO-1 is very low in hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells under normal conditions. Thus, modulation of IDO-1 levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells provides an opportunity to affect the immuno-regulatory properties of those cells, and upon administration, the immunological properties of patients' cells.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, what is needed in the art is a method for producing HSPCs having increased PD-L1 and/or IDO-1 expression without exposing the cells to the stress of in vitro processes and prolonged cell culture.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention addresses these limitations through the identification of a number of molecules or compounds which, in a short-term incubation, independently or in combination, pharmacologically up- regulate PD-L1 and/or IDO-1 expression on cells, including HSPCs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure provides compositions and methods to modulate the immune system through the immuno-regulatory properties of cells expressing increased levels of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1).

Cells treated ex vivo may be administered to the donor or to a different living subject.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Such ex vivo therapeutic applications may also include an optional in vivo treatment or procedural step, such as by administering cells with therapeutic potential one or more times to a living subject. Both local and systemic administration is contemplated for these embodiments, according to well-known techniques in the art and as described elsewhere herein. The amount of therapeutic cells administered to a subject will depend on the characteristics of that subject, such as general health, age, sex, body weight, and tolerance to drugs, as well as the degree, severity, and type of reaction to the drug and/or cell transplant.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As used herein, the term &#x201c;incubating&#x201d; is used to describe a specific step or steps by which cells or populations of cells are manipulated. Incubation steps may include specific temperatures, agents, or conditions which modulate the cell or populations of cells.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">As used herein, the term &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; is used interchangeably with the term &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; refer to a substance coming from some source other than its native source. For example, the terms &#x201c;exogenous protein,&#x201d; or &#x201c;exogenous cell&#x201d; refer to a protein or cell from a non-native source or location, and that have been artificially supplied to a biological system. In contrast, the terms &#x201c;endogenous protein,&#x201d; or &#x201c;endogenous cell&#x201d; refer to a protein or cell that are native to the biological system, species or individual.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The phrase &#x201c;stem cell&#x201d; as used herein refers to a cell which is an undifferentiated cell capable of (1) long term self-renewal, or the ability to generate at least one identical copy of the original cell, (2) differentiation at the single cell level into multiple, and in some instance only one, specialized cell type and (3) of in vivo functional regeneration of tissues. Stem cells are subclassified according to their developmental potential as totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent and oligo/unipotent. A &#x201c;progenitor cell&#x201d; also has the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into more mature cells, but is committed to a lineage (e.g., hematopoietic progenitors are committed to the blood lineage; myeloid progenitors are committed to the myeloid lineage; lymphoid progenitors are committed to the lymphoid lineage), whereas stem cells are not necessarily so limited. &#x201c;Self-renewal&#x201d; refers a cell with a unique capacity to produce unaltered daughter cells and therefore replenish and maintain its population numbers, and to generate specialized cell types (potency). Self-renewal can be achieved in two ways. Asymmetric cell division produces one daughter cell that is identical to the parental cell and one daughter cell that is different from the parental cell and is a more committed progenitor or differentiated cell. Symmetric cell division produces two identical daughter cells. &#x201c;Proliferation&#x201d; or &#x201c;expansion&#x201d; of cells refers to symmetrically dividing cells.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">As used herein, the term &#x201c;progenitor&#x201d; or &#x201c;progenitor cells&#x201d; refers to cells that have the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into more mature cells. Progenitor cells have a reduced potency compared to pluripotent and multipotent stem cells. Many progenitor cells differentiate along a single lineage, but may also have quite extensive proliferative capacity.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As used herein, the term &#x201c;hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell&#x201d; or &#x201c;HSPC&#x201d; refers to a cell identified by the presence of the antigenic marker CD34 (CD34+) and are therefore characterized as CD34+ cells, and populations of such cells. In particular embodiments, the term &#x201c;HSPC&#x201d; refers to a cell identified by the presence of the antigenic marker CD34 (CD34+) and the absence of lineage (Lin) markers and are therefore characterized as CD34+/Lin(&#x2212;) cells, and populations of such cells. It is recognized that the population of cells comprising CD34+ and/or Lin(&#x2212;) cells also includes hematopoietic progenitor cells. The term &#x201c;hematopoietic cell&#x201d; refers to a continuum of cells ranging from a HSPC, to a fully differentiated blood cell, including all the cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">As used herein, the term &#x201c;induced pluripotent stem cells&#x201d; or, iPSCs, means that the stem cells are produced from differentiated adult, neonatal or fetal cells that have been induced or changed, i.e., reprogrammed into cells capable of differentiating into tissues of all three germ or dermal layers: mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm.

No. 13/257,290 (US 20120202288), which is herein incorporated in full by reference. HSPCs for use with the invention may also be derived from a clonal cell line.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">Hematopoietic cells described herein, whether obtained from cord blood, bone marrow, peripheral blood, or other source, can be grown, treated or expanded in any suitable, commercially available or custom defined medium, with or without serum, as desired (see, e.g., Hartshorn et al., Cell Technology for Cell Products, pages 221-224, R. Smith, Editor; Springer Netherlands, 2007, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). For instance, in certain embodiments, serum free medium can utilize albumin and/or transferrin, which can be useful for the growth and expansion of, for example, CD34+ cells in serum free medium. Cytokines can be included, such as, but not limited to, Flt-3 ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), thrombopoietin (TPO), and IL-6, among others. Hematopoietic cells (for instance HSPCs) can be grown in vessels such as bioreactors (see, e.g., Liu et al., Journal of Biotechnology 124:592-601, 2006, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). A suitable medium for ex-vivo expansion of HSPCs can include HSPC supporting cells, such as stromal cells (e.g., lymphoreticular stromal cells). Stromal cells can be derived, for instance, from the disaggregation of lymphoid tissue. Stromal cells can support the in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo maintenance, growth, and differentiation of HSPCs, as well as their progeny.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">When transplanted into irradiated humans, hematopoietic cells described herein (e.g., modulated hematopoietic cells) can repopulate the erythroid, neutrophil-macrophage, megakaryocyte, and lymphoid hematopoietic cell pool. HSPCs described herein can be identified according to certain phenotypic or genotypic markers. For example, HSPCs can be identified by their small size, lack of lineage (lin) markers, low staining (side population) with vital dyes such as rhodamine 123 (rhodamine<sup>DULL</sup>, also called rho<sup>lo</sup>) or Hoechst 33342, and by the presence of various antigenic markers on their surface, many of which belong to the cluster of differentiation series (e.g., CD34, CD38, CD90, CD133, CD105, and c-kit, the receptor for stem cell factor). In some aspects, HSPCs are CD34+ cells. HSPCs described herein can be considered negative for the markers that are typically used to detect lineage commitment, and, thus, are often referred to as Lin(&#x2212;) cells. Most human HSPCs (e.g. hHSPCs) can be characterized as CD34+, CD59+, Thy1/CD90+, CD38101&#x2212;, C-kit/CD117+, and Lin(&#x2212;). However, not all stem cells are covered by these combinations, as certain HSPCs are CD34&#x2212;/CD38&#x2212;. Also some studies suggest that earliest stem cells can lack c-kit on the cell surface. For HSPCs, CD133 can represent an early marker. CD34+ and CD34&#x2212;HSPCs in certain instances have been shown to be CD133+. CD34+ and Lin(&#x2212;) cells can also include hematopoietic progenitor cells.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The cells described herein can be HLA typed and can be matched or partially matched to a specific subject for the administration. Alternatively, the cells may be unmatched to a specific subject for administration. HLA-type refers to the unique set of proteins called human leukocyte antigens. These proteins are present on each individual's cells and allow the immune system to recognize &#x2018;self from &#x2018;foreign&#x2019;. Administration of cells or tissues that are recognized as foreign can lead to compatibility problems including, for example, immunorejection or graft versus host disease (GVHD). There are six major HLAs (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DR, HLADP, and HLA-DQ). Each HLA antigen has multiple isoforms in the human population, and each individual can have two different isoforms for each HLA due to the diploid nature of our genome. Therefore, a complete match would match twelve out of twelve isoforms. A cell or tissue donated from the same individual as, or an identical twin of, the intended recipient would have a perfect HLA-type and is referred to as syngeneic or autologous. It is also understood that certain factors including but not limited to ethnic background and race correlate with certain HLA-types.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Many major and minor HLA isoforms exist and it is understood that a suitable match can include a match between a subset of the major HLAs, all the major HLAs, some or all major and minor HLAs or any combination known to the art that mitigates immuno-rejection or GVHD. It is also understood that specific guidelines for what constitutes a good HLA-type match depends on many factors. Therefore, judgment must be made by one skilled in the art to assess the suitability of a given cell or tissue sample for transplant into a given individual.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">HLA type can be determined using methods known in the art, including for example low resolution methods, such as by sero-typing, or using antibody based methods. Sero-typing is based on antibody recognition of HLA types. Sero-typing can distinguish between 28 different HLA-A genes, 59 HLA-B genes and 21 HLA-C genes. A perfect match by sero-typing methods would be a six out of six match referring to the two alleles for each HLA (A, B, and C) present in each individual. In certain instances, a five out of six match or less can be considered a good match as determined by one skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Other low or medium resolution methods to determine HLA type examine the HLA isoforms of the individual, but do not rely on determining the actual sequence of an individual's HLA alleles. Often, the donor is related to the individual receiving the sample and in such instances, sero-typing alone or in combination with other low or medium resolution methods can be sufficient to determine if a sample is suitable for administration. In instances where a donor is not related to the recipient, HLA type can be a five out of six or lower match. In such instances it can be useful to use cells or tissues with a lower match rather than expend time and effort to find a better HLA type match.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">High resolution methods involve examining the specific sequence of the HLA genes or gene expression products (protein or RNA). High resolution methods can distinguish between thousands of different isoforms. HLA typing of the HSPCs and enhanced-HSPCs can be performed for six HLA loci, HLA-A, -B, and -DR, for example, at low resolution/split antigen level.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">DNA-based testing methods can be utilized for HLA-DR typing. DNA-based testing can be used for HLA-A and -B. Transplant center guidelines for typing of subject, family and to confirm the HLA types of potential unrelated donors include, typing HLA-A, B, and -DR loci using primarily DNA-based testing methods at allele level resolution for DRBI and low resolution/split antigen level for HLA-A and -B. The typing of a subject and the selected donor can be performed using the same set of reagents, methodology, and interpretation criteria with fresh tissue samples to ensure HLA identity. Quality assurance and quality control for HLA testing are complied with.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">Accordingly, compositions used in the methods described herein can include haplotyped enhanced-HSPCs. The enhanced-HSPCs can be HLA typed based on HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. The enhanced-HSPCs can be HLA typed based on a matched HLA group with a specific human subject. The HLA haplotyped enhanced-HSPCs can include 6 out of 6 HLA matches with a specific human subject. The HLA haplotyped enhanced-HSPCs can include 5 out of 6 HLA matches with a specific human subject. The HLA haplotyped enhanced-HSPCs can include 4 out of 6 HLA matches with a specific human subject. HLA matching can be based on alleles or antigens, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">Percentages of Cells by Type in Population of Cells</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">The methods and compositions described herein can include a plurality of cells (e.g., a cell population) that is about 0.1% to about 1%, about 1% to about 3%, about 3% to about 5%, about 10% to about 15%, about 15%-20%, about 20%-25%, about 25%-30%, about 30%-35%, about 35%-40%, about 40%-45%, about 45%-50%, about 60%-70%, about 70%-80%, about 80%-90%, about 90%-95%, or about 95% to about 100% HSPCs.

A subsequent step can be performed to further purify the population of cells. The subsequent step includes a substrate labeled with antibodies that binds to the CD34+ antigen.

In one aspect, the patient receiving the modulated cells has not received a transplant. In one aspect, the patient receiving the modulated cells is not a candidate for hematopoietic transplant to reconstitute the hematopoietic compartment. In one non-limiting embodiment, modulated cells are administered to a subject that has received no conditioning prior to administration of the cells. &#x201c;Conditioning&#x201d; as used herein is meant to convey treatment typically administered prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Typically such conditioning is performed with radio- or chemo-therapies. In one aspect, the modulated cells are administered to a subject who has not had high-dose (myeloablative) conditioning. In another aspect, the modulated cells are administered to a patient who has not had either high-dose or reduced-intensity conditioning. In yet another aspect, the modulated cells are administered to a patient who has not had any of high-dose, reduced-intensity, or nonmyeloablative conditioning.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In another embodiment, the modulated cells also find use in treating immunological disorders that arise from transplantation therapy, such as graft-versus-host disease and transplant rejection, for example. Thus, modulated cells may be used to treat graft versus host disease or transplant rejection that results from a bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, or cell therapy (e.g. any composition comprising isolated stem cells). Transplants in the context of cell therapy, include, but are not limited to, the administration of genetically engineered cells that have been modified to produce a desired protein or polynucleotide in a subject. In aspects of the invention, modulated cells are administered to the subject before or at the time of transplantation so as to prevent graft-versus- host disease and/or transplant rejection. Without being limited to any particular theory or mechanism, treating a subject with modulated cells prior to or at the time of transplantation dampens the immunological response in the transplant recipient and improves transplant acceptance and engraftment.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">In one non-limiting embodiment, modulated cells are administered to a subject that has received a bone marrow transplant (or cell therapy), wherein the transplant is directed to hematopoietic engraftment or reconstitution.

Such disorders include neutropenias, anemias, thrombocytopenia, and immune dysfunction.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Administration of an &#x201c;amount&#x201d; of modulated cells to a subject refers to administration of &#x201c;an amount effective,&#x201d; to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result, including without limitation, treatment of the subject. A &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; of cells for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations as are known in the art, and may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the cells to elicit a desired response in the individual. The term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; includes an amount that is effective to &#x201c;treat&#x201d; a subject (e.g., a patient).
