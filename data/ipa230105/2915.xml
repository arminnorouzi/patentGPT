The optical power density of the xenon lamp was 450 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the spot diameter was 5 cm (equivalent to an optical power of 8.8 W). Other than that, there were no other light sources.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0197">During electrolysis, it was found that after applying a constant voltage (15V) for 5 minutes, the electrolyte solution showed a light yellow color, indicating that graphene oxide had been formed. After the electrolysis, a solid powder was filtered and collected from the electrolyte solution, the collected solid powder was dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide under ultrasonic, then a solid was filtered and collected, which was the graphene oxide material.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Examples 1.2&#x2dc;1.8</heading><p id="p-0200" num="0198">Examples 1.2 to 1.8 differed from Example 1.1 in the parameter differences, and the specific differences were shown in the following table:</p><p id="p-0201" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Example No.</entry><entry>1.1</entry><entry>1.2</entry><entry>1.3</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>1.5</entry><entry>1.6</entry><entry>1.7</entry><entry>1.8</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Constant</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>15</entry></row><row><entry>voltage/V</entry></row><row><entry>Oxalic acid</entry><entry>0.1</entry><entry>0.1</entry><entry>0.01</entry><entry>0.05</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>0.1</entry><entry>0.1</entry><entry>0.1</entry></row><row><entry>concentration/</entry></row><row><entry>M</entry></row><row><entry>Time/hour</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>7</entry><entry>9</entry></row><row><entry>Yield/g</entry><entry>2.5</entry><entry>1.2</entry><entry>0.7</entry><entry>1.1</entry><entry>2.0</entry><entry>1.4</entry><entry>3.7</entry><entry>4.1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Examples 2.1&#x2dc;2.5</heading><p id="p-0202" num="0199">Examples 2.1 to 2.5 differed from Example 1.1 in some parameter differences, which were shown in the following table for details.
