id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to baking pans for baking cakes and more specifically to a baking pan for baking tilted cakes which are used to construct multi-layer whimsical or mad hatter cakes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Tilted cakes, sometimes referred to as whimsical cakes or mad hatter cakes, are well-known in the cake and cake decorating industry. Such cakes are generally constructed by baking a typical round cake having the desired diameter and height and after the cake has appropriately cooled, preferably after freezing the cake to make it more solid, the cake is sliced at an angle to remove the top section thereof and thus provide a tilted cake. Various additional round cakes of smaller diameters are also baked frozen and also sliced in this matter to provide a plurality of layers all having a tilt to them. Such layers are then assembled one on top of the other typically by cutting a section from the bottom layer to provide a flat surface to receive the next tilted cake layer and then inserting it in place. This process is continued until the cake is appropriately assembled. Thereafter, the cake is decorated in the manner desired to provide the desired appearance.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An alternative method of providing a tilted cake to then be assembled in such layers is to utilize a plurality of flat cakes of varying diameters and heights and then to provide a filling that will remain stiff and hold its form around the outer edge of the bottom layer and then place additional half rings on top of the first tapering off at the ends and building the half rings to a desired height and then placing the next layer after filling in the thus formed reservoir with a desired filling such as a cream or the like to support the top layer. This process is repeated to provide the desired height and differences in diameters for the desired appearance for the whimsical cake.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In all of these instances, it has been found necessary that the cake be very cold even frozen so that it does not break during the cutting and assembling process. Obviously, all of this procedure, irrespective of the type that is utilized, is very time consuming and tedious thus making such cakes extremely expensive if they are manufactured by a commercial bakery. Alternatively, if they are manufactured by an individual at home, an inordinate amount of time is taken to accomplish the task. There therefore exists the need for providing the building blocks for making a tilted or whimsical or mad hatter cake which eliminates the slicing and cutting process and enables more effective and efficient assembly of the various layers of the cake.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A baking pan for baking a tilted cake which includes a pan having a sidewall and an upper open rim defining a first plane, a lower enclosed bottom defining a second plane, the second plane is disposed at an angle relative to the first plane thereby causing the side wall of the pan to be shorter on one side as compared to the other, and a means for supporting the pan in a baking oven at a position so that the first plane remains parallel to the surface upon which the pan rests during baking.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a baking pan for a tilted cake constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the baking pan as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a rear view of the baking pan as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of a support member for receiving a pan constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side view of the structure as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring now more specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b></figref> thru <b>3</b>, the baking pan <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention includes a side wall <b>12</b>, the upper portion of which terminates an upper open rim <b>14</b> and a bottom wall <b>16</b>. The rim <b>14</b> defines a first plane <b>18</b> and the bottom wall <b>16</b> defines a second plane <b>20</b>. The plane <b>20</b> is angularly disposed with respect to the plane <b>18</b> so that the side wall <b>12</b> of the pan <b>10</b> is substantially shorter as shown at <b>22</b> as compared to the opposite side <b>24</b>. The planes <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> intersect at an acute angle <b>21</b>, which can vary depending on the slope of the plane <b>20</b> Through this construction, a cake which is baked by depositing dough internally of the pan <b>10</b> will, when removed from the pan <b>10</b>, have a tilted surface as defined by the plane <b>20</b>. As a result, there would be no necessity for having to freeze the cake and then slice a portion thereof to provided the tilted section since such would have been provided by the configuration of the pan <b>10</b>. It would be recognized by those skilled in the art that a plurality of pans having varying diameters and heights could be utilized to thus produce a plurality of layers for the whimsical or mad hatter cake with each of the layers having a different diameter and a different tilt. It should also be recognized that even though an embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>3</b></figref> shows a circular pan that any particularly geometric configuration can be utilized that is desired to form a whimsical cake. For example, a pan could be square in shape or oblong in shape and as above indicated may have varying dimensions to provide the sizes of the layers for the whimsical cake.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As is illustrated more specifically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the pan <b>10</b> is placed within an oven to bake the cake, it will rest upon a surface as schematically illustrated at <b>26</b>. It is important that the upper portion or rim <b>14</b> of the pan be disposed within the oven so that the plane <b>18</b> is substantially parallel with the surface <b>26</b>. To accomplish this, since the bottom of the pan <b>16</b> is tilted at an angle to establish the plane <b>20</b>, there is provided a means for causing the pan to be disposed such that the plane <b>18</b> remains substantially parallel to the surface <b>26</b>. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a stand <b>28</b> which is affixed at its upper end <b>29</b> to the outwardly directed flange <b>30</b> on the rim <b>14</b> by appropriate fasteners such as rivets <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. A foot <b>36</b> is directed inwardly from the bottom end <b>31</b> of the upstanding arm <b>38</b> to support the pan in the position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> on the surface <b>26</b>. Obviously, the stand <b>28</b> may be affixed to the flange <b>30</b> in other ways than by the rivets <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> such for example as by welding the same thereto or alternatively welding the arm <b>38</b> to the external surface of the wall <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As an alternative structure to maintain the plane <b>18</b> substantially parallel to the oven surface <b>26</b>, a pair of legs, one of which is shown by dotted lines <b>37</b> may be affixed to the outside bottom edge and spaced apart substantially equivalent from the center of the pan. The end <b>39</b> of the leg <b>37</b> would rest on the surface <b>26</b> and the end <b>41</b> of the bottom <b>16</b> of the pan would rest on the surface <b>26</b>. Thus, there would be provided three spaced apart supports for the pan <b>10</b> to maintain it in the desired position during baking.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the pan without the stand <b>28</b> may be placed upon a support member <b>40</b> which is a frame constructed of a plurality of inter connected wire <b>43</b> or mesh to thus provide a flat surface <b>42</b> which would rest upon the surface <b>26</b> of the oven. The support member also defines a slanted surface <b>45</b> for receiving the bottom of the pan <b>10</b>. The slanted surface <b>45</b> is at an angle with respect to the oven surface <b>26</b> which is substantially the same as the angle of the second plane <b>20</b>. The pan without the stand <b>28</b> would then be placed so that the larger side <b>24</b> would rest against a lip <b>44</b> formed at the bottom of the member <b>40</b> thus causing the upper surface forming the plane <b>18</b> to be disposed within the oven so that the plane <b>18</b> is substantially parallel to the surface <b>26</b> within the cover. This structure, obviously, provides two different pieces which are disposed within the oven to support the pan to produce the desired cake.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">There has thus been disclosed a baking pan for producing a tilted cake which is simple, easy to utilize and produces a desired tilted cake while eliminating the intensive labor required to freeze and cut the cake to provide the desired layers for a whimsical or mad hatter type cake.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
