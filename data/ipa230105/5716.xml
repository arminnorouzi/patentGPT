The system includes a primary RF generator configured to generate a primary RF signal at a first frequency range. The system further includes a secondary RF generator configured to generate a secondary RF signal at a second frequency range. The system includes an impedance matching circuit coupled to the primary RF generator via a first RF cable and coupled to the secondary RF generator via a second RF cable.

For example, by achieving the shrinkage in the bow, the mask selectivity is increased by approximately 15% to 20% compared to mask selectivity achieved using two-state pulsing.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additional advantages of the herein described systems and methods for multi-state pulsing include achieving the balance between bow control and mask selectivity. By pulsing each of the low frequency RF generator and the high frequency RF generator in three-states, the balance is achieved. For example, the low frequency RF generator is pulsed at a much greater power level compared to a power level of the high frequency RF generator during a first state. The high frequency RF generator is pulsed at a greater power level compared to a power level of the low frequency RF generator during a second state. The low and high frequency RF generators have a power level of approximately zero during the third state. By pulsing the low and high frequency RF generators in such a manner, the balance is achieved. Achieving the balance facilitates etching substrate features with a high aspect ratio.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Other aspects will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in

For example, because of the substantially equal passivation of the passivation layer <b>724</b>, a bow is not formed on sidewalls of the features of the silicon nitride layer <b>704</b>. As an example, a passivation layer is a layer that is deposited on or around another layer when the modified RF signal <b>124</b> is applied to the substrate S.

During the first state of the two-state pulsing, there is high mask selectivity, a high level of passivation of the feature <b>702</b>B, and negligible or minimal passivation of the feature <b>704</b>B. Also, during the first state, because of the high level of passivation of the feature <b>702</b>B and because of the negligible or minimal passivation of the feature <b>704</b>B, a bow is created in the feature <b>704</b>B. The bow is undesirable. Moreover, in the second state of the two-state pulsing, there is lower mask selectivity compared to the first state, a high level of passivation of the feature <b>704</b>B, and minimal or negligible passivation of the feature <b>702</b>B. As such, during the two-state pulsing, there is a lack of balance between passivation of the feature <b>702</b>B and passivation of the feature <b>704</b>B and the bow is created. The lack of balance occurs because there is a comparatively high amount of passivation of the feature <b>702</b>B compared to the feature <b>704</b>B during the first state and a comparatively high amount of passivation of the feature <b>704</b>B compared to the feature <b>704</b>A during the second state.
