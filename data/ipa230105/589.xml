Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Disclosed herein are methods of pulp capping exposed pulp in a tooth for pulpal revitalization and/or inducing dentin formation or regeneration.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Teeth are composed of dental tissues, which include enamel, dentin, cementum and pulp. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a mammalian tooth <b>10</b> with a protective outer layer of enamel <b>20</b>. Pulp <b>30</b> in the central portion of the tooth <b>10</b> is filled with blood vessels and nerves, which enter through the root canals into the pulp chamber <b>32</b>, where there is the pulp chamber floor <b>33</b> and the pulp chamber roof, which typically has sites where the pulp extends the base of dentinal structure, which individually are each termed a pulp horn <b>31</b>. Surrounding the pulp <b>30</b> is dentin <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Pulp capping is a dental procedure used to cover pulp of a tooth that has become exposed due to reasons such as tooth decay, trauma, or when removing decay from a tooth. Pulp capping on exposed pulp facilitates the formation of protective barrier and maintenance of the pulp (Komabayashi et al., 2016, <i>Dental Materials Journal </i>35(1):1-12), If undertaken early, that is, before pulp necrosis, pulp capping may help to avoid root canal treatment or tooth extraction. Materials used in pulp capping to cover the exposed pulp have included zinc oxide eugenol, glass ionomer/resin-modified glass ionomer, calcium hydroxide (&#x201c;Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>&#x201d;) and mineral trioxide aggregate (&#x201c;MTA&#x201d;). Certain pulp capping materials have been described, e.g., in U.S. 2008/0318190 A1.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Following pulp capping, a dentin-like structure may form between the pulp capping material and pulp, however with Ca(OH)2 and MTA, however this dentin-like structure has been reported to be porous and/or form an incomplete layer (see, e.g., Al-Hezaimi et al., 2011, <i>J. Endod., </i>37:507-512). Applying biological molecules such as growth factors and extracellular matrices have been used when pulp capping to stimulate tissue regeneration and growth, including, for example, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and enamel matrix derivative (EMD), although results have been variable (see, e.g., Komabayashi et al., 2016, <i>Dental Materials Journal </i>35(1):1-12). EMDOGAIN&#xae; gel (Straumann) is a commercial EMD product containing amelogenins, a type of extracellular matrix protein, which has successfully been employed to restore cementum and alveolar bone. Randomized controlled clinical trials on the use of EMD with permanent filling (without pulp capping material) for direct pulp capping in primary molars and partial pulpotomy in permanent premolars failed to observe dentin regeneration (Garrocho-Rangel et al., 2009, <i>Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol. Oral Radiol. Endod., </i>107:733-738; Kiatwateeratana et al., 2009, <i>Int. Endod. J., </i>42:584-592).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Platelet-derived growth factor (&#x201c;PDGF&#x201d;) is potent mitogen for a variety of cell types. PDGF is a protein dimer which can include two A subunits (&#x201c;PDGF-AA&#x201d;), two B subunits (&#x201c;PDGF-BB&#x201d;) or one of each (&#x201c;PDGF-AB&#x201d;). It has been reported that PDGF-BB plays a role in periodontal bone and dental tissue regeneration when used in conjunction with bone allograft and PDGF-BB gene modified human dental pulp stem cells, respectively (Nevins et al., 2003, <i>J. Periodontal., </i>74:1282-1292; Zhang et al., 2017, <i>Stem </i>Cells Transl. Med., 6:2126-2134). When recombinant human PDGF was used without a matrix on human dental pulp stem cells insignificant dentinal tissue formation was reported (Zhang et al., 2008, <i>Tissue Eng. Part A, </i>14:285-294; Zhang et al., 2006, <i>Biomaterials, </i>27:5658-5668).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed herein are methods, e.g., of pulp capping and pulp revitalization of an exposed pulp in a tooth comprising administering a growth factor substance (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or enamel matrix derivative (EMD)) to exposed pulp in a tooth, followed by placing a pulp capping material (e.g., mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) or calcium hydroxide) over the exposed pulp.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, disclosed herein are methods of pulp capping exposed pulp in a tooth comprising administering a growth factor substance (e.g., PDGF or EMD) to exposed pulp in a tooth, and placing a pulp capping material (e.g., MTA or calcium hydroxide) over the exposed pulp after administering the growth factor substance (e.g., PDGF or EMD).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the method comprises:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">(a) administering recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF) or enamel matrix derivative (EMD) to exposed pulp in the tooth; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">(b) placing mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) or calcium hydroxide over the exposed pulp following step (a).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">In certain embodiments, rhPDGF is administered in step (a).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">In certain embodiments, the exposed pulp is in a cavity in the tooth, wherein the placed MTA or calcium hydroxide seals the cavity, and the method further comprises step (c) applying a permanent filling over the placed MTA or calcium hydroxide.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">In certain embodiments, the exposed pulp is in a cavity in the tooth and the method further comprises step (c) sealing the cavity with a permanent dental filling following step (b).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">In certain embodiments, the exposed pulp is in a cavity in the tooth and the method further comprises step (c) sealing the cavity containing the placed MTA or calcium hydroxide with a permanent dental filling.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">In certain embodiments, the calcium hydroxide is placed in step (b).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">In certain embodiments, repaired dentin forms between the site of the exposed pulp and the placed calcium hydroxide.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">In certain embodiments, the MTA is placed in step (b).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">In certain embodiments, regenerated dentin forms between the site of the exposed pulp and the placed MTA.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">In certain embodiments, the MTA is placed to be in contact with dentin at the periphery of the site of exposed pulp.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">In certain embodiments, the rhPDGF is rhPDGF-BB.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">In certain embodiments, the MTA is placed over the site of exposed pulp at least 1 minute, at least 2 minutes, at least 3 minutes, at least 4 minutes, at least 5 minutes, or at least 10 minutes after administering step (a).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">Also provided herein are methods of inducing dentin formation over exposed pulp in a cavity of a tooth.

Dentin formation over exposed pulp is advantageous, e.g., for preserving pulp vitality, preventing complete pulp infection, protecting the pulp from noxious agents, and the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">In general, methods provided herein comprise administering a growth factor substance, which can, for example, be platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or enamel matrix derivative (EMD), to exposed pulp, followed by placing a pulp capping material, which can, for example, be mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) or calcium hydroxide, over the exposed pulp.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">In one aspect, provided herein are methods of pulp capping exposed pulp in a tooth.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">In some embodiments, a method of pulp capping exposed pulp in a tooth comprises (a) administering platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or enamel matrix derivative (EMD) to exposed pulp in the tooth; and (b) placing mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) or calcium hydroxide over the exposed pulp following the administration step (a).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">In another aspect, methods of inducing dentin regeneration over exposed pulp in a cavity of a tooth are provided herein.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">In another aspect, methods are provided for revitalizing pulp tissue in a tooth with exposed and/or inflamed pulp.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">In certain embodiments of a method for inducing dentin regeneration over exposed pulp in a tooth, the method comprises: (a) administering EMD or PDGF to the exposed pulp in a cavity of the tooth; (b) placing MTA or calcium hydroxide over the exposed pulp after step (a), wherein the MTA or the calcium hydroxide is in contact with dentin at a periphery of the exposed pulp; (c) sealing the cavity with a permanent dental filling after step (b); whereby dentin is regenerated between the pulp and the MTA or the calcium hydroxide.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">In certain embodiments of a method for inducing dentin regeneration over exposed pulp in a tooth, the method comprises: (a) administering PDGF to the exposed pulp in a cavity of the tooth; (b) placing MTA over the exposed pulp after step (a), wherein the MTA is in contact with dentin at a periphery of the exposed pulp; (c) sealing the cavity with a permanent dental filling after step (b); whereby dentin is regenerated between the pulp and the MTA.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">Those skilled in the art will know that direct pulp capping is used when the pulp is visibly exposed, which can be due to, for example, caries, trauma, or accidental exposure during tooth preparation or caries removal. Indirect pulp capping is generally used in deep cavity preparation that may be in close proximity to the pulp but with no visible pulp exposure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">Unless referred to as &#x201c;indirect pulp capping,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;pulp capping&#x201d; as used herein refers &#x201c;direct pulp capping.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">The terms &#x201c;subject&#x201d; and &#x201c;patient&#x201d; are used herein interchangeably, and will generally be understood to mean a human subject unless denoted otherwise. It will be understood that the methods provided herein are performed on a tooth in a subject. In certain embodiments of the methods provided herein, the subject can be a mammal, such as, e.g., chimpanzee, baboon, gorilla, horse, goat, dog, or pig.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">The term &#x201c;dentin formation,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to newly formed dentin or to newly formed dentin-like structure formed after pulp capping according to the methods provided herein.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">The phrases &#x201c;revitalizing pulp tissue&#x201d; or &#x201c;revitalized pulp tissue&#x201d; as used herein means that a tooth with exposed pulp that exhibits thermal (hot or cold) sensitivity, pain, and/or other indications indicative of pulpitis, returns to a state where the tooth does not exhibit thermal (hot or cold), pain, and/or other indications of pulpitis after pulp capping as described herein.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">It is generally understood in the art that dentin can be classified as primary dentin, which is formed only early in tooth development. Secondary dentin, which formed after root formation is complete, and continues to grow, albeit slowly, in the mature tooth. Secondary dentin is similar to primary dentin although there are noticeable morphological differences between primary and secondary dentin. Tertiary dentin, which includes so-called reactionary dentin, is distinct in structure from primary and secondary dentin, and typically grows only in reaction to external stimuli.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">As used herein, the term &#x201c;regenerated dentin&#x201d; means newly formed dentin that resembles secondary dentin in its morphology or structure when subject to histological analysis.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">As used herein, the term &#x201c;repaired dentin&#x201d; means a dentin-like structure that does not resemble secondary dentin in its morphology or structure when subject to histological analysis.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">Prior to pulp capping, clinical pulp conditions can be evaluated, which can be performed using diagnostic tests known in the art. Pulp capping typically would not be performed on a tooth were pulp necrosis is diagnosed. While normal pulp has no clinical symptoms, pulp with reversible pulpitis usually has a short-lived thermal sensitivity, which will disappear immediately once the thermal stimulation is removed. Irreversible pulpitis can, for example, have spontaneous, and/or lingering pain.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062">In certain embodiments of the methods provided herein, the method is performed on a tooth wherein the pulp is normal pulp, or the pulp has reversible pulpitis.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063">In certain embodiments, the method is performed on a tooth wherein the pulp has irreversible pulpitis.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0064">Typically, pulp capping can be performed where percussion, palpation, and thermal test results confirm vital pulp diagnosis. Radiography should show normal apical tissue.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0065">Techniques for drilling to create a cavity in the tooth are well known in the art, for instance, to allow access to administer growth factor substance (e.g., PDGF or EMD), and placing pulp capping material (e.g., MTA or calcium hydroxide). For instance, the clinician can employ high speed or low speed drills to create an access cavity and/or, for instance, to remove any decayed or infected tissue.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0066">The term &#x201c;access cavity&#x201d; as used herein refers to a space created in the tooth containing exposed pulp in which the growth factor substance (e.g., PDGF or EMD) can be administered and/or in which the pulp capping material (e.g., MTA or calcium hydroxide) can be placed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0067">In certain embodiments, the pulp exposure site is visible and less than 1 mm in diameter.

For instance, bleeding can be stopped by placing a cotton pellet soaked in a solution on the exposed pulp. Solutions that can be administer to the exposed pulp to control bleeding can, for instance, be saline, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, ferric sulfate, and chlorhexidine. Typically, sodium hypochlorite is administered.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0069">In certain embodiments of the methods provided herein, the methods comprise administering PDGF to the exposed pulp in the tooth and placing MTA or calcium hydroxide over the exposed pulp following the administration of the PDGF. In some embodiments, MTA is placed over the exposed pulp following the administration of the PDGF. In yet other embodiments, calcium hydroxide is placed over the exposed pulp following the administration of the PDGF.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0070">In some embodiments the PDGF is PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, or PDGF-AB.

In the study described in this example, pulp capping was performed on premolar teeth in human subjects, and the teeth extracted 4 months after pulp capping for histomorphometric and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analyses.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Material and Methods</heading><p id="p-0107" num="0111">Sources for materials were as follows: Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, DYCAL calcium hydroxide composition (Dentsply Sirona); EMD, EMDOGAIN&#xae; gel (Straumann), rhPDGF, GEM21 (Osteohealth). A randomized clinical trial protocol was followed, which had been approved by the King Saud University Institutional Research Review Board and the in vivo Ethical Committee. Subjects enrolled in the study signed a consent form. Intact premolars scheduled for extraction due to orthodontic reasons were included in this trial. All teeth were tested for symptoms and pulp responses and proved normal. Class I occlusal caries were seen in 17 teeth, and 1 tooth had Class II occlusomesial caries. Eighteen premolars (from eight patients) were randomly assigned, using a brown bag, to one of three experimental groups: Group 1 (CaOH2 only); Group 2 (CaOH2+EMD); or Group 3 (CaOH2+rhPDGF). All patients received phone calls the night of the procedure and at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 1 week postoperatively to record any complaint of symptoms. None of the subjects reported lingering pain or swelling, and no patient was excluded from the study. No patient was excluded from the study or required root canal treatment at any stage of the experiment.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0112">Pulp Exposure. Local infiltration with anesthetic solution of Xylocaine (20 mg/mL; Fresenius) and epinephrine (12.5 mg/mL) was used. Following application of a dental dam, the pulp of each tooth was exposed by creating a 4-mm&#x2014;diameter occlusal Class I access cavity using a size 2 round bur mounted on a highspeed handpiece. Sterile saline solution was used as coolant. Bleeding was controlled with sterile cotton pellets followed by 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) irrigation. Each tooth was then left exposed to the oral cavity for 1 hour to obtain a nonsterile wound. Subsequently, the exposed pulp was irrigated with 2.5% NaOC1 . After arrested bleeding was confirmed, the pulp was capped with one of the three experimental biomaterials. In Groups 2 and 3, a small drop of EMD (30 mg/mL) or GEM21 (0.3 mg/mL), respectively, was placed over the exposure site and left undisturbed for at least 1 minute. CaOH2 was then mixed and carefully placed with gentle pressure over the control site (group 1) or over the the EMD or GEM21 (Groups 2 and 3, respectively) and the adjacent dentin in the exposure site to ensure close contact with the pulp tissue. Amalgam filling was then placed over the pulp-capping material to seal the coronal access cavity.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0113">Periapical radiographs were taken preoperatively, immediately following the procedure, and 4 months later. Under local anesthesia, teeth were atraumatically extracted 4 months after the pulp capping procedure. Clinical tests, including percussion, palpation, electric pulp test, and thermal tests, were done in all teeth prior to extraction. All teeth responded normally.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0114">Micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) Analysis. The extracted teeth were fixated in 10% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde (pH 7.4) and dehydrated in 70% ethanol. Using a scanner (model 1172; SKY SCAN, Bruker), Micro-computed tomography was performed to assess the density, thickness, and continuity of the newly formed hard tissue, as well as the presence of calcifications in the root canal space. Each tooth was wrapped in PARAFILM (Pechiney Plastic Packaging) to prevent desiccation during scanning. Specimens were scanned at 100 kV and 100 mA with a resolution of 18.6 mm, using a 0.5-mm-thick aluminum filter and 54% beam-hardening reduction. After image reconstruction, two-dimensional virtual slices were acquired in the axial plane and examined corono-apically and mesiodisatlly to determine the first and last slices in which reparative hard tissues could be identified. This provided a rough estimate of the thickness of the newly formed hard tissues. Every tenth slice (0.186 mm apart) was used to create a serial profile of the newly formed hard tissues.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0115">Light Microscopy. The teeth were decalcified for 10 weeks using a solution containing equal parts of 50% formic acid and 20% sodium citrate. Following decalcification, the specimens were washed in running water, dehydrated in ascending ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin. Polymerized blocks were primarily grounded to bring the tissue components closer to the cutting surface. A 100-&#x3bc;m-thick section attached to the second slide was cut under 50- to 100-g pressure using diamond blade saw. A final thickness of 40 &#x3bc;m was achieved by grinding and polishing each specimen with 1,200-, 2,400-, and 4,000-grit sandpaper. The sections were then stained with toluidine blue/pyronin.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0116">Histologic analysis was performed using an image analysis system (OMNIMET 9.5, Buehler) linked to a light microscope. Pixel calibration was performed by using a digitized image of a Stage Micrometer for Transmitted Light (Ted Pella, Inc.). Magnifications were between &#xd7;2 and &#xd7;32.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0117">Data Analysis. Histomorphometric and micro-CT analyses were used to assess the presence and pattern of the newly formed hard tissue structure, continuity (mesiodistally and buccolingually), form, thickness, mineralization pattern, density, and organization. The histologic images were correlated with the corresponding micro-CT images. Outcomes from both histologic and micro-CT examinations were classified as either dentin regeneration or dentin repair. Regeneration was defined as restoration of the lost dentin that resembled secondary dentin in form and shape. Repair was defined as newly formed dentin-like structure that did not resemble secondary dentin in form and shape. Data sets were statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and Dunn multiple comparison tests to determine whether differences in the thickness of the reparative hard tissues existed among the three experimental groups. Statistical significance was predetermined at a 95% level of confidence. Thicknesses reported below are an average from teeth within a group.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Results</heading><p id="p-0114" num="0118">Group 1: CaOH2</p><p id="p-0115" num="0119">Evidence of hard tissue apposition was minimal.

The histologic, histomorphometric, and micro-CT analyses showed that all groups produced a dentin-like structure that was different from secondary dentin in form, density, shape, and thickness. Group 3 showed abundant odontoblastic lacunae, was without tunnel defects, had inconsistent hard tissue thickness, and had high porosity and low density. The different degrees of mineralization in the rhPDGF group could, for example, be due to the impact of CaOH2 hydroxylation, a production of carboxylate salts by chelation reaction combined with high alkalinity. This may affect the CaOH2 stability as a matrix for the rhPDGF during the early stage of wound healing. Recruitment of progenitor cells to sites of injury occurs naturally..</p><p id="p-0124" num="0127">The mean thickness of the newly formed dentin-like structure was 0.18&#xb1;0.084 mm, 0.9&#xb1;0.223 mm, 1.05&#xb1;0.19 mm for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0128">It is evident from the current findings that, when added to CaOH2, rhPDGF induced significant thickness in the newly formed dentin-like tissue, which differed from secondary dentin in its tissue density and mineralization.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0129">The addition of CaOH2 to EMD resulted in significant root canal obliterations. The calcified tissue is unlike secondary dentin in form, shape, amount, and density. When rhPDGF is added to CaOH2, no calcific obliteration of root canals occurs. The newly calcified tissue differs from secondary dentin by degree of mineralization, porosity, and density. Adding rhPDGF to CaOH2 resulted in a tissue thickness over the pulp space that was more consistent, resembling secondary dentin. This example demonstrates the superior properties of pulp capping with CaOH2+PDGF over, e.g., CaOH2 used alone or CaOH2+EMD.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0127" num="0130">This example describe results of the effect of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) as a matrix carrier for rhPDGF and EMD on dentin regeneration following pulp capping.

The randomized clinical trial protocol used for the study described in this example was approved by the King Saud University Institutional Research Review Board and the in vivo Ethical Committee. Subjects enrolled in the study signed consent forms. Intact premolar human teeth scheduled for extraction due to orthodontic reasons were included. All teeth were tested for symptoms and pulp responses and proved normal. Eighteen premolars obtained from eight patients were randomly assigned, using a brown bag, to one of the following three experimental groups (n=6 teeth per group): Group 1, using MTA alone for pulp capping; Group 2, using MTA+EMD, or Group 3, using MTA+rhPDGF. All patients received phone calls the night of the procedure, and at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 1 week postoperatively to record any symptom complaints. None of the subjects reported lingering pain or swelling, and no patient was excluded from the study.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0132">Pulp exposure was performed as described in the preceding example. After arrested bleeding was confirmed, the pulp was capped with one of the three experimental biomaterials. Group 1 was capped with MTA alone.

In Group 3, a small drop of rhPDGF (50 microliters) was placed over the exposure site and left undisturbed for at least 1 minute. MTA was then mixed and carefully placed with gentle pressure over the EMD or rhPDGF as well as the adjacent dentin in the exposure site to ensure close contact with the pulp tissue. Amalgam filling was then placed over the pulp-capping material to seal the coronal access cavity.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0133">Periapical radiographs were taken preoperatively and 4 months postoperatively.

The MTA+rhPDGF group demonstrated abundant and organized odontoblastic lacunae in all dentinal walls. The newly formed structure resembled secondary dentin in pattern, structure, form, shape, porosity, consistent thickness, complete absence of tunnel defects, tissue mineralization, and density. This pattern is different when rhPDGF is used with CaOH2 as a matrix, as shown in Example 1, above. The regenerated dentin in the MTA+rhPDGF group suggests that MTA may be a good matrix to use with rhPDGF. Moreover, it could be that MTA's biocompatibility, sealeability, and stability as a matrix during the early stage of wound healing plays a role in this process.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0144">The characteristics of the newly formed dentin-like structure following application of MTA+EMD showed a highly dense structure that was nonporous, without tunnel defects, and with abundant root canal obliterations. The use of MTA as matrix with EMD did not prevent the uncontrolled induction and formation of dentin-like structure. On the other hand, the use of MTA+rhPDGF produced a controlled generation of dentin-like structure with characteristics resembling secondary dentin. This demonstrates that rhPDGF may stimulate and recruit progenitor stem cells to commit to odontoblastic lineage in a more regulated form than EMD.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0145">The findings of the current study can have significant applications for vital pulp therapy. This human randomized clinical trial using rhPDGF+MTA in vital pulp therapy demonstrates the reconstitution of dentin similar to secondary dentin in its form, shape, structural organization, and thickness, while maintaining the pulp integrity. Thus, innovative treatment protocols using rhPDGF together with MTA as a protective biocompatible barrier over exposed pulp tissue to induce dentin regeneration are described herein.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0146">In the present study, two different types of tissue were formed: (1) regenerated dentin-like structure that resembled secondary dentin when rhPDGF+MTA was used; and (2) dentin-like structure that did not resemble secondary dentin when MTA alone or MTA+EMD were used. It appears that both rhPDGF and EMD can increase the thickness of such reparative tissue. Addition of EMD to MTA may increase root canal calcifications.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0147">The results presented in Examples 1 and 2 taken together support that the combination of growth factor substance (e.g., PDGF or EMD) and MTA as the pulp capping material provides superior dentin formation as compared to when calcium hydroxide is used as the pulp capping material.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0148">Particular embodiments of this invention are described herein.
