When the ring is substituted with a substituent, carbon atoms included in the substituent are not counted as ring carbon atoms. Unless otherwise specified, the same applies to &#x201c;ring carbon atoms&#x201d; described later. For example, a benzene ring has 6 ring carbon atoms, a naphthalene ring has 10 ring carbon atoms, a pyridine ring has 5 ring carbon atoms, and a furan ring has 4 ring carbon atoms. For example, a 9,9-diphenylfluorenyl group has 13 ring carbon atoms, and a 9,9&#x2032;-spirobifluorenyl group has 25 ring carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0679" num="0619">When a benzene ring is substituted with, for example, an alkyl group, carbon atoms of the alkyl group are not counted as ring carbon atoms of the benzene ring. Therefore, a benzene ring substituted with an alkyl group has 6 ring carbon atoms. When a naphthalene ring is substituted with, for example, an alkyl group, carbon atoms of the alkyl group are not counted as ring carbon atoms of the naphthalene ring. Therefore, a naphthalene ring substituted with an alkyl group has 10 ring carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0680" num="0620">Herein, the number of ring atoms refers to the number of atoms constituting a ring of a compound (e.g., a monocyclic compound, a fused-ring compound, a cross-linking compound, a carbon ring compound, or a heterocyclic compound) having a structure in which atoms are bonded to each other to form the ring (e.g., a monocyclic ring, a fused ring, or a ring assembly). Atoms not constituting the ring (e.g., hydrogen atoms terminating bonds of atoms constituting the ring) and atoms included in a substituent with which the ring is substituted are not counted as ring atoms. Unless otherwise specified, the same applies to &#x201c;ring atoms&#x201d; described later. For example, a pyridine ring has 6 ring atoms, a quinazoline ring has 10 ring atoms, and a furan ring has 5 ring atoms. For example, hydrogen atoms bonded to a pyridine ring and atoms constituting a substituent of the pyridine ring are not counted as pyridine ring atoms. Therefore, a pyridine ring to which hydrogen atoms or a substituent is bonded has 6 ring atoms. For example, hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms of a quinazoline ring and atoms constituting a substituent of the quinazoline ring are not counted as ring atoms of the quinazoline ring.
