Thus, the horse's digestive system is specifically designed for the intake of small quantities of feed over long periods of time. Horses and certain other animals did not evolve to develop the mechanism which turns stomach acid on and off, like humans. Therefore, a horse's stomach typically produces stomach acid 24 hours a day even when there is no food present and such production can be up to 9 gallons of acidic fluid per day.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Stalled horses, with minimal access to pasture for grazing, are normally fed 2-3 times per day which leads to the buildup of excess stomach acid, as the stomach is subjected to prolonged periods of time without feed present to neutralize the acid. As such, gastric ulcers are quite common in domesticated/stalled horses and foals; their prevalence has been estimated at from about 50% to about 90%, depending upon the population surveyed and type and level of athletic activity in which the horses are engaged.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Foals are often subject to stomach ulcers causing morbidity and mortality. Clinical signs of ulcers in foals include intermittent colic (after suckling or eating), frequent recumbency (this is common in foals since this position seems to provide some relief from severe gastric ulceration), intermittent nursing, diarrhea, poor appetite, grinding of teeth and excessive salivation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Adult horses with stomach ulcers may exhibit one or more clinical signs of ulcers including: poor appetite, attitude changes, decreased performance, reluctance to train or work, excessive recumbency, poor body condition, rough hair coat, weight loss, low grade colic and/or loose feces. More serious cases will show abdominal pain (colic) and/or grinding of the teeth. Others may walk away from food for a period of time as if the horse experiences discomfort when the food first contacts the stomach. Due to the range of common clinical signs of ulcers (and the fact that some horses with ulcers show no outward signs), the only clinically proven way to diagnose and verify stomach ulcers in horses is through gastric endoscopy or gastroscopy. Unfortunately, this involves placing an endoscope into the horse's stomach to examine its inner surface. This is unpleasant for the horse and sometimes a complex procedure for the veterinarian as it invariably requires anesthesia. In addition, this process can be very costly for the horse owner and a large number of veterinarians do not have access to an endoscope; due to the high cost basis for this type of equipment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Humans also suffer from gastrointestinal distress such as ulcers, acid reflux, bloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, or the threat thereof and are often in need of prevention and treatment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Unfortunately, currently available solutions for the prevention or treatment of ulcers or other gastrointestinal distress may require a licensed caregiver to prescribe an oral administration of expensive treatments with a dosing syringe or other supplement. In addition to being costly, many horses or other animals fight this type of treatment, which makes administration difficult. Moreover, there are often side-effect with respect to currently available supplements and the like.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is a method and supplement for prevention and/or treatment of gastrointestinal distress, including ulcer conditions in horses and other animal species such as humans. It would be further advantageous if the method and supplement employed generally available materials, which were safe and effective, FDA approved, and had limited or no side effects. It would be further advantageous if the supplement could be provided in a variety of forms and could be readily formulated with existing equipment. Advantageously, the present invention accomplishes one or more up to all of the aforementioned needs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the present invention pertains to a method of preventing or treating ulcer conditions in a human. The method comprises dosing the human with an effective amount of a supplement comprising mastic gum and lecithin wherein the weight ratio of mastic gum to lecithin is from about 1:10 to about 1:50 based on the total weight of mastic gum and lecithin.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, the present invention pertains to a method of preventing or treating gastrointestinal distress in a human. The method comprises dosing the human orally at least once daily with a supplement comprising an emulsified mastic gum. Typically, the weight ratio of mastic gum to an emulsifying agent in the emulsified mastic gum is from about 1:10 to about 1:50 based on the total weight of emulsified mastic gum.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a nutritional supplement for the prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal distress in animals including humans comprising mastic gum and an emulsifying agent such as lecithin. The supplement may alternatively be used to support a healthy digestive tract in a broad range of animals including humans. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of preventing gastrointestinal distress in an animal including a human comprising: dosing an animal orally at least once daily with a supplement.

It also pertains generally to a method of preventing gastrointestinal distress in an animal such as a human and more specifically to a method of preventing or treating ulcer conditions in a human using a nutritional supplement as described herein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used herein &#x201c;gastrointestinal distress&#x201d; generally refers to gastrointestinal upset, ulcers, and other digestive conditions or disorders such as diarrhea that are suffered by non-human animals such as a horse, dog, sheep, alpaca, llama, camel, cat, donkey, and cow, as well as a human. In one embodiment, the animal is a human. The supplements and method described herein may be useful to prevent gastrointestinal distress and/or treat gastrointestinal distress in a human and various animals including pigs, primates, guinea pigs, ferrets, elephants, marine mammals, rabbits, rats, dolphins, tigers, cheetahs, lions zebras, zoo animals, livestock, and domestic animals. Generally, the amount of supplement and/or dosage is higher when the supplements and/or methods are employed to treat as opposed to prevent distress. In certain instances and dosages, the supplements and/or methods may simultaneously treat and prevent further gastrointestinal distress.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The digestive process can often be conceptually divided into the functions carried out in the front of the gastrointestinal tract and those carried out in the back of the GI tract. The functions carried out in the two areas can be very different. In the foregut, after food is gathered up, chewed, and swallowed, the stomach kicks into gear. The main functions of the stomach are to add gastric acid to help with the breakdown of food, to secrete the enzyme pepsinogen to begin protein digestion, and to regulate the passage of food into the small intestine. The stomach can be thought of as a holding and mixing tank, similar to a cement truck that is constantly churning and mixing ingredients.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">While food breakdown may begin in the stomach, it continues in the small intestine, where secretions help with the further digestion of protein, simple carbohydrates, and fat. The small intestine is also the main site of nutrient absorption once the food is in small enough form. Amino acids, glucose, vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids are taken into the body as they move along the small intestine, so progress shouldn't be too fast or too slow.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The processes that occur in the hindgut, and particularly in the cecum and colon, are less about breaking down food into smaller, absorbable particles with the aid of enzymes and more about fermenting complex carbohydrates (fiber) into useful end products with the assistance of beneficial organisms. In addition to generating fatty acids, which supply energy or calories, these helpful microorganisms also produce B-vitamins, Vitamin K, and some amino acids. The colon then serves not only to absorb these nutrients but also a portion of the water that accompanies food as it moves along the digestive tract.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Mastic Gum and Emulsifying Agent Such as Lecithin Employed</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The nutritional supplement generally comprises a mixture of mastic gum and an emulsifying agent such as lecithin. The types and amounts of mastic gum employed may vary. That is, the specific properties and amounts of the mastic gum that may be employed herein, of course may vary depending upon a number of factors including, for example, the desired results, the animal such as a human being treated, as well as the types and amounts of other ingredients employed and the desired form of the supplement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The mastic gum (a source of triterpenic compounds and phytosterols) may be produced synthetically or, alternatively and more preferably, readily obtained from common natural sources. Mastic gum is sometimes known also as Chios Mastiha. Mastic gum is a natural resin that typically comes from an evergreen small tree or large shrub, which may be cultivated successfully in, for example, the Mediterranean such as the island of Chios, in the Eastern Aegean Sea. This evergreen tree called Schinos, belongs to the family of Pistachia. (Botanical name: Pistachia Lentiscus var. Chia). Mastic gum useful in the present invention is available commercially from sources such as Parchem or other chemical or nutritional supplement suppliers.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The emulsifying agent or agents employed may vary depending upon a number of factors including, for example, the desired results, the animal such as a human being treated as well as the types and amounts of other ingredients employed, and the desired form of the supplement. While not wishing to be bound to any theory it is believed that including a suitable amount of a emulsifying agent may assist in delivery of the mastic gum to the stomach lining by virtue of being at least partially soluble in one or more fats present in the stomach and water. The emulsifying agent may aid in protecting gastric tissue from ulcer injury in, for example, horses and other animals such as humans. First, the mastic/emulsifying agent may facilitate forming a barrier between stomach contents and epithelial cells, and second, one or both ingredients may facilitate cell membrane turnover and wound resealing. The emulsifying agent may also assist in partially protecting the mastic gum from being destroyed by excess stomach acid and/or in maintaining an appropriate texture of the mastic gum depending upon the form of the supplement.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Useful emulsifying agents may include any agent that is compatible with mastic gum and relatively non-toxic to normal cells. Such emulsifying agents are often found in food products such as dairy products like ice cream, butter, and margarine, salad dressings, and mayonnaise. Such emulsifying agents are also described in TITLE 21&#x2014;FOOD AND DRUGS, CHAPTER I&#x2014;FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, SUBCHAPTER E&#x2014;ANIMAL DRUGS, FEEDS, AND RELATED PRODUCTS, PART 582 Subpart E&#x2014;Emulsifying Agents, SUBSTANCES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE as of the parent application filing date and currently include Diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono&#x2014;and diglycerides of edible fats or oils, or edible fat-forming fatty acids; Mono&#x2014;and diglycerides of edible fats or oils, or edible fat-forming acids; Monosodium phosphate derivatives of mono&#x2014;and diglycerides of edible fats or oils, or edible fat-forming fatty acids; Monosodium phosphate derivatives of mono&#x2014;and diglycerides of edible fats or oils, or edible fat-forming fatty acids; Propylene glycol; and mixtures thereof. Useful emulsifying agents may also include, for example, lecithin, calcium sterol, soy lecithin, monoglycerides, alkali stearates such as magnesium stearate and potassium stearate, sucrose ester, ethoxylated sorbitan esters (trade name: TWEEN such as TWEEN20 and TWEEN80), xanthan gum, guar gum, pepsin, methyl cellulose, glycol esters such as propylene glycol ester, sorbitan esters such as sorbitan monostearate (trade name SPANS), glyceryl monostearate, tragacanth, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Generally, lecithin is a naturally occurring fatty substance or phospholipid, which could potentially be produced synthetically if desired. Lecithin may come from many sources, including both plant and animal tissues. Soybeans are the most common source of lecithin (soy lecithin), but other potential sources of lecithin include: eggs, animal tissues, milk, fish eggs, rapeseed, cotton seed and sunflower. One particularly preferable emulsifying agent is lecithin which is believed to act synergistically with mastic gum at certain proportions with respect to its use in, for example, equine and other animals such as human. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory one potential reason that soy lecithin may be particularly effective is that soy lecithin comprises phosphatidylethanolamines which are also found in the lipid bilayer of most cells.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A chemical formula for a lecithin is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>O<sub>5</sub>NRR&#x2032; wherein R and R&#x2032; are the same or different fatty acid groups. Pure lecithin is generally a phosphatidyl choline. That is, lecithins are mixtures of diglycerides of fatty acids linked to the choline ester of phosphoric acid. Thus, lecithins are often classed as phosphoglycerides or phosphatides (phospholipids). Commercially available lecithin is often a mixture of acetone insoluble phosphatides. For example, LECITHIN FCC, available from, for example, Spectrum Chemical, is a substance that is of a fatty nature and occurs naturally in animals and plant tissues. It is a brownish yellow color and contains a range of substances such as triglycerides, glycerol, phosphoric acid and so on. Other potential sources of lecithin useful in the present invention include, for example, Cargill.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The specific emulsifying agent such as lecithin and amounts employed in the supplements and method of treatment/prevention also vary depending upon a number of factors. Such factors include, for example, the desired results, the animal such as a human being treated as well as the types and amounts of other ingredients employed and the form of the supplement. So long as the emulsifying agent such as lecithin is capable of being mixed with the mastic gum, it may be in any form. Preferably, the emulsifying agent such as lecithin with mastic gum employed may be in a form such as granules, powders, or even liquid such that it may be substantially homogeneously mixed with the mastic gum. Suitable forms for the substantially homogeneous mixture include, for example, top dressings, pills, gels and other forms as described herein. Moreover, such mixtures include, for example, oral gels and &#x201c;extruded treats&#x201d; or snacks. Oral gels may include, for example, a gel comprising the ingredients and amounts described herein or alternatively from at least about 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, or 3 or more grams per dose with or without a time release component. Such gels may typically comprise less than about 6, 5, 4.5, 4, 3.5, or 3 or less grams per dose with or without a time release component. Such amounts may also be useful with respect to the other forms of supplement discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">&#x201c;Extruded Treat&#x201d; as used herein means a formulation in the form of, for example, a snack or other supplement to be provided at, for example, a non-routine feeding. Such extruded treats can comprise an appropriate amount of ingredients described herein or alternatively from at least about 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, or 3 or more grams per dose with or without a time release component. Such extruded treats may typically comprise less than about 6, 5, 4.5, 4, 3.5, or 3 or less grams per dose with or without a time release component. Often such extruded treats are made via extrusion and are in the form of a solid such as a chewable biscuit or cracker similar to, or example, MILK BONE dog treats.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0000">Weight Ratios and Amounts of Mastic Gum and Emulsifying Agent such as Lecithin Employed</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">As described previously, the amounts of mastic gum and emulsifying agent such as lecithin employed vary depending upon a number of factors including, for example, the degree or severity, if any, of gastrointestinal distress, desired results, the animal such as human being treated as well as the types and amounts of other ingredients employed and the form of the supplement. Other factors may include, for example, the activity level and/or diet of the animal such as a human.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">Generally, the weight ratio of mastic gum to emulsifying agent such as lecithin is determined such that the weight ratio is effective to prevent and/or treat gastrointestinal distress in an animal by providing the animal with about one to two or three or even four supplements per day. In such cases, the weight ratio of mastic gum to emulsifying agent such as lecithin is a range from about 1:2500 to about 1:1.25, or from about 1:1000 to about 1:300, or from about 1:500 to about 1:100, or from about 1:10 to about 1:50 based on the total weight of mastic gum and emulsifying agent such as lecithin. In other embodiments, the ratio of mastic gum to emulsifying agent such as lecithin is a range from about 1:1 to about 1:100, or from about 1:10 to about 1:50, or from about 1:20 to about 1:40, or is a range from about 1:15 to about 1:35, or from about 0.5:40 to about 1.5:20.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">Some embodiments may comprise the step of identifying an animal such as a human with ulcer conditions for treatment. A preferred embodiment also comprises the step of dosing an animal such as a human with the supplement for at least thirty days.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Supplement Form and Process of Making</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0029">The nutritional supplement comprising lecithin, mastic gum and/or other ingredients is typically administered or provided orally to the animal such as a human in any convenient manner. The supplement may be formulated as a powder, paste, granule, liquid, gel, capsule, tablet, or pellet. Various additives may be added to the supplement in order to achieve the desired physical form. In one embodiment, the supplement may be administered or provided as a top dressing on top of food or with food at one or more regular feeding times or meals. A top dress is typically a formulation that is a supplement form which encourages the animal such as a human to ingest the supplement voluntarily. That is, if the supplement is not in the form of a &#x201c;top dressing&#x201d;, then the animal or even a human may move the supplement to the side, spit out the supplement, or refuse the feeding altogether.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">The specific process of making the supplement, of course, will vary depending upon the final form desired, the specific ingredients and their form, amounts employed, and other factors. Generally, the process typically involves mixing the desired emulsifying agent such as lecithin and mastic gum at ambient conditions to form a substantially homogenous mixture. If other ingredients are desired in the supplement, then in most cases the ingredients may be mixed prior to, simultaneously or even after the emulsifying agent such as lecithin and mastic gum are mixed. In some cases, it may be desirable to add the desired amounts of emulsifying agent such as lecithin and mastic gum to an already commercially available supplement lacking sufficient amounts of lecithin and mastic gum. Once the desired ingredients are mixed, they may be put in the desired form, e.g., powder, paste, granule, liquid, gel, or pellet using techniques known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">In some embodiments the supplement may be in the form of a tablet or a capsule. Tablets are typically a compressed form of the desired ingredients and amounts described above. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated with a suitable material for ease of swallowing, taste, color, odor, improving stability in gastric environment, improving release properties, and combinations thereof. Various processes may be used for coating including, for example, sugar coating, film coating, and enteric coating.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">In some embodiments, capsules may be preferred for the supplements described herein. Supplements in the form of capsules may offer advantages such as sustained release, targeted delivery, bioavailability, and/or ease of manufacturing. The specific type of capsule employed for the supplements herein may depend upon the ingredients and amounts employed, desired bioavailability, desired release profile, and other factors. Suitable types of capsules may include, for example, hard gelatin capsules, HPMC (hydroxypropyl methylcullose) capsules, starch capsules, pullulan capsules, PVA capsules, soft gelatin capsules. If desired, the gel form of the supplement described herein could be put into a capsule for ease of human consumption.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Other Ingredients</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0033">Other ingredients may be added to the supplement so long as the ingredients do not substantially interfere with the desired effects of the supplement comprising mastic gum and emulsifying agent such as lecithin. In certain embodiments, the supplement may additionally comprise beneficial amounts of biotics such as probiotics and/or prebiotics, vitamins, minerals, and/or other nutritional supplements.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">Probiotics are live &#x201c;good&#x201d; microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeast. Probiotics that may be useful in the supplement, particularly for equine supplements, include <i>Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus caseii </i>and <i>Lactobacillus plantarum. </i></p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">Additional potential probiotics may include:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036"><i>Lactobacillus </i>species including, but not limited to, <i>L. rhamnosus, L. salivarius, L. paracasei, L. gasseri, L. reuteri, L. bulgaricus, L. brevis, L. brevis, L fermentum</i>, and <i>L. reuteri. </i></p><p id="p-0039" num="0037"><i>Bifidobacterium </i>species including, but not limited to, <i>B. bifidum, B. longum, B. infantis, B. breve, </i>and <i>B. lactis. </i></p><p id="p-0040" num="0038"><i>Bacillus </i>species including, but not limited to, <i>B. coagulans </i>and <i>B. subtillius. </i></p><p id="p-0041" num="0039"><i>Streptoccocus </i>species including, but not limited to, <i>S. salivarius, S. thermophilus, S. cremoris, S. faecium </i>and <i>S. infantis. </i></p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Other useful species may include, but are not limited to, <i>Saccharomyces boulardii, Aspergillus oryzae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, </i>and <i>Aspergillus niger. </i></p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">The amount of probiotic to include in the supplement varies depending upon, among other items, the type of probiotic, other ingredients, and desired results. Typically, an amount of probiotic is measured in colony forming units (CFU's) per dose. In many cases, from millions to even billions of CFUs of probiotic may be included in a given supplement. Typically, the amount of probiotic may be at least 500 million, preferably at least 1 billion, more preferably at least 2 billion, preferably at least 3 billion up to as much as 10 billion CFUs per dose of supplement. Certain embodiment may comprise at least 10 to 15 billion CFUS per dose of supplement.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Disclosed embodiments may comprise at least 500 million, preferably at least 1 billion, more preferably at least 2 billion, preferably at least 3 billion up to as much as 10 billion CFUs of each species of <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, </i>and/or <i>Enterococcus faecium </i>per dose of supplement.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">In contrast to probiotics, prebiotics are the foods that feed the probiotics. Examples of prebiotic that may be included, particularly in equine supplements, include <i>fructooligosaccharides </i>(FOS), <i>xylooligosaccrarides </i>(XOS), polydextrose, pectin and psyllium. Additional potential prebiotics include the following:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">Larch arabinogalactin (LAG), resistant starch, beta-glucans, trans-galactooligosaccharide, inulin, oligofructose, gum arabic, chicory root, Jerusalem artichoke, dandelion greens, garlic, leek, onion, asparagus, wheat bran, wheat flour, and banana.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Prebiotics may include short-chain prebiotic with 2-8 links per saccharide molecule or longer-chain prebiotics with 9-64 links per saccharide molecule. Prebiotics may comprise any of the above in combination as in Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin (OEI).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">Prebiotic food ingredients are generally not digested by horses or other animals. Instead, prebiotics are digested by desirable microorganisms and probiotics in the digestive system to increase or enhance the numbers and/or activity of the desirable microorganisms and/or probiotics. Thus, including both probiotics and prebiotics in the supplement may assist in further treating or preventing GI-related concerns, such as diarrhea, by facilitating the growth of the good microbes and/or minimizing the invasion and growth of disease-causing bacteria. Probiotics and/or prebiotics may be particularly preferable in supplements employed in animals such as horses that are on antibiotics or experiencing stress, transport, abrupt dietary changes, and/or Clostridium or Salmonella infections. Any of these may potentially alter the normal microbe population in, for example, a horse's large intestine.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">If prebiotics are to be employed in the supplement, then the amount may vary widely depending upon, among other items, the type of prebiotic, other ingredients, and desired results. Typically, an amount of prebiotic is at least about 0.01, or at least about 0.1, or at least about 0.4 up to about 1, or up to about 2 grams per dose.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In addition to mastic gum, emulsifying agent such as lecithin, probiotics and prebiotics, a wide variety of vitamins, minerals, or other nutritional supplements may be included in the described nutritional supplement. Such other ingredients include, for example, B vitamins such as, for example, Vitamin B1 (thiamine) A coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids; Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) A precursor of cofactors called FAD and FMN, which are needed for flavoprotein enzyme reactions, including activation of other vitamins; Vitamin B3 (niacin or nicotinic acid) A precursor of coenzymes called NAD and NADP, which are needed in many metabolic processes; Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) A precursor of coenzyme A and therefore needed to metabolize many molecules; Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine) A coenzyme in many enzymatic reactions in metabolism; Vitamin B7 (biotin) A coenzyme for carboxylase enzymes, needed for synthesis of fatty acids and in gluconeogenesis; Vitamin B8 (inositol); Vitamin B9 (folic acid) A precursor needed to make, repair, and methylate DNA; a cofactor in various reactions; especially important in aiding rapid cell division and growth, such as in infancy and pregnancy; Vitamin B12 (various cobalamins; commonly cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamin in vitamin supplements) A coenzyme involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">For certain embodiments, the ratio of total B-vitamins to mastic gum is from about 1:0.1 to about 1:4, or from about 1:0.3 to about 1:2, or from about 1:0.6 to about 1:1. B-vitamins may refer to all known B-vitamins including: thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, biotin, folic acid, folinic acid, cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin or other cobalamins, choline, adenine, or carnitine, adenosine monophosphate (AMP), inositol, para-aminobenzoic acid, pteryl-hepta-glutamic acid, orotic acid, dimethylglycine, L-carnitine, carnitine, and myo-inositol.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Other useful ingredients for the supplement may include DL methionine, Vitamin E, zinc, selenium, distillers dried grains with or without solubles, magnesium mica, corn distillers dried grains, wheat middlings, alfalfa meal, dehydrated alfalfa, rice mill by product, rye flour, beet pulp, dicalcium phosphate, flaxseed meal, oat flour, oat oil, magnesium stearate, cellulose, silicon dioxide, gelatin, maltodextrin, silica, fructose, inulin, inouline, soy protein isolate, rice bran, soybean flour, coconut meal, marine lipid concentrates, kelp, kaolin, and/or pectin.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">If desired, formulation aids and/or flavoring aids may be employed in the supplement at useful amounts. Such ingredients include, for example, silicon dioxide, maltodextrin, vanilla flavor, and the like. Flavoring aids are typically added in a useful amount which encourages the animal to ingest the supplement voluntarily. Such aids include, for example, maltodextrin, vanilla flavor, and flavors such as fruit, vegetable, apple, honey, molasses, karo syrup, banana, citrus, orange, beet pulp, herbs, fenugreek, cherry, rosemary, cumin, carrot, peppermint, oregano, various flavors of jams and jellies. Suitable flavoring may be available at various suppliers including, for example, Agriflavors, Inc. Some embodiments may contain a pH buffer or alkalinizing agent. Alternative embodiments may contain an additive for coating the interior of an animal stomach. Still other embodiments may contain anti-fungal additives. Of the aforementioned additives it may be convenient to select from those recognized as safe in TITLE 21&#x2014;FOOD AND DRUGS, CHAPTER I&#x2014;FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, SUBCHAPTER E&#x2014;ANIMAL DRUGS, FEEDS, AND RELATED PRODUCTS, PART 582 Subparts A-H (Oct. 19, 2017 21 CFR 582.1-7724 incorporated herein by reference).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Chart 1 below shows a potential embodiment as well as potential dosage ranges for the disclosed supplement. Such a supplement would be particularly preferable for horses at a dose of about once daily for preventing gastrointestinal distress. In the case of humans the dose or supplement could be adjusted down based on the weight of the human. If desired, the supplement could be administered in two or even three or more daily doses for treatment purposes depending upon the severity of the distress. In certain circumstances administering a dose every other day, every third day, or weekly may be appropriate depending on the nature and severity of the distress. Generally, each of the below ingredients with the exception of mastic gum and emulsifying agent such as lecithin are optional and thus need not be present at even the low level described in Chart 1 below. That said, it is often preferable to include at least the prebiotics and probiotics with the mastic gum and emulsifying agent such as lecithin.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">If desired the composition may be formulated as a time release formulation. That is, the composition may further comprise on or more ingredients that facilitate release of the mastic gum in a controlled release over time. The skilled artisan will appreciate the type and amount of such ingredients as being used in conventional time release formulations. Such ingredients include, for example, methyl celluloses such as hydroxy methyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, and the like in amounts necessary to delay the release of the mastic gum for desired amounts of time.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">If desired, an absorbent may be added to the formulation. Useful amounts of such absorbents may be useful to, for example, facilitate removal of heavy metals &#x26; toxins, balance pH levels, or both. Suitable absorbent may include micronized zeolites such as clinoptilolite. Often, such absorbents may attract positive minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and iron. These common positive cations may then be displaced by heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury, nickel, and arsenic and removed safely from the body.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Chart 1:</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0055"></p><p id="p-0058" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="133pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="147pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Dose Amount Range</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Formulation</entry><entry/><entry>Low</entry><entry>High</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Mastic Gum</entry><entry>1.00</entry><entry>gm</entry><entry>0.02</entry><entry>gm</entry><entry>4.00</entry><entry>gm</entry></row><row><entry>DL Methionine</entry><entry>1.72</entry><entry>gm</entry><entry>0.05</entry><entry>gm</entry><entry>3.00</entry><entry>gm</entry></row><row><entry>Inositol</entry><entry>368</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>550</entry><entry>mg</entry></row><row><entry>Niacin</entry><entry>135</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>250</entry><entry>mg</entry></row><row><entry>Thiamine</entry><entry>42</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>150</entry><entry>mg</entry></row><row><entry>Riboflavin</entry><entry>38</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>75</entry><entry>mg</entry></row><row><entry>Pyridoxine</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>30</entry><entry>mg</entry></row><row><entry>Biotin</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>mg</entry></row><row><entry>Vitamin B12</entry><entry>184</entry><entry>mcg</entry><entry>50</entry><entry>mcg</entry><entry>500</entry><entry>mcg</entry></row><row><entry>Vitamin E</entry><entry>123</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>30</entry><entry>mg</entry><entry>250</entry><entry>mg</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Zinc</entry><entry>1%</entry><entry>0.03%&#x2002;</entry><entry>2%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Selenium</entry><entry>40</entry><entry>ppm</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>ppm</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>ppm</entry></row><row><entry>FOS -

With regard to this particular embodiment, a 10 cc dose preferably contains about 3 grams of mastic gum.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0079">The currently described embodiment may comprise the Probiotic bacteria: <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei </i>and/or <i>Enterococcus faecium </i>at at least about 2 billion, or at least about 3 billion, or at least about 3.5 billion, or at least about 4 billion or more CFUs per 10 cc dose and/or may comprise less than about 6 billion, or less than about 5 billion, or less than about 4.5 billion, or less than about 4 billion or less CFUs per 10 cc dose. With regard to this particular embodiment, a dose preferably comprises Probiotic bacteria: <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei </i>and/or <i>Enterococcus faecium </i>at about 4 billion CFUs per 10 cc dose. The probiotic bacteria to be added to the mixture to form the gel may be in any convenient form, for example, as the dried fermentation product.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0080">The currently described embodiment comprises at least about 0.4 grams, or at least about 0.5 grams, or at least about 0.8 grams, or at least about 1 gram, or at least about 2 grams or more soy lecithin per 10 cc dose and/or may comprise less than about 1.5 grams, or less than about 1.2 grams, or less than about 1 gram, or less soy lecithin per 10 cc dose. The currently described embodiment preferably comprises about 1 gram soy lecithin per 10 cc dose. As described above, emulsifying agents (surfactants) other than soy lecithin may be employed and such is the case in the currently described embodiment. That is, the emulsifying agent may be selected from the group consisting of diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono&#x2014;and diglycerides of edible fats or oils, or edible fat-forming fatty acids; mono&#x2014;and diglycerides of edible fats or oils, or edible fat-forming acids; monosodium phosphate derivatives of mono&#x2014;and diglycerides of edible fats or oils, or edible fat-forming fatty acids; monosodium phosphate derivatives of mono&#x2014;and diglycerides of edible fats or oils, or edible fat-forming fatty acids; propylene glycol; lecithin; calcium sterol; soy lecithin; alkali stearates; sucrose ester; ethoxylated sorbitan esters; xanthan gum; guar gum; pepsin; methyl cellulose; glycol esters; sorbitan esters; glyceryl monostearate; tragacanth; sodium lauryl sulfate; sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate; and mixtures thereof. The amount of emulsifying agent may vary depending upon the specific agent, the amount of mastic, and the other ingredients present but often the weight ratio of mastic gum to emulsifying agent may be from about 1:1 to about 5:1 based on the weight of mastic gum and emulsifying agent in the gel formulation.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0081">The currently described embodiment may comprise, and preferably does comprise, the prebiotic FOS. The amounts employed may vary depending upon the application but usually are at least about 0.1 gram, or at least about 0.2 grams, or at least about 0.3 grams or more, up to about 1 gram, or up to about 0.9 grams, or up to about 0.7 grams per 10 cc dose. In one embodiment the amount of prebiotic FOS is about 0.5 grams per 10 cc dose.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0082">The currently described embodiment may be carried on an oil which is naturally high in tocopherols to help preserve the integrity of the active ingredients, preferably in gel form. The currently described embodiment is preferably carried on soy oil and is more preferably carried on non-GMO expelled soy oil. Other oils may also be employed depending upon the specific ingredients, specific amounts, and desired results. Suitable oils may include vegetable oil such as those selected from the group consisting of soybean oil, corn oil, rapeseed oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, brazil nut oil, cottonseed oil, coconut oil, olive oil, palm oil, rice bran oil, grape seed oil, hazelnut oil, linseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, and mixtures thereof. The amount of oil employed may vary depending upon the specific oil, the amount of mastic, and the other ingredients present but often the amount of oil is more than the amount of mastic gum on a weight basis of the gel formulation. Often, by adjusting the type or amount of oil one may achieve the desired flowability of the gel, e.g., the more oil that is present, the more flowable the composition is. A suitable weight ratio range of oil to mastic gum may be from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1 in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0083">The manner of making the gel is not particularly critical so long as the gel exhibits the desired flowable paste-like consistency, remains suitably mixed, and functions in the desired manner. Suitable methods may vary depending upon the specific amounts and specific ingredients. However, in general the mastic gum, vegetable oil, emulsifying agent, and any other desired ingredients are mixed in a convenient manner at ambient temperature and pressure for a time sufficient to disperse the solid ingredients relatively uniformly within the vegetable oil and any other liquid ingredients. The desired flowable paste-like consistency can be achieved primarily via adjusting the amounts of various ingredients and the skilled artisan may adjust the viscosity or flowability using conventional techniques and ingredients. Typically, the ingredients stay in a relatively homogenous mixture within the gel formulation at ambient conditions.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0084">The method of using the gel formulation is similar to the methods described above for the various formulations. The animal such as a human is dosed orally at least once daily with the gel formulation supplement when and as needed to prevent or treat gastrointestinal distress. For example, a horse in need of prevention could be dosed once daily for at least one, or at least two, or at least three days before a competition, heavy training, trailering, or other stress conditions. A horse in need of treatment for gastrointestinal distress or ulcers may be treated more frequently and perhaps longer, e.g., once, twice, or three times daily for a period of at least a week, or least two weeks, or at least three weeks, or at least four weeks. Similarly, there may be some horses that may be in need of a daily treatment for indefinite period of time. A typical dose for an average size horse of 1000 to 1200 pounds is about 10 cc of the above-described formulations. Of course, the dose can be increased or decreased based on the size and needs of the horse. In the case of a human the dose could be decreased at a ratio based on the weight of the human. That is, for a 100 to 120 pound human the dose could be about 1 cc of the above described formulation.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0085">Preparation of Gel Example</p><p id="p-0092" num="0086">Approximately four kilograms of soy oil is added to three kilograms of mastic gum, 1 kilogram of soy lecithin, and 0.5 kilograms FOS&#x2014;Prebiotics. The ingredients are mixed and 0.4 kilograms of silicon dioxide and 4 billion CFU probiotics in dried fermentation form are added while continuing to mix. If desired, B vitamins, flavoring aids, or other ingredients are added and mixed until a relatively homogeneous gel is obtained. If it is desired that the gel be more flowable, then additional soy oil may be added until the desired consistency is reached. The gel may then be put in 10 cc oral syringes.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0087">In another specific embodiment, a gel may comprise soy oil, about 1 gram of mastic, 1 gram of soy lecithin, 0.5 grams FOS&#x2014;prebiotics, and 2.5 million CFU probiotic bacteria (dried <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus </i>fermentation product, dried <i>Lactobacillus plantarum </i>fermentation product, dried <i>Lactobacillus casei </i>fermentation product, and dried <i>Enteroccus faecium </i>fermentation product) along with anhydrous dextrose, silicon dioxide, and artificial flavor in a 5 ml dose within a tube. Horses may be given one 5 ml dose per day for three days or as needed. Foals may be given one 2.5 ml dose per day for six days after birth, during weaning or stress conditions, or as needed.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0088">In another embodiment, a gel may comprise mastic gum and Probiotic bacteria as active ingredients in amounts of from about 15 to about 25, or from about 18 to about 22 percent by weight of the gel product. In another embodiment, a gel may comprise mastic gum, Probiotic bacteria, and soy lecithin as active ingredients in amounts of from about 23 to about 33, or from about 26 to about 30 percent by weight of the gel product. In another embodiment, a gel may comprise mastic gum, Probiotic bacteria, soy lecithin, and FOS (prebiotic) as active ingredients in amounts of from about 28 to about 37, or from about 30 to about 34 percent by weight of the gel product.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0089">The terms, descriptions and examples used herein are set forth by way of illustration only and are not meant as limitations.
