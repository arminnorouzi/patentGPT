Also provided are alpha-hydroxy esters and synthetic intermediates prepared according to processes disclosed herein, compositions comprising the alpha-hydroxy esters, and methods of using the compositions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Alpha-hydroxy ester analogs of natural amino acids are useful as dietary supplements and in the study of enzymatic processes and protein function. Synthesis of such esters typically employs acid-catalyzed Fischer esterification of the corresponding acid and an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid such as H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>or Amberlyst&#xae; cationic exchange resin, acid-mediated hydrolysis of the corresponding nitrile in the presence of a strong acid, or enzyme-mediated processes. However, acid-catalyzed approaches lead to degradation of starting material and product and contamination of the product with dimeric and oligomeric components. Such methods typically provide low yields, and complex purification techniques are needed to isolate the target compound from the polymeric side-products. Enzymatic approaches require expensive and sensitive reagents and special reaction conditions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An alpha-hydroxy ester of particular importance is isopropyl 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoate (HMBi). HMBi is the isopropyl ester of the hydroxy analog of methionine, 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid (HMBA). HMBi is used to help supplement methionine in ruminants, including cows. Adequate methionine levels in dairy cows help maintain desired levels of milk protein synthesis and, in turn, desired levels of milk production. However, methionine content in the animal feedstock is vastly insufficient and has become a major limiting factor in the diet of the dairy cow. HMBi is a chemical derivative of methionine that readily and rapidly diffuses through the rumen wall, avoiding degradation by ruminal microbes. Once HMBi passes through the rumen wall, it is metabolized in the liver and becomes available for milk protein synthesis in dairy cows.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need for additional processes for synthesizing alpha-hydroxy esters, such as HMBi, that employ inexpensive, non-toxic reagents and mild reaction conditions, and that provide the product esters in high yield and purity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the disclosure is directed to a method of preparing a compound of Formula (I):</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="19.30mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002315A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0009" num="0000">wherein<br/>R<sup>1 </sup>is C<sub>1-4 </sub>alkyl; and<br/>R<sup>2 </sup>is C<sub>1-8 </sub>alkyl or C<sub>4-7 </sub>cycloalkyl; and<br/>R<sup>3 </sup>and R<sup>4 </sup>are each independently chosen from H, methyl, and ethyl;<br/>comprising coupling a compound of Formula (IV):</p><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="18.88mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002315A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0011" num="0000">with a vinyl Grignard reagent of Formula (A):</p><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="13.12mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002315A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0013" num="0000">wherein X is Br or Cl;<br/>to form a compound of Formula (III):</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-C00004" he="18.80mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002315A1-20230105-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0015" num="0000">and converting the compound of Formula (III) to the compound of Formula (I).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0007">In another aspect, the disclosure is directed to a method of preparing a compound of Formula (I), comprising reducing a compound of Formula (II):</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-C00005" he="19.39mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002315A1-20230105-C00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0018" num="0000">with a reducing agent to form the compound of Formula (I).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0008">In some aspects, the compound of Formula (I) is the compound of Formula (I-A):</p><p id="p-0020" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-C00006" he="18.80mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002315A1-20230105-C00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0021" num="0009">In another aspect, the disclosure is directed to a method of preparing a compound of Formula (I-A):</p><p id="p-0022" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-C00007" he="18.80mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002315A1-20230105-C00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0023" num="0000">comprising:<br/>esterifying oxalic acid with isopropanol to form diisopropyl oxalate;<br/>coupling diisopropyl oxalate with vinylmagnesium bromide to form a compound of Formula (III-A):</p><p id="p-0024" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-C00008" he="18.80mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002315A1-20230105-C00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0025" num="0000">thiolating the compound of Formula (III-A) with CH<sub>3</sub>SH to form a compound of Formula (II-A):</p><p id="p-0026" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-C00009" he="18.80mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002315A1-20230105-C00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0027" num="0000">and reducing the compound of Formula (II-A) to form the compound of Formula (I-A).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0010">In another aspect, the disclosure is directed to a compound of Formula (I) or Formula (I-A) prepared as in any of the methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0011">In another aspect, the disclosure is directed to isopropyl 2-oxobut-3-enoate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0012">In another aspect, the disclosure is directed to an animal feed composition comprising the compound of Formula (I) of Formula (I-A) as described herein.
