To meet such demand for fuel efficiency, it has been required to reduce the rolling resistance in terms of tire performance. A method of optimizing a tire structure has been studied as a method for reducing the rolling resistance of a tire, but a general method for reducing rolling resistance is to use a material with low heat generating properties as a rubber composition.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Examples of techniques of improving the low heat generating properties of a rubber composition include the one described in JP4478262B (PTL 1), where a rubber composition uses a modified conjugated diene-based polymer as a rubber component, and the modified conjugated diene-based polymer is obtained by reacting a specific imino group-containing hydrocarbyloxysilane compound.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Because the dispersibility of filler is improved in the rubber composition of PTL 1, a certain rolling resistance-reducing effect can be obtained when the rubber composition is applied to a tire. However, the improvement effect of the rubber composition of PTL 1 is insufficient to meet the recent demand for fuel efficiency, and it is desired to further improve the low heat generating properties.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">To improve the low heat generating properties of a rubber composition, it is conceivable to reduce the content of filler such as carbon black. However, this may deteriorate the performance of rubber such as processability, reinforcing properties, wear resistance, and steering stability when applied to a tire. Therefore, it is desired to develop a technique capable of greatly improving the low heat generating properties without deteriorating performance other than the low heat generating properties.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">PTL 1: JP4478262B</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">It could thus be helpful to provide a rubber composition having excellent low heat generating properties without deteriorating other performance, and a tire having greatly improved rolling resistance.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0008">As a result of studies to solve the above problems, we found that, by using a conjugated diene-based polymer modified with a specific modifier having oligosiloxane and a tertiary amino group as a rubber component, excellent low heat generating properties can be obtained without deteriorating other performance.

More specifically, they may each independently be a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. When substituted, they can be substituted with a substituent as described above for R1 to R4. When R5 to R8 are not an alkyl group but a hydrolyzable substituent, the bonds of N&#x2014;R5R6 and N&#x2014;R7R8 may be hydrolyzed to N&#x2014;H in the presence of water, which may adversely affect the processability of the polymer.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0032">More specifically, in the compound represented by the formula (1), R1 to R4 may be a methyl group or an ethyl group, and R5 to R8 may be an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0033">In the present disclosure, the amino group in the compound represented by the formula (1), that is, N&#x2014;R5R6 and N&#x2014;R7R8 are preferably a tertiary amino group. The tertiary amino group provides better processability when the compound represented by the formula (1) is used as a modifier.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0034">Note that when a protecting group for protecting an amino group is bonded to the R5 to R8, or hydrogen is bonded to the R5 to R8, it may be difficult to obtain the effect of the compound represented by the formula (1). When hydrogen is bonded, anions react with the hydrogen during the modification and lose their reactivity, rendering the modification reaction itself impossible. When a protecting group is bonded, the modification reaction will proceed, but it is deprotected by hydrolysis during subsequent processing in a state of being bonded to the polymer terminal, resulting in a primary or secondary amino group. The deprotected primary or secondary amino group may cause a high viscosity in the product during subsequent composition and may cause a decrease in processability.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0035">In the compound represented by the formula (1), L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>are each independently a substituted or unsubstituted alkylene group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0036">More specifically, L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>are each independently an alkylene group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms.

However, if Si is directly bonded to N, the bond between Si and N may be broken during subsequent processing, and a secondary amino group formed in this case is likely to be washed away by water during subsequent processing. Then, it is difficult to bond a modified conjugated diene-based polymer thus obtained to a silica filler through a member of the amino group that promotes the bond with a silica filler, which may deteriorate the dispersion effect of a dispersant. Considering the improvement effect by the length of the bond between Si and N, the L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>are more preferably each independently an alkylene group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms such as a methylene group, an ethylene group, or a propylene group, and more specifically, they may be a propylene group. Further, L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2 </sub>may be substituted with a substituent as described above for R1 to R4.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0038">The compound represented by the formula (1) is preferably, for example, any one of the compounds represented by the following formulas (1a) to (1e).

In this way, the bond between the filler and the modified conjugated diene-based polymer can be promoted as compared with a conventional modifier containing one amino group in the molecule. Further, the degree of bonding of the activated terminal of the conjugated diene-based polymer is uniform, and it is found that, when observing the change in molecular weight distribution before and after coupling, the molecular weight distribution after coupling does not increase as compared to before coupling and is kept constant. Therefore, the physical properties of the modified conjugated diene-based polymer itself are not deteriorated, the aggregation of the filler in the rubber composition can be prevented, and the dispersibility of the filler can be improved. As a result, the processability of the rubber composition can be improved. These effects can particularly improve the fuel efficiency properties, wear properties and braking properties in a well-balanced manner when the rubber composition is applied to a tire.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0040">Note that the compound represented by the formula (1) can be obtained through a condensation reaction represented by the following reaction formula 1.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-C00006" he="74.85mm" wi="54.53mm" file="US20230002533A1-20230105-C00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0049" num="0041">In the reaction formula 1, R1 to R8, L1 and L2, and n are the same as those defined in the formula (1) above, and R&#x2032; and R&#x2033; are arbitrary substituents that do not affect the condensation reaction.

When the molecular weight distribution of the modified conjugated diene-based polymer exceeds 3.0 or is less than 1.1, the tensile properties and the viscoelasticity may deteriorate when applied to the rubber composition.
