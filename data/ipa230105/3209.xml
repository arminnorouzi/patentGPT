The pump assembly <b>10</b> is configured for providing pressurized/compressed air for use in a downstream application. Such air may be provided to the pump assembly <b>10</b> through air inlets (e.g., a first air inlet <b>14</b>A and a second air inlet <b>14</b>B) and may be discharged through air outlets (e.g., a first air outlet <b>18</b>A and a second air outlet <b>18</b>B). In other embodiments, the pump assembly <b>10</b> may include any number or arrangement of air inlets and air outlets. The pump assembly <b>10</b> may be powered by any suitable power source, including AC or DC power sources. In the illustrated embodiment, the pump assembly <b>10</b> includes an electrical connector <b>22</b> for receiving power from the power source.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a pneumatic system <b>300</b> including the pump assembly <b>10</b>. The pneumatic system <b>300</b> may be a portion of an automobile. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the pneumatic system <b>300</b> is part of an automobile seating assembly. Other applications of the pneumatic system <b>300</b> are contemplated, however, such as aerospace applications, office/desk chair applications, or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the illustrated embodiment, the pneumatic system <b>300</b> includes a power source <b>301</b>, which may be part of an electrical power system of an automobile. The connector <b>22</b> is configured to connect to the power source <b>301</b>. As such, the power source <b>301</b> may supply power <b>302</b> (e.g., DC power at 12 Volts, 24 Volts, or 28 Volts in some embodiments) to the pump assembly <b>10</b> via the connector <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the pump assembly <b>10</b> is powered, the pump assembly <b>10</b> may operate to pump air from the atmosphere into the pump assembly <b>10</b> through the air inlets <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B and then pump the air out through the of <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B. For example, air may flow from the outlets <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B through a pneumatic line <b>306</b>. In some embodiments, the pump assembly <b>10</b> may include a single outlet and/or a single air inlet.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The pneumatic line <b>306</b> may include one or more valves <b>303</b> along or at either end of the pneumatic line <b>306</b>. The valves <b>303</b> may be a single valve and/or may be multiple valves, and in either case may serve to: (i) direct air along the pneumatic line <b>306</b> from the pump assembly <b>10</b>, (ii) stop a flow of air along the pneumatic line <b>306</b> directed from the pump assembly <b>10</b>, (iii) regulate pressure of a flow of air through the pneumatic line <b>306</b>, and/or (iv) regulate flow rate of a flow of air through the pneumatic line <b>306</b>. For example, the valves <b>303</b> may include one or more check valves, pressure relief valves, flow-regulating valves, or the like. Additionally or alternatively, the valves <b>303</b> may include a release valve, which may allow air to vent from the pneumatic line <b>306</b> to the atmosphere or into another, connected pneumatic line. The valves <b>303</b> may be passive valves or active valves in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the valves <b>303</b> may be incorporated into the pump assembly <b>10</b> as an integrated assembly.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The pneumatic line <b>306</b> may be connected to one or more bladders <b>305</b>.

As the connecting rods <b>86</b> reciprocate, the center portions <b>122</b> of the diaphragms <b>90</b> flex from the intake position to the compression position.

This arrangement, together with the positioning of the pairs <b>86</b>A, <b>90</b>A and <b>86</b>B, <b>90</b>B on opposite sides of the axis <b>78</b>, advantageously reduces vibration and noise by effectively cancelling out first and second order forces and moments exerted by the moving connecting rods <b>86</b> on the crank shaft <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, movement of each of the diaphragms <b>90</b> from the compression position to the intake position (i.e. the intake stroke) creates negative pressure within the respective air chambers <b>126</b>, which draws air into the housing <b>26</b> through the air inlets <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B along an airflow path <b>149</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Movement of each of the diaphragms <b>90</b> from the intake position to the compression position (i.e. the pumping stroke) creates positive pressure within the respective air chambers <b>126</b>, thereby discharging pressurized air out of the housing <b>26</b> through the outlets <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B along an airflow path <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the airflow <b>149</b> is drawn in through the air inlets <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B and then into the interior volume <b>74</b> of the main housing <b>38</b> through transfer ports <b>158</b>.

The airflow is then drawn from the interior of the main housing <b>738</b>, through the air inlet passageways <b>762</b>, through the air intake valves <b>843</b>, and into the air chambers <b>826</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As the diaphragms <b>790</b> are moved from the intake position A to the compression position B, the air is forced out of the air chambers <b>826</b> and through the air outlet valves <b>844</b>. The expelled air then flows into the air outlet passageway <b>766</b>. From the air outlet passageway <b>766</b>, the air is directed through the air outlet <b>718</b> (e.g., and into the pneumatic line <b>300</b> where it may be used as described above in reference to the pneumatic system <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the illustrated embodiment, the pump assembly <b>710</b> may be operable to pump at least 6 liters of fluid (e.g., air, or other pumpable fluids) per minute. Additionally, the pump assembly <b>710</b> may be operable to produce a pump outlet pressure of at least 70 kPa.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The pump assembly <b>10</b> described and illustrated herein thus includes multiple diaphragms <b>790</b>, arranged in four planes that are not co-planar. In the illustrated embodiment, the pump assembly <b>10</b> includes multiple diaphragms in each of the four planes. The diaphragms <b>790</b> are actuated by a central crank shaft <b>782</b>, which allows the phase of each diaphragm <b>790</b> to be independently set to minimize noise and vibration. This arrangement may also provide a relatively high pumping capacity or maximum flow rate, while minimizing the overall size of the pump assembly <b>710</b>. As such, the pump assembly <b>710</b> and variations thereof described and/or illustrated herein may be particularly advantageous for use in applications, (such as automotive, furniture, and aviation applications), in which operating noise, vibration, and package size are of high importance. Finally, because each of the air chambers <b>826</b> is in fluid communication with the single outlet <b>718</b>, the pump assembly <b>710</b> in some embodiments may configured to provide four or more pulses of air per revolution of the drive shaft <b>770</b>. By providing a greater number of pulses, the relative magnitude of each particular pulse may be reduced compared to a pump that delivers one or two pulses per revolution, for example. This may further reduce the noise produced during operation of the pump assembly <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Various features and advantages of the disclosure are set forth in the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-24" num="01-24"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>24</b>.
