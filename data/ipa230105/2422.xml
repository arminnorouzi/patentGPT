In addition, when the thin-film forming raw material is vaporized to obtain vapor in the raw material container or in the vaporization chamber, the pressure in the raw material container and the pressure in the vaporization chamber preferably fall within the range of from 1 Pa to 10,000 Pa.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">Herein, as a material for the substrate to be set in the deposition reaction portion, there are given, for example: silicon; ceramics, such as silicon nitride, titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, titanium oxide, titanium nitride, ruthenium oxide, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, and lanthanum oxide; glass; and metals, such as metal cobalt and metal ruthenium. The shape of the substrate is, for example, a plate shape, a spherical shape, a fibrous shape, or a scaly shape. The surface of the substrate may be planar, or may have a three-dimensional structure, such as a trench structure.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">Precursor Layer Formation Step</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">In the precursor layer formation step, the tin compound in the raw material gas introduced into the deposition reaction portion having the substrate set therein is deposited on the surface of the substrate, to thereby form the precursor layer on the surface of the substrate. At this time, heat may be applied by heating the substrate or heating the deposition reaction portion. There are no particular limitations on the conditions under which the precursor layer is formed, but for example, a reaction temperature (substrate temperature), a reaction pressure, a deposition rate, and the like may appropriately be determined depending on a desired thickness of the precursor layer and the kind of the thin-film forming raw material. The reaction temperature is preferably not less than 50&#xb0; C. that is the temperature at which the thin-film forming raw material of the present invention sufficiently reacts with the surface of the substrate, more preferably from 50&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C. A film thickness is controlled by the number of cycles so that a desired film thickness is obtained. The reaction pressure is preferably from 1 Pa to 10,000 Pa, more preferably from 10 Pa to 1,000 Pa.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075">When the thin-film forming raw material contains the other precursor than the tin compound of the present invention, the other precursor is also deposited on the surface of the substrate together with the tin compound.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0076">(Exhaust Step)</p><p id="p-0080" num="0077">After the precursor layer has been formed, an unreacted raw material gas containing the tin compound not having been deposited on the surface of the substrate is exhausted from the deposition reaction portion. At this time, it is ideal that the raw material gas be completely exhausted from the deposition reaction portion, but it is not always required that the gas be completely exhausted. As an exhaust method, there are given, for example, a method involving purging the inside of the system of the deposition reaction portion with an inert gas, such as helium, nitrogen, or argon, an exhaust method involving performing exhaust by decompressing the inside of the system, and a combination of these methods. The degree of decompression in the case of performing decompression falls within the range of preferably from 0.01 Pa to 300 Pa, more preferably from 0.01 Pa to 100 Pa.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0078">(Second Step)</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">In the second step, the reactive gas is introduced into the deposition reaction portion after the exhaust step so that the reactive gas is caused to react with the precursor layer, that is, the tin compound having been deposited on the surface of the substrate through the action of the reactive gas or through the action of the reactive gas and the action of heat. Examples of the reactive gas include: oxidizing gases, such as oxygen, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, water vapor, hydrogen peroxide, formic acid, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride; reducing gases, such as hydrogen; organic amine compounds, such as a monoalkylamine, a dialkylamine, a trialkylamine, and an alkylenediamine; and nitriding gases, such as hydrazine and ammonia. Those reactive gases may be used alone or as a mixture thereof. The thin-film forming raw material of the present invention has the property of reacting with the oxidizing gases out of those gases at specifically low temperatures, and particularly, can react with ozone and water vapor at low temperatures. A gas containing ozone or water vapor is preferably used as the reactive gas, and a gas containing water vapor is more preferably used as the reactive gas because a film thickness obtained per cycle is large, and a thin-film can be produced with good productivity.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">When the reactive gas is the oxidizing gas, and only the tin compound of the present invention is used as the precursor in the first step, a tin atom on the surface of the substrate is oxidized to form a tin oxide thin-film. At this time, a component other than the tin atom in the precursor layer turns into a by-product gas.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">There are no particular limitations on the reaction conditions, but for example, a reaction temperature (substrate temperature), a reaction pressure, a deposition rate, and the like may appropriately be determined depending on a desired film thickness and the kind of the reactive gas. The temperature when the heat is applied preferably falls within the range of from room temperature to 500&#xb0; C., more preferably from 50&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C. An ALD window in the case of using the thin-film forming raw material of the present invention and the reactive gas in combination falls within the range of from about 50&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C., and hence the precursor layer and the reactive gas are more preferably caused to react with each other at a temperature within the range of from 50&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. The pressure in the deposition reaction portion when this step is performed is preferably from 1 Pa to 10,000 Pa, more preferably from 10 Pa to 1,000 Pa.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">The thin-film forming raw material of the present invention has satisfactory reactivity with the reactive gas, and hence when the thin-film forming raw material of the present invention is used, a high-quality tin-containing thin-film containing less residual carbon can be produced with good productivity.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">(Exhaust Step)</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">After the second step, the unreacted reactive gas and the by-product gas are exhausted from the deposition reaction portion. At this time, it is ideal that the reactive gas and the by-product gas be completely exhausted from the deposition reaction portion, but it is not always required that the gases be completely exhausted. An exhaust method and the degree of decompression in the case of performing decompression are the same as those in the above-mentioned exhaust step performed between the first step and the second step.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">When the ALD method is adopted as described above in the method of producing a thin-film of the present invention, thin-film deposition performed by a series of operations in which the first step, the exhaust step, the second step, and the exhaust step are performed in the stated order is defined as one cycle. The cycle is repeated a plurality of times until a thin-film having a required film thickness is obtained. Thus, a tin-containing thin-film having a desired film thickness can be produced. According to the method of producing a thin-film by the ALD method, the film thickness of the tin-containing thin-film to be formed can be controlled by the number of the cycles.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">When the film thickness of the tin-containing thin-film obtained per cycle is large, the characteristics of the thin-film may deteriorate.

When the output of a radiofrequency wave (hereinafter sometimes referred to as &#x201c;RF&#x201d;) at the time of the plasma treatment is excessively low, a satisfactory tin-containing thin-film is hardly obtained, and when the output is excessively high, damage to the substrate is increased. Accordingly, the output of the radiofrequency wave is preferably from 0 W to 1,500 W, more preferably from 50 W to 600 W.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">In addition, in the method of producing a thin-film of the present invention, after the formation of the tin-containing thin-film, annealing treatment may be performed under an inert atmosphere, an oxidizing atmosphere, or a reducing atmosphere in order to obtain more satisfactory electrical characteristics. When step embedding is required, a reflow step may be provided. The temperature of the atmosphere in this case is preferably from 200&#xb0; C. to 1,000&#xb0; C., more preferably from 250&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">The tin-containing thin-film to be produced by using the thin-film forming raw material of the present invention may be formed as a desired kind of thin-film, which covers a substrate formed of, for example, a metal, an oxide ceramic, a nitride ceramic, or glass, by appropriately selecting the other precursor, the reactive gas, and the production conditions. The tin-containing thin-film of the present invention is excellent in electrical characteristics and optical characteristics, and hence can be widely used in the production of, for example, electrode materials for memory elements typified by DRAM elements, resistance films, diamagnetic films used for the recording layers of hard disks, and catalyst materials for polymer electrolyte fuel cells.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">While the method of producing a tin-containing thin-film by the ALD method has been described in this embodiment, the method of producing a thin-film through use of the thin-film forming raw material of the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned method, and only needs to be a method comprising introducing a raw material gas obtained by vaporizing the thin-film forming raw material into a deposition reaction portion having a substrate set therein, and subjecting the tin compound in the raw material gas to decomposition and/or a chemical reaction in the deposition reaction portion, to thereby produce a tin-containing thin-film on the surface of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">For example, the tin-containing thin-film may be produced by a CVD method through use of the thin-film forming raw material containing the tin compound of the present invention.
