For example, in a gaming context, gamers may express their affinity for, or association with, a particular video game by purchasing and wearing articles of clothing that display imagery related to the video game. However, unlike video game platforms for which gamers may purchase many different games for a single platform, articles of clothing are static and only capable of representing a single fixed image (or set of images) per article of clothing. This means that for a gamer wishing to self-express through their clothing an affinity for multiple video games, the gamer would have to purchase different articles of clothing for each game. This problem is further compounded by the continual development and release of new video games over time, thereby requiring the purchase of more and more articles of clothing if the gamer wishes to express their affinity or support for additional games.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is in this context that implementations of the disclosure arise.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Implementations of the disclosure are drawn to clothing and merchandise having a display capability, and triggering changes in display based on attachment/detachment of separate components.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some implementations, a garment system is provided, including: a main component configured to be worn by a user, the main component having a flexible display portion and a sensor;

In some implementations, the imagery presented on the display of the garment can be controlled or set through an app on a mobile device such as a cellular phone. Such imagery can be purchased from a marketplace or otherwise obtained or downloaded from a cloud digital asset system. In some implementations, images can be earned through gameplay of a video game, such as by attaining access to certain images by virtue of successful achievement of certain levels in a given video game, or by earning digital rewards/points through gameplay which can be redeemed for video game related images.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some implementations, a detachable component is provided for use with a main garment, wherein the attachment or detachment of the detachable component from the main garment can be configured to trigger a change in the imagery that is presented on the display of the garment. By way of example, a detachable hood can be configured to trigger a change in imagery presented on a display on a jacket when the hood is attached or detached from the jacket.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> conceptually illustrates a garment and associated detachable components, in accordance with implementation of the disclosure. In the illustrated implementation, a jacket <b>100</b> is shown, having a display <b>102</b> integrated therein. The display <b>102</b> is flexible and configurable to show various types of imagery as set by the user or in accordance with other techniques as described in further detail below. In some implementations, the display <b>102</b> is defined by an e-ink display, LED/OLED display, a color changing textile, or other flexible display technology capable of being integrated into a garment, or combinations of such technologies thereof. In some implementations, an e-ink display is layered over a color changing textile, such that the e-ink display can be utilized to draw images while the color changing textile is controlled to define the background color(s) for the drawn images.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An electronics module <b>104</b> is also integrated into the jacket <b>100</b>. The electronics module <b>104</b> includes various componentry such as a battery, processor, memory and communications hardware to enable the control of imagery rendered on the display <b>102</b>, and enable communication with external devices. For example, a user may obtain or purchase a design to be rendered to their jacket <b>100</b> through an app on their cell phone, and the electronics module <b>104</b> communicates wirelessly with the user's cell phone in order to receive the design and then apply the design to the display <b>102</b> for rendering. In some implementations, the electronics module <b>104</b> is removable from the jacket <b>100</b>, for example, via a detachable connector system so that the electronics module <b>104</b> can be removed from the jacket for charging the battery or when the user wishes to launder the jacket <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some implementations, various detachable components are provided which can be attached and detached from the jacket <b>100</b>. For example, a hood <b>108</b> or a collar <b>110</b> are provided as examples of detachable components which can be attached to the collar <b>106</b> of the jacket <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the attachment mechanism entails an array of magnets so that the detachable component is easily attached and detached. In other implementations, the attachment mechanism can utilize any of various other types of attachment mechanisms such as buttons, zipper, Velcro, clips, snap on buttons, or any other type of mechanism capable of attaching a component to a main article of clothing as in the presently described embodiments.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another example in the illustrated implementation of a detachable component are the cuffs <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b</i>, which are attachable to the ends of the sleeves of the jacket <b>100</b>. It will be appreciated that the attachment mechanisms for the cuffs <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>can be the same as those utilized for the hood <b>108</b> or the collar <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, the jacket can be configured to detect when a given detachable component is attached or detached. Furthermore, detection of such attachment or detachment events can be utilized to trigger rendering of predefined imagery on the display <b>102</b> of the jacket <b>100</b>. For example, the display <b>102</b> can be configured to render a first image when the hood <b>108</b> is attached to the jacket <b>100</b>, and then when the hood <b>108</b> is removed from the jacket, then this may trigger rendering of a second pre-defined image on the display <b>102</b>. It will be appreciated that similar effects can be provided in response to attachment or detachment of the collar <b>110</b> or the cuffs <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b</i>. As described in further detail below, sensors such as Hall effect sensors can be utilized to detect attachment or detachment of a given component when magnetic mechanisms are utilized for attachment of the component. The electronics module <b>104</b> can be configured to receive input from such sensors, and based on the input as it indicates the attachment status of a component to the jacket <b>100</b>, so the electronics module <b>104</b> can responsively trigger the rendering on the display <b>102</b> based on whether the component is being attached or detached from the jacket.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In further implementations, detachable components may themselves include displays such as that described with reference to the jacket <b>100</b>. That is, components can be configured to include integrated flexible displays capable of rendering images or colors or patterns, which can be set by the user or triggered in response to certain input or events. By way of example, in some implementations the attachment or detachment of a given component may trigger changes in rendering on that component. For example, when the hood <b>108</b> is attached to the jacket <b>100</b> this may trigger a change in the imagery or color of the hood <b>108</b>, and likewise detachment of the hood <b>108</b> from the jacket <b>100</b> may also trigger such a change.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some implementations, the electronics model <b>104</b> can include a GPS unit, enabling tracking of the location of the jacket, which can be used to trigger presentation of, or changes to, images or designs on the jacket. In some implementations, a given design is associated with a given location, so that when the jacket is determined, according to the GPS unit, to be at the given location, then the given design is rendered on the jacket.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">While implementations of the present disclosure have been described with reference to a jacket and associated detachable components, it will be appreciated that in various implementations the principles of the present disclosure can be applied to any type of garment or clothing and corresponding detachable components. By way of example without limitation, other types of detachable components can include pockets, zipper pulls, hems, patches, etc.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> conceptually illustrates a system for enabling digital assets to be presented on an article of clothing, in accordance with implementations of the disclosure. In the illustrated implementation, the jacket <b>100</b> is shown with a conceptually expanded view of the electronics module <b>104</b> that has been previously described. The electronics module <b>104</b> includes various hardware to enable control and rendering on the display <b>102</b> of the jacket <b>100</b>. For example, the electronics model <b>104</b> can include a processor <b>204</b>, a memory <b>206</b>, a battery <b>208</b>, a controller <b>210</b>, and a wireless transceiver <b>212</b>. The processor and memory are configured to enable storage and execution of program instructions to provide functionality in accordance with embodiments described herein. The battery <b>208</b> provides power for the electronics module <b>104</b> as well as the display <b>102</b> of the track at <b>100</b>. The controller <b>210</b> is configured to control and effect rendering on the display <b>102</b>. The wireless transceiver <b>212</b> enables wireless communications between the electronics module <b>104</b> and other devices such as a cell phone <b>200</b>. In some implementations, wireless communications are enabled using a wireless protocol such as Bluetooth.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some implementations, control of the imagery to be displayed on the jacket <b>100</b> is controlled through an app <b>202</b> installed on the cell phone <b>200</b>. In some implementations, the app <b>202</b> enables predefined images to be selected and rendered to the jacket <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the app <b>202</b> can further provide an interface enabling a user to customize rendering on the jacket <b>100</b>. For example the app <b>202</b> may provide in interface for drawing or otherwise creating designs for rendering on the jacket, or enable adjustments to settings such as background colors or patterns, etc. For example, in the case of an e-ink film formed over a color changing textile, an interface can be provided to enable drawing of a grayscale image to be rendered by the e-ink film, and setting of one or more colors and or patterns to be rendered by the color changing textile.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some implementations, the app <b>202</b> accesses a digital asset service <b>216</b> over a network <b>214</b>. The network <b>214</b> can include any of various kinds of communications/data networks including the Internet. It will be appreciated that the jacket <b>100</b> can be configured to present imagery that is obtained via the digital asset service <b>216</b>. For example the digital asset service <b>216</b> can provide for user accounts <b>218</b>, wherein a given user account can have one or more designs associated therewith, which can be enabled for the given user's jacket. Thus, a user operating the app <b>202</b>, can thereby access the digital asset service to obtain designs which are stored to their user account, and which can then be downloaded and rendered to the jacket <b>100</b>. In some implementations, specific designs are downloaded through the app <b>202</b> and wirelessly transferred to the electronics module <b>104</b> to be stored and rendered for display. It will be appreciated that the app <b>202</b> can facilitate pairing of the jacket <b>100</b> to the cell phone <b>200</b> and registration of the jacket <b>100</b> in association with a user's account.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It will be appreciated that attachment items can also be registered to a user's account. In some implementations, an attachment can be paired to another article, such as a hood being paired to a specific jacket, and such pairing may be managed through the app <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some implementations, the digital asset service <b>216</b> provides access to a digital marketplace <b>220</b> through which designs can be purchased or otherwise obtained. In some implementations, purchase of a design can utilize various types of currency, including fiat currencies as well as virtual currencies such as points or rewards, cryptocurrencies, etc. in some implementations, users can contribute designs to the digital marketplace <b>220</b> and receive at least a portion of revenues generated through sales of such designs.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, the digital asset service <b>216</b> is linked to, or a part of, a gaming service <b>226</b>. The gaming service <b>226</b> is configured to track information about users' gaming activity. For example, in some implementations users can earn points or rewards through their gameplay, and such points or rewards can be redeemed in the digital marketplace <b>220</b> for designs that can be rendered on their garment such as jacket <b>100</b>. In some implementations, user gameplay can be configured to directly earn specific designs, such as a user earning a design by passing a certain level of a video game. It will be appreciated that such designs, whether purchased or directly earned or otherwise obtained, will be associated with a user's user account, and thereby enabled for use with a given garment capable of display of the design as presently described.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some implementations, the digital asset service <b>216</b> implements digital rights management logic <b>222</b> to control aspects of the designs relating to digital rights management. For example, a given design may be configured to have a limited lifespan of usability, and the DRM logic <b>222</b> can accordingly manage the expiration of such a design. For example, in some implementations, a digital signature authorizing a specific pattern may be valid for a specific amount of time, and then if not re-upped or extended, then the pattern would no longer continue to be drawn.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some implementations, the amount of time that a given design is displayed by the jacket <b>100</b> is tracked for purposes of DRM attribution. For example, the user may switch between various designs and therefore it is useful to determine how much time a given design is actually displayed. In some implementations, a total time limit for display of a design may be implemented, and the amount/duration of time the design is displayed is tracked to determine when the time limit is reached.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some implementations, the digital asset service <b>216</b> further implements an event service <b>224</b> that is configured to handle event-based designs such as that described in further detail below. For example, designs can be promulgated to enable garments worn by users at a given event. That is, users may enable their garments to receive designs or images from specified parties, and these received designs/images can be automatically triggered at a given event to render to the users' garments.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Though the jacket <b>100</b> has been described as being managed through an app on a cellular phone, in other implementations such an app (or an application) can be implemented on other devices such as a tablet, laptop computer, PC, game console, or any other device capable of communications with the jacket. In some implementations, the jacket can be managed through a web interface accessed through a web browser. In some implementations, the jacket <b>100</b> is connected using a wired connection instead of a wireless connection. In some implementations, the electronics module is removable and configured to be connected to another device to enable pre-configuration of the electronics module, for example, to load pre-defined images/designs for rendering, to set-up triggering events and responses, etc. Then when the jacket <b>100</b> is worn by the user, the jacket's display (or that of an attachment) is automatically triggered to change rendering based on events such as those described herein.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some implementations, the jacket <b>100</b> is a networked device capable of connecting directly to the network <b>214</b>. For example, the jacket <b>100</b> may connect over the network <b>214</b> to the digital asset service <b>216</b> and be managed via communication with the digital asset service <b>216</b>. For example, the user operating the app <b>202</b> may interact with the digital asset service <b>216</b> through the app <b>202</b>, and changes to the configuration of the jacket <b>100</b> can be communicated to the jacket <b>100</b> over the network <b>214</b> by the digital asset service <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a close-up view of a hood attachment for a jacket, in accordance with implementations of the disclosure. As shown in the illustrated implementation, the hood <b>108</b> is configured to attach to the jacket <b>100</b>, as has been described. In some implementations, the attachment of the hood <b>108</b> is implemented through a system of magnets on the hood and/or the jacket. In the illustrated implementation, the hood <b>108</b> includes a collar portion <b>300</b> having a plurality of permanent magnets <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, <b>302</b><i>c</i>, <b>302</b><i>d</i>, and <b>302</b><i>e </i>integrated therein. The magnet configuration as shown is provided by way of example without limitation, as there can be any number of magnets, or an array of magnets, which may be arranged along the collar portion <b>300</b> in any configuration that facilitates attachment of the hood <b>108</b> to the jacket <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Along the collar portion <b>106</b> of the jacket <b>100</b>, there are a plurality of corresponding attachment portions <b>310</b><i>a</i>, <b>310</b><i>b</i>, <b>310</b><i>c</i>, <b>310</b><i>d</i>, and <b>310</b><i>e</i>, which are configured to align with the magnets <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, <b>302</b><i>c</i>, <b>302</b><i>d</i>, and <b>302</b><i>e</i>, respectively, when the hood <b>108</b> is attached to the jacket <b>100</b>. The attachment portions can be defined from a ferromagnetic material such that the magnets <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are attracted to the ferromagnetic material. In some implementations, the attachment portions <b>310</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>consist of permanent magnets configured so that their polarity is arranged in a manner so that the magnets <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are attracted thereto to facilitate attachment of the hood <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some implementations, the collar portion <b>106</b> of the jacket <b>100</b> further includes sensors <b>312</b><i>a </i>and <b>312</b><i>b </i>for detected attachment or detachment of the hood <b>108</b>. In some implementations, the sensors <b>312</b><i>a </i>and <b>312</b><i>b </i>consist of Hall effect sensors which detect the presence or absence of the magnetic fields produced by the magnets <b>302</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>. In this manner, the sensors <b>312</b><i>a </i>and <b>312</b><i>b </i>are capable of detecting when the hood is attached or detached by detecting the change in the magnetic fields. In some implementations, the sensors <b>312</b><i>a </i>and <b>312</b><i>b </i>are connected to the electronics module <b>104</b>, which processes (e.g. using a processor/memory of the electronics module <b>104</b>) the signals from the sensors <b>312</b><i>a </i>and <b>312</b><i>b</i>, to determine whether the hood is attached or detached from the jacket <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some implementations, the hood <b>108</b> further includes magnets <b>304</b><i>a </i>and <b>304</b><i>b</i>, which are disposed along the opening of the hood <b>108</b>. As shown, the magnets <b>304</b><i>a </i>and <b>304</b><i>b </i>are positioned so that their distance from the sensors <b>312</b><i>a </i>and <b>312</b><i>b </i>changes in accordance with the hood being worn up (on/covering the user's head) or down (collapsed on the user's back). Hence, in some implementations, the sensors are also capable of detecting, based on the changes in magnetic fields produced in accordance with the positioning of the magnets <b>304</b><i>a </i>and <b>304</b><i>b</i>, whether the hood is in an up or down configuration. In some implementations, the detected configuration of the hood being up or down can be used to trigger changes in content displayed on the jacket <b>100</b>, or on the hood <b>108</b> when equipped with a display mechanism.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some implementations, the electronics module <b>104</b> connects to the hood <b>108</b> via connector <b>314</b> (on the jacket collar <b>106</b>) which mates to a connector <b>316</b> (on the hood collar <b>300</b>) when the hood is attached to the jacket. The electronics module <b>104</b> can thereby provide control signals and power to the hood <b>108</b>, to control rendering of images/designs on display portions of the hood <b>108</b>, such as by rendering on an e-ink display or controlling color of color changing textiles that are integrated in the hood <b>108</b>. In other implementations, the hood is integrated with the jacket, and may be non-detachable from the jacket, so that connections to integrated displays of the hood need not be made via such connectors <b>314</b> and <b>316</b> as previously described.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a user wearing a hood in up and down configurations that trigger changes in display on a jacket, in accordance with implementations of the disclosure. In the illustrated implementation, at reference <b>400</b><i>a</i>, a user <b>404</b> wearing a jacket <b>100</b> with a hood <b>108</b> is shown. The hood is shown being worn in an up configuration, so as to cover the head of the user <b>404</b>. Whereas at reference <b>400</b><i>b</i>, the hood <b>108</b> is shown being worn in a down configuration, such that it lays along the back of the user <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some implementations, the up/down configuration of the hood <b>108</b> is detected as described above, and utilized to trigger display changes on the jacket <b>100</b>. For example, in the illustrated implementation, the hood's up/down configuration can trigger changes in rendering on a display <b>402</b> on the back of the jacket <b>100</b>. Such changes in rendering can include triggering rendering on or off in some implementations, or changing the design or image being rendered in some implementations, etc. In some implementations, wearing the hood in an up configuration triggers rendering to turn on and/or render a first image, whereas wearing the hood in a down configuration triggers rendering to turn off and/or change to a second image.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It will be appreciated that the jacket <b>100</b> can be configured to provide enhancements to the user experience in various group contexts. The jacket <b>100</b> can be configured to display specific imagery associated with a given event.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> conceptually illustrates a lead user configuring jackets of team members at a group event, in accordance with implementations of the disclosure. For example, at an e-sports tournament or other group event, users <b>506</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>514</b> may opt in to join a team, for example, via respective phone apps communicating with digital asset service <b>216</b>. A team leader <b>500</b> may set configuration details for jackets worn by team members, for example, through the app on the team leader's phone <b>504</b> accessing the digital asset service <b>216</b>. The digital asset service <b>216</b> propagates the jacket configuration to the team members. That is, by joining the team, the team members are enabled to download, through their respective phone apps, coordinated designs to their jackets for display. Such designs may be designated by the team leader <b>500</b> in some implementations.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some implementations, the app and/or jackets are configured so that team members' jackets automatically display the designated design for the team. For example, in some implementations, the jackets <b>508</b>, <b>512</b>, and <b>516</b>, which are worn by team members <b>506</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>514</b>, respectively, can thereby automatically be configured to display the same image as the jacket <b>502</b> worn by the team leader <b>500</b>. In some implementations, the jackets of a team can be configured to display one image when hoods are attached, and then when it is game time, the hoods are removed, triggering a different image to be displayed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some implementations, the team leader <b>500</b> may be a famous player/gamer, and the team members are fans of the team leader <b>500</b>. In this scenario, the team members are thereby able to express their support and share in the experience of wearing a design associated with the team leader <b>500</b>, which the team leader <b>500</b> might also be wearing or which may be complementary or otherwise related to the team leader's design.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some implementations, the team members <b>506</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>514</b> may automatically receive updates to their jackets <b>508</b>, <b>512</b> and <b>516</b>. It will be appreciated that designs can be dynamically updated over time, providing variety for the team members and others that may view the jackets.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> conceptually illustrates a user wearing a garment that receives wireless updates in a venue, in accordance with implementations of the disclosure. In the illustrated implementation, a user <b>600</b> is located in a venue/arena <b>608</b>, which in some implementations, is a venue for an e-sports event, but can be any other type of venue. The user <b>600</b> wears a garment <b>602</b> having a display <b>604</b> capable of displaying imagery as has been described. In some implementations, the venue <b>608</b> is configured to provide updates to the garment <b>602</b> through wireless transmission of data from various wireless transmitters <b>610</b><i>a</i>, <b>610</b><i>b</i>, <b>610</b><i>c</i>, and <b>610</b><i>d </i>as conceptually shown. The wireless transmitters are configured to transmit wireless payloads <b>618</b>, which are received by the garment <b>602</b> and applied to change the rendering on the display <b>604</b> of the garment <b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As users do not wish to expose themselves to unwanted changes to their garments, so it is important to permit secure access to a user's garment by only those parties that are authorized by the user. To this end, in some implementations, at operation <b>612</b> the user <b>600</b> may opt-in or whitelist a given source for updates, e.g., via an app on their cellular phone <b>606</b>, thereby indicating that the given source is a trusted source with permission to update the display on the user's garment. At operation <b>614</b>, a public key for the whitelisted source is obtained, and at operation <b>616</b>, the garment can be configured with the public key for the whitelisted source.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The wireless transmitters <b>610</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>broadcast wireless payloads <b>618</b> in the venue <b>608</b>. These payloads can be signed with respective private keys for security. Upon receipt of the wireless payloads <b>618</b>, the garment <b>602</b> (or specifically, an electronics module included in the garment, not shown) parses through the wireless payloads to identify which payload is from a whitelisted source, and further validates that the identified payload has been signed with a private key that can be validated using the public key of the whitelisted source. This verifies the sender/source of the payload by verifying the signature. And accordingly, the update, such as a design to be rendered on the display <b>604</b> of the user's garment, is applied, thereby automatically changing the appearance of the garment <b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">By way of example without limitation, in the context of an e-sports event, the wireless payloads <b>618</b> can include designs associated to a given team or player, such as a Team A Design <b>620</b>, a Team B Design <b>622</b>, etc. In the illustrated implementation, the user <b>600</b> has whitelisted Team A, and accordingly, the Team A Design <b>620</b> is applied to the user's garment <b>602</b>, rendering an image associated with Team A on the display <b>604</b> of the garment <b>602</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">It will be appreciated that the wireless payloads <b>618</b> can dynamically change as set by the provider. Teams at an e-sports tournament can configure their payloads to show imagery or information of their choosing, and these can change over time during the course of the tournament. In some implementations, the display of information such as stats or scores of a given team can be shown. In some implementations, scoreboards or leaderboards can be displayed. These and other types of information can be continually updated during the e-sports event, and users may opt-in to receive such updates and have them automatically drawn on their garments. Utilizing a system as described above, though wireless transmitters are sending out various payloads having various possible updates, a user's garment will accept and render only those updates that have been whitelisted, so that the user controls which updates will be accepted for rendering on their garment.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some implementations, wireless transmitters broadcast data using a wireless technology such as Bluetooth Low Energy, WiFi, ultra-wideband, etc. It will be appreciated that any wireless transmission protocol or technology can be employed that is capable of transmitting data to update a garment as presently described. In some implementations, the garment is configured to connect to a network to obtain the requisite data for updating the garment. In some implementations, the wireless payloads are managed and/or transmitted from a server, which may be local to or remote from the venue <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some implementations, the wireless payloads provided in different regions of the venue <b>608</b> can be different, so that the user's garment is updated with different designs as the user moves to the different regions of the venue. Accordingly, different wireless transmitters in the different regions can be configured to broadcast the different designs.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a related implementation, the geo-location of the user within the venue can be determined and used to trigger different rendering on the garment <b>602</b>. For example, the geo-location may be determined based on the wireless signals received by the garment <b>602</b>, such as based on the relative strengths of the signals or timing of the signals. In some implementations, the geo-location can be determined using GPS information, based on hardware incorporated into the garment or based on another device such as the user's cellular phone.

As noted above, an electronics module is provided which can include hardware and software for powering and controlling a garment display. In some implementations, the electronics module is removable for charging and to protect the electronics module when the garment is laundered. In the illustrated implementation, an electronics module <b>700</b> is conceptually shown in cross-section, which is configured to be detachable from the garment.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As conceptually shown, the electronics module <b>700</b> is configured to attach to a receptacle <b>708</b> that is integrated into the garment.

In some implementations, the electronics module includes magnets <b>702</b> and <b>704</b> that facilitate attachment of the electronics module <b>700</b> to the receptacle <b>708</b>. The protrusions <b>710</b> and <b>712</b> can be formed from a ferro-magnetic material to which the magnets <b>702</b> and <b>704</b> are attracted.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the electronics module <b>700</b> attaches to the receptacle <b>708</b>, a connection is made between corresponding connectors <b>706</b> and <b>714</b> of the electronics module and the receptacle, respectively. In some implementations, the connectors <b>706</b> and <b>714</b> are configured to make contact between conductive surfaces/contacts. In other implementations, the connectors <b>706</b> and <b>714</b> make an inductive connection, so that power and/or data are transferred without specific contact being made between conductive contacts. This also enables the electronics module <b>700</b> and the receptacle <b>708</b> to be sealed and protected from dirt or other contaminants, even when not connected to each other. When connection is made, then the electronics module is capable of controlling rendering on a display <b>720</b> integrated in the garment.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some implementations, the receptacle <b>708</b> is integrated or connected to the fabric <b>716</b> of the garment.

If the user of the client device initiating the request is not a registered user, then the cloud gaming site may identify the user as a new user and select the game titles (for e.g., a default set of game titles) that are appropriate for a new user. The identified game titles are returned to the client device for presenting on a display screen <b>1100</b>-<i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">User interaction at one of the game titles rendered on the client device is detected and a signal is sent to the cloud gaming site. The signal includes the game title information where the user interaction was detected and the user interaction registered at the game title. In response to the signal received from the client device, the cloud gaming site proactively determines a data center where the game is being hosted and sends a signal to the identified data center to load the game associated with the game title for which the user interaction is detected. In some embodiments, more than one data center may be hosting the game. In such embodiments, the cloud gaming site may determine the geo location of the client device initiating the request and identify a data center that is geographically close to the client device and signal the data center to pre-load the game. The geo location of the user may be determined using a Global Position System (GPS) mechanism within the client device, the client's IP address, the client's ping information, to name a few. Of course, the aforementioned ways to detect the geo location of the user may be exemplary and other types of mechanisms or tools may be used to determine the geo location of the user. Identification of a data center that is close to the client device can minimize latency during user interaction with the game. In some embodiments, the identified data center may not have the required bandwidth/capacity to host the game or may be overused. In these embodiments, the cloud gaming site may identify a second data center that is geographically close to the client device. The loading of the game includes loading game code and executing an instance of the game.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In response to receiving the signal from the cloud gaming site, the identified data center may select a server at the data center to instantiate the game on the server. The server is selected based on the hardware/software capabilities available and the game requirements. The server may include a plurality of game consoles and the server may determine which one of the plurality of game consoles to use to load the game. The game console may be similar to an independent game console, or may be a rack-mounted server or a blade server. The blade server, in turn, may include a plurality of server blades with each blade having required circuitry for instantiating a single dedicated application, such as the game. Of course, the game console described above is exemplary and should not be considered restrictive. Other types of game consoles, including game stations, etc., and other forms of blade server may also be engaged for hosting the identified game.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Once the game console is identified, the generic game-related code for the game is loaded onto the game console and a signal is returned to the client device via the cloud gaming site over the network identifying the game console on which the game is instantiated. The loaded game is thus made available to the user.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of an Information Service Provider architecture, in accordance with implementations of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Information Service Providers (ISP) <b>1270</b> delivers a multitude of information services to users <b>1282</b> geographically dispersed and connected via network <b>1286</b>. An ISP can deliver just one type of service, such as stock price updates, or a variety of services such as broadcast media, news, sports, gaming, etc. Additionally, the services offered by each ISP are dynamic, that is, services can be added or taken away at any point in time. Thus, the ISP providing a particular type of service to a particular individual can change over time. For example, a user may be served by an ISP in near proximity to the user while the user is in her home town, and the user may be served by a different ISP when the user travels to a different city. The home-town ISP will transfer the required information and data to the new ISP, such that the user information &#x201c;follows&#x201d; the user to the new city making the data closer to the user and easier to access. In another embodiment, a master-server relationship may be established between a master ISP, which manages the information for the user, and a server ISP that interfaces directly with the user under control from the master ISP. In another embodiment, the data is transferred from one ISP to another ISP as the client moves around the world to make the ISP in better position to service the user be the one that delivers these services.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">ISP <b>1270</b> includes Application Service Provider (ASP) <b>1272</b>, which provides computer-based services to customers over a network (e.g. including by way of example without limitation, any wired or wireless network, LAN, WAN, WiFi, broadband, cable, fiber optic, satellite, cellular (e.g. 4G, 5G, etc.), the Internet, etc.). Software offered using an ASP model is also sometimes called on-demand software or software as a service (SaaS). A simple form of providing access to a particular application program (such as customer relationship management) is by using a standard protocol such as HTTP. The application software resides on the vendor's system and is accessed by users through a web browser using HTML, by special purpose client software provided by the vendor, or other remote interface such as a thin client.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Services delivered over a wide geographical area often use cloud computing. Cloud computing is a style of computing in which dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources are provided as a service over the Internet. Users do not need to be an expert in the technology infrastructure in the &#x201c;cloud&#x201d; that supports them. Cloud computing can be divided into different services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Cloud computing services often provide common business applications online that are accessed from a web browser, while the software and data are stored on the servers. The term cloud is used as a metaphor for the Internet (e.g., using servers, storage and logic), based on how the Internet is depicted in computer network diagrams and is an abstraction for the complex infrastructure it conceals.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, ISP <b>1270</b> includes a Game Processing Server (GPS) <b>1274</b> which is used by game clients to play single and multiplayer video games. Most video games played over the Internet operate via a connection to a game server. Typically, games use a dedicated server application that collects data from players and distributes it to other players. This is more efficient and effective than a peer-to-peer arrangement, but it requires a separate server to host the server application. In another embodiment, the GPS establishes communication between the players and their respective game-playing devices exchange information without relying on the centralized GPS.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Dedicated GPSs are servers which run independently of the client. Such servers are usually run on dedicated hardware located in data centers, providing more bandwidth and dedicated processing power. Dedicated servers are the preferred method of hosting game servers for most PC-based multiplayer games. Massively multiplayer online games run on dedicated servers usually hosted by the software company that owns the game title, allowing them to control and update content.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Broadcast Processing Server (BPS) <b>1276</b> distributes audio or video signals to an audience. Broadcasting to a very narrow range of audience is sometimes called narrowcasting. The final leg of broadcast distribution is how the signal gets to the listener or viewer, and it may come over the air as with a radio station or TV station to an antenna and receiver, or may come through cable TV or cable radio (or &#x201c;wireless cable&#x201d;) via the station or directly from a network. The Internet may also bring either radio or TV to the recipient, especially with multicasting allowing the signal and bandwidth to be shared. Historically, broadcasts have been delimited by a geographic region, such as national broadcasts or regional broadcast. However, with the proliferation of fast internet, broadcasts are not defined by geographies as the content can reach almost any country in the world.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Storage Service Provider (SSP) <b>1278</b> provides computer storage space and related management services. SSPs also offer periodic backup and archiving. By offering storage as a service, users can order more storage as required. Another major advantage is that SSPs include backup services and users will not lose all their data if their computers' hard drives fail. Further, a plurality of SSPs can have total or partial copies of the user data, allowing users to access data in an efficient way independently of where the user is located or the device being used to access the data. For example, a user can access personal files in the home computer, as well as in a mobile phone while the user is on the move.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Communications Provider <b>1280</b> provides connectivity to the users. One kind of Communications Provider is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) which offers access to the Internet. The ISP connects its customers using a data transmission technology appropriate for delivering Internet Protocol datagrams, such as dial-up, DSL, cable modem, fiber, wireless or dedicated high-speed interconnects. The Communications Provider can also provide messaging services, such as e-mail, instant messaging, and SMS texting. Another type of Communications Provider is the Network Service provider (NSP) which sells bandwidth or network access by providing direct backbone access to the Internet. Network service providers may consist of telecommunications companies, data carriers, wireless communications providers, Internet service providers, cable television operators offering high-speed Internet access, etc.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Data Exchange <b>1288</b> interconnects the several modules inside ISP <b>1270</b> and connects these modules to users <b>1282</b> via network <b>1286</b>. Data Exchange <b>1288</b> can cover a small area where all the modules of ISP <b>1270</b> are in close proximity, or can cover a large geographic area when the different modules are geographically dispersed. For example, Data Exchange <b>1288</b> can include a fast Gigabit Ethernet (or faster) within a cabinet of a data center, or an intercontinental virtual area network (VLAN).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Users <b>1282</b> access the remote services with client device <b>1284</b>, which includes at least a CPU, a memory, a display and I/O. The client device can be a PC, a mobile phone, a netbook, tablet, gaming system, a PDA, etc. In one embodiment, ISP <b>1270</b> recognizes the type of device used by the client and adjusts the communication method employed. In other cases, client devices use a standard communications method, such as html, to access ISP <b>1270</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced with various computer system configurations including hand-held devices, microprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers and the like. The disclosure can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a wire-based or wireless network.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some embodiments, communication may be facilitated using wireless technologies. Such technologies may include, for example, 5G wireless communication technologies. 5G is the fifth generation of cellular network technology. 5G networks are digital cellular networks, in which the service area covered by providers is divided into small geographical areas called cells. Analog signals representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an analog to digital converter and transmitted as a stream of bits. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local antenna array and low power automated transceiver (transmitter and receiver) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the telephone network and the Internet by a high bandwidth optical fiber or wireless backhaul connection. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically transferred to the new cell. It should be understood that 5G networks are just an example type of communication network, and embodiments of the disclosure may utilize earlier generation wireless or wired communication, as well as later generation wired or wireless technologies that come after 5G.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">With the above embodiments in mind, it should be understood that the disclosure can employ various computer-implemented operations involving data stored in computer systems. These operations are those requiring physical manipulation of physical quantities. Any of the operations described herein that form part of the disclosure are useful machine operations. The disclosure also relates to a device or an apparatus for performing these operations. The apparatus can be specially constructed for the required purpose, or the apparatus can be a general-purpose computer selectively activated or configured by a computer program stored in the computer. In particular, various general-purpose machines can be used with computer programs written in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may be more convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the required operations.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The disclosure can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium. Alternately, the computer readable code may be downloaded from a server using the data exchange interconnects described above. The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data, which can be thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of the computer readable medium include hard drives, network attached storage (NAS), read-only memory, random-access memory, CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, CD-RWs, magnetic tapes and other optical and non-optical data storage devices. The computer readable medium can include computer readable tangible medium distributed over a network-coupled computer system so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Although the method operations were described in a specific order, it should be understood that other housekeeping operations may be performed in between operations, or operations may be adjusted so that they occur at slightly different times, or may be distributed in a system which allows the occurrence of the processing operations at various intervals associated with the processing, as long as the processing of the overlay operations are performed in the desired way.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Although the foregoing disclosure has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications can be practiced within the scope of the appended claims. Accordingly, the present embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the disclosure is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the described embodiments.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
