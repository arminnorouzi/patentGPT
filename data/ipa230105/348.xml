Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a fundus camera, particularly to fundus camera with several switchable illumination light sources.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The fundus camera has to introduce the illumination light source to pass through the pupil of the tested eyeball to the fundus for imaging. The light reflected from the fundus also passes through the pupil of the tested eyeball, imaged by an imaging system on the eye of the observer or an image sensor (or a film). The fundus camera may be used to observe whether the retina, the optical disc and the vasculature are abnormal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The traditional fundus camera uses white light as the illumination light source. However, white light is a broadband light source. While the traditional fundus camera captures the image of a fundus, the fundus image is in fact a superimposition of fundus information generated by lights of a plurality of wavelengths. In such a case, some specified symptoms may be covered. In order to reveal a specified symptom, it is necessary to use an illumination light with a specified wavelength to illuminate the fundus. Nevertheless, a multi-light source illumination mechanism is bulky and makes the fundus camera hard to be miniaturized and inconvenient to be operated by hand.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, many manufacturers are eager to develop a fundus camera with several switchable illumination light sources.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a fundus camera, which comprises a plurality of light emitting modules and uses a driving element to drive a specified light emitting module to a light emitting position to output an illumination light with required optical characteristics for capturing fundus images. The fundus camera of the present invention is compact in structure and able to quickly switch between different illumination light sources to acquire fundus images with different optical characteristics.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, the fundus camera of the present invention comprises an objective lens, an illumination device, an imaging lens group and an image sensor. The objective lens has a first side and a second side, and the first side faces the tested eyeball. The illumination device has a light emitting position and includes a plurality of light emitting modules and a driving element. Each light emitting module generates a corresponding illumination light. The optical characteristics of the lights generated by different light emitting modules are different. The driving element drives one of the light emitting modules to the light emitting position to output the illumination light with the required optical characteristics. The illumination light passes through the objective lens to illuminate the fundus of the tested eyeball, and the fundus reflects the illumination light to form an imaging light. The imaging lens group is coaxially disposed at the second side of the objective lens. The image sensor is disposed at a light output side of the imaging lens group. The imaging light passes through the objective lens and the imaging lens group in sequence and then focuses on the image sensor to form a fundus image.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The objective, technologies, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein certain embodiments of the present invention are set forth by way of illustration and example.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing conceptions and their accompanying advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated after being better understood by referring to the following detailed description, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing a fundus camera according to a first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing an illumination device of a fundus camera according to the first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing an illumination device of a fundus camera according to a second embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing control signals of an illumination device of a fundus camera according to the second embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing an illumination device of a fundus camera according to a third embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing an illumination device of a fundus camera according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram schematically showing an illumination device of a fundus camera according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Various embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below and illustrated in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Same or similar elements in Figures will be indicated by same or similar reference numbers. It is noted that the Figures are schematic and may not represent the actual size or number of the elements. For clearness of the Figures, some details may not be fully depicted.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In one embodiment, the fundus camera <b>10</b> of the present invention comprises an objective lens <b>11</b>, an illumination device <b>12</b>, an imaging lens group <b>13</b> and an image sensor <b>14</b>. The objective lens <b>11</b> has a first side and a second side, and the first side faces a tested eyeball <b>20</b>. The illumination device <b>12</b> generates an illumination light L<b>1</b>. The illumination light L<b>1</b> passes through the objective lens <b>11</b> and projects onto a fundus <b>21</b> of the tested eyeball <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, the illumination device <b>12</b> may be a coaxial illumination device. For example, the coaxial illumination device includes a hollow reflecting mirror or a ring-shape blocking plate, whereby while the illumination light passes through the pupil, it presents a ring-shape light spot coaxial with an optical axis O<b>1</b>; the imaging light, which is reflected by the fundus, penetrates from the central region of the ring-shape light spot. The coaxial illumination system also includes a relay lens. Thus, the total fundus camera is hard to be miniaturized. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the illumination device <b>12</b> is an off-axis point-type illumination device. In other words, the illumination device <b>12</b> is deviated from the optical axis O<b>1</b> of the objective lens <b>11</b>. Besides, the illumination light L<b>1</b> generated by the illumination device <b>12</b> is directly projected to the objective lens <b>11</b>, whereby the relay lens, reflecting mirror, etc. are omitted. In one embodiment, the objective lens <b>11</b> may be a single biconvex lens, whereby to decrease the ghosting effect that is generated by the objective lens <b>11</b> reflecting the illumination light L<b>1</b>. The detailed structure of the illumination device <b>12</b> is to be described below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The imaging lens group <b>13</b> is coaxially disposed at the second side of the objective lens <b>11</b>. The image sensor <b>14</b> is disposed at a light output side of the imaging lens group <b>13</b>. The fundus <b>21</b> reflects the illumination light L<b>1</b> to form an imaging light L<b>2</b>. The imaging light L<b>2</b> passes through the objective lens <b>11</b> and the imaging lens group <b>13</b> in sequence and then focuses on the image sensor <b>14</b> to form a fundus image. In one embodiment, the fundus camera <b>10</b> of the present invention further comprises a display device <b>16</b>. The display device <b>16</b> is electrically connected with the image sensor <b>14</b> and able to present the fundus image output by the image sensor <b>14</b>, whereby the operator can operate the fundus camera <b>10</b> or inspect the image quality of the fundus image.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In one embodiment, the illumination device includes a plurality of light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>b</i>, <b>121</b><i>c</i>, <b>121</b><i>d</i>, <b>121</b><i>e</i>, <b>121</b><i>f</i>, <b>121</b><i>g </i>and <b>121</b><i>h </i>and also includes a driving element <b>123</b>. The light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>may respectively generate illumination lights with different optical characteristics. For example, the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>may respectively generate illumination lights having different wavelength ranges, different polarization states, different light emitting angles, different light sources, or different combinations of the abovementioned optical characteristics. Bases on the fact that different tissues respectively absorb different spectra of lights, the signals respectively reflected by the tissues in different depths of the fundus are collected, and different signals may be combined to inspect abnormal symptoms. For example, green light may be used to detect fundus hemorrhage because blood vessels respond to green light more intensely; yellow-red lights are favorable to observe exudates of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), such as drusen, or observe angiogenesis. A wider light emitting angle is favorable for operations, such as finding symptoms. A narrower light emitting angle can decrease the reflection from the interior of the system and focus on the area of interest. The light sources may be selected from light emitting diodes (LED), laser LED, superluminescent diodes (SLD), light bulbs, etc.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The driving element <b>123</b> drives at least one of the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>to a light emitting position <b>124</b>, whereby to output an illumination light with the required optical characteristics. For example, the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>are disposed on a substrate <b>122</b>; the driving element <b>123</b> drives the light emitting module <b>121</b><i>a </i>to the light emitting position <b>124</b> and makes the illumination device output an illumination light with the required optical characteristics. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the driving element <b>124</b> moves the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>in a horizontal way, as indicated by the arrows.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the driving element <b>123</b> may be but is not limited to be a step motor or a motor with a position encoder, whereby the driving element <b>123</b> can accurately drive one of the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>to the light emitting position <b>124</b>. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In one embodiment, the driving element <b>123</b> of the fundus camera of the present invention further includes a position detector <b>125</b>. The position detector <b>125</b> can detect whether one of the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>is exactly corresponding to the light emitting position <b>124</b> and output a corresponding detection signal. According to the detection signal output by the position detector <b>125</b>, the driving element <b>123</b> drives one of the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>to the light emitting position <b>124</b>. In one embodiment, each of the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>has a positon label <b>126</b>; the position detector <b>125</b> detects the position label <b>126</b> and outputs a corresponding detection signal. In one embodiment, the position label <b>126</b> may be a light-permeable hole, a light-reflecting surface, or a light-absorbing surface, which can generate an optical variation; the position detector <b>125</b> can detect the optical variation caused by the position label <b>126</b> and output a corresponding detection signal. In one embodiment, the position label <b>126</b> may be a spot or surface, which has relief structure or convex-concave structure to form spatial variation; the position detector <b>125</b> can detect the spatial variation and output a corresponding detection signal.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> for the control signals of the illumination device of the fundus camera of the present invention. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the position detector <b>125</b> detects the position label <b>126</b> and outputs a corresponding detection signal DS. While the detection signal DS is at a high level, it indicates that the specified light emitting module <b>121</b><i>a </i>has moved to the light emitting position. Meanwhile, the driving element <b>123</b> may stop the rotation of the motor, i.e. the motor signal MS is at a low level, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. While the required light emitting module <b>121</b><i>a </i>has been at the light emitting position <b>124</b>, an illumination signal LS changes to be at a high level to control the light emitting module <b>121</b><i>a </i>to output the illumination light. Later, a next specified light emitting module is moved to the light emitting position to output an illumination light having required optical characteristics.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the abovementioned embodiments, the driving element <b>123</b> moves the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>in a horizontal way. However, the present invention is not limited by these embodiments. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In one embodiment, the driving element <b>123</b> can drive the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>to the light emitting position <b>124</b> in a rotation way. For example, the driving element <b>123</b> may drive the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>to rotate with respect to a rotation axis <b>1231</b>, as indicated by the arrow. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the rotation axis <b>1231</b> is parallel to the optical axis O<b>1</b> of the objective lens <b>11</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the rotation axis <b>1231</b> is vertical to the optical axis O<b>1</b> of the objective lens <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the light emitting modules <b>121</b><i>a</i>-<b>121</b><i>h </i>respectively include corresponding light emitting elements, which can separately generate illumination lights with different optical characteristics. For example, the light emitting elements may be respectively white light LED, red light LED, green light LED, etc. In one embodiment, the illumination lights having different optical characteristics may be generated by the cooperation of a light emitting element and a plurality of different optical elements. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In one embodiment, the illumination device includes a light emitting element <b>1210</b> and a plurality of optical elements <b>1211</b>, <b>1212</b>, <b>1213</b>, <b>1214</b>, <b>1215</b>, <b>1216</b>, <b>1217</b> and <b>1218</b>; the light emitting element <b>1210</b> is disposed at a position corresponding to the light emitting position <b>124</b>; the optical elements <b>1211</b>-<b>1218</b> may be filters or polarization plates. While the driving element <b>123</b> drives one of the optical elements <b>1211</b>-<b>1218</b> to a light output side of the light emitting element <b>1210</b>, an illumination light with required optical characteristics can thus be output from the light emitting position <b>124</b>. It is easily understood: the illumination device may include a plurality of light emitting elements and a plurality of optical elements. The driving element <b>123</b> may respectively drive a specified light emitting element and a specified optical element to the light emitting position, whereby the illumination device can output an illumination light with required optical characteristics.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> again. In one embodiment, the fundus camera of the present invention further comprises a processor <b>15</b>. The processor <b>15</b> is electrically connected with the illumination device <b>12</b> and the image sensor <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the processor <b>15</b> can accurately control the motor signal MS to make a specified light emitting module move to the light emitting position according to the detection signal DS; then the illumination signal LS enables the image sensor <b>14</b> to capture the fundus image having required optical characteristics. Therefore, the processor <b>15</b> can control the illumination device to generate illumination lights with different optical characteristics in a programmable way during an image-capturing interval, whereby the fundus camera can capture fundus images of different optical characteristics. In one embodiment, the image-capturing interval is shorter than or equal to one second. Based on the abovementioned structure, the fundus camera of the present invention can thus capture a plurality of fundus images of different optical characteristics in a short time.
