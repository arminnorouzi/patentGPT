For example, a gas laser (a He&#x2014;Ne laser, an argon laser, a carbon dioxide gas laser, an excimer laser, a nitrogen laser, or the like), a semiconductor laser, a solid-state laser (an YAG laser, a neodymium (Nd) laser, a ruby laser, a fiber laser, a titanium laser or the like), a metal laser (a copper vapor deposition laser, a helium cadmium laser, a gold vapor deposition laser, or the like), a liquid laser, or the like is exemplified as the laser light source <b>20</b>. The technology of the present disclosure can be applied to various oscillation types such as pulse oscillation, continuous wave (CW) oscillation, and the like.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The output module <b>30</b> is set according to a purpose of the laser beam. For example, the laser beam is used for an optical device such as a laser machining device, a laser melting device, a laser welding device, a laser marking device, a laser measuring device, a semiconductor exposure device, a flat panel display exposure device, a circuit substrate exposure device, a laser illumination device, a laser display device, a laser detection device, a laser propulsion device, a laser inspection device, a laser microscope, a laser medical device, or the like. The technology of the present disclosure can be applied to devices in various fields including these devices.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a specific embodiment, the output module <b>30</b> includes a spatial light modulator (SLM) <b>60</b>. For example, the SLM <b>60</b> includes a liquid crystal element, a digital mirror device (digital micro-mirror device, DMD), a magneto optic spatial light modulator (MOSLM), or the like.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The time divider (a time distributor, a dynamic time divider, an optical time divider, an optical switch, an optical shutter, a dynamic switch, a dynamic shutter, a dynamic separator, or an optical path switching machine) <b>50</b> is controlled by the controller <b>40</b> and configured to divide the laser beam in time. For example, a polygon mirror device, a galvanometer mirror device, an electro-optical modulator (EOM), an acousto-optic modulator (AOM), a vibration device, another optical switch device (liquid crystal switch or the like), or the like is exemplified as the time divider <b>50</b>. The time-divided beam can be selectively used. Further, the plurality of time-divided beams can be synthesized, mixed, and/or converged. For example, the beam selectively extracted from the time divider <b>50</b> enters the output module <b>30</b>. In one example, the time-divided beam is guided to a plurality of optical paths for each predetermined span on a time axis. The plurality of time-divided beams (plurality of distributed beams) are supplied to each of the plurality of paths.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a specific embodiment, the time divider <b>50</b> is controlled to be driven synchronously with the SLM <b>60</b> of the output module <b>30</b>. For example, the time-divided beam corresponding to a driving timing of the SLM <b>60</b> is supplied to the SLM <b>60</b>. For example, in general, the operation frequency (for example, an image updating frequency) of the SLM <b>60</b> is lower than a repeating frequency of the pulse beam. Among the time-divided beams, the beam corresponding to the operation timing of the SLM <b>60</b> is selectively used. The remaining time-divided beams may be used for another purpose. In another embodiment, the time divider <b>50</b> can be controlled to be driven non-synchronously with the SLM <b>60</b> of the output module <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a specific embodiment, the laser beam system includes a plurality of laser light sources <b>20</b>. The number of the laser light sources <b>20</b> may be arbitrarily set. For example, the number of the laser light sources <b>20</b> may be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more. In one example, the beams from the plurality of laser light sources <b>20</b> are synthesized, mixed, and/or converged via a predetermined device, and enter the time divider <b>50</b>. The beams from the plurality of laser light sources <b>20</b> may have a relatively high energy value even after they are divided by the time divider <b>50</b>. In another example, the beams from the plurality of laser light sources <b>20</b> enter the time divider <b>50</b> independently. In one example, the beams from the plurality of pulse laser light sources <b>20</b> are set such that pulse widths and peak values (pulse waveforms, waveform profiles) are substantially the same as each other. In another example, the beams from the plurality of pulse laser light sources <b>20</b> are set such that at least one of the pulse widths and peak values (pulse waveforms, waveform profiles) are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a state in which the plurality of laser light sources <b>20</b> and the output module <b>30</b> having the SLM <b>60</b> are combined with each other, for example, energy loss of the laser beam is reduced, energy efficiency is improved, output intensity of the laser beam is appropriately controlled, and/or speckles are suppressed. In one example, the beams from the time divider <b>50</b> are supplied to the SLM <b>60</b> at an appropriate timing. In the SLM <b>60</b> to which the beams are limitedly supplied for an appropriate time, a high energy beam (high power beam) is output from the output module <b>30</b> together with reduction in energy loss in the SLM <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a specific embodiment, the laser beam system includes a plurality of output modules <b>30</b>. For example, a first time-divided beam is supplied to the first output module <b>30</b>, and a second time-divided beam is supplied to the second output module <b>30</b>. The number of the output modules <b>30</b> may be arbitrarily set. For example, the number of the output modules <b>30</b> may be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or more.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a specific embodiment, each of the plurality of output modules <b>30</b> has the SLM <b>60</b>. The plurality of SLMs <b>60</b> are driven synchronously or non-synchronously. In one example, the first, second, third and fourth SLMs <b>60</b> are driven at the same timing corresponding to a certain time-divided beam. In another example, the first and second SLMs <b>60</b> are driven at the same timing corresponding to the first time-divided beam, and the third and fourth SLMs <b>60</b> are driven at another timing corresponding to the second time-divided beam. In still another example, the first SLM <b>60</b> is driven at a timing corresponding to the first time-divided beam, the second SLM <b>60</b> is driven at another timing corresponding to the second time-divided beam, the third SLM <b>60</b> is driven at still another timing corresponding to the third time-divided beam, and the fourth SLM <b>60</b> is driven at yet another timing corresponding to the fourth time-divided beam.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In a state in which the time divider <b>50</b> and the plurality of SLMs <b>60</b> are combined, for example, energy loss of the laser beam is reduced, energy efficiency is improved, output intensity of the laser beam is appropriately controlled, the beam output timing is appropriately controlled, and/or the output beam waveform is appropriately controlled. In one example, the beams from laser light source <b>20</b> are guided to the plurality of SLMs <b>60</b> to correspond to the driving timings of each of the plurality of SLMs <b>60</b>. Reduction in shading period (beam nonuse period) of the beam is advantageous for improvement of energy efficiency, reduction in leak light, and/or avoidance of thermal effects.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a specific embodiment, the laser beam system further includes a subsidiary divider (a time distributor, a dynamic time divider, an optical time divider, an optical switch, an optical shutter, a dynamic switch, a dynamic shutter, a dynamic separator, an optical path switching machine) <b>70</b> disposed optically between the laser light source <b>20</b> and the time divider <b>50</b> or optically between the time divider <b>50</b> and the output module <b>30</b>. The subsidiary divider <b>70</b> includes a dynamic divider or a static divider, and is configured to perform polarization separation, frequency separation, or separation in time of the laser beam. The dynamic divider is a configuration for separating or dividing the laser beam according to the driving of the divider, and the static divider is a configuration for separating or dividing the laser beam without driving the divider. For example, the same device as the above-mentioned time divider or the like can be applied as the dynamic divider. For example, a polarization beam splitter, a half mirror, a dichroic mirror, a frequency separator, or the like is exemplified as the static divider. In one example, the time divider <b>50</b> and the static divider <b>70</b> are sequentially disposed on the optical axis in a direction in which the beam advances. In another example, the static divider <b>70</b> and the time divider <b>50</b> are sequentially disposed on the optical axis in the direction in which the beam advances. Further, in another example, the time divider (a front position, a front stage time divider) <b>70</b> and the time divider (a rear position, a rear stage time divider) <b>50</b> are sequentially disposed on the optical axis in the direction in which the beam advances. In an example, the plurality of time dividers <b>50</b> and <b>70</b> are combined. In another example, the time divider <b>50</b> and the plurality of static dividers <b>70</b> are combined. In yet another example, the plurality of time dividers <b>50</b> and the one static divider <b>70</b> are combined. In still another example, the plurality of time dividers <b>50</b> and the plurality of static dividers <b>70</b> are combined. The number of the time dividers <b>50</b> and the number of the subsidiary dividers <b>70</b> may be arbitrarily set. For example, a total number of the time dividers <b>50</b> and the subsidiary dividers <b>70</b> may be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a state in which the time dividers <b>50</b> and the static dividers <b>70</b> are combined, for example, energy loss of the laser beam is reduced, energy efficiency is improved, output intensity of the laser beam is appropriately controlled, a beam output timing is appropriately controlled, and/or an output beam waveform is appropriately controlled. In one example, a division number of the beam is increased, and/or the beam is divided into a plurality of beams according to a wavelength bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a state in which the time divider (front position) <b>70</b> and the time divider (rear position) <b>50</b> are combined, for example, energy loss of the laser beam is reduced, energy efficiency is improved, output intensity of the laser beam is appropriately controlled, a beam output timing is appropriately controlled, and/or an output beam waveform is appropriately controlled. In one example, a division number of the beam is increased, and/or use of a non-stable zone and/or a non-suitable zone in the time divider is avoided while the energy loss is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one example, the time-divided beam from the front position time divider <b>70</b> in the first span on the time axis enters the rear position time divider <b>50</b>, and a stable zone and/or a suitable zone of the rear position time divider <b>50</b> is preferentially and/or appropriately (specifically and/or preferentially) used. Meanwhile, in the second span on the time axis, the time-divided beam from the front position time divider <b>70</b> does not enter the rear position time divider <b>50</b> substantially, and use of the non-stable zone and/or the non-suitable zone of the rear position time divider <b>50</b> is avoided. For example, by alternately supplying the time-divided beams to the first time divider <b>50</b> and the second time divider <b>50</b> at the rear position, use of the non-stable zone and/or the non-suitable zone in the time divider <b>50</b> is avoided while substantially continuously using the beams. In other words, each of the plurality of rear position time dividers <b>50</b> has a stable zone (suitable zone) and a non-stable zone (non-suitable zone). The plurality of rear position time dividers <b>50</b> are driven such that the stable state upon driving becomes different timings. The time-divided beam from the front position time divider <b>70</b> is parted to match the stable state of each of the time dividers <b>50</b> at the rear position.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a specific embodiment, the output module <b>30</b> has an optical fiber. The optical fiber is configured to receive a plurality of time-divided beams from the time divider <b>50</b> or the subsidiary divider <b>70</b>. In one example, one optical fiber is provided with respect to one output module <b>30</b>. In another example, a plurality of optical fibers are provided with respect to one output module <b>30</b>. In this example, the plurality of time-divided beams from the plurality of optical fibers enter the one output module <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In a specific embodiment, the laser beam system has the plurality of output modules <b>30</b>. Each of the plurality of output modules <b>30</b> includes a fiber. For example, the time-divided beam at the first timing is supplied to the first optical fiber, and the time-divided beam at the second timing is supplied to the second optical fiber. In one example, one optical fiber is provided with respect to each of the plurality of output modules <b>30</b>. In another example, a plurality of optical fibers are provided with respect to each of the plurality of output modules <b>30</b>. In this example, the plurality of time-divided beams from the plurality of optical fibers enter each of the plurality of output modules <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view showing an example of synthesis control of the pulse laser beam. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view showing an example of synthesis control of a CW laser beam. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> are views showing examples of an output beam. In each example, the laser beam, power of which was controlled, is output from the laser beam system.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one example, the plurality of laser beams emitted from the plurality of laser light sources <b>20</b> are synthesized. The synthesis can be performed by an optical system including a lens, a beam splitter, a halving, a mirror, or the like. The synthesized laser beam enters the time divider <b>50</b>, a synthesis beam (a synthesis beam of a first pulse) corresponding to the first repeating timing is guided to a first optical fiber <b>80</b> via the time divider <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>). A synthesis beam (a synthesis beam of a second pulse) corresponding to the second repeating timing is guided to a second optical fiber <b>80</b> via the time divider <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>). A synthesis beam (a synthesis beam of a third pulse) corresponding to the third repeating timing is guided to a third optical fiber <b>80</b> via the time divider <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>). A synthesis beam (a synthesis beam of a fourth pulse) corresponding to the fourth repeating timing is guided to a fourth optical fiber <b>80</b> via the time divider <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>e</i>)</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>e</i>)</figref>). A synthesis beam (a synthesis beam of a fifth pulse) corresponding to the fifth repeating timing is guided to a fifth optical fiber <b>80</b> via the time divider <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>f</i>)</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>f</i>)</figref>). The first, second, third, fourth and fifth repeating timings are sequentially shifted in time. Accordingly, a high energy (high power) synthesis beam is guided to each of the optical fibers <b>80</b>. For example, in the output module <b>30</b> having the SLM <b>60</b>, a synthesis beam is guided to the optical fiber <b>80</b> according to the operation timing of the SLM <b>60</b> at a relatively low speed.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In another example, the output power can be controlled to differ between the plurality of output modules <b>30</b> according to an application of the combination of the time division and the synthesis. For example, a relatively high energy (high power) beam is output from the first output module <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>). An intermediate energy (intermediate power) beam is output from the second output module <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>). A relatively low energy (low power) beam is output from the third output module <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In further another example, the output beam waveform from the one or plurality of output modules <b>30</b> is appropriately controlled according to the application of the combination of the time division and the synthesis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>)</figref>). And/or, the beam output timing from the one or plurality of output modules <b>30</b> is appropriately controlled (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In a specific embodiment, a rotation device (rotation switch) is applied as the time divider <b>50</b>. A rotation device <b>50</b> is rotation-controlled by the controller <b>40</b>, and configured to divide the laser beam in time.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one example, a polygon mirror device is applied as the rotation device <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The beam from the laser light source <b>20</b> is reflected by each of a plurality of reflecting surfaces <b>52</b> of a polygon mirror <b>51</b> in a polygon mirror device <b>50</b>. Each of a plurality of output modules <b>30</b> has an optical fiber <b>80</b> having an inlet section. In the polygon mirror device <b>50</b>, the beam is divided in time according to a rotation angle of the polygon mirror <b>51</b>. The beam reflected by the polygon mirror <b>51</b> is directed to any one inlet section (incidence surface) of the plurality of optical fibers <b>80</b> according to the rotation angle of the polygon mirror <b>51</b>. That is, an angle of the reflecting surface of the polygon mirror <b>51</b> with respect to the beam changes according to rotation of the polygon mirror <b>51</b>, and a destination of the beam reflected by the reflecting surface changes according to lapse of time. For this reason, a beam with a first pulse from the laser light source <b>20</b> enters the first optical fiber, and a beam with a second pulse enters the second optical fiber, a position of which is different from that of the first optical fiber. The number of optical fibers <b>80</b> may be disposed with respect to the one polygon mirror <b>51</b>. The time-divided beam from the polygon mirror <b>51</b> is parted to any one of the plurality of optical fibers <b>80</b>. In other words, the polygon mirror <b>51</b> switches the optical fiber through which the beam enters. In addition, in other words, the polygon mirror <b>51</b> switches a position of the optical path of the beam. At least one lens <b>85</b> or <b>86</b> is disposed between the polygon mirror <b>51</b> and the optical fiber <b>80</b> according to necessity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). For example, when the inlet section (incidence surface) of the optical fiber <b>80</b> and the reflecting surface of the polygon mirror <b>51</b> are conjugated, a deviation (positional deviation) of the incidence position of the beam with respect to the optical fiber <b>80</b> based on the rotation of the polygon mirror <b>51</b> is suppressed. Further, a slight change of the incidence angle of the beam with respect to the optical fiber <b>80</b> on the basis of the rotation of the polygon mirror <b>51</b> is advantageous for suppression of the speckles. Instead of the pulse beam, a CW beam can also be applied to this type similarly.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another example, a disk-shaped optical switch device is applied as the rotation device <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). In the disk-shaped optical switch device <b>50</b>, the beam is divided in time according to a rotation angle of a rotation plate <b>55</b>. For example, the beam from the laser light source <b>20</b> is reflected by or transmitted through optical surfaces <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> of the rotation plate <b>55</b> in the optical switch device <b>50</b> according to the rotation angle of the rotation plate <b>55</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>). The rotation plate <b>55</b> has the transmission surface <b>56</b> and the reflecting surface <b>57</b> arranged in the circumferential direction.

The beam from the illumination system <b>1310</b> illuminates the SLM <b>60</b>. The controller <b>40</b> generates pattern data on the basis of the exposure pattern formed on the substrate <b>1410</b>.

The SLM <b>60</b> is controlled by the controller <b>40</b>, and guides the beam from the illumination system to the substrate <b>1410</b> on the basis of the pattern data (simply expressed as image data and image in some cases). The projection lens <b>1330</b> projects the beam from the SLM <b>60</b> onto the substrate <b>1410</b>, and images the beam in a predetermined region on the substrate <b>1410</b>. Further, when the exposure pattern is formed on the substrate <b>1410</b> by the plurality of SLMs <b>60</b>, the controller <b>40</b> divides the generated pattern data for each of the SLMs <b>60</b>, and transmits the divided pattern data to each of the SLMs <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the scan type exposure device using the SLM, the laser beam is emitted during movement of the substrate stage <b>1400</b> on which the substrate is placed, and the laser beam is guided to the SLM via the illumination optical system <b>1310</b>. The image formed on the SLM is preferably exposed with a single emission of the laser beam. When the image formed on the SLM is exposed with emission of the laser beam two times or more, the same pattern data are projected onto the substrate on each emission. Since the substrate <b>1410</b> moves also between the emission and the emission of the laser beam by the substrate stage <b>1400</b>, when the same pattern data are projected onto the substrate, it will be exposed as if the image is flowing. When the scan speed is increased for throughput improvement, a moving distance between the emission and the emission of the laser beam is lengthened, and the image will flow more. In order to increase a scan speed for throughput improvement and make it difficult for the image to flow, one emission time must be shortened. When one emission time is short, since the energy of the laser beam radiated onto the substrate <b>1410</b> via the SLM is lowered, an exposure defect (photosensitive defect) in which exposure energy is insufficient may occur. In general, an operation frequency (for example, an image updating frequency) of the SLM is lower than an emission repeating frequency (an oscillation frequency) of the laser beam, for example, several kHz to tens kHz. In a comparative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the laser beam is 50 kHz (10W), and the SLM is 10 kHz. As shown in the comparative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, an oscillation frequency having a low frequency in order to prevent the image from flowing and a high energy light source that does not generate an exposure defect are desired, but in consideration of the wavelength condition as well, the choice of the laser light source is extremely limited at present.

In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the distribution module <b>1200</b> synthesizes and time-divides the beams from five light sources <b>20</b>. The beams emitted from the five light sources with a frequency of 50 kHz are synthesized and become a high energy beam. The synthesized beam (50 kHz, high energy) is time-divided and guided to the five SLMs <b>60</b> (and the five projection lenses <b>1330</b>) by the distribution module <b>1200</b>. For this reason, a high energy beam with a frequency of 10 kHz arrives at each of the first to fifth SLMs. Further, in both of the comparative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> and the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the light sources with a total 50 W are used in five modules. Further, in the comparative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, since the laser beam is 50 kHz (10W) and the SLM is 10 kHz, the light is distributed (parted, switched) to the five SLMs by the distribution module <b>1200</b>. The oscillation frequency of the laser beam is preferably an integral multiple of the image updating frequency of the SLM. In other words, the distribution module <b>1200</b> distributes the laser beam into the number of SLMs, which is the integral multiple. The numerical value is an example, and the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the example, the intensity (for example, pulse energy, average power) E<b>2</b> of the laser beam radiated to the one SLM is equal to or greater than the intensity (for example, pulse energy, average power) E<b>1</b> of the laser beam emitted from the one laser light source. For example, E<b>2</b>/E<b>1</b> may be about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100 or more. In addition, a frequency (an irradiation frequency) F<b>2</b> of the beam radiated to the one SLM or an image updating frequency F<b>3</b> of the SLM is lower than an emission repeating frequency (an oscillation frequency, a light source frequency) F<b>1</b> of the laser light source.

In the CW light source, when the necessary emission time is 0.5 &#x3bc;s, if the beam is radiated to the SLM after 0.5 &#x3bc;s, since the image on the SLM is not updated, the same projection image is formed on the substrate <b>1410</b> that is moving as if the image will flows as described above. In order to prevent the image from flowing, during the time from 0.5 &#x3bc;s until the next image on the SLM is updated, for example, the beam is blocked in the middle of the optical path from CW light source to the SLM such that the beam is not radiated to the SLM. In this case, the time from 0.5 &#x3bc;s until the next image on the SLM is updated is substantially a pause time. In the comparative example, only 1/200 of the energy from the light source will expose the substrate <b>1410</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Similarly, in the comparative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the operation frequency (image updating frequency) of the SLM is 10 kHz.

In the comparative example, when the frequency of the light source is 400 kHz, operation frequency/light source frequency of SLM= 1/40, and only 1/40 of the energy from the light source is used. That is, in 40 pulses oscillated from the pulse light source, only one pulse radiates the SLM, in other words, 39 pulses do not radiate the SLM, and the 39 pulses do not contribute to the exposure of the substrate <b>1410</b>. For this reason, in the comparative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>22</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, an exposure defect (photosensitive defect) in which exposure energy is insufficient may occur.

The first, second and third SLMs are arranged and disposed in the non-scanning direction crossing the scanning direction in which the substrate <b>1410</b> is moved during exposure. Timing when the second SLM is irradiated with the beam is different from the timing when the first SLM is irradiated with the beam. Similarly, irradiation timing of the third SLM is different from irradiation timing of the first and second SLMs. For example, in the plurality of SLMs <b>60</b>, the irradiation timing is sequentially shifted in time. Accordingly, the substrate <b>1410</b> can be exposed to the energy from the light source that does not contribute to the exposure shown in the comparative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>22</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> by parting the beams to the different SLMs.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, in the exposure device, when the irradiation timing differs between the plurality of SLMs, there is a possibilty that the images on the SLMs are updated at the same timing, and a projection position (exposure position) of a pattern may be deviated according to a difference in timing of the beam irradiation. For example, in comparison with the first pulse corresponding to the first SLM (SLM (<b>1</b>)), a projection position of the second pulse corresponding to the second SLM (SLM (<b>2</b>)) is shifted in the scan direction.
