The self-refresh mode allows a refresh operation to be automatically performed by using an internal counter, and thus, leads to low power consumption. When the DRAM is not accessed for a long time, a self-refresh mode is performed in response to a self-refresh entry command (SRE) and a self-refresh exit command (SRX) by the memory controller.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If power consumption can be further reduced than in the self-refresh mode even while data bits stored in the DRAM are retained, a mobile device including the DRAM would exhibit better performance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept provide a method of controlling a power state of a memory device having a plurality of low power states.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept also provide the aforementioned memory device having the plurality of low power states.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an exemplary embodiment, there is provided a method of controlling a power state of a memory device, the method including: entering a low power mode state, in which memory cell rows of the memory device are refreshed and power consumption is lower than in a self-refresh mode state, in response to a low power state entry command;

In the self-refresh mode state <b>250</b>, a refresh operation may be performed by using an internal counter (not shown) while the clock signal CK is disabled. Thus, power consumption in the self-refresh mode state <b>250</b> may be lower than that in the active mode state <b>220</b> and the refresh mode state <b>230</b> in which all of the circuits may be enabled.

For example, in the low power mode state <b>260</b>, only circuits related to the internal counter, among the circuits enabled in the self-refresh mode state <b>250</b>, may be enabled. Thus, since the low power mode state <b>260</b> controls more circuits to be disabled than the self-refresh mode state <b>250</b>, power consumption in the low power mode state <b>260</b> may be further reduced than in the self-refresh mode state <b>250</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the self-refresh operation in the low power mode state <b>260</b> is completed, the memory device <b>120</b> may automatically transit to the idle state <b>210</b>.

In addition, the communication devices <b>1221</b> and <b>1222</b> may correspond to transceivers performing both of transmission and reception functions. In the following embodiments, each of the communication devices <b>1221</b> and <b>1222</b> will be referred to as a terminal, and may be the mobile device <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The base station <b>1210</b> may correspond to a Node B, an eNode B (eNB), a base station, an access point (AP), or the like, and may be defined as a concept collectively referring to arbitrary nodes communicating with a terminal. In addition, each of the terminals <b>1221</b> and <b>1222</b> may be defined as a concept collectively referring to mobile and stationary user terminals, such as user equipment (UE), a mobile station (MS), an advanced mobile station (AMS), and the like.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The terminals <b>1221</b> and <b>1222</b> may operate in a cellular communication mode (or relay communication mode) in which the base station <b>1210</b> performs relay. In the cellular communication mode, when a first terminal <b>1221</b> transmits data to a second terminal <b>1222</b>, the first terminal <b>1221</b> may transmit the data to the base station <b>1210</b> through an uplink to the base station <b>1210</b>, and the base station <b>1210</b> may transmit the data to the second terminal <b>1222</b> through a downlink to the second terminal <b>1222</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the cellular communication mode, a position measuring service for finding out positions of the first and second terminals <b>1221</b> and <b>1222</b> may be provided. The positions of the first and second terminals <b>1221</b> and <b>1222</b> may be found out by GPS receivers in the first and second terminals <b>1221</b> and <b>1222</b>. For example, the positions of the first and second terminals <b>1221</b> and <b>1222</b> may be found out by special signals cyclically sent from the base station <b>1210</b> to the first and second terminals <b>1221</b> and <b>1222</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The first and second terminals <b>1221</b> and <b>1222</b> need to be awake to respond the signals cyclically sent from the base station <b>1210</b>.

In this case, the memory devices <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>may be required to exit the self-refresh mode state or the low power mode state before receiving the cyclical signals sent from the base station <b>1210</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The memory devices <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>may perform self refresh exit in the self refresh mode state by using the first alarm signal ALRM<b>1</b>, and may perform low power mode exit in the low power mode state by using the second alarm signal ALRM<b>2</b>. The memory devices <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b </i>may receive the first and second alarm signals ALRM<b>1</b> and ALRM<b>2</b> so as to exit the self-refresh mode state and the low power mode state before the cyclical signals sent from the base station <b>1210</b> are received.
