For example, a processing entity may receive (a) impression data related to ads provided by one or more advertisers regarding products or services provided by a selling entity and (b) conversion data related to conversions by the selling entity and use such data to measure the effectiveness of the ads provided by the advertisers. Such systems generally require that the selling entity provide detailed (and potentially sensitive, private, and/or otherwise customer-specific) information in providing the conversion data to the processing entity. It may be desirable to enable the determination of marketing campaign/advertising content effectiveness measurements via a processing entity without requiring that selling (or other conversion data collection) entities release such potentially sensitive, private, and/or otherwise customer specific information to the processing entity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some implementations disclosed herein measure an effect of content exposure (e.g., lift attributable to ad campaign content) by comparing exposed and unexposed conversion (e.g., visit) rates.

The method determines exposed group data and unexposed group data, the exposed group data identifying user identities of users exposed to content and the unexposed group data identifying user identities of users not exposed to the content. The method further transmits the exposed group data and unexposed group data to a second computing environment, wherein the second computing environment is configured to compute aggregate data based on the exposed group data, the unexposed group data, and identifier-level conversion data, wherein the second computing environment is distinct from the first computing environment.

In this example, content (e.g., ads and/or other advertising campaign content) are provided by content sources A-N <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>to potential actors, e.g., customers or users who may convert, for example, by making a purchase from a seller. A conversion data collection entity <b>130</b>, which may be a seller or an affiliate of a seller as examples, collects information about conversions, e.g., customer A visited store B or purchased product C for price D on date E, etc. Processing service <b>120</b> facilitates measurement of the effects of content exposure, e.g., how effective the advertising campaign content provided by each of source A-N <b>110</b><i>a </i>were with respect to resulting in purchases or other conversions by the recipients of the advertising campaign content.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Measuring the effects of content exposure may involve a location conversion index to measure advertising driven conversion, e.g., data to attribute incremental store visits to marketing campaigns. This may involve a comparison of exposed and unexposed conversion (e.g., visit) rates, where conversion rates are calculated: conversion rate=conversions/users. Incremental lift may be calculated as the percentage increase between the exposed conversion/visit rate (EVR) and the unexposed conversion/visit rate (UVR).

Rather, such potentially sensitive, private, and/or otherwise identifier-level-specific information may be used locally (e.g., without distribution to other parties) by the entity that collects that information, e.g., conversion data collection entity <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary distributed computing environment in which processing server <b>120</b> facilitates the measurement of the effects of content exposure without receiving potentially sensitive, private, and/or otherwise identifier-level-specific information from the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, exposure collection <b>210</b> is performed, for example, by collecting information about which users were provided content by content sources A-N <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, when such content was provided, etc. Multi-touch attribution <b>220</b> is performed, for example, to determine a level, amount, percentage or other information about the relative amount of content provided by each of the content source A-N <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>to the individual users, who may or may not have ended up converting.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">At block <b>230</b>, raw conversion/visit data is obtained and, if necessary, extract, transform, and load (ETL) <b>230</b> analysis is performed to cleanse and consolidate different data sets. The conversion/visit data may be converted by managed portfolio block <b>240</b>, for example, using a conversion table and matching performed at block <b>250</b> to identify an exposed group of users. Data <b>255</b> representing the exposed group of users and a control group is sent from the first processing environment, i.e., processing service <b>120</b>, to the second processing environment, i.e., the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b>. The conversion data collection entity <b>130</b> uses the received data <b>255</b> representing the exposed group of users and the control group and its own collected conversion data <b>270</b> to generate aggregate counts of conversions and users. Data <b>265</b> representing the aggregate counts of conversions and users is sent back to the first processing environment, i.e., the processing service, which performs computations <b>280</b> using the received data to provide output <b>290</b> corresponding to the effects of the content exposure. For example, this may involve determining incremental lift as the percentage increase between the exposed conversion/visit rate (EVR) and the unexposed conversion/visit rate (UVR), where incremental Lift=(EVR&#x2212;UVR)/UVR. In this example, identifier-level specific data is retained in the second environment, i.e., at the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b>, and only aggregate data is provided to the first environment, i.e., to the processing service <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some implementations, to enable multi-touch attribution (MTA) <b>220</b>, MTA weights are generated by processing service <b>120</b> and provided to the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b>, which uses the MTA weights to compute and provide back more generalized information.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method <b>300</b> for measuring the effects of content exposure using distributed computation. The exemplary method <b>300</b> can be implemented via a computing device, for example, by using a processor to execute instructions stored in a non-transitory computer-readable medium. Reference to the method <b>300</b> being performed by a computing device includes the method <b>300</b> being performed by one or more computing devices and/or using one or more processors.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At block <b>310</b>, the method <b>300</b> determines exposed group data and unexposed group data. The exposed group data identifies user identities of users exposed to content and the unexposed group data identifies user identities of users not exposed to the content. In some implementations, a processing service obtains exposure data, computes multi-touch attribution (MTA), and optionally performs matching to identify users for the unexposed group. The matching may identify users for the unexposed group having one or more attributes matching attributes of the exposed group users. The exposed group data and unexposed group data may correspond to exposure/non-exposure during a defined time window.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The unexposed group may be identified based on data received from the second computing environment, where the second computing environment generates the data by generalizing the identifier-level conversion data for individual users. For example, the processing service may identify the unexposed group based on data received from the second computing environment, e.g., based on receiving identifier-level-specific data that is generalized/abstracted, for example, regarding precampaign conversion rate, to unexposed users who visit retailer X as frequently as the exposed visitors. This may involve dividing a user set into abstract classifications to select an unexposed group that matches the unexposed group data without needing identifier-level-specific conversion data, e.g., based on the user being within the 40<sup>th </sup>to 50th percentile with respect to number of retailer X visits without knowing the actual number of visits.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At block <b>320</b>, the method <b>300</b> transmits the exposed group data and unexposed group data to a second computing environment, where the second computing environment is configured to compute aggregate data based on the exposed group data, the unexposed group data, and identifier-level conversion data. In some implementations, the aggregate data includes aggregate counts of exposed conversions, exposed users, unexposed conversions, unexposed users, standard deviation of conversion for the exposed users, and/or standard deviation of conversion for the unexposed users. The aggregate data may include aggregate counts of, sub-dimension data, including exposed conversions, exposed users, unexposed conversions, and unexposed users. The aggregate data may include matched rate data.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The second computing environment is distinct from the first computing environment, e.g., provided via different computing devices and/or operated by or under the control of different entities. In some implementations, the first computing environment comprises information that is confidentially maintained for a first business entity and the second computing environment comprises information that is confidentially maintained for a second business entity different than the first business entity.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some implementations, a processing service sends data regarding exposed groups and non-exposed (i.e., control) groups to a module (e.g., a conversion abstraction module (CAM)) that is within the conversion data collection entity (retailer X's) systems. This module may use the received data and the second party's conversion data to compute aggregate values (e.g., aggregate counts of conversions and users: (1) exposed conversions/visits, (2) exposed users, (3) unexposed conversions/visits, and (4) unexposed users. MTA weights may also be sent, which may enable the module to convert MTA weighted conversions without the processing service seeing the conversions. In some implementations, such a module is implemented using an API exposed to the processing party. Exposed group data and unexposed group data may be sent to such a module within the second computing environment via an application programming interface (API) call.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some implementations, the multi-touch attribution (MTA) weights are computed in the first computing environment and provided to MTA to the second computing environment and the second computing environment performs MTA weighted conversions using the MTA weights such that the first computing environment is prohibited from accessing the MTA weighted conversions, although aggregate values may be provided to the first computing environment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At block <b>330</b>, the method <b>300</b> receives the aggregated data from the second computing environment and, at block <b>340</b>, the method determines an effect of exposure to the content (e.g., incremental lift attributable to ad campaign content) by comparing exposed and unexposed conversion (e.g., visit) rates determined based on the received aggregate data. Incremental lift may be calculated as percentage increase between an exposed conversion/visit rate (EVR) and an unexposed conversion/visit rate (UVR). this percentage increase may be calculated using four aggregate numbers (exposed conversions/visits, exposed users, unexposed conversions/visits, and unexposed users).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Method <b>300</b> may be performed such that the first computing environment does not receive the identifier-level conversion data. Raw identifier-level conversion data need not leave the second party environment. Thus, identifier-level conversion data may be exclusively maintained within the second computing environment.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some implementations, the data that is shared with the first computing environment comprises limited identifier-level data but does not reveal conversion-specific data. For example, such data may identify that a customer is within the 40th percentile without revealing that that the customer spent $50.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of measuring the effects of content exposure using distributed computation. Chart <b>410</b> illustrates identifier-level-specific information that may be tracked by a conversion data collection entity <b>130</b> (e.g., a retailer, a credit card transaction tracker, or any other entity that collects data about sales or other types of conversions) about customer conversions. In this example, this information includes, for each user, a number of exposed device (Exposed YN), a number of conversions (Conversions), a number exposed (Ne), a number exposed that converted (Nec), a number exposed that did not convert (Nen), and a number of conversions by the exposed that converted (CeC). Identifier-level-specific information such as this may be maintained by the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In contrast, aggregate information such as the population totals for Ne, Nec, Nen, and Cec values may be shared by the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b> with the processing service <b>120</b>. The processing service <b>120</b> may use the received aggregate data to determine, for example, an exposed conversion rate (ECR) based on the aggregate number of conversions by exposed users (CeC) divided by the aggregate number exposed users (Ne), a penetration based the aggregate number exposed that converted (Nec) divided by the aggregate number of exposed users (Ne), and a cadence based on the aggregate number of conversions by exposed users (CeC) divided by the aggregate number exposed that converted (Nec).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this example, the processing service <b>120</b> collects impression data for users (e.g., users <b>1</b>-<b>5</b>) and uses that impression data to determine MTA weights, which are illustrated in tables <b>420</b> and <b>430</b>. These MTA weights may be generated for different population segmentations as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. For example, users may be segmented into different groups, e.g., publishers and creatives, and weights determined for the attributions of different content providers based on the impressions provided by those content providers. For example, for user <b>1</b> in dimension A, content provider <b>1</b> has attribution 0.25, content provider <b>2</b> has attribution 0.25, and content provider <b>3</b> has attribution 0.5. The identifier-level-specific and dimension-specific MTA weights illustrated in tables <b>420</b> and <b>430</b> are generated by processing service <b>120</b> and provided to the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b>, e.g., via an API call or otherwise.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The conversion data collection entity <b>130</b> (e.g., a conversion abstraction module (CAM) implemented by the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b>) receives the MTA weights and uses it to perform calculations based on its identifier-level-specific conversion information. In this example, the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b> uses the received MTA weights and its identifier-level-specific conversion data to generate tables <b>440</b> and <b>450</b>. Table <b>440</b> is specific to the first dimension (e.g., based on the MTA weights of table <b>420</b>) and identifies, for each user, the attribution of Ne, Nec, Nen, and Cec to each content source (e.g., a1, a2, a3). Table <b>450</b> is specific to the second dimension (e.g., based on the MTA weights of table <b>430</b>) and identifies, for each user, the attribution of Ne, Nec, Nen, and Cec to each content source (e.g., b1, b2, b3, b4). Identifier-level-specific information such as this may be maintained by the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In contrast, aggregate information such as the population totals in charts <b>440</b> and <b>450</b> for Ne, Nec, Nen, and Cec values may be shared by the conversion data collection entity <b>130</b> with the processing service <b>120</b>. In this example, 1.58 is the number of exposed users attributed to a1, 1.58 is the number exposed users attributed to a2, 1.84 is the number or exposed users attributed to a3, and these values sum to 5 which is the overall aggregate value of Ne shown in chart <b>410</b>. The processing service <b>120</b> may use the received aggregate data to determine, for example, for each content source, attribution of an exposed conversion rate (ECR) based on the aggregate number of conversions by exposed users (CeC) divided by the aggregate number exposed users (Ne), a penetration based the aggregate number exposed that converted (Nec) divided by the aggregate number of exposed users (Ne), and a cadence based on the aggregate number of conversions by exposed users (CeC) divided by the aggregate number exposed that converted (Nec).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations, a distributed computation model, e.g., using a CAM at conversion data collection entity <b>130</b> separate from a processing service <b>120</b>, is configured to facilitate campaign analytics, e.g., generating and providing insights associated with a campaign.
