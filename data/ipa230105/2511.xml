An instant starch is one that swells and develops increased viscosity in solution without heating. Instant starches are used, for example, in instant puddings. Starch is a carbohydrate polymer and can consist essentially of amylose and/or amylopectin. The major component (about 70-80%) of most starches is amylopectin, which is a branched polymer of several thousand to several hundred thousand glucose units. Amylose is the minor component (about 20-30%) of most starches. However, there are high amylose starches with 50-70% amylose. Amylose is essentially a linear glucose polymer of several hundred to several thousand glucose units. A waxy corn starch can contain almost 100% (or 95% or greater) amylopectin. Low amylose corn starch can contain less than 10% amylose.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sources of starch include but are not limited to cereals, tubers, roots, rhizomes or fruits. Common sources of starch include but are not limited to corn, rice, wheat, barley, sorghum, buckwheat, millet, quinoa, potato, tapioca/cassava, arrowroot, sweet potatoes, taro, yams, banana, kudzu, oca, and sago. Edible beans, such as favas, lentils and pea, chick pea, are also rich in starch.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some starches are classified as waxy starches. A waxy starch consists essentially of amylopectin, i.e. it contains at least about 95 wt % amylopectin. Common waxy starches include waxy corn starch, waxy rice, waxy potato, waxy wheat, waxy tapioca and waxy cassava starch.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A native starch is one that has been isolated from its plant source without altering its chemical structure. A modified starch has a structure that has been altered from its native state, resulting in modification of one or more of its chemical or physical properties. Starches are typically functionalized by chemical or enzymatic means. Chemical means can include crosslinking or substitution with various chemical compounds. For example, starches can be modified to increase stability, improve texture, increase or decrease viscosity, and/or increase or decrease solubility, among others. In one example, modified starches are cross-linked for example to improve stability. Starches that are modified by substitution or crosslinking have a different chemical composition.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A starch can undergo thermal processing, such as heat moisture treatment (HMT), i.e. heating in the presence of water, or thermal inhibition, i.e. heating essentially in the absence of water. A thermally inhibited (TI) starch is not regarded as a chemically modified starch. As such, a TI starch can be regarded as a clean label starch.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is an increased demand from food consumers for clean label starches, such as native or physically modified, to replace chemically-modified food starches commonly used in various food products.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present inventors recognize, among other things, an opportunity for a label-friendly starch composition comprising a thermally inhibited (TI) corn starch and a waxy starch. Examples of waxy starches include waxy corn starch, waxy rice, waxy potato, waxy wheat, waxy tapioca and waxy cassava starch and combinations thereof. Preferably the waxy starch is waxy corn or waxy rice. The starch composition is suitable for use in food products and can provide improved performance in a thermally sterilized food product as compared to using TI corn starch alone. Thermal sterilization of the food product can include one or more of retort, ultrahigh temperature (UHT) treatment, and aseptic packaging.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention includes also a starch composition comprising a thermally inhibited (TI) corn starch, and a waxy starch in an amount up to and including about 50 weight percent of the starch composition, wherein the waxy starch is preferably waxy corn or waxy rice. In an example, the waxy starch is waxy rice and its amount ranges between about 15 and about 50 weight percent of the starch composition. In another example, the waxy starch is waxy corn and the amount ranges between about 15 and about 25 weight percent of the starch composition. A food product can contain the starch composition of the invention and one or more additional food ingredients. In an example, the food product can be a soup. Preferably, the food product is subjected to a retort process, preferably said retort process being carried out once the food product is inside its packaging. The retorted food product can be stored at room temperature and consumed at a future date. In an example, the retorted food product can have a long shelf life. In an example, the retorted food product may be optionally heated before consumption. In an example, the food product may undergo ultrahigh temperature (UHT) treatment. In an example, an aseptic packaging process can be used for the food product. Processes for thermally retorting a food product are known in the art, e.g. from EP2783583. By &#x201c;retort process&#x201d; is intended to mean a process in which the food product is exposed to heat in a sealed container to render it commercially sterile. Retorting includes such process in any sealed container, including without limitation a can, pouch or jar of any material including without limitation glass and metals.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention also relates to a starch composition comprising a thermally inhibited (TI) corn starch in a first amount ranging between about 50 and about 85 weight percent of the starch composition, and a waxy starch in a second amount ranging between about 15 and about 50 weight percent of the starch composition. Preferably, the waxy starch is waxy corn or waxy rice. Preferably, the first amount is between about 75 and 85 weight percent of the starch composition. In an example, the waxy starch is waxy rice and the second amount is between about 15 and about 25 weight percent of the starch composition. In another example, the waxy starch is waxy corn and the second amount is between about 15 and about 25 weight percent of the starch composition. The invention also relates to a food product containing the starch composition described above, wherein the starch composition is preferably equal to or less than about 5 weight percent of the food product. In an example, the food product can be configured for storage at room temperature, prior to consumption of the food product.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Examples according to the present application can include a method of making a label friendly starch composition and the method can comprise producing or providing a thermally inhibited (TI) corn starch, producing or providing a waxy starch, and blending the TI corn starch and the waxy starch to form a starch composition. The waxy starch can range up to and including 50 weight percent of the starch composition, preferably between about 15 and about 50 weight percent of the starch composition. Preferably, the waxy starch is waxy corn or waxy rice. Preferably, the waxy starch ranges between about 15 and about 25 weight percent of the starch composition. Preferably, the TI corn starch ranges between about 50 and about 85 weight percent of the starch composition.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Examples according to the present application can include a method of making a food product containing a label friendly starch composition and the method can comprise producing or providing a starch composition comprising a thermally inhibited (TI) corn starch and a waxy starch in an amount up to about 50 weight percent of the starch composition, combining the starch composition with one or more additional food ingredients to form the food product, thermally processing or sterilizing the food product to form an aseptic, sterilized or retorted food product that can be stored at room temperature prior to consumption by a consumer. In an example, the food product is a soup. In an example in which the food product is a soup, the soup can go through the retort process once the soup is packaged inside the can. The waxy starch in the soup formulation can be waxy corn or waxy rice. In an example, the waxy starch is waxy corn and the amount ranges between about 15 and about 25 weight percent of the starch composition.

Examples of waxy starches include waxy corn starch, waxy rice, waxy potato, waxy wheat, waxy tapioca and waxy cassava starch and combinations thereof. The starch compositions of the present application can include a thermally inhibited (TI) corn starch in combination with a native waxy starch. Preferably, the TI corn starch is a TI waxy corn starch, i.e. a waxy corn or low amylose (less than 10%) corn starch that has been physically functionalized by way of heat processing. Preferably, the waxy starch is waxy corn or waxy rice. A TI starch and/or a chemically modified starch can commonly be used in foods that undergo retort processes because such modified starches can swell and stay intact, allowing for increased viscosity for the finished product. However, the present inventors unexpectedly found that a starch composition of TI corn starch and waxy corn or waxy rice can have improved performance in a retorted food product, compared to if TI corn starch is used individually in the retorted food product. Waxy corn and waxy rice are native starches and thus it was surprising that replacing a portion of the TI corn starch with such native starches resulted in improved performance. This finding contradicts the typical understanding in the art believing that native starches on their own would breakdown when exposed to high heat, such as in a retort process and thus would not contribute to improved performance. Such improved performance, as described below, included for example increased freeze/thaw stability of the food product that the starch composition was used in.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The starch compositions of TI corn starch and a waxy starch, preferably a waxy corn or waxy rice can be suitable for use in a food product, particularly a retorted food product, such as a soup or a pasta sauce. A retorted food product containing a composition of TI corn starch and waxy corn or waxy rice showed greater stability and better performance compared to a similar product containing TI corn starch alone. As demonstrated herein, the starch compositions containing waxy corn or waxy rice are well suited for use in a soup that may undergo a freeze/thaw cycle prior to being consumed by a user.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The starch compositions disclosed herein can be suitable in many different food products, examples of which are provided below. Because a thermally inhibited corn starch has been physically functionalized, rather than chemically modified, the starch compositions disclosed herein can provide a label friendly starch solution for the food product that such compositions are used in. Thermal inhibition is a physical modification process viewed more favorably amongst consumers as an alternative to chemical modification. It shall be understood that various technologies can be used to achieve thermal inhibition, for example but not limited to fluidized bed reactor, paddle mixer reactor, microwave, and radiofrequency technologies. The process for thermally inhibiting a starch is known in the art for example from EP1281721, EP2246365 and EP1038882.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an example, the starch compositions disclosed herein can be used in food products, preferably those that are thermally sterilized to extend a shelf life of the product. Moreover, such retorted (or otherwise thermally sterilized) food products can be stored at room temperature. Such food products can include, for example, soups, and various types of sauces, gravies and beverages. Sauces can include, but are not limited to, tomato-based sauces, cheese sauces, Asian-style sauces, and gravies. For purposes herein, &#x201c;label friendly&#x201d; generally means that the starch, or the food product the starch is contained within, is not chemically modified. For purposes herein, &#x201c;sauce&#x201d; generally refers to a thick liquid served with food to add moistness and flavor. Typically, a sauce includes texturizers such as flour or starch.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The invention relates to a starch composition comprising a TI corn starch and a waxy starch, the waxy starch being in an amount of at least 50 wt % relative to the starch composition. Preferably the waxy starch is a waxy corn starch or a waxy rice starch. Preferably, the waxy starches, e.g. waxy corn and waxy rice, are native waxy starches. The TI corn starch is preferably a TI waxy corn starch. The invention also relates to a starch composition comprising a TI waxy corn starch and a native waxy starch, the native waxy starch being in an amount of at least 50 wt % relative to the starch composition. Preferably, the amount of the waxy starch is at least 3 wt %, more preferably at least 5 wt %, even more preferably at least 7 wt %, most preferably at least 10 wt %. When the waxy starch is waxy corn, the amount of waxy starch is between 10 and 50 wt %, more preferably between 15 and 50 wt %. When the waxy starch is waxy rice, the amount of waxy starch is between 10 and 50 wt %, more preferably between 15 and 50 wt %.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The invention also relates to a starch composition comprising a TI corn starch in a first weight amount relative to the total weight amount of the composition and a waxy starch in a second weight amount relative to the total weight amount of the composition, the first weight amount being equal with or higher than the second weight amount. Preferably, the first weight amount is higher than the second weight amount. Preferably, the first weight amount is at least 50%, more preferably at least 55 wt %, even more preferably at least 60 wt %, even more preferably at least 65 wt %, most preferably at least 70 wt %. Preferably the second weight amount is at most 50 wt %, more preferably at most 45 wt %, more preferably at most 40 wt %, even more preferably at most 35 wt %, most preferably at most 30 wt %. Preferably the first weight amount is at least 55 wt % and the second weight amount is at most 45 wt %, more preferably at most 40 wt %, even more preferably at most 35 wt %, most preferably at most 30 wt %. Preferably the first weight amount is at least 60 wt % and the second weight amount is at most 40 wt %, more preferably at most 35 wt %, most preferably at most 30 wt %.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The starch compositions of the present application can include TI corn starch and waxy starch, and the waxy starch can be in an amount up to about 50 weight percent of the starch compositions. In an example, the waxy starch can be waxy rice and the amount of the waxy rice is preferably between about 15 and about 50 weight percent of the starch composition, more preferably between about 15 and about 25 weight percent of the starch compositions. In an example, the waxy starch can be waxy corn and the amount is preferably between about 15 and about 25 weight percent of the starch composition. The starch compositions were found to have similar viscosity profiles to TI corn starch, while showing superior performance after multiple freeze thaw cycles, compared to TI corn starch only, when used in a food product. Superior performance as used herein can refer to one or more of viscosity, texture, and storage stability.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) Perkins Elmer 4800 can be used to measure a viscosity of the starch compositions. The compositions can be heated to 120&#xb0; C., held for 2.6 minutes (156 seconds), then cooled to 50&#xb0; C. and held for 2 minutes (122 seconds). The RVA can be operated at 160 revolutions per minute. (Heating to 120&#xb0; C. is relevant to a typical retort process of a food product containing the starch samples described herein.) As used herein, the final viscosity of the composition or sample refers to the viscosity at the end of the RVA run. As used herein, the hot paste viscosity of the composition or sample refers to the viscosity at the end of the holding time at 120&#xb0; C. In an example, the starch compositions have a final viscosity of between 500 and 1200 centipoise, between 600 and 1000 centipoise, or between 600 and 900 centipoise. In an example, the starch compositions have a hot paste viscosity at 120&#xb0; C. of between 300 and 900 centipoise, between 400 and 800 centipoise, or between 500 and 800 centipoise.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an example in which the starch compositions contain waxy rice, the waxy rice can be waxy white rice flour or low amylose white rice flour. Both waxy white rice flour and low amylose white rice flour can be characterized by a high starch content (80% or more) and can contain protein, e.g. at least 5 wt % protein, preferably at least 10 wt % protein. White rice flour can be used as a substitute for rice starch in canned food or retort applications.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The starch compositions disclosed herein can be used in retort food applications, such as soup. A method of making a food product containing a label friendly starch can include producing or providing a starch compositions comprising a TI corn starch and a waxy starch in an amount up to about 50 weight percent of the starch composition. The method can include combining the starch composition with one or more additional ingredients to form the food product and thermally processing the food product to form a sterilized food product. In an example, the post-retort viscosity of the food product is greater than 200 centipoise, measured at 70&#xb0; F., or greater than 500 centipoise, greater than 800 centipoise, or greater than 1000 centipoise.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Examples of a chicken soup recipe containing the starch compositions are provided below in the Examples section. Favorable properties were observed, including a general absence of weeping or syneresis and a smooth texture after one or more freeze/thaw cycles. Microscopy results provided below show that the use of starch compositions with waxy corn or waxy rice in the soup resulted in more intact starch granules after multiple freeze/thaw cycles, as compared to if TI corn starch only was used in the soup formulation.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The starch composition of this application may be used in any retorted food product. Food products also include those which may also be classified as pharmaceutical or nutritional products, such as diabetic foods and supplements, dietetic foods, foods to control glycemic response, foods for dysphagia, or sports drinks. In some examples, the retorted food product is a high-moisture food such as a liquid or semi-liquid.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The amount of starch composition which can be added and used in any given food may be determined to a great extent by the amount that can be tolerated by consumers of the food. In other words, the amount of starch composition used generally may be up to what is acceptable in organoleptic evaluation of the food. Preferably, the starch composition is used in an amount from about 0.1% to about 20%, by weight of the food, preferably from about 0.5% to about 16%, by weight of the food, more preferably from about 1% to about 12%, by weight of the food.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Starch compositions containing TI corn starch and varying amounts of tapioca starch were also evaluated for the same properties as the compositions containing TI corn starch and waxy corn or waxy rice. As shown below, the compositions with waxy corn or waxy rice performed better overall compared to the compositions with tapioca.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">All percentages provided herein for starch compositions are weight percentages of the overall starch composition (dry solids basis).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">RVA Comparison of TI Corn Starch and Compositions of TI Corn Starch with Waxy Corn or Waxy Rice</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">An analysis was done to compare the viscosity profile of a TI corn starch to the viscosity profile of a starch composition comprising TI corn starch and a native starch. Specifically, the native starches used in the starch samples include waxy corn (at 5.5% solids), waxy rice (at 5% solids) and tapioca (at 5% solids). The viscosity profile of each of the native starches is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The viscosity of the starches was measured using the RVA Perkins Elmer 4800 and heating each of the native starches to 95&#xb0; C., holding for 2.7 minutes, then cooling to 50&#xb0; C. and holding for 2 minutes.

This increase in peak viscosity seen at 50% can be undesirable in a retort process because it will take longer to retort the product to 6 Fo and thus more energy and processing time is required.
