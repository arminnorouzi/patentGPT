Efficiency reductions can affect the conversion capability of the SCR catalyst and ammonia storage capacity of the SCR catalyst. Degradation of the SCR catalyst can lead to reduction in catalytic conversion efficiency of the SCR catalyst leading to increased NO<sub>x </sub>emissions which is unacceptable. Therefore, knowledge of SCR catalyst degradation has been of much interest in this field. Furthermore, detection of SCR catalyst degradation can be complicated by the inclusion of multiple SCR catalysts with differing degradation modes and rates, and by other complications such as cross reading of multiple constituents by available composition sensors. Advanced emission control strategies therefore need to incorporate a model for such a behavior, which must also be sufficiently simple for practical implementation in vehicles.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments described herein relate generally to systems and methods for predicting with a real-time engine-aftertreatment data and physics based cumulative damage model, degradation of SCR catalyst performance in terms of regulating or controlling exhaust emissions from a combustion engine in a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a controller is provided for controlling operation of an aftertreatment system configured to treat constituents of an exhaust gas produced by an engine, the aftertreatment system including a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst, the controller configured to: generate a short-term cumulative degradation estimate of the SCR catalyst corresponding to reversible degradation of the SCR catalyst due to sulfur and/or hydrocarbons based on a SCR catalyst temperature parameter;

description. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative implementations described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other implementations may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and made part of this disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Embodiments described herein relate generally to systems and methods for predicting with a real-time engine-aftertreatment data and physics based cumulative damage model, degradation of SCR catalyst performance in terms of regulating or controlling exhaust emissions from a combustion engine in a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As stated earlier, SCR catalyst degradation is crucial in vehicles having aftertreatment systems. Many engine emission control strategies therefore incorporate a model for detection and calculation of the SCR catalyst degradation.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">However, existing SCR catalyst degradation models use simple regression models that track only operating hours, mileage, and a number of regeneration events to forecast degradation rate of the SCR catalyst without taking into account the real time noise factors. Moreover, the simplistic regression models typically can only help identify an average SCR catalyst aging or degradation for a group of vehicles.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Therefore, the simplistic regression models cannot help a fleet operator, a maintenance manager, or any adaptive control system to identify SCR catalyst aging in a single vehicle or a sub-group within a population running in different vehicle applications, duty cycles, or ambient conditions, etc. Therefore, further technological developments are desirable in this area.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In recent times, knowledge of cumulative damage of SCR catalyst components has expanded significantly due to detailed performance and chemical analysis of real world aged (field-returned) engine-aftertreatment systems and the availability of corresponding real-time data capability of the engine control module (ECM) and accompanying data acquisition/transmission (e.g. data logger) systems. The real-time (e.g. 1 Hz) data from physical and virtual sensors, combined with knowledge of the physics/chemistry of SCR catalyst degradation systems has enabled the development of physics-based models that track the cumulative damage and resulting emissions performance degradation of the SCR catalyst elements that are contained in the aftertreatment system. Information on the cumulative damage in an individual aftertreatment systems compared to the expected cumulative damage in the vehicle population can inform preventive maintenance practices (e.g. maintenance monitor) or adaptive emission control algorithms.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Advantageously, the disclosed embodiments of the model use the information as mentioned above making it easier for the aftertreatment system and vehicle manufacturers to increase emissions compliance for the most challenging duty cycles and applications without excessive cost, size, and weight for an overdesigned component. Furthermore, increasingly stringent CO<sub>2 </sub>standards (e.g., greenhouse gas emission standards) and increased proposed emissions useful life (EUL) requirements (over 1 million miles) result in reduced exhaust temperatures and longer durability requirements for the vehicle components and sub-systems. Advantageously, preventive maintenance practices using disclosed embodiments of the physics based cumulative damage model combined with adaptive controls and cloud-based data analytics can be effective to improve the long-term emissions capability of the vehicles.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to certain embodiments disclosed herein is an apparatus and a method for to calculate SCR catalyst degradation in an aftertreatment system using a physics based cumulative damage model. The physics based cumulative damage model, also referred to as a degradation model, can be incorporated as a system or as part of the engine control module (ECM) of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The disclosed model may be implemented in hardware, software or any combination thereof. Furthermore, the model may be implemented as part of the ECM in a vehicle. Moreover, the disclosed model may be thought of as a system or a module. The disclosed model, module, or system may be part of an adaptive control system used by fleet operators at a vehicle manufacturing or testing plants.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the disclosed physics based cumulative damage model is based on physical parameters such as ambient temperature, SCR catalyst outlet temperature, fleet trends, NO<sub>x </sub>variation, etc. Furthermore, in certain embodiments the disclosed model can be a short-term cumulative degradation model sensitive to the fuel flow and SCR catalyst temperature or a long-term cumulative degradation model sensitive to the signals from various temperature sensors in the SCR catalyst. Additionally, certain embodiments disclose an apparatus and methods of combining data analytics with the physics based model. A combined system as such can provide fleet learning capabilities and can be configured for use with a telematics system.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It may be noted by those of skill in the art that one key to successfully increasing energy efficiency, reducing emissions, and lowering energy costs in certain vehicles such as trucks is a sound knowledge of drive cycles and duty cycles. A good understanding of drive cycle (how a vehicle is used) and duty cycle (how much a vehicle is used) can help increase a truck's energy efficiency, reduce emissions and lower energy costs. The telematics system are typically used to collect information from graphical data during drive cycles and duty cycles.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, from a drive cycle's graphical data, critical vehicle operational statistics can be determined which can include: maximum speed, average speed, number and frequency of vehicle starts and stops, idle time, engine-off time, total engine hours per cycle, or other critical data such as power export time, power export demands, power take-off (PTO), dwell time during power export (this is when the engine is operating but no power is being exported), engine rpm during the power export cycle, power export load demand cycle (minimum, maximum, average, duration, etc.), or more. Similarly, data during duty cycles may typically include information about hours/shifts per day, days per week or other measurement cycle, total miles per measurement cycle, typical (average) load profile, peak load profile, and more.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one example, the disclosed physics based cumulative damage model and data analytics can get updates from a telematics system regarding:</p><p id="p-0068" num="0000">a. total fleet size and duty-cycle/applications statistics included in the fleet (i.e. fleet make-up);<br/>b. application fleet size and duty-cycle/applications statistics included in that sub-group; and/or<br/>c. customer fleet size and duty-cycle/applications statistics included in that sub-group</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">Furthermore, in some examples the factors included in a fleet make-up may include horsepower rating of the engine, machine (vehicle) type, geographical location of vehicle operation or other factors. Additionally, the total fleet size may be defined as being equal to the sum of the same engine displacement and aftertreatment. Some examples of customer fleets such as Penske fleet or Swift fleet. The information collected from these sub-groups via telematics can be used to improve any related machines. It can also be used for adaptation of the cumulative damage model to determine the preventative (scheduled) maintenance limits.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">The disclosed embodiments are explained with regard to SCR catalyst or diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), however those may be applicable to other types of catalysts used in any other types of engines used in vehicles, boilers, electric heaters, or any other machines.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example system <b>100</b> including an engine <b>102</b> and an aftertreatment system <b>106</b>.

One way to lose performance is through loss of reducible Cu sites, which is what happens upon sulfur poisoning.

The other sets also represent NH<sub>3 </sub>storage kinetics for the same or different sites. A kinetic model may be formed by considering NH<sub>3 </sub>adsorption with at least four different types of energetics, associated with different types of active sites. For example, active sites may be categorized as weak or strong Br&#xf8;nsted acid sites, or lumped ZCu, Z2Cu and ZCuOH Copper sites or lumped Physisorbed sites. Further, in one example, a type-II BET isotherm may be used for estimating adsorption on Br&#xf8;nsted acid sites, a Temkin isotherm may be used for estimating adsorption on lumped copper sites, and a Langmuir isotherm may be used for estimating adsorption on lumped Physisorbed sites.

In a third embodiment the signal <b>801</b> can be derived from a temperature sensor disposed within a SCR catalyst to measure the SCR catalyst bed temperature.

For example, the short-term cumulative degradation model <b>808</b> can correspond or may be used to estimate the amount of sulfur storage on the SCR catalyst coating at low exhaust temperatures or the amount of sulfur release from the SCR catalyst at high exhaust temperatures or both.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0114">In other words, in one example, the short-term model <b>808</b> is configured to generate a short-term cumulative degradation estimate of the SCR catalyst corresponding to a reversible degradation of the SCR catalyst due to sulfur and/or hydrocarbons based on a SCR catalyst temperature parameter. Additionally, the long-term model <b>810</b> is configured to generate a long-term cumulative degradation estimate corresponding to thermal aging of the SCR catalyst based on the SCR catalyst temperature parameter. Furthermore, the SCR catalyst temperature parameter can comprise an inlet exhaust gas temperature at an inlet of the SCR catalyst, an outlet exhaust gas temperature at an outlet of the SCR catalyst, or a SCR catalyst temperature of the SCR catalyst or more. In one example, the inlet exhaust gas temperature, the outlet exhaust gas temperature, or the SCR catalyst temperature can be determined using a physical temperature sensor or can be calculated based on operating parameters of the exhaust gas.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0115">These temperatures are measured in the exhaust stream upstream and downstream of the oxidation catalyst (e.g., a diesel particulate filter) the virtual internal temperature sensors are predicted (using an embedded heat-transfer/thermodynamic software model in the ECM) inside the cylindrical SCR catalyst element at one or more axial and radial positions inside the SCR catalyst element.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0116">The combined degradation estimate based SCR catalyst plant model <b>814</b> can be a combination of a real-time SCR catalyst plant model (not shown) which can be a real-time simulation or a plant model of the physical and chemical reactions that occur in modules <b>710</b> and <b>712</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.

For example in case of a line-haul vehicle such as a truck may be shifted temporarily to a pick-up and delivery driving cycle which may allow machine learning and enhance physics-based model to make adjustments to the engine/aftertreatment calibration using over-the-air (OTA) calibration adjustments.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a graphical illustration of an example of application of prognostics with machine learning to extend cumulative damage factor into future times, according to an embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> includes a graph <b>2200</b> of cumulative damage factor versus time. A plot <b>2202</b> in the graph <b>2200</b> can represent sample data from service performance test for a single vehicle. A region <b>2201</b> represents the diagnostics historical data where as a region <b>2203</b> represents prognostics region. The data from the region <b>2201</b> can be used to extend or extrapolate the cumulative damage factor into future. For example, from a cluster of data shown, the plot <b>2202</b> can be extended as either line <b>2204</b>, line <b>2206</b>, or line <b>2208</b>, where <b>2208</b> is a mean of the line <b>2204</b> and the line <b>2206</b>.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0165">As such, the data from the graph <b>2200</b> can be used as prognostics using machine learning. The use of sample data from service performance tests performed on other vehicles and/or machines within a population helps improve the reliability of the extrapolation of the cumulative damage function or factors for that particular single vehicle. This could be further enhanced by the use of the histograms that are reduced from time-domain exhaust temperature data and exhaust mass flow data (that are comparable to the time constant of the combined degradation estimate based SCR catalyst plant model <b>814</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) and can allow a more efficient data transfer from the machine to the cloud-based data analytics. This approach has a benefit that it is agnostic (insensitive) to SCR catalyst design settings. This may further allow the identification of vehicle sub-populations and allow data analytics to determine if the service performance tests on other vehicles and/or engine aftertreatment systems are applicable to a particular vehicle. The vehicles may include cars, trucks, buses etc. that operate on-road (paved or un-paved) which are subject to on-highway emission regulations. The engine aftertreatment systems may include aftertreatment systems in generator sets, farming or agricultural equipment, construction or mining equipment that operate off-road which are subject to off-highway emission regulations.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> illustrates an example implementation <b>2300</b> of integration of data analytics with physics based degradation model combined with a conventional PID controller as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, according to an embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> can be one example of an implementation <b>1600</b> of integrated physics based model with PID controller of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> with additional data analytics blocks or modules.

In one example, data analytics blocks <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b>, and <b>2306</b> may be used for adjusting the cumulative damage model damage value on a vehicle fleet trend data and update the cumulative damage value to date as well as updating the cumulative damage model for future calculations.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0167">In an example practical implementation, the controller <b>128</b> may be configured to receive a population SCR catalyst damage signal corresponding to an amount of SCR catalyst damage experienced by a plurality of SCR catalysts included in a respective plurality of vehicle aftertreatment systems, each of the plurality of vehicle aftertreatment systems being substantially similar to the aftertreatment system <b>160</b>. Furthermore, the ECM <b>128</b> may be configured to modify the short-term cumulative degradation estimate and the long-term cumulative degradation estimate based on the population SCR catalyst damage signal.

The implementation <b>2400</b> is similar to the implementation <b>2300</b> but includes an additional signal or parameter named SCR catalyst temperature during regeneration signal <b>2401</b> as an input to the short-term cumulative degradation model. Furthermore, there may be a degradation prior to regeneration model <b>2408</b> in this implementation.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0169">In one example, the short-term cumulative degradation model <b>808</b> can be a sulfur exposure model to determine damage to the SCR catalyst system. A software implementation of this can include total fuel burn, SCR performance to determine the amount of sulfur exposure. If enabled, this feature may use desulfurization (i.e., sulfur removal events) as an input along with total fuel burn. An extension of this concept for the cumulative damage model may use a calculated sulfur exposure based on the total fuel burned in addition to time and temperature exposure to determine the damage to the SCR catalyst system. The software may use this information to predict SCR performance, for which measurements from field return units and telematics-based data analytics can provide feedback corrections to an individual vehicle. The use of a model-based SCR NO<sub>x </sub>conversion performance (including low temperature NO<sub>x </sub>conversion changes in short-term (10's of hours)) may allow identification of fuel sulfur exposure for an individual truck (or sub-population) based on the long-term cumulative degradation trends observed in the larger population using data analytics.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> illustrates an existing implementation <b>2500</b> of model-based controls in an aftertreatment system for a real time plant.

The implementation <b>2600</b> is a combination of the implementation <b>2500</b> and <b>1800</b>. The damage events within SCR catalyst systems are a function of the internal SCR catalyst bed temperatures and the use of a SCR catalyst thermal model for virtual internal temperature sensors combined with physics-based embedded damage models can improve the ability of the control system to track cumulative damage over time. Due to the cylindrical form of SCR catalyst elements, the virtual internal temperature sensors can be simplified to two-dimensional (radial and axial) models and the embedded cumulative damage model can be applied within radial and axial zones of the cylindrical SCR catalyst element. The overall cumulative damage within the SCR catalyst bed is an aggregate of the local cumulative damage within radial/axial zone.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> illustrates an example implementation <b>2700</b> of integration of data analytics with a real time plant model and physics based degradation models (<b>808</b> and <b>810</b>) and a conventional PID controller, according to an embodiment.
