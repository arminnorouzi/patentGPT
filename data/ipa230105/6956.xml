For example, Canvas, is a web-based LMS now used by more than 3,000 universities, school districts, and institutions around the world. LMS systems deliver and manage all types of content, including video, courses, and documents. In the education and higher education markets, an LMS will include a variety of functionality that is similar to corporate but will have features such as rubrics, teacher and instructor-facilitated learning, a discussion board, and often the use of a syllabus.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Canvas is a powerful and flexible platform that includes many features and allows third-party developers to offer additional features. For example, Canvas offers SMS notifications, including course content. This is how Canvas notifies users about their upcoming planner items. One limitation with Canvas's system is that students are only notified when a planner item is posted or changed. As a result, students can miss assignments. </p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one example disclosed is a method for providing a user-control message service. The message service can be one of a short message service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), GroupMe, FB Messenger, and a voice call. The method begins with accessing, by a server, data in a third-party format from a third-party server, where the server and the third-party server are controlled by different business entities. The third-party server can be running one of any one or more of a learning management system, email system, and other data sources. As an example, the accessing is performed using one or more of API calls, web scraping, file transfer protocol (FTP), and http methods. In another example the accessing includes accessing reminders from a syllabus using an API or optical character recognition.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Next, the data in the third-party format is filtered, which has been accessed according to user preferences, the user preferences including a mobile device identifier. The filtering includes one or more of show courses, skip courses, set days, and skip completed to-dos. The filtering may also include one or more of planner is empty, time and time-zone, active status, texts paused, and skipped days of week.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Next, the data in the third-party format is converted as specified by the user preferences into a format compatible with the message service. In one example, converting the data in the third-party format into a format compatible with the message service is one of a SMS protocol or an instant message for receipt by a messaging app. The user preferences for formatting may include one or more of classes, customized course names, birthday, time format, time-zone, name, and limited reminder amount.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The user preferences for formatting include one or more of customized course names, time format, time-zone, name, and limited reminder amount. Finally, the data is sent in which has been converted into the message service to the mobile device as specified by the mobile device identifier. In one example, the data is sent, which has been converted into the SMS format to an SMS gateway to send to the mobile device as specified by the mobile device identifier. For example, the data is sent, which has been converted into the SMS format or instant message to the mobile device as specified by the mobile device identifier. As another example, the data is sent  which has been converted into the SMS format to an SMS gateway or through the use of a CPaaS API to send to the mobile device as specified by the mobile device identifier.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example the process continues by accessing, by the server, data in an additional third-party format from an additional third-party server, wherein the server and the additional third-party server are controlled by different business entities. Next, the data is filtered in the additional third-party format which has been accessed according to user preferences, the user preferences including a mobile device identifier. Next, the data is converted in the additional third-party format which, as specified by the user preferences, into a format compatible with the message service. Finally, the data is sent, which has been converted into the message service to the mobile device as specified by the mobile device identifier.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another example, the process above includes receiving a request from a plurality of users to join a collaborative group. In this example, the filtering the data in the third-party format which has been accessed according to user preferences, the user preferences including a mobile device identifier for each of the plurality of users. And further, in this example, the sending the data which has been converted into the message service includes sending to the mobile devices as specified by the mobile device identifier for each of the plurality of users.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A more complete understanding of the present disclosure, and the attendant advantages and features thereof, will be more readily understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example flowchart of the system and method, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an example screenshot of a webpage where a first-time user can sign up for the service or a returning user can sign-in to their account, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a screenshot of example webpages where a user can add and/or edit their settings, according to the present invention; </p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are a screenshot of an example webpage that a user can preview the text message that would be received based on the settings, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a sample text message a user would receive with upcoming assignments, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of the data handling process, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a table of user filter and formatting preferences, according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flow chart of the overall process, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram depicting the operating environment, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram depicting connected accounts or parental notifications, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an example of a preview message, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a diagram of extra reminders, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a picture of a message as an image, according to the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating one example of a client or server information processing system, according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As required, embodiments are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely examples and that the methods described below can be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present subject matter in virtually any appropriately detailed  structure and function. Further, the terms and phrases used herein are not intended to be limiting, but rather, to provide an understandable description of the concepts.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The description of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description but is not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the invention in the form disclosed. Many modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. The embodiment was chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and the practical application, and to enable others of ordinary skill in the art to understand the invention for various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention is directed to a successfully commercialized version of the software under the brand name Lazy TextsTM App. In one example, the present invention to text users a list of the upcoming items on their learning management systems, such as, but not limited to the Canvas planner. The types of planner items that can be found on a planner are assignments, quizzes, discussion topics, announcements, and calendar events. The Lazy Texts App fetches the items from the user's Canvas planner that are due within the number of days the user specifies. It then filters the list based on the user's several customizations and compiles one or more text messages to send.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the description here is directed to text messages, it is important to note that other messaging types can be used, as further described in the section entitled &#x201c;Non-Limiting Definitions.&#x201d; A message is any communication from one electronic device to another electronic device, typically from a server to a client, such as a push notification, a web browser notification, email, short message service, or instant message using a messaging app. The message may include the information embedded in it or a link, such as a URL (uniform resource locator), to a website or other address for additional information. In one example, the user can specify that in addition to sending reminders as texts (SMS, WhatsApp, etc.) the user can also receive a message that is an image or voice recording for ADA compliance.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Currently, up to three text messages are part of the Lazy Texts App, but the disclosure contemplates additional text messages. The first text includes a user's assignments, quizzes, and  discussion posts; the second text includes a user's announcements; and the third text includes a user's calendar events. All users receive at least the first text, with the last two texts being optional. Text messages display each planner item by showing its due date, course, type (assignment, quiz, etc.), and name. Users may also opt to receive more than one text per day and select the times at which the texts will be sent. Available customizations options can depend on the subscription package that the user selects.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The user personalizes their text message with customization options on the Lazy Texts website, LazyTexts.com, where the user creates an account with their phone number. Their customizations are saved on their account and can be changed at any time to be applied to the next text they receive. The next text they receive can be previewed on the website, and the preview is updated whenever the user saves their changes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first customization option is their preferred first name (nickname) that they will be called in the opening sentence of the text. The user then selects if they want the course associated with each planner item to be included in their text. The user can also choose to omit certain courses from a list of courses they are enrolled in. Users also have the option to change the name of each course from that used in Canvas, where they are encouraged to shorten the name of their courses, to keep the texts more concise and, therefore, more readable for the user. The course name change can also be reflected in their Canvas. Finally, users can set a limit to the planner items they receive by both specifying the maximum number of days out for each planner item to be, and the maximum number of planner items to fully display in the text; the remainder of planner items are displayed as a number at the end of the text.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The user's customization options are stored in a database. They are set to default values when the user signs up on the website. The main program that sends the texts runs independently of the website and is pulling the user's customization options at runtime. The website is intended first for the user to sign up to receive their texts and then as a means for the user to log in easily to modify their customization options.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As previously noted, Canvas does offer SMS notifications, including course content. One problem with Canvas's system is that users are only notified when a planner item is posted or  changed. Furthermore, the notifications that Canvas offers for course content are not customizable. One aspect that sets the Lazy Texts App apart is that it is more user-friendly and gives the user a vast array of customization options, as detailed above, to allow them to receive no more and no less than what they need to see to keep them organized.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Non-Limiting Definitions</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.
