A saw blade typically includes a body, one or more attachment portions, and a cutting portion. The cutting portion comprises a plurality of teeth made up of one or more tooth forms. Tooth forms on saw blades are a major factor in the durability, cost, speed of cutting, and accuracy and quality of cuts made. Each tooth typically includes a tip, a relief face, a rake face, and a gullet. The teeth are generally separated by a pitch length (otherwise identified as the number of teeth per inch (TPI)). Some tooth forms vary along the length of the saw blade or include portions having varied teeth. In some tooth forms, a nail may become lodged in the gullet of a tooth during operation, thereby breaking or otherwise damaging the tooth.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In many instances, the operator of a reciprocating saw uses the saw and attached saw blade to initiate and make cuts in construction material starting at an edge, or periphery, of the construction material. During such cuts, the cutting portion and the plurality of teeth associated therewith are the first part of the saw blade to contact the material. In other instances, the operator of the reciprocating saw uses the saw and attached saw blade to initiate a cut in a face of the construction material (i.e., away from the edge, or periphery, of the construction material). This type of cut is typically referred to as a plunge cut. During a plunge cut, a leading tooth located proximate the end of the saw blade penetrates the material face first. Therefore, the end geometry and the leading tooth geometry of the saw blade are significant to performance during plunge cutting and may affect the durability of the saw blade, the speed with which the plunge cut is executed, and the accuracy of the cut.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, the invention provides a reciprocating saw blade for use with a reciprocating saw. The reciprocating saw blade includes a body defining a longitudinal axis, and a cutting portion formed on the body. The cutting portion includes a plurality of cutting teeth, each cutting tooth including a tip and a protrusion, each tip spaced a separation distance from a corresponding protrusion in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. A protrusion of a first cutting tooth is spaced a gap distance from a tip of an adjacent second cutting tooth in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis. A ratio of the separation distance to the gap distance is at least 0.4 and no greater than 0.5.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, the invention provides a reciprocating saw blade for use with a reciprocating saw. The reciprocating saw blade includes a body defining a longitudinal axis, an attachment portion coupled to the body, the attachment portion configured to couple to the reciprocating saw, and a cutting portion formed on the body. The cutting portion includes a plurality of cutting teeth, each cutting tooth including a tip and a rounded protrusion, each tip spaced a separation distance from a corresponding rounded protrusion in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, the rounded protrusion of a first cutting tooth spaced a gap distance from the tip of an adjacent second cutting tooth in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis, the tip of the first cutting tooth being closer than the rounded protrusion of the first cutting tooth to the attachment portion along a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis. The cutting portion also includes a gullet defined between the tip of the first cutting tooth and the rounded protrusion of the adjacent second cutting tooth, the gullet including a base. The tips of the plurality of cutting teeth define a plane that is generally parallel to the longitudinal axis. The separation distance and the gap distance are configured such that a standard framing nail engages a rounded protrusion and no more than 20% of the standard framing nail protrudes beyond the plane toward the base of the gullet in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed

The illustrated saw blade <b>30</b> is a reciprocating saw blade for use with a power tool such as, for example, a reciprocating saw <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>). The saw blade <b>30</b> includes a body <b>38</b>, an attachment portion <b>42</b> for coupling the blade <b>30</b> to the reciprocating saw <b>34</b>, a cutting portion <b>46</b> having a plurality of cutting teeth <b>50</b>, and a plunge point <b>54</b> for initiating a plunge cut.

In other embodiments, the saw blade <b>30</b> may be formed from several pieces that are welded or otherwise secured together. During operation, the saw blade <b>30</b> is reciprocated in a cutting direction <b>58</b> and a return direction <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to cut through a work piece. In some embodiments, the saw <b>34</b> and the blade <b>30</b> may be used to cut through work pieces composed of wood having nails extending through or embedded therein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The body <b>38</b> includes a first end portion <b>66</b> and a second end portion <b>70</b>.

In the illustrated embodiment, the effective relief angle F is approximately 14.5 degrees. The effective relief angle F is between the tang angle A and the relief angle C. That is, the effective relief angle F of each cutting tooth <b>50</b> is generally greater than the tang angle A (e.g., 6.5 degrees), but generally smaller than the relief angle C (e.g., 23 degrees).

As the saw blade <b>30</b> moves in the cutting direction <b>58</b> (to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), the tips <b>106</b> of the cutting teeth <b>50</b> engage and cut through the work piece <b>170</b>. The protrusions <b>130</b> are hidden behind the tips <b>106</b> of adjacent teeth <b>50</b> such that the protrusions <b>130</b> do not cut the work piece <b>170</b> during the cutting operation.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the saw blade <b>30</b> encounters the nail <b>166</b>, the rake faces <b>110</b> of the cutting teeth <b>50</b> typically would contact the nail <b>166</b>. Such contact may chip, break, or otherwise damage the cutting teeth <b>50</b>, significantly reducing the usable life of the saw blade <b>30</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the protrusions <b>130</b> inhibit the nail <b>166</b> from impacting the rake faces <b>110</b>. Instead, as the saw blade <b>30</b> moves in the cutting direction <b>58</b>, the nail <b>166</b> contacts one of the protrusions <b>130</b> before contacting the adjacent rake face <b>110</b>. The protrusion <b>130</b> displaces (e.g., lifts) the saw blade <b>30</b>, which repositions the nail <b>166</b> with respect to the gullet <b>114</b> in an improved cutting position. In the improved cutting position, the protrusion <b>130</b> inhibits the nail <b>166</b> from entering the gullet <b>114</b> and the tip <b>106</b> is allowed to cut into the nail <b>166</b>. When the saw blade <b>30</b> is reciprocated in the return direction <b>62</b> (to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), the nail <b>166</b> can ride along the corresponding relief surface <b>118</b> and over the tip <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the illustrated embodiment, the protrusions <b>130</b> of the cutting teeth <b>50</b> are designed to inhibit a standard framing nail having a 0.131 inch diameter from entering the gullets <b>114</b>. In other embodiments, the protrusions <b>130</b> may be optimized to inhibit other size nails from entering the gullets <b>114</b>. The distance R between the plane <b>134</b> defined by the tips <b>106</b> and the plane <b>158</b> defined by the protrusions <b>130</b> and the distance S between effective relief surfaces <b>162</b> of adjacent cutting teeth <b>50</b> are optimized to increase durability of the cutting teeth <b>50</b> by offsetting a center of the framing nail approximately 0.031 inches below the plane <b>134</b>. That is, the protrusions <b>130</b> are sized and positioned to prevent approximately 80% of the nail from entering the area above the plane <b>134</b>. Such a configuration results in an increase in durability compared to a similar saw blade without protrusions on the cutting teeth. As used herein, the term &#x2018;durability&#x2019; refers to the average number of cuts a saw blade makes before fracturing a cutting tooth.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the plunge point <b>54</b> is formed on the second end portion <b>70</b> of the body <b>38</b> opposite the attachment portion <b>42</b>.

The rake face <b>186</b> extends from the tip <b>182</b> at a leading rake angle H relative to the plane <b>134</b>. The leading rake angle H, measured through the leading tooth <b>174</b>, is a negative rake angle (i.e., greater than 90 degrees) such that the leading tooth <b>174</b> is a negative rake tooth. A negative rake tooth is less likely to hook or grab material being cut, allowing the plunge point <b>54</b> to more easily penetrate a work piece without chipping the work piece. In the illustrated embodiment, the leading rake angle H is approximately 95 to 105 degrees.

The enlarged leading gullet <b>190</b> improves plunge cut performance by allowing the leading tooth <b>174</b> to penetrate further into a work piece before the plurality of cutting teeth <b>50</b> engage the work piece, thereby improving cut quality and finish.
