Specifically, when one of the first direction (x direction) and the second direction (x direction), which is the direction in which the substrate extends substantially, is substantially perpendicular to the ground surface, the lower portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the upper portion <b>1</b><i>c </i>may be disposed on the left and right sides, respectively, with respect to the end portion <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the edge portion <b>1</b><i>e </i>from the viewpoint of the observer standing perpendicular to the ground. On the other hand, as described in this specification, when the first direction (x direction) and the second direction (x direction), which are the directions in which the substrate extends substantially, are parallel to the ground surface, the lower portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the edge portion <b>1</b><i>e </i>and the upper portion <b>1</b><i>c </i>may be arranged on the upper side and the lower side with respect to the end portion <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the edge portion <b>1</b><i>e </i>from the viewpoint of the observer standing perpendicular to the ground.

Further, in accordance with the general process of manufacturing the substrate <b>1</b>, the substrate <b>1</b> during processing includes an upper surface exposed to the processing environment and a lower surface in contact with a supporting structure included in a carrier, a conveyor, etc. Therefore, if a predetermined portion of the edge <b>1</b><i>e </i>adjacent to the lower surface of the substrate is defined as the lower portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>and a predetermined portion of the edge <b>1</b><i>e </i>adjacent to the upper surface of the substrate <b>1</b> is defined as the upper portion <b>1</b><i>c, </i>the definition of the lower portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the upper portion <b>1</b><i>c </i>of the edge portion <b>1</b><i>e </i>will obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art.

In this case, the lower portion of the edge portion before the substrate is inverted can be the upper portion of the edge portion after the substrate is inverted, and the upper portion of the edge portion before the substrate is inverted can be the lower portion of the edge portion after the substrate is inverted.

The first chamfering wheels <b>11</b> and the first polishing wheels <b>12</b> in a row may be in parallel with the moving direction of the substrate <b>1</b> and may chamfer and polish an adjacent edge portion <b>1</b><i>e. </i>At the same time, the first chamfering wheels <b>11</b> and the first polishing wheels <b>12</b> in the other row may chamfer and polish another edge portion <b>1</b><i>e </i>facing the above edge portion <b>1</b><i>e. </i>Accordingly, two facing edge portions <b>1</b><i>e </i>of the substrate <b>1</b> may be simultaneously chamfered and polished on the first stage <b>10</b>. The first chamfering wheels <b>11</b> may be closer to an inlet of the first stage <b>10</b> than the first polishing wheels <b>12</b> so that the substrate <b>1</b> may be firstly chamfered and then polished. A distance between the first chamfering wheels <b>11</b> and the first polishing wheels <b>12</b> in a row and the first chamfering wheels <b>11</b> and the first polishing wheels <b>12</b> in the other row may vary depending on a size of the substrate <b>1</b> that is chamfered and polished.
