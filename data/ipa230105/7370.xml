As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the side-strap structure comprises an outer strap shell <b>1</b>, a strap <b>2</b>, a middle strap shell <b>3</b>, a bottom strap shell <b>4</b> and a strap locker <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Particularly, the bottom strap shell <b>4</b> is rotatably fixed to the main body <b>6</b> of the head-mounted device through the strap locker <b>5</b>, the middle strap shell <b>3</b> is fixed between the outer strap shell <b>1</b> and the bottom strap shell <b>4</b>, and one end of the strap <b>2</b> are fixed between the outer strap shell <b>1</b> and the middle strap shell <b>3</b>. In general, two side-strap structures need to be provided at the head-mounted device, and are provided on the two sides of the head-mounted device for fixing the two ends of the strap to the head-mounted device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An accommodating slot for placing a loudspeaker <b>8</b> is provided on the inner side of one end of the bottom strap shell <b>4</b>. After the loudspeaker is placed into the accommodating slot, the middle strap shell <b>3</b> and the bottom strap shell <b>4</b> are hermetically connected. The middle strap shell <b>3</b>, the bottom strap shell <b>4</b> and the upper end of the loudspeaker <b>8</b> form a front sound cavity of the loudspeaker <b>8</b>. The middle strap shell <b>3</b> can also separate the front sound cavity of the loudspeaker <b>8</b> from the strap <b>2</b> so as not to affect the sound quality of the loudspeaker <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The outer side of the other end of the bottom strap shell <b>4</b> is provided with a sound emitting hole <b>7</b> of the loudspeaker <b>8</b>, the sound emitting hole <b>7</b> is in communication with the front sound cavity, and the sound generated by the vibration of the loudspeaker <b>8</b> passes through the front sound cavity and the sound emitting hole <b>7</b> in sequence to realize external sound playing.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a sound playing hole <b>9</b> is provided at the periphery of the accommodating slot so that the rear sound cavity of the loudspeaker <b>8</b> is in communication with the outside. Generally, when designing the structure of loudspeakers, it is necessary to provide a large front sound cavity and a large rear sound cavity to ensure that the air pressures at the front and rear end faces of the loudspeaker are equal during the vibration, to make the sound quality of the loudspeaker better. In the present embodiment, the rear sound cavity of the loudspeaker <b>8</b> is in communication with the outside by providing the sound playing hole <b>9</b> on the periphery of the accommodating slot, and thus the consistence of the air pressures of the front and rear sound cavities can be achieved without providing a large rear sound cavity, thereby reducing the volume of the side-strap structure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to prevent external dust particles from entering the side-strap structure, a filter mesh is provided within the sound playing hole <b>9</b> and/or the sound emitting hole <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the accommodating slot is of an outwardly convex structure, and the bottom of the accommodating slot passes through a through hole <b>10</b> on a side of the main body <b>6</b> of the head-mounted device and is rotatably fixed to the strap locker <b>5</b>.
