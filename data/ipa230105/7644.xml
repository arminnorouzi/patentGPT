To improve spectrum utilization, base station deployment density may be increased. As the base station deployment density increases, a relay node (relay node, RN) is introduced to reduce costs for deploying optical fibers between a base station and a core network. The relay node establishes a connection to the core network based on a wireless backhaul link, to further reduce the deployment costs of optical fibers. Usually, the relay node may establish a wireless backhaul link with one or more upper-level nodes, and access the core network through the upper-level node. The relay node may provide services for one or more lower-level nodes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An in-band relay solution is a relay solution in which a backhaul link and an access link share a same frequency band, and has advantages such as high spectrum efficiency and low deployment costs. Integrated access and backhaul (integrated access and backhaul, IAB) is an in-band relay solution. In this in-band relay solution, a relay node may be referred to as an IAB node (node). When IAB nodes are densely deployed, interference exists between the IAB nodes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, how to reduce mutual interference between the IAB nodes is an urgent technical problem to be resolved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application provides a resource indication method and a communication apparatus, to reduce mutual interference between IAB nodes, and therefore improve network performance and spectrum efficiency.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of this application provides a resource indication method.

It should be understood that the IAB node in this application is only used for description, but this does not mean that the solutions of this application are used only in an NR scenario.

One is a wireless access link, and the other is a wireless backhaul link.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The wireless access link may also be described as an access link (access link), and refers to a link between a terminal device and an IAB node or an IAB donor. Alternatively, the wireless access link includes a wireless link used when a node communicates with a lower-level node of the node. The wireless access link includes an uplink access link and a downlink access link. The uplink access link is also referred to as uplink transmission of the access link, and the downlink access link is also referred to as downlink transmission of the access link.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The wireless backhaul link may also be described as a backhaul (backhaul, BH) link, and refers to a link between an IAB node and an IAB child node or between an IAB node and an IAB parent node. For example, for the node <b>110</b>, an IAB child node of the node <b>110</b> is the IAB node <b>120</b>, and an IAB parent node of the node <b>110</b> is the base station <b>100</b>. The wireless backhaul link includes a downlink transmission link to the IAB child node or the IAB parent node, and an uplink transmission link to the IAB child node or the IAB parent node. For the IAB node, transmitting data to the IAB parent node of the IAB node or receiving uplink data transmitted by the IAB child node of the IAB node is referred to as uplink transmission of the backhaul link. For the IAB node, receiving data transmitted by the IAB parent node of the IAB node or transmitting data to the IAB child node of the IAB node is referred to as downlink transmission of the backhaul link. To distinguish a terminal device from the IAB node, a backhaul link between the IAB node and the IAB parent node of the IAB node is also referred to as an upper-level backhaul link (parent BH link), and a backhaul link between the IAB node and the IAB child node of the IAB node is referred to as a lower-level backhaul link (child BH link).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Usually, a lower-level node may be considered as a terminal device of an upper-level node. It should be understood that, that one IAB node is connected to one upper-level node is used as an example in the IAB system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. During actual application, to improve reliability of a wireless backhaul link, one IAB node, for example, the IAB node <b>120</b>, may be connected to a plurality of upper-level nodes. In other words, a plurality of upper-level nodes may provide services for one IAB node.

In particular, wireless backhaul links <b>113</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>133</b>, and a&#x2032;a<b>134</b> may be used by upper-level nodes to provide services for lower-level nodes. For example, the upper-level node (for example, the base station <b>100</b>) provides a wireless backhaul service for the lower-level node (for example, the IAB node <b>110</b>). It should be understood that an uplink and a downlink of the backhaul link may be separated, in other words, transmission on the uplink and transmission on the downlink are not initiated by a same node. Downlink transmission means that an upper-level node (for example, the base station <b>100</b>) transmits information or data to a lower-level node (for example, the IAB node <b>110</b>). Uplink transmission means that a lower-level node (for example, the IAB node <b>110</b>) transmits information or data to an upper-level node (for example, the base station <b>100</b>). The node is not limited to a base station, an IAB node, and a terminal device. For example, in a device-to-device (device-to-device, D2D) scenario, a terminal device may be used as a relay node to serve another terminal device. In some scenarios, the wireless backhaul link may also be an access link. For example, the wireless backhaul link <b>123</b> may also be considered as an access link for the node <b>110</b>, and the backhaul link <b>113</b> is also an access link for the node <b>100</b>. It should be understood that the upper-level node may be a base station or may be a relay node, and the lower-level node may be a relay node or a terminal device having the relay function.

The MT is used by the IAB node to implement communication with an upper-level node, and the DU is used to implement communication between the IAB node and a lower-level node. A link on which the MT communicates with the upper-level node may be referred to as an upper-level backhaul link, and a link on which the DU communicates with the lower-level node may be referred to as a lower-level backhaul link. In some cases, for example, a case in which the lower-level node of the DU is a terminal device, the lower-level backhaul link may also be referred to as an access link.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In an NR system, the IAB node is configured with an MT resource and a DU resource. Three resource types may be configured for MT resources, and are separately downlink (downlink, D), uplink (uplink, U), and flexible (flexible, F). A donor base station of the IAB node may configure a type of the MT resource for the IAB node by using signaling. Four resource types may be configured for DU resources, and are separately uplink, downlink, flexible, and not available (not available, NA). &#x201c;Not available&#x201d; may also be described as &#x201c;disabled&#x201d;, &#x201c;unavailable&#x201d;, or the like. Further, DU-uplink resources or DU-flexible resources may be further classified into a hard (hard) resource and a soft (soft) resource. The hard resource refers to a resource that is always available to the DU. Whether the soft resource is available to the DU depends on an indication of the upper-level node. It can be further learned that the MT resources of the IAB node have three resource types, and the DU resources have seven resource types. One resource type of the MT resources and one resource type of the DU resources may be combined to support time division multiplexing, space division multiplexing, or even full-duplex mode transmission.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">A full-duplex mode means that a device may receive a signal sent by another device and send a signal to another device at a same moment.
