Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a wafer processing temporary adhesive, a wafer laminate, and a method for manufacturing a thin wafer.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Three-dimensional semiconductor packages become essential for accomplishing a higher density and capacity. The 3D semiconductor packaging technology is by thinning semiconductor chips individually, and stacking them in multilayer structure while providing through-silicon via (TSV) interconnects. Fabrication of such packages requires the steps of thinning a substrate having a semiconductor circuit formed therein by grinding its non-circuit forming surface or back surface, and forming TSV and electrodes on the back surface. In the prior art, the step of grinding the back surface of a silicon substrate includes attaching a protective tape to the surface of the substrate opposite to the surface to be ground for preventing the wafer from breakage during the grinding step. Since the protective tape uses an organic resin film as the support substrate, it is flexible, but has insufficient strength and heat resistance to withstand the TSV forming step and the step of forming interconnects on the back surface.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is then proposed to bond a semiconductor substrate to a support of silicon, glass or the like via an adhesive layer. The resulting system is sufficient to withstand the steps of grinding the back surface and forming TSV and electrodes on the back surface. The adhesive layer for bonding the substrate to the support is critical for this system. The adhesive layer must bond the substrate to the support without leaving gaps, be durable enough to withstand the subsequent steps, and eventually allow the thin wafer to be readily released from the support. Herein, the adhesive layer is referred to as &#x201c;temporary adhesive layer&#x201d; since it is finally released.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With regard to well-known temporary adhesive layers and release thereof, Patent Document 1 discloses a layer of an adhesive containing a light absorbing substance. The adhesive layer is irradiated with high intensity light for decomposing the adhesive layer so that the adhesive layer may be removed from the support. Patent Document 2 discloses an adhesive comprising a heat-fusible hydrocarbon compound, wherein the adhesive can be bonded and released in the heat fused condition. The former technology undesirably requires an expensive tool such as laser and a longer time of treatment per substrate. The latter technology is simple because of control solely by heat, but is applicable to only a limited range because of instability at high temperatures in excess of 200&#xb0; C. These temporary adhesive layers are not adequate to form a layer of uniform thickness on a heavily stepped substrate and to provide a complete bond to the support.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of a silicone pressure-sensitive adhesive as the temporary adhesive layer is proposed in Patent Document 3. A substrate is bonded to a support with an addition reaction curable silicone pressure-sensitive adhesive. On removal, the assembly is immersed in an etching solution capable of dissolving or decomposing the silicone resin, whereby the substrate is separated from the support. This method takes a very long time for removal and is difficult to apply to the commercial manufacture process. Also, a long time is necessary to wash away the silicone adhesive which is left as residues on the substrate after removal, posing a problem in terms of wash-away.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 1: JP-A 2004-64040</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Document 2: JP-A 2006-328104</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 3: U.S. Pat.

The temporary adhesive is applicable to a wide spectrum of semiconductor film-forming process, is highly resistant to chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and forms a temporary adhesive layer having high uniformity of film thickness even on a stepped wafer. By virtue of the film thickness uniformity, a uniform thin wafer of up to 50 &#x3bc;m thick can be easily manufactured. The temporary adhesive using the non-functional organopolysiloxane is improved in peeling or release. After a thin wafer is produced, the wafer can be easily released from the support, for example, at room temperature, that is, a fragile thin wafer can be easily manufactured. Since the temporary adhesive is selectively bondable to the support, no residues of the temporary adhesive are left on the thin wafer after release, and the subsequent washing-away step is effective. By the wafer manufacturing method of the invention, thin wafers having a TSV structure or bump interconnect structure can be easily manufactured.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0010" level="2">[Wafer Processing Temporary Adhesive]</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0023">The invention provides a wafer processing temporary adhesive comprising a thermosetting silicone resin composition containing a non-functional organopolysiloxane.

of Examples 1 to 7 including the temporary adhesive layer within the scope of the invention have sufficient processing durability, good peeling properties, and good clean-away after peeling. In contrast, the wafer laminates of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 not containing the non-functional organopolysiloxane and Comparative Examples 3 and 4 containing the functional organopolysiloxane showed a strong bond between the circuit-bearing wafer and the support. As a result, the wafer cracked in the peeling step and peeling was impossible.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230002647A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
