This description is not intended as an extensive or detailed discussion of known concepts. Details that are well known may have been omitted, or may be handled in summary fashion.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following subject matter may be embodied in a variety of different forms, such as methods, devices, components, and/or systems. Accordingly, this subject matter is not intended to be construed as limited to any example embodiments set forth herein. Rather, example embodiments are provided merely to be illustrative. Such embodiments may, for example, take the form of hardware, software, firmware or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following provides a discussion of some types of computing scenarios in which the disclosed subject matter may be utilized and/or implemented.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">One or more systems and/or techniques for signal spoof detection at base stations are provided. A base station may operate based upon signals received by the base station. In an example, the base station may receive communication signals from devices such as user equipment. The base station may transmit the communication signals through a communication network in order to provide the devices with communication capabilities over the communication network. In another example, the base station may receive signals from a satellite. The signals may correspond to location information (e.g., GPS location data). The base station may utilize the signals to determine a real time location of the base station. The base station may compare the real time location to a fixed known location of the base station in order to determine an error in the location information. For example, the location information may correspond to GPS location data, which may have an error margin of up to 5 meters in any direction. The base station may communicate error correcting information to nearby GPS receivers of devices (e.g., GPS receivers of phones, watches, vehicles, or other user equipment with GPS capabilities) so that the devices can adjust their own GPS location data in order to compensate for any errors in their GPS location data. In this way, the precision of location tracking by these devices is improved.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Unfortunately, malicious entities may utilize various types of devices, referred to as malicious devices, to spoof the signals transmitted to the base station with erroneous information. For example, a malicious device may be used to transmit spoofed signals to the base station. These spoofed signals may be meant to spoof satellite signals normally received from the satellite by the base station. In an example, the spoofed signals may comprise erroneous location information and/or other erroneous information. If the base station does not realize that received signals are spoofed signals, then the base station will operate based upon the erroneous location information. This can cause the base station to transmit incorrect error correcting information to other devices. This then can cause the other devices to operate incorrectly because the devices may adjust GPS location data using the incorrect error correcting information, which may result in incorrect GPS location data that the device will operate based upon.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a system <b>100</b> where a base station <b>102</b> may experience a spoofing attack. For example, the base station <b>102</b> may receive signals from one or more satellites, such as where the base station <b>102</b> receives signals <b>108</b> comprising GPS location data and/or other data from a first satellite <b>104</b>. The base station <b>102</b> may utilize the GPS location data and/or other data to communicate information to one or more devices, such as a first device <b>106</b> (e.g., user equipment). For example, the base station <b>102</b> may generate error correcting information based upon the signals <b>108</b>. The base station <b>102</b> may transmit the error correcting information to the first device <b>106</b> so that the first device <b>106</b> may verify or correct GPS location data based upon the error correcting information. It may be appreciated that the signals <b>108</b> received by the base station <b>102</b> and/or the information communicated to the first device <b>106</b> may comprise any type of information, and that GPS location data and error correcting information is merely used as one example for illustrative purposes.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A malicious device <b>110</b> may perform a spoofing attack upon the base station <b>102</b> by transmitting spoofed signals <b>112</b> that are meant to appear to be the satellite signals <b>108</b> transmitted by the first satellite <b>104</b>. However, the spoofed signals <b>112</b> may comprise erroneous information, such as incorrect GPS location data. This can cause operation of the base station <b>102</b> and/or the first device <b>106</b> to operate incorrectly.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, as provided herein, operation of the base station <b>102</b> and devices receiving information from the base station <b>102</b> is improved by detecting spoof attacks and protecting the base station <b>102</b> and the devices from the spoof attacks. Various techniques are disclosed for detecting the spoofing attack by the malicious device <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, these techniques utilize known information about the base station <b>102</b> to detect the spoofing attack, such as a true position of the base station <b>102</b>, expected noise experienced by the base station <b>102</b> in relation to the satellite signals <b>108</b>, expected signal power and strength of the satellite signals <b>108</b> received at the base station <b>102</b>, etc. In this way, information about the base station <b>102</b> may be used to detect a spoofing attack.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Once the spooking attack is detected, various remedial actions may be performed. In some embodiments, the base station <b>102</b> may be taken offline from the communication network so that the base station does not provide erroneous information to other devices or expose information to the malicious device <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, one or more base stations within a proximity threshold distance to the base station <b>102</b> may be evaluated to validate the authenticity of data associated with these base stations, such as by checking real time locations of the base stations. Devices that have been served data from the base station <b>102</b> within a threshold timespan (e.g., within the last hour) may be provided with notifications of the spoof attack (breach).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An embodiment of signal spoof detection at base stations utilizing location information is illustrated by an exemplary method <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which is further described in conjunction with system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. A base station <b>302</b> may provide various functionality for devices, such as for user equipment (UE). For example, the base station <b>302</b> may provide communication functionality for a first device <b>306</b> so that the first device <b>306</b> can communicate over a communication network. In another example, the base station <b>302</b> may utilize real time kinematics in order to provide error correcting information to the first device <b>306</b>. In this way, the first device <b>306</b> may adjust GPS location data based upon the error correcting information in order to improve the accuracy of the first device <b>306</b> tracking location information of the first device <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The base station <b>302</b> may receive satellite signals from satellites, such as satellite signals <b>308</b> from a first satellite <b>304</b>. The satellite signals <b>308</b> may comprise various information, such as timing information from which location information may be calculated. For example, the satellite signals may comprising carrier/global navigation satellite system (GNSS) timing data, which may be used by various types of navigation systems such as GPS. The base station <b>302</b> may be able to evaluate the satellite signals <b>308</b> received from the first satellite <b>304</b> in order to calculate a real time position of the base station <b>302</b>. In some embodiments, the real time position may be calculated based upon timing information within the satellite signals <b>308</b>. The GPS location data may have a particular margin of error, such as where the GPS location data may be up to 5 meters off in any direction, for example. The base station <b>302</b> may be configured with or capable of determining location information corresponding to a true position of the base station <b>302</b>. In an example, the location information may be configured within the base station <b>302</b> during installation because the location of the base station <b>302</b> is known. In another example, the location information may be determined based upon a measured distance from the base station <b>302</b>, having a known fixed location, to stationary infrastructure such as a distance to a cellular tower having a known fixed location.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">If the difference between the true position and the real time position is within the margin of error (e.g., within 5 meters of one another), then the satellite signals <b>308</b> may be verified as being received from the first satellite <b>304</b>. These signals may be determined to not be spoofed signals because the real time location data within the satellite signals <b>308</b> is within reason with what was expected. However, if the difference between the true position and the real time position exceeds the margin of error, then the real time location data within the satellite signals <b>308</b> is not what was expected. In this instance, the base station <b>302</b> may have been moved, GPS functionality of the first satellite <b>304</b> is not working correctly, or the base station <b>302</b> may be experiencing a spoof attack such as by a malicious device <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As provided herein, a spoofing attack upon the base station <b>302</b> may be identified based upon location information. During operation <b>202</b> of method <b>200</b>, the location information of the base station <b>302</b> may be evaluated to determine the true position <b>314</b> of the base station <b>302</b>. The true position <b>314</b> may correspond to a known position of the base station <b>302</b>. For example, the base station <b>302</b> may be configured with the location information during install. In another example, the location information may be determined based upon a measured distance from the base station <b>302</b> to other stationary infrastructure such as a cellular tower. In some embodiments, the location information may be sampled/measured over a time period (e.g., sampled over a plurality of days) to determine the true position <b>314</b> as a proximate constant value. In some embodiments, a pattern recognition neural network <b>318</b> may be trained using the location information, such as where the pattern recognition neural network <b>318</b> is trained using measured distances from the base station <b>302</b> to other infrastructure or equipment over time. The pattern recognition neural network <b>318</b> is trained using the location information in order to recognize patterns in the location information associated with the base station <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">During operation <b>204</b> of method <b>200</b>, a received signal that is received by the base station <b>302</b> may be processed evaluated to calculate a real time position <b>316</b> of the base station <b>302</b>. In some embodiments of the processing, signals received by the base station <b>302</b> may correspond to GPS/GNSS signals. These signals may be radio waves that have information encoded onto them. When the base station <b>302</b> receives these signals, the signals pass through RF hardware elements in order to convert a waveform of the signals into a digital output, such as through the use of an analog to digital converter. Next, the signals may be amplified because the signals have traveled a significant distance, and thus a signal strength/amplitude would need to be attenuated. Furthermore, the signals may have noise characteristics that would need to be removed. In an example, digital information may be extracted from GNSS signals as part of the processing. Once timing and other information is extracted from the received signal, the extracted information can be evaluated to decipher location information.
