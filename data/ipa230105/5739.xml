The disclosed embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well-known process operations have not been described in detail to not unnecessarily obscure the disclosed embodiments. While the disclosed embodiments will be described in conjunction with the specific embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Introduction and Context</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Manufacturing of semiconductor devices commonly requires sequential deposition and etching operations in order to create the desired structures on a substrate. Deposition operations deposit one or more layers of a material onto a substrate using various techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (&#x201c;CVD&#x201d;), plasma-enhanced CVD (&#x201c;PECVD&#x201d;), atomic layer deposition (&#x201c;ALD&#x201d;), low pressure CVD, ultra-high CVD, and physical vapor deposition (&#x201c;PVD&#x201d;). CVD processes deposit a film on a wafer surface by flowing one or more gas reactants (also called precursors) into a reactor where they react, optionally with the assistance of a plasma as in PECVD, to form a product (typically the film) on a substrate surface. In ALD processes, precursors are transported to the wafer surface where they are adsorbed by the wafer and then converted by a chemical or physicochemical reaction to form a thin film on the substrate. A plasma may be present in the chamber to facilitate the reaction. ALD processes employ multiple film deposition cycles, each producing a &#x201c;discrete&#x201d; film thickness. A typical ALD cycle generally includes the following steps: (1) exposure of the substrate surface to a first precursor, (2) purge of the reaction chamber in which the substrate is located, (3) activation of a reaction of the substrate surface, optionally by exposure to high temperature and/or a plasma, and/or by exposure to a second precursor, and (4) purge of the reaction chamber in which the substrate is located.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Semiconductor fabrication processes also involve patterning and etching of various materials, including conductors, semiconductors, and dielectrics. Some examples include conductors, such as metals or carbon; semiconductors, such as silicon or germanium; and dielectrics, such as silicon oxide, aluminum dioxide, zirconium dioxide, hafnium dioxide, silicon nitride, and titanium nitride. Etching operations partly or wholly remove one or more materials from a substrate. Example etching operations include plasma etching, atomic layer etching which remove thin layers of material using sequential self-limiting reactions, and ion beam etching.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">With the move from planar to 3D transistor structures (e.g., FinFET gate structures for logic devices) and advanced memory structures such as Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) and Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM), etching processes need to be increasingly precise and uniform in order to produce quality products. One problem with conventional etching techniques is that etching byproducts, instead of being swept away, are sometimes re-deposited on surfaces where such deposition is not desired. For example, the byproducts may deposit near the edge of the substrate. The byproducts are often metallic or metal rich films. This redeposition phenomenon is particularly problematic when etching non-volatile substances, which is often the case when fabricating advanced devices such as MRAM, ReRAM, cross point memory devices, etc.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Unwanted etching byproduct deposition on the substrate can cause many problems including poor etch results and sub-standard devices. It has been found that some etching techniques result in metallic redeposition in an outer, annular region of a wafer, such as the edge region which may be considered an annular region that includes the outer circular edge (or substantially circular, such as within +/&#x2212;5% of circular) of the substrate and extends radially inwards for a particular distance, such as about 5 millimeters or 3 millimeters. This metallic byproduct deposition may cause electrical problems, especially where the structure being etched has interleaving layers of dielectric and conductive films. In some cases, unwanted metallic material may deposit on the outer radial end of an etched stack, thereby forming an electrical connection between layers that are supposed to be electrically insulated. This connection creates a short circuit in the stack and may result in failure of the device. One example of this type of failure is a short that forms across a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) barrier of an MRAM device.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, there exists a need for improved semiconductor fabrication methods and apparatus which remove the effects of unwanted material on a semiconductor substrate, especially material in the outer, edge region of the substrate, after the substrate has been etched.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Oxidizing unwanted metals and metal rich materials on the substrate may remove their adverse effects by transforming these unwanted metals and metal rich materials into dielectrics, thereby neutralizing them and preventing them from causing a short. However, flowing an oxidizing gas over an entire wafer to oxidize and neutralize the unwanted metals and metal rich materials in the outer annular region of the wafer may damage and ruin the wafer by oxidizing and/or over-oxidizing the wafer interior. As stated above, the wafer interior may have etched features, such as MRAM stacks, that intentionally include numerous metals and the oxidization or over-oxidization of these metals can adversely affect these stacks by increasing their resistance and damaging their performance. Oxidizing the entire wafer surface for the time required to oxidize the metals in the annular edge region may thus adversely affect and damage these stacks by oxidizing or over-oxidizing these metals in the wafer interior. It is therefore desirable to oxidize only the area of the wafer that contains the unwanted metals in order to prevent the unwanted oxidization and over-oxidization of the wafer interior.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Described herein are apparatuses and techniques for neutralizing the effects of unwanted metals and metal rich materials in the outer annular region of a substrate by selectively oxidizing the outer annular substrate region. The apparatuses and techniques include flowing an oxygen-containing gas (referred to herein as an &#x201c;oxidizing gas&#x201d;) around the periphery of a pedestal containing a wafer while simultaneously flowing an inert gas through a showerhead and onto the wafer; this inert gas flowed through the showerhead does not contain any oxygen. This simultaneous dual gas flow creates a high oxygen concentration in an annular gas region around and on top of the annular edge region of the wafer containing the unwanted materials, and an interior gas region with a low oxygen concentration on top of the wafer interior. The annular gas region has a higher oxidation rate than the interior gas region which allows for selective and greater oxidation of metals and metal rich materials in the wafer's outer annular region, and a low or non-existent oxidization rate on the wafer interior. The inert gas flow through the showerhead creates the interior gas volume which acts as a gas barrier against the oxygen and prevents or hinders the oxygen from flowing radially inwards across the wafer, including over the wafer interior. In some instances, a pump evacuates gases from the bottom of the chamber and this pumping may draw or pull the oxidizing gas downwards in the chamber and create a uniform flow of oxidizing gas around the substrate and substrate holder; the oxidizing gas is transported via diffusion radially inwards along the substrate.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">First Example Processing Apparatus</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The apparatuses disclosed herein are configured to simultaneously flow both an oxidizing gas around the periphery of a substrate holder and the gap between a showerhead and the substrate holder (hereinafter referred to as the &#x201c;substrate holder-showerhead gap&#x201d; or the &#x201c;gap&#x201d;), and an inert gas through the showerhead over that substrate holder. This may include features and structures within a processing chamber to direct oxidizing gas flow around the periphery of the substrate holder and substrate holder-showerhead gap. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an example single-station substrate processing apparatus in accordance with disclosed embodiments. This apparatus <b>100</b> includes a single processing chamber <b>102</b> having an interior volume <b>103</b> and a single substrate holder <b>104</b> (e.g., a pedestal or an electrostatic chuck) on which a substrate <b>106</b> is positioned. Also fluidically coupled to the chamber for the delivery of (for example) film precursors, carrier and/or purge and/or process gases, secondary reactants, etc. is gas delivery system <b>110</b> fluidically connected to a showerhead <b>108</b>. Here, the gas delivery system <b>110</b> includes an oxidizing gas source <b>112</b> and an inert gas source <b>114</b>; this gas delivery system <b>110</b> also may include gas (or liquid) sources, valves, gas lines, and other flow elements configured to transport the gases (or liquids) to the showerhead and process chamber. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the apparatus is configured to selectively flow inert gas from the inert gas source <b>114</b> to the showerhead <b>108</b>, and from the showerhead <b>108</b> onto the substrate <b>106</b> positioned on the substrate holder <b>104</b>; this inert gas flow from the showerhead <b>108</b> onto the substrate <b>106</b> is represented by the non-shaded arrows <b>132</b>. The substrate holder-showerhead gap is identified as item <b>191</b>. The apparatus schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be used to perform any film deposition operations, such as ALD, CVD, or plasma enhanced CVD. For simplicity, other features of the processing apparatus <b>100</b> have been omitted from this Figure and are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The apparatus <b>100</b> also includes one or more gas entry ports <b>116</b> for flowing the oxidizing gas into the chamber interior <b>103</b>. These gas entry ports <b>116</b> extend through the chamber wall and into the chamber interior <b>103</b>, and are fluidically connected to the oxidizing gas source <b>112</b> such that oxidizing gas may flow from the oxidizing gas source <b>112</b> into the chamber interior <b>103</b>. Each gas entry port <b>116</b> is configured to flow gas into the chamber and may be, for instance, a hole, slot, a nozzle, or annulus. In some instances, at least one of the gas entry ports <b>116</b> is configured to flow the oxidizing gas into the chamber in a vertical direction or with a vertical directional component (as used herein, a &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; direction or movement is in the direction of the z-axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In some embodiments, at least one of the gas entry ports <b>116</b> may be configured to flow the oxidizing gas into the chamber in a horizontal direction or with a horizontal directional component (as used herein, a &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; direction or movement is in directions parallel to the X-Y plane perpendicular to the z-axis). One or more flow control elements <b>118</b> may be positioned on and within the fluidic connection between the oxidizing gas source <b>112</b> and the gas entry ports <b>116</b> that are configured to control the flow of this gas, such as a valve, restrictor, and/or mass flow controller (MFC).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The apparatus may be configured in various ways to flow the oxidizing gas around the periphery of the substrate. In some embodiments, the apparatus may have one or more elements, collectively referred to as a periphery gas flow unit, that are configured to cause an oxidizing gas to flow around a periphery of the substrate holder. In some embodiments, the apparatus may have a baffle plate above the showerhead that is configured to direct the flow of the oxidizing gas towards the periphery of the substrate. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>100</b> includes a baffle plate <b>120</b> positioned within the interior <b>103</b> of the chamber <b>102</b>, and configured to cause, at least in part, the oxidizing gas to flow around the periphery of the substrate holder <b>104</b> and the substrate <b>106</b> positioned thereon. This may include positioning the baffle plate <b>120</b> underneath the gas entry ports <b>116</b> and above the showerhead <b>108</b> such that, as indicated by the solid black arrows <b>124</b>, the oxidizing gas enters the chamber <b>102</b> in the region between the top of the chamber and the baffle plate <b>120</b>, identified as the dotted rectangle <b>126</b>, is caused to flow radially outwards and horizontally towards the chamber sidewalls <b>122</b>, vertically down, onto the substrate <b>106</b> edge, and radially inwards towards the substrate <b>106</b> center. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the periphery gas flow unit may be considered to include the baffle plate <b>120</b> and the gas entry ports <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">While the black arrows <b>124</b> generally depict the flow of the oxidizing gas within the chamber <b>102</b>, the configuration of the baffle plate <b>120</b> and the gas injection ports <b>116</b> may vary in order to cause this oxidizing gas flowpath. For example, the baffle plate <b>120</b> may be substantially circular (e.g., having an outer perimeter that stays within an annular zone that has an inner radius that is 95% or more of its outer radius) and may have an outer diameter that is substantially equal to (e.g., within 5% of equal) or greater than the outer diameter of the showerhead <b>108</b>. In some instances, the vertical offset distance between the baffle plate <b>120</b> and the top of the chamber may vary, which in turn may affect the gas flow characteristics of gas within this region <b>126</b>. It may be advantageous in some circumstances to use this baffle plate because it protects the showerhead from unwanted backside deposition, prevents sidewall deposition, reduces defects in the substrate, and also may contribute to uniform gas flow around the substrate holder and the substrate holder-showerhead gap <b>191</b>. In some embodiments, the gas injection ports <b>116</b> may also have different configurations that flow the gas into the region <b>126</b> in the chamber <b>102</b> in various directions, e.g., vertical or horizontal, which may affect the oxidizing gas flow. For instance, the oxidizing gas contacts and flows along the baffle plate <b>120</b> towards the chamber side walls <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The apparatus is also configured to cause the oxidizing gas to flow onto the substrate radially inwards from the substrate edge. In some embodiments, this configuration may include just flowing the oxidizing gas around the periphery of the substrate, the periphery of the substrate holder, and the periphery of the substrate holder-showerhead gap which enables the oxidizing gas to flow onto the substrate. In some instances, this configuration may include an exhaust port <b>133</b> (or outlet) in the bottom region of the chamber <b>102</b> and a pump <b>135</b> configured to pump gases out of the chamber <b>102</b>. The pump <b>135</b>, e.g., a one or two stage mechanical dry pump and/or turbomolecular pump, may be used to draw gases out of the process chamber <b>102</b> and to maintain a suitably low pressure within the process chamber <b>102</b> by using a closed-loop-controlled flow restriction device, such as a throttle valve <b>137</b> or a pendulum valve. Pumping gases out of the chamber <b>102</b> causes, among other things, the oxidizing gas to flow downwards, i.e., in the z-axis, in chamber <b>102</b> such that it flows around the showerhead <b>108</b>, the substrate holder-showerhead gap <b>191</b>, and the substrate holder <b>104</b> as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. With the oxidizing gas flowing vertically downwards around the periphery of the substrate holder <b>104</b> and the substrate holder-showerhead gap <b>191</b>, the oxidizing gas flows radially inwards into the substrate holder-showerhead gap <b>191</b>, above the substrate <b>106</b>, and along the substrate <b>106</b> through diffusion. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the oxidizing gas <b>124</b> flows vertically downwards and also radially inwards, i.e., in the horizontal x-axis direction, as indicated by arrows <b>124</b>A, from the outer edge <b>128</b> of the substrate <b>106</b> towards the center <b>130</b> of the substrate <b>106</b> by diffusion.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional side view, the apparatus is configured to flow the oxidizing gas uniformly around the entire periphery of the substrate holder and the substrate holder-showerhead gap, and thus around the entire periphery of the substrate on that substrate holder. This uniform flow around the entire periphery of the substrate holder and the substrate holder-showerhead gap, sometimes referred to as a curtain flow of oxidizing gas around the substrate holder, may also be enabled by the baffle plate and the pumping of the gases out of the chamber. In some embodiments, flowing the oxidizing gas onto the baffle plate and drawing it downwards in the chamber with the exhaust pump, causes the oxidizing gas to flow uniformly around the baffle plate and thus uniformly around the showerhead, the substrate holder, the substrate holder-showerhead gap, and the substrate.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Simultaneously flowing the inert gas through the showerhead and onto the substrate along with the oxidizing gas around the substrate periphery assists in creating the annular gas region of oxidizing gas. This inert gas flow creates a barrier over the substrate interior that allows the oxidizing gas to flow over the substrate's annular edge region, but prevents or hinders the oxidizing gas from flowing too far radially inwards and causing unwanted oxidization or over-oxidization on interior region of the substrate. The resulting annular gas region has a high oxygen concentration, and thus a high oxidation rate, on top of the substrate's annular edge region in order to oxidize the unwanted metals in this region. The simultaneous inert gas flow through the showerhead and onto the substrate also prevents the oxidizing gas from flowing too far radially inwards and causing unwanted oxidization or over-oxidization in the interior region of the substrate. As stated herein, the inert gas flowed through the showerhead does not contain any oxygen.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">These gas flows are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>. As indicated by the non-shaded arrows <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the inert gas flows through the showerhead <b>108</b>, onto the substrate <b>104</b>, and radially outwards away from the substrate center <b>130</b> and towards the substrate edge <b>128</b>. Flowing this inert gas through the showerhead at the same time as the oxidizing gas around the periphery of the substrate (as well as the periphery of the substrate holder-showerhead gap), i.e., these simultaneous gas flows, creates an interior gas region, identified as lightly shaded region <b>131</b>, over the interior of the wafer that acts a barrier against the oxidizing gas and prevents the oxidizing gas from flowing radially inwards more than is desired. Without this simultaneous radially outward inert gas flow, there is no ability to counteract the oxidizing gas flow and prevent it from flowing too far radially inwards and oxidizing too much of the substrate, and there is limited to no control of the oxidization area on the substrate. This interior gas region <b>131</b> has an oxidization rate lower than that of the annular gas region such that limited or no oxidization occurs in this interior gas region.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> depict a top view of an example substrate. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the substrate <b>206</b> has an exterior edge <b>228</b> that forms a part of the substrate's periphery. The unwanted metal and metal rich materials may exist in the annular edge region <b>234</b> (illustrated with dark shading) of the substrate <b>106</b> which extends around the substrate center <b>230</b> and extends radially inwards from the edge <b>228</b> towards the center <b>230</b> for a first radial thickness <b>236</b> that may be, for instance, 3 mm or 5 mm; the inner radius of this annular edge region <b>234</b> is labeled R<b>1</b>. The substrate's interior region <b>238</b> is unshaded and may be considered the area in which oxidization or over-oxidization may damage the features on the substrate. It is therefore desirable to create an annular gas region having high oxidization on top of this annular edge region <b>234</b> and a region with no or a low oxygen concentration on and around this interior region <b>238</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts an annular gas region <b>240</b> having a high oxygen concentration, i.e., a high oxidization rate, which is illustrated with dashed-line boundaries and semi-transparent cross-hatching. This annular gas region extends around the edge <b>228</b> of the substrate <b>206</b> and extends radially inwards towards the center <b>230</b> for a second radius R<b>2</b> and therefore may have a radial thickness <b>242</b>. In some embodiments, like depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, this second radius R<b>2</b> may be close to, but smaller than, the first radius R<b>1</b> in order to oxidize all of the annular edge region <b>234</b>. In some embodiments, the second radius R<b>2</b> may be larger than the first radius R<b>1</b> in order to prevent any oxidization of the interior region <b>238</b>. In some other embodiments, the two radiuses may be equal or substantially equal (e.g., within +/&#x2212;5% of each other). In some other embodiments, the second radius R<b>2</b> may be larger than the first radius R<b>1</b> in order to oxidize just some of the annular edge region <b>234</b>; this may be advantageous for preventing oxidization to the interior region <b>238</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the inert gas <b>132</b> is seen flowing radially outwards against the radially inward flowing oxidizing gas <b>124</b> which together contribute to the creation of the annular gas region <b>240</b> having the high oxidization rate, and the interior gas region <b>131</b> that has a low oxygen concentration and that is depicted radially inwards from the annular gas region and illustrated with light shading. As stated above, this interior gas region <b>131</b> acts as a barrier to prevent the oxidizing gas from flowing radially inwards more than is desired.

The radial flow of the oxidizing gas may be considered to generally stop at the edge of the interior gas region <b>131</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, and as used herein, annular is used to describe a ring-shaped area or region that has an outer circular circumference and a smaller, inner circular circumference, with an open area radially inwards of the inner circular circumference. In some embodiments, the inner and outer circular circumferences may not be exactly circular and may, in some instances, be substantially circular (e.g., having an outer perimeter that stays within an annular zone that has an inner radius that is 95%, 90%, or 85% or more of its outer radius).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Additionally, even though these annular gas regions and regions on the substrate have clearly defined boundaries, in practice and operation these boundaries may not be as exact because of the inexact and imprecise nature of the unwanted materials on the substrate and of gas flows and gas volumes. Accordingly, in some embodiments these annular shapes and radiuses may be considered average nominal radiuses, boundaries, circumferences, and diameters. For instance, an annular gas ring may have a variable inner boundary that is not a perfect circle but can be defined as an average nominal radius and circumference. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the annular gas region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is depicted. Here, the actual, approximate inner and outer boundaries of the annular gas region <b>240</b> are shown and identified as items <b>244</b> and <b>246</b>, respectively. These boundaries are each considered as having average radiuses, R<b>3</b> and R<b>4</b>, respectively, that represent the average nominal inner and outer radius of the annular gas region <b>240</b>. Although not depicted in these Figures, the annular edge region of the substrate may also have an imprecise, non-uniform inner boundary.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described in more detail below, the oxidization rate as well as the size of the annular gas region may be adjusted by adjusting the inert gas flow and the oxidizing gas flow. For instance, decreasing the inert gas flowrate may decrease the annular gas region's inner radius, thereby allowing more oxidizing gas to flow radially inwards (i.e., via diffusion) on the wafer and increasing the annular gas region's radial thickness on the substrate and oxidizing more of the substrate surface.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As also described in more detail below, the semiconductor processing apparatuses described herein may have a controller with program instructions for controlling the features of the apparatus, including for executing one or more of the example techniques described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a controller <b>160</b> having a processor <b>162</b> and a memory device <b>164</b>, with the controller <b>160</b> configured to control any and all aspects of the apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Example Techniques</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Various techniques may be used to flow the inert gas and oxidizing gas onto the substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a first example technique for oxidizing an annular edge region of a substrate. In operation <b>301</b>, a substrate is provided to a substrate holder in a processing chamber. As stated herein, the processing chamber has at least one substrate holder configured to support, directly or indirectly, the substrate. This may include directly supporting the substrate on a support surface of the substrate holder as well as indirectly supporting the substrate above the support surface, such as on lift pins. As also described above, the processing chamber has a showerhead above the substrate holder that is configured to flow process gases onto the substrate that is directly or indirectly supported by the substrate holder.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Once the substrate is directly or indirectly supported by the substrate holder, an oxidizing gas and inert gas may be simultaneously flowed into the process chamber as provided by operation <b>303</b>. As described above, in this operation the oxidizing gas is flowed around the periphery of the substrate (which may also include the substrate holder-showerhead gap) and the inert gas is simultaneously flowed through the showerhead and onto the substrate. The flow of the oxidizing gas around the periphery of the substrate may be performed in any way described herein, including flowing the oxidizing gas into the chamber and onto a baffle plate as described above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. This operation <b>303</b> may also include, as discussed herein, simultaneously evacuating gases from the processing chamber in order to draw or pull the oxidizing gas downwards in the processing chamber. In some embodiments, this oxidizing gas may include only molecular oxygen, although in other embodiments it may also include other elements such as one or more generally inert gases including, for instance, argon, helium, nitrogen or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the inert gas flowed through the showerhead in operation <b>305</b> may include argon, helium, nitrogen or a combination thereof; the inert gas flowed through the showerhead in operations <b>303</b> and <b>305</b> do not include the any oxidizing gas, i.e., it does not contain any oxygen. In some embodiments, during this simultaneous flowing, the substrate is directly supported by a substrate support surface of the substrate holder, while in some other embodiments, the substrate may be supported by lift pins of the substrate holder (and thus indirectly supported by the substrate holder).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">These simultaneous gas flows of operation <b>303</b> create an annular gas region on the annular edge region of the substrate and an interior gas region on an interior region of the substrate as described above, as represented by operation <b>305</b>. As also stated above, in some embodiments the creation of the annular gas region of operation <b>305</b> may be enabled by the simultaneous evacuation of gases from the processing chamber while both the oxidizing and inert gases are flowed. For instance, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the interior gas region <b>131</b> is created over the interior <b>238</b> of the substrate while the annular gas region <b>240</b> is over the annular edge region <b>234</b> of the substrate. This interior gas region <b>131</b> has an oxygen concentration, and therefore an oxidation rate, that is less than that of the annular gas region <b>240</b> such that limited or no oxidization occurs in this interior gas region <b>231</b>. The annular gas region <b>240</b> oxidizes the annular edge region <b>234</b> of the substrate in order to oxidize the unwanted metals and metal containing materials in this annular edge region <b>234</b>. In some embodiments, the interior gas region may have an oxidization rate gradient that is highest at the oxidizing gas-inert gas interface (i.e., where the oxidizing gas and inert gas meet, identified with identifier <b>133</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and lowest at the center of the substrate. Similarly, in some embodiments the annular gas region may have an oxidization rate that is not uniform, e.g., is a gradient, that is highest at the outer edge and lowest at the oxidizing gas-inert gas interface <b>133</b>A.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, the flowrates of the oxidizing gas and the inert gas may be the same, while in other embodiments they may differ. For example, the oxidizing gas flow rate may be greater than or equal to the inert gas flow rate. In some embodiments, the oxidizing gas may be at least 500 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) and the flowrate of the inert gas may be at least 250 sccm, 300 sccm, 400 sccm, 500 sccm, 1,000 sccm, and 2,000 sccm. As discussed below, the present inventors discovered that the oxidization rate in the annular edge region decreased relative to the interior region as the inert gas flowrate increased. Additionally, the flowrates of the oxidizing gas and inert gas may remain constant during at least a part of operations <b>403</b> and <b>405</b>. These constant flowrates may be advantageous for creating steady state gas regions and conditions which in turn may create more uniform oxidization results on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As stated above, operations <b>303</b> and <b>305</b> are not performed during a deposition step or operation. This includes not performing these operations during a CVD deposition operation, PECVD, or ALD operation, such as a dose, purge, or activation step. In some embodiments, operations <b>303</b> and <b>305</b> may be considered post-etching steps and/or pre-deposition steps.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, operations <b>301</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>305</b> are performed as pre-deposition operations in a processing chamber for CVD deposition, and in some such embodiments, the CVD deposition performed after these three operations may be incompatible with the oxidizing gas. For example, molecular oxygen trapped in channels, lines, and other conduits has the potential to react with precursor gases, such as Silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), and Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) resulting in unwanted particle formation and unwanted incorporation of O<sub>2 </sub>into the deposited film. In some instances, SiH<sub>4 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>will form SiO<sub>2 </sub>which is a potential unwanted defect source. In order to perform both these pre-deposition and deposition operations having incompatible chemistries in the same processing chamber, a purge operation may be performed to remove the incompatible oxidizing gases and other unwanted materials, such as particulates, from the processing chamber. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> further shows this optional purge operation <b>307</b> that may be performed after operations <b>303</b> and <b>305</b>. In a purge operation, purge gas, such as inert gas, may be flowed through the showerhead and through the same oxidizing gas flow path into the chamber and out an exhaust port in the chamber. As also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the optional deposition operation <b>309</b>, e.g., CVD deposition, in the same chamber may be performed after operations <b>303</b> and <b>305</b>, and in some embodiments, after optional operation <b>307</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As stated above, the techniques may include evacuating the gases from the chamber during at least the simultaneous oxidizing and inert gas flows. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> depicts a second example technique for oxidizing an annular edge region of a substrate. Here, operation <b>303</b>A is similar to, but different than, operation <b>303</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As can be seen in this operation <b>303</b>A, the oxidizing gas and the inert gas are flowed simultaneously into the chamber and during this simultaneous gas flow, the gases in the chamber are also simultaneously evacuated from the bottom of the processing chamber. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this chamber evacuation may be performed by the pump <b>135</b> that draws gases out of the bottom of the processing chamber <b>102</b> which in turn draws the oxidizing gas <b>124</b> downwards and uniformly around the baffle plate, the showerhead, the showerhead-substrate holder gap, the substrate, and the substrate holder. The oxidizing gas around the showerhead-substrate holder gap is transported radially inwards over and on the substrate by diffusion. The simultaneous inert and oxidizing gas flows and chamber evacuation assist in creating the annular oxidizing gas region of operation <b>305</b>. The optional operations <b>307</b> and <b>309</b> may also be performed in the second example technique of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. In some embodiments, the chamber evacuation by begin before or at the same time as the simultaneous flowing of the oxidizing and inert gases, while in some other embodiments in may begin after the simultaneous flowing of the gases. In some embodiments, the chamber evacuation may continue after the simultaneous flowing of gases stops.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The techniques described herein may also include other operations as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> which depicts a third example technique for oxidizing an annular edge region of a substrate. In some embodiments, the techniques may include a substrate heating operation and/or an inert gas flow operation before the simultaneous flowing of the oxidizing and inert gases. In this third example technique, operations <b>401</b>, <b>403</b>, and <b>405</b> are the same as operations <b>301</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>305</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In some embodiments, although not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, operation <b>403</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be the same as operation <b>303</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> in which the processing chamber is evacuated during the simultaneous oxidizing and inert gas flows into the processing chamber. In optional operation <b>411</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the inert gas may be flowed through the showerhead (without accompanying flow of the oxidizing gas) and onto the substrate before the simultaneous inert and oxidizing gas flow of operations <b>403</b> and <b>405</b>. This may create and position the inert gas barrier over the substrate before the oxidizing gas is flowed which may protect more of the substrate and also allow for more control of the annular gas region over the substrate. In some instances, the flowrate of the inert gas in operation <b>411</b> may be the same as in operation <b>403</b> while in other embodiments they may be different. For example, the inert gas flow rate may be higher in operation <b>411</b> than in operation <b>403</b>. After operation <b>411</b> has been performed for a particular time period, the oxidizing gas flow may begin, thereby beginning operation <b>403</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In optional operation <b>413</b>, the substrate may be heated during the simultaneous flow of the inert gas and the oxidizing gas, and the creation of the annular and interior gas regions, of operations <b>403</b> and <b>405</b>. The heating of the substrate may improve the oxidation of the substrate by, for instance, increasing the oxidization rate. The temperature of the substrate during this heating may be at least 20&#xb0; C. or 23&#xb0; C., and in some embodiments between about 200&#xb0; C. and 400&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, this heating may be achieved by positioning the substrate on the substrate support surface of the substrate holder and heating the substrate holder. This heating of the substrate holder may be achieved by heating the substrate holder with a heating fluid or a resistive heating coil. In some instances in which both operations <b>411</b> and <b>413</b> are performed, the heating of the substrate in operation <b>413</b> may also occur during the inert gas flow of operation <b>411</b>. In some embodiments, the temperature of the substrate may be adjusted or controlled by adjusting the separation distance between the substrate and the substrate holder by lowering or raising the substrate using the lift pins. For instance, the substrate may be heated to the highest temperature by lowering the substrate onto the substrate holder, and the substrate temperature may be reduced by raising the substrate up with the lift pins such that lower temperatures are achieved with greater separation distances.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As stated above, various process conditions may be adjusted to vary the dimensions and oxidization rate of the annular gas region over the wafer; these conditions include the inert gas flowrate, inert gas partial pressure, inert gas composition, oxidizing gas flowrate, oxidizing gas partial pressure, oxidizing gas composition, and chamber pressure. For example, the oxidization rate of the annular gas region may be adjusted by changing the composition of the oxidizing gas, such as by changing the percentage of molecular oxygen in the oxidizing gas. This may include adding other components to the oxidizing gas, like an inert gas, or removing components so the oxidizing gas contains only molecular oxygen. In some embodiments, the oxidizing gas and inert gas flowrates may be adjusted to make the radial thickness of the annular gas region larger or smaller and/or to make the oxidization rate of the annular gas region higher or lower. For instance, increasing the inert gas flowrate relative to the oxidizing gas flowrate may decrease the radial thickness of the annular gas region and/or decrease the oxidization rate of the annular gas region.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Additional Example Apparatuses and Features</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Additional chamber configurations may be used to flow the oxidizing gas around the periphery of the substrate, e.g., using various configurations of periphery gas flow units. This may include flowing the oxidizing gas through a collar placed around the stem of a chandelier-style showerhead, through the pedestal, and/or through the showerhead. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, which depicts another example schematic of a substrate processing apparatus <b>500</b>, the apparatus <b>500</b> includes a processing chamber <b>502</b>, a showerhead <b>508</b>, and a showerhead collar <b>550</b> through which the oxidizing gas flows.

The oxidizing gas may therefore flow through the apertures in the showerhead collar and into the processing chamber in a direction substantially parallel to the plane of the substrate and also substantially parallel to the plane of the bottom surface of the head portion of the showerhead. In this embodiment, the periphery gas flow unit includes the collar. The gas flow may flow around the showerhead <b>508</b> and vertically downwards in the z-direction so that the oxidizing gas flows around the substrate holder-showerhead gap <b>591</b>, the substrate <b>506</b>, and the substrate holder <b>504</b>.

The vertical axis is the copper oxidization thickness in Angstroms while the horizontal axis is the radial distance along the substrate from the substrate center; the substrate center point, 0, is in the middle of the graph. In a first experiment, the data from which is labeled with identifier <b>1052</b>, a substrate was positioned in a chamber similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, supported by the substrate holder, and an oxidizing gas was flowed only through the showerhead above the substrate while the chamber was evacuated by a pump and held at a low pressure. As can be seen, the oxidization profile of the substrate has a concave shape with the highest oxidization occurring at the center of the substrate and the lowest at the edge of the substrate. Flowing the oxidizing gas in this matter may be less advantageous for oxidizing the edge region of the substrate because in order to oxidize the outer annular region for the desired amount, this flowing causes over-oxidization of the substrate center and interior. In a second experiment, the data from which is labeled with identifier <b>1054</b>, another substrate was positioned in the chamber similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, supported by the substrate holder, and the simultaneous flow of an inert gas through the showerhead and an oxidizing gas around the periphery of the substrate was performed while the chamber was being evacuated by the pump and held at a low pressure. As can be seen, the overall shape of the oxidization flipped from the first experiment <b>1052</b> to a convex shape that has the highest oxidization rate at the outer edge of the substrate and the lowest oxidization in the substrate center. Accordingly, simultaneously flowing the oxidizing and inert gases in accordance with the disclosed techniques provides for a more advantageous oxidization profile for selectively oxidizing an outer edge annular region of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts another graph of various oxidization thicknesses on two substrates. The vertical axis again is the copper oxidization thickness in Angstroms while the horizontal axis is the radial distance along the substrate from the substrate center; the substrate center point, 0, is in the middle of the graph. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a first experiment <b>1152</b> was performed in which a substrate was positioned in a chamber similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, supported by the substrate holder, and an oxidizing gas was flowed through both the showerhead above the substrate and onto the baffle plate above of the showerhead (which therefore caused the oxidizing gas to flow around the periphery of the substrate) while the chamber was being evacuated by the pump and held at a low pressure. As can be seen, the oxidization profile of the substrate has a generally constant, flat profile shape. Flowing the oxidizing gas in this matter may be less advantageous for oxidizing the edge region of the substrate because in order to oxidize the outer annular region for the desired amount, this flowing again causes over-oxidization of the substrate center and interior. As stated herein, it is desirable to selectively oxidize the annular region of the substrate without oxidizing or over-oxidizing the substrate interior. In a second experiment <b>1154</b>, as with <b>1054</b>, another substrate was positioned in the chamber similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, supported by the substrate holder, and the simultaneous flow of an inert gas through the showerhead and an oxidizing gas around the periphery of the substrate was performed while the chamber was being evacuated by the pump and held at a low pressure. As can be seen, the overall shape of the oxidization has a convex shape with the highest oxidization rate at the outer edge of the substrate and the lowest oxidization in the substrate center. Accordingly, simultaneously flowing the oxidizing and inert gases in accordance with the techniques disclosed herein provides for a more advantageous oxidization profile for selectively oxidizing an outer edge annular region of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">As stated above, the flowrates of the inert and/or oxidizing gases may affect the size and shape of the oxidization regions and the resulting oxidization profile on the substrate. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, which depicts a graph of various oxidization thicknesses on a substrate, increasing the inert gas flowrate as compared to the oxidizing gas flowrate reduced the oxidization profile in the annular edge region. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the vertical axis is the copper oxidization thickness in Angstroms while the horizontal axis is the radial distance along the substrate from the substrate center; the substrate center point, 0, is in the middle of the graph.

The first experiment <b>1252</b> had the lowest the inert gas flowrate of 500 sccm, the second experiment <b>1254</b> had the middle inert gas flowrate of 1,000 sccm, and the third experiment <b>1256</b> has the highest inert gas flowrate of 2,000 sccm; the oxidizing gas of pure molecular oxygen was at 500 sccm in all three experiments.
