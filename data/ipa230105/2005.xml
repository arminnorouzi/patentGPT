The base member is configured to be attached to a vehicle body of the human-powered vehicle. The movable member is configured to be movable relative to the base member in a first direction and a second direction different from the first direction. The linkage is configured to movably connect the movable member to the base member. The electrical actuator is configured to operatively move the movable member relative to the base member. The first biasing member is configured to deform if first external force is applied to move the movable member in the first direction. The second biasing member is configured to deform if second external force is applied to move the movable member in the second direction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the derailleur according to the first aspect, the first biasing member can at least partially absorb the first external force, and the second biasing member can at least partially absorb the second external force. Thus, the first biasing member and the second biasing member can protect the electrical actuator from the first external force and the second external force.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, the derailleur according to the first aspect is configured so that the electrical actuator includes an output part configured to be operatively coupled to the movable member to move the movable member relative to the base member. The first biasing member is configured to reduce the first external force transmitted to the output part. The second biasing member is configured to reduce the second external force transmitted to the output part.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the derailleur according to the second aspect, the first biasing member and the second biasing member can effectively protect the electrical actuator from the first external force and the second external force.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, the derailleur according to the second aspect is configured so that the first biasing member is configured to allow the movable member to move relative to the base member in the first direction in response to the first external force.

The derailleur RD is configured to transmit, through the electric power source PS and the electric cables EC<b>1</b> and EC<b>2</b> to the derailleur FD, control signals wirelessly transmitted from the operating device <b>4</b> to the derailleur RD. For example, the derailleur RD is configured to transmit, through a controller of the electric power source PS and the electric cables EC<b>1</b> and EC<b>2</b> to the derailleur FD, control signals wirelessly transmitted from the operating device <b>4</b> to the derailleur RD. However, the derailleur RD can be configured to receive control signals wirelessly transmitted from only one of the operating devices <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. In such embodiments, the derailleur FD can be configured to receive control signals wirelessly transmitted from the other of the operating devices <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">However, the structure of the human-powered vehicle <b>2</b> is not limited to the above structure. For example, each of the derailleurs FD and RD can be configured to be electrically connected to the electric power source PS through the electric cables EC<b>1</b> and EC<b>2</b> and an additional device such as a junction box <b>6</b>. Each of the derailleur RD and the electric power source PS can be configured to be electrically connected to the derailleur FD through the electric cables EC<b>1</b> and EC<b>2</b> if the derailleur FD includes a plurality of cable connectors. Each of the derailleur FD and the electric power source PS can be configured to be electrically connected to the derailleur RD through the electric cables EC<b>1</b> and EC<b>2</b> if the derailleur RD includes a plurality of cable connectors.
