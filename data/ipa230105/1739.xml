For example, this mobility allows medical staff to move medical equipment around in operating rooms, from one operating room to another, from one floor to another (e.g., using elevators), etc. However, in certain cases, an equipment (e.g., medical equipment) rolling on caster wheels may bind when the equipment is rolled onto electrical cables, fluid hoses, and other similar objects. This is a nuisance to the equipment operator and reduces the equipment's mobility. Further, it can cause the equipment to tip over, damage the electrical cables, pinch hoses shut, and pose other similar issues.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In certain cases, certain existing cable guards are used in conjunction with casters for purposes of pushing cables and hoses aside, such as to prevent the equipment from rolling onto the cables and hoses and causing the issues discussed above. However, the existing cable guards pose certain additional and undesired issues. For example, some of the existing cable guards have to be removed and stored when the equipment is moved over fixed obstacles such as doorsills and elevator sills or non-fixed but difficult-to-move obstacles such as floor mats. Forcing an equipment operator to remove and store cable guards every time the equipment has to be moved over such objects, however, is extremely burdensome for the operator.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some of the other existing cable guards are in a fixed position and, therefore, cannot even be removed when the equipment is about to move over fixed obstacles. As such, the fixed cable guards bind on such obstacles and can cause the equipment to tip over.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates generally to retractable guard assemblies for use in connection with casters of mobile equipment, such as medical or non-medical equipment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Particular embodiments disclosed herein provide a retractable guard assembly coupled to a caster of a mobile equipment, comprising a housing and one or more guards at least partially disposed in the housing.

While the embodiments below describe retractable guard assemblies that are mounted on casters and used in connection with a medical equipment, such as an ophthalmic surgical console, those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate that the retractable guard assemblies described herein may be used in conjunction with a variety of medical and non-medical equipment. Examples of such medical equipment include surgical and non-surgical consoles, diagnostic equipment, hospital beds, hospital carts, stretchers, IV (intravenous) poles and other mobile medical equipment. Examples of non-medical equipment include any mobile electrical and/or mechanical devices and accessories with casters.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments disclosed herein provide a caster with a retractable guard assembly which self-retracts when the respective caster wheel encounters fixed objects. Self-retracting guard assemblies allow mobile equipment to be easily moved over fixed objects without requiring action by the user. Furthermore, the retractable guard assemblies disclosed herein retract only when contacting objects that exert counter force (against the respective guards of the retractable guard assemblies) that is large enough to satisfy a threshold condition. This mechanism allows a retractable guard assembly to push loose objects out of the path of a corresponding caster wheel to prevent the caster wheel from binding on loose objects while at the same time allowing the caster wheel to move over fixed objects. In addition, the retractable guard assemblies disclosed herein are designed to yield to fixed objects approaching from any direction including from the front, rear, or below (e.g., when mobile equipment is set down or maneuvered up or down a ledge).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a medical equipment <b>100</b> including four caster assemblies <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>, and <b>102</b><i>d </i>(not shown). As shown, each caster assembly <b>102</b> includes a caster (e.g., caster <b>303</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) with a rotating caster wheel (&#x201c;caster wheel&#x201d;) <b>101</b> and a caster lock toehold <b>106</b>. Pressing caster lock toehold <b>106</b> causes it to make contact with the ground and, therefore, create friction that may prevent a corresponding caster wheel <b>101</b> from rotating.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each caster assembly <b>102</b> also includes a retractable guard assembly <b>104</b>, as described in more detail below. In certain embodiments, each retractable guard assembly <b>104</b> is mounted on a corresponding caster during the manufacturing process. As further described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, each retractable guard assembly <b>104</b> comprises one or more guards which are independently movable with respect to each other and with respect to caster assembly <b>102</b>. When deployed, the guards are configured to push objects such as cables, hoses, and other similar objects aside. In the deployed state, the guards provide a certain amount of clearance with the ground in order to allow medical equipment <b>100</b> to be moved around. The clearance (e.g., distance between the bottom of the guards and the ground), however, is configured such that the guards are still able to make contact with cables, hoses, and other similar objects and push them aside. When one or more of the guards contact an object which is not intended to be pushed aside, the corresponding guards are retracted, thereby creating a larger clearance with the ground, such that medical equipment <b>100</b> can be easily moved over fixed objects (e.g., obstacles), such as doorsills and elevator sills, and other difficult-to-move obstacles such as floor mats. Note that, in certain embodiments, any difficult-to-move obstacles may be considered as fixed objects. As used herein, the term &#x201c;fixed object&#x201d; refers to any object that exerts a large enough force on at least one of the guards, thereby, causing the guard to retract.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a side view of a caster assembly <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> including a retractable guard assembly <b>104</b> in a deployed state, according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a perspective view of caster assembly <b>102</b> including retractable guard assembly <b>104</b> in a deployed state, according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a perspective view of caster assembly <b>102</b> including retractable guard assembly <b>104</b> with front guards <b>210</b><i>a </i>in a retracted state, according to some embodiments.

Housing pieces <b>209</b><i>a </i>and <b>209</b><i>b </i>are coupled together using screws <b>218</b><i>a</i>-<b>218</b><i>c</i>. Housing pieces <b>209</b><i>a </i>and <b>209</b><i>b </i>are indirectly coupled together through collar <b>216</b>. Housing piece <b>209</b><i>a </i>is coupled to collar <b>216</b> using screw <b>218</b><i>d</i>, and housing piece <b>209</b><i>b </i>is coupled to collar <b>216</b> using screw <b>218</b><i>e</i>. Front guards <b>210</b> and rear guards <b>212</b> are at least partially disposed in housing <b>208</b>. Only portions of front guards <b>210</b> and rear guards <b>212</b> which are disposed outside housing <b>208</b> are visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>. As shown, front guards <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>are positioned symmetrically such that there is a front guard on each side of caster wheel <b>101</b>. Rear guards <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>are also positioned symmetrically such that there is a rear guard on each side of caster wheel <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As described above, in a deployed state, front guards <b>210</b> and rear guards <b>212</b> provide a minimal amount of clearance with the ground to allow medical equipment <b>100</b> to be moved around while also pushing any objects such as cables, out of the way. When front guards <b>210</b> and rear guards <b>212</b> are in a fully deployed state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), contact between a fixed object <b>214</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) and a portion of any one of front guards <b>210</b> or rear guards <b>212</b> disposed outside housing <b>208</b> causes the corresponding guard to transition into a retracted state. Note that because the guards are independently movable with respect to each other, any one of the four guards is able to retract while the other guards stay deployed. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, front guards <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>are in the retracted state, whereas rear guards <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b </i>remain in the deployed state. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, front guards <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>have a greater clearance with the ground than rear guards <b>212</b><i>a </i>and <b>212</b><i>b</i>. In addition, front guards <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>in the retracted state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) have a greater clearance with the ground than front guards <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>in the fully deployed state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When front guards <b>210</b> are in the retracted state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) and when the contact with fixed object <b>214</b> is removed, the corresponding guards self-deploy or transition back into the fully deployed state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Although rear guards <b>212</b> are only shown in the fully deployed state, rear guards <b>212</b> function similar to front guards <b>210</b>. The transition to the fully deployed state is caused by corresponding biasing elements which bias, or pre-load, each of the guards towards the fully deployed state as described in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref> and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates an exploded view of the caster assembly <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, according to certain embodiments.

In contrast to lower slot <b>311</b><i>a</i>, upper slot <b>313</b><i>a </i>has a non-linear shape which is configured to permit translational motion of front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>in any direction. In other words, a width and length of upper slot <b>313</b><i>a </i>are both greater than a diameter of upper pin <b>328</b><i>a </i>so that upper pin <b>328</b><i>a </i>can move in any direction (e.g., up, down, left, and right) within upper slot <b>313</b><i>a</i>. As shown, upper slot <b>313</b><i>a </i>is triangular. Alternatively, upper slot <b>313</b><i>a </i>may be square, rectangular, circular, or any other suitable non-linear shape.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The motion of upper slot <b>313</b><i>a </i>in any direction relative to upper pin <b>328</b><i>a </i>allows lower slot <b>311</b><i>a </i>to rotate about a longitudinal axis of lower pin <b>326</b><i>a </i>in addition to translating on the longitudinal axis of lower slot <b>311</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, as front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>contacts left side <b>214</b><i>a </i>of fixed object <b>214</b> at leading edge <b>454</b><i>a</i>, a lateral force is exerted on front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>causing front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>and lower slot <b>311</b><i>a </i>to rotate clockwise about the longitudinal axis of lower pin <b>326</b><i>a</i>. Rotation of front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>causes a left side of sidewall <b>446</b><i>a </i>(which corresponds to the perimeter of slot <b>313</b><i>a</i>) to translate in contact with upper pin <b>328</b><i>a</i>. The shape of upper slot <b>313</b><i>a </i>(which diverges in a downward direction) and complementary angle of sidewall <b>446</b><i>a </i>causes front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>to move upwards causing lower slot <b>311</b><i>a </i>to translate in contact with lower pin <b>326</b><i>a </i>as shown.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, caster wheel <b>101</b> has moved into contact with fixed object <b>214</b>, and front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>has transitioned into a second retracted state which has a greater clearance with the ground compared to the first retracted state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, caster wheel <b>101</b> is in contact with an edge connecting side <b>214</b><i>a </i>and top surface <b>214</b><i>b </i>of fixed object <b>214</b>. Comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C</figref>, continued application of the lateral force on front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>continues the clockwise rotation of front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>and lower slot <b>311</b><i>a </i>about the longitudinal axis of lower pin <b>326</b><i>a </i>which continues the upward movement of front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>as left side of sidewall <b>446</b><i>a </i>continues to translate in contact with upper pin <b>328</b><i>a </i>and lower slot <b>311</b><i>a </i>continues to translate in contact with lower pin <b>326</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>is disposed completely within a perimeter of caster wheel <b>101</b>. Therefore, the retraction of front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>is at a maximum for the depicted movement of caster wheel <b>101</b> over fixed object <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>, caster wheel <b>101</b> has moved onto top surface <b>214</b><i>b </i>of fixed object <b>214</b>, and front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>has transitioned into the fully deployed state. Although not shown, after initial movement of caster wheel <b>101</b> onto top surface <b>214</b><i>b </i>of fixed object <b>214</b>, second end <b>444</b><i>a </i>of front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>moves into contact with top surface <b>214</b><i>b</i>. At this point, the lateral force exerted on front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>is removed. Instead, a vertical force is exerted against second end <b>444</b><i>a </i>maintaining front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>in a retracted state. Continued movement of caster wheel <b>101</b> along top surface <b>214</b><i>b </i>provides greater clearance between second end <b>444</b><i>a </i>of front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>and top surface <b>214</b><i>b </i>of fixed object <b>214</b> allowing front guard <b>210</b><i>a </i>to transition to the fully deployed state shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>.

In such examples, as rear guard <b>212</b><i>a </i>contacts a right side of fixed object <b>214</b> at leading edge <b>455</b><i>a</i>, a lateral force is exerted on rear guard <b>212</b><i>a </i>causing rear guard <b>212</b><i>a </i>and lower slot <b>315</b><i>a </i>to rotate counterclockwise about a longitudinal axis of lower pin <b>327</b><i>a</i>. Rotation of rear guard <b>212</b><i>a </i>causes a right side of sidewall <b>447</b><i>a </i>(which corresponds to the perimeter of slot <b>317</b><i>a</i>) to translate in contact with upper pin <b>329</b><i>a</i>. The shape of upper slot <b>317</b><i>a </i>(which diverges in a downward direction) and complementary angle of sidewall <b>447</b><i>a </i>causes rear guard <b>212</b><i>a </i>to move upwards causing lower slot <b>315</b><i>a </i>to translate in contact with lower pin <b>327</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Accordingly, certain embodiments described herein provide retractable guard assemblies that can be used in conjunction with caster wheels of an equipment.
