The invention further relates to a process for producing the compression limiter, and to an assembly comprising a thermoplastic body and the compression limiter. According to the invention, the compression limiter is made of a thermoplastic composition.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Plastic components can be fixed into or onto a carrier, for example an engine of a vehicle, using screws or bolts. Compression limiters are designed for high load bearing capability, thereby protecting the plastic components of an assembly from the compressive loads generated by the tightening of bolts and assuring continued integrity of the bolted connection.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Compression limiters ensure that the normal force of the screw is limited with respect to the plastic component's permissible load, and in doing so, they protect the components from damage. The load causes compression due to tightening torque, which without compression limiters can lead to cracking and creep or otherwise damage the thermoplastic body. Compression limiters also ensure that the normal force of the screw is maintained to an adequate degree over the life of the fastened joint.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Compression limiters are typically plain hole metal inserts designed for use in plastic molded components. The plain hole provides bolt clearance and the wall of the compression limiter withstands the compressive force induced during the assembly of the mating screw or bolt. In practice, the compression limiter should be slightly shorter than the thickness of the plastic host.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the bolt is tightened the plastic compresses and the stress in the plastic increases until the head of the bolt, or washer if one is used, comes into contact with the compression limiter. Thereafter, the compression limiter and plastic will compress at the same, although greatly reduced, rate. The compression limiter will absorb additional clamping loads without further significant compression or increased stress in the plastic material.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Assemblies comprising a thermoplastic body and one or more compression limiters can be made by insert-molding, i.e. the compression limiters are positioned in place in a mold after which the thermoplastic body is molded around the compression limiters by injection molding, or the compression limiters can be inserted after the thermoplastic body is molded. Installation can take place manually or automatically.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A general problem with compression limiters is proper engagement between the compression limiter and the main body receiving compression limiter. A further problem with many compression limiter systems is the dimensional match between compression limiter and the aperture receiving the compression limiter. A too small aperture or a too large sized compression limiter can lead to damage of the thermoplastic body when putting the compression limiter in place by pressing. On the other hand, a too large aperture or a too small sized compression limiter can lead to too lose connection between the two and result in problems in further handling and mounting or in pull off of the thermoplastic body during operation. Use of an adhesive to overcome these latter problems is also not desirable, as it requires an extra operation and sensitive to failure as well.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An assembly comprising a body part and compression limiters is described for example in US2018261812-A1. The assembly of US2018261812-A1 is a battery assembly for an electrified vehicle. The battery assembly includes one or more compression limiters configured to engage a structural member of the battery assembly. The compression limiters carry loads within the battery assembly and guide fasteners for mating parts of the assembly. The compression limiter includes a body and an attachment head near a first end of the body. Proper engagement of the compression limiter to the structural member of the battery assembly is accomplished with a special configuration of the compression limiter.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another example of a compression limiter is described in US2008157483-A1. US2008157483-A1 relates to a compression limiter and, more particularly, to a compression limiter utilized to transmit loads of a plastic component. The compression limiter is made of metal. As mentioned in US2008157483-A1, a metal compression limiter is commonly used in applications where a compressive load is applied to a plastic component. The compression limiter strengthens the plastic and resists the load that is applied. The integrity of the plastic, therefore, is not compromised. Additionally, the compression limiter prevents/reduces plastic material creep which can cause reduction of the fastener tightening torque over time. However, according to US2008157483-A1, there are still problems to be solved. Typically, the metal compression limiter is pressed into a bore in the plastic component and receives the fastener. Retention of the pressed-in compression limiter to the plastic component is of concern because they often fall-out prior to final installation of the plastic component. Additionally, the pressed-in compression limiter can press into and deform the material of the second component to which the plastic component is secured, reducing the applied load of the fastener. In motor vehicles and other applications, the plastic component typically has at least three attachment holes receiving the fasteners. One of the holes is typically a datum hole with a smaller diameter that locates the plastic component, one of the holes is a slotted hole that orients the plastic component, and at least one of the holes is a clearance hole for retention of the plastic component to the other component. This requires at least three different compression limiters for a single plastic component which results in a risk that the compression limiters can be inserted in the wrong holes. As a solution to these problems, the compression limiter of US2008157483-A1 includes, in combination, a tubular-shaped wall having an outer surface and an inner surface forming a central passage, and a plurality of perforations extending through the wall from the outer surface to the inner surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further example of a compression limiter is described in US2012107659-A1. US2012107659-A1 relates to a battery pack and more particularly to a battery pack including a prismatic repeating frame assembly comprising a main body having an aperture formed therein; and a hollow compression limiter disposed in the aperture of the main body and permitting a compression rod to be inserted therethrough. According to US2012107659-A1, metallic compression limiters are necessarily machined separately from the repeating frame assemblies. A high degree of cleanliness is desirable for the battery pack, and the machined metallic compression limiters can undesirably introduce debris such as metallic flakes into the battery pack during the insertion process. The metallic compression limiters can also oxidize over time, and further contaminate the battery pack. The use of the heat insertion equipment for installation of the metallic compression limiters also adds to a complexity of the battery pack assembly. The prismatic repeating frame assembly of US2012107659-A1, comprises a main body formed from a first polymer selected from nylon or polypropylene, and a compression limiter formed from a second polymer selected from polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) and a polyether ether ketone (PEEK), made by co-injection molding.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Injection molded parts generally suffer from weak spots at weldlines resulting from the injection molding process. Apart from the above problems with compression limiters in general, compression limiters made of metal are preferred over compression limiters made of plastics, because of their high load bearing properties and in particular for their better performance at elevated temperatures and under dynamic conditions. Whereas the requirements on compression limiters in terms of load bearing properties and prevention of damage of plastic components of an assembly from the compressive loads generated by the tightening of bolts is already high, these requirements are even more severe for under-the-hood applications in vehicles, where assemblies may be mounted close to or even onto the engine. Herein the tight mounting is generally not only to keep the mounted assembly in place, but also secure a leak-tight sealing, for example to prevent leakage of coolant fluid in the assembled battery pack. Herein the mounted assemblies not only have to perform under dynamic mechanic loads due to vibrations from the vehicles in operation at room temperature, but also under different thermal conditions, both at low temperatures, e.g. at &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. and even below, and at elevated temperatures as high as 120&#xb0; C. or even 150&#xb0; C. and even above, with peak temperatures up to or even above 180&#xb0; C., as well as under dry conditions and humid conditions, and all combinations thereof, even up to 80 to 100% relative humidity at for example 80&#xb0; C. Furthermore, dimension control of the compression limiter in combination with the dimensions of the aperture in the plastic body comprising the compression limiter are critical, not only during assembly, but also during these variations in temperature and in humidity.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, the aim of the present invention is to provide a compression limiter, and an assembly comprising a thermoplastic body and the compression limiter, that show high load-bearing properties over a wide temperature range, for instance that show high static compression failure force and high retention of compression force, this indicating good sealing performance under a wide range of thermal and/or humidity variations.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This aim is achieved with the compression limiter and with the assembly according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The compression limiter according to the invention is made of a first thermoplastic polyamide composition as mentioned in claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Herein the compression limiter is made of a thermoplastic material comprising<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0016">(A) 35-65 wt. % of a polyamide component (A), wherein at least 90 wt. % of the polyamide component (A) consists of a semi-crystalline semi-aromatic polyamide (A-1), consisting of repeat units derived from        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0017">45-50 mole % of a diamine,</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0018">40-50 mole % of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid; and</li>            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0019">0-10 mole % of one or more other monomers,</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0020">wherein the mole % is relative to the total molar amount of diamine, aromatic dicarboxylic acid and one or more other monomers, and wherein (A-1) has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least 110&#xb0; C. and a melting temperature of at least 280&#xb0; C.;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0021">(B) 35-65 wt. % of a fibrous reinforcing agent;<br/>wherein the weight percentages of (A) and (B) are relative to the total weight of the composition.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0022">The assembly according to the invention comprises a thermoplastic body made of a second thermoplastic polyamide composition and further comprises the hereabove mentioned compression limiter.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0023">Herein the assembly is suitably made by first producing the compression limiter by injection molding of the first thermoplastic polyamide composition, and then producing the thermoplastic body by injection molding of a second thermoplastic polyamide composition, and thereby overmolding the compression limiter with the second thermoplastic polyamide composition.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0024">Such production may be carried out as a two-step injection molding process, or as an insert molding process wherein the compression limiter is produced in a separate process and inserted in a mold prior to the overmolding process.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0025">The effects of the compression limiter and the assembly according to the present invention, wherein the compression limiter is made of the first thermoplastic polyamide composition, and the thermoplastic body is made by overmolding the compression limiter with the second thermoplastic polyamide composition, are high load bearing properties over a prolonged time at a wide temperature range, good adhesion between the compression limiter and the thermoplastic body, and a leak-tight sealing during prolonged operation under varying temperature and/or humidity conditions and/or dynamic mechanic loads.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0026">The compression limiter according to the invention is made of a thermoplastic material, also referred to herein as first thermoplastic material, wherein the thermoplastic material comprises 35-65 wt. % of a polyamide component (A); and 35-65 wt. % of a fibrous reinforcing agent (B).
