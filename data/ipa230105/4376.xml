The control unit is configured to perform: selecting a first vehicle that is to download first data in place of a second vehicle while the first vehicle is traveling; and instructing the first vehicle to download the first data in place of the second vehicle while the first vehicle is traveling and to transmit the first data to the second vehicle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The information processing device may be, for example, a server that manages a plurality of vehicles. The present disclosure is not limited thereto. Vehicles that are managed by the information processing device include a first vehicle and a second vehicle. The vehicles managed by the information processing device may be, for example, vehicles that can travel autonomously or travel automatically. The present disclosure is not limited thereto, and the vehicles managed by the information processing device may be vehicles that travel with a driver's operation, have a communication function, and have a plurality of programs installed therein. The control unit may be, for example, a processor such as a central processing unit (CPU). An example of an instruction for a vehicle is to prepare and transmit a schedule for the vehicle. The present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the aspect of the present disclosure, for example, even when the second vehicle travels or parks in an area with a poor communication environment, the first vehicle can download first data in place of the second vehicle and transmit the downloaded first data to the second vehicle. Accordingly, the second vehicle can stably acquire the first data.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the aspect of the present disclosure, the control unit may select the first vehicle that is to download the first data out of a plurality of vehicles in place of the second vehicle based on a data rate on a scheduled travel route. In this case, the control unit may select the first vehicle when a data rate in a scheduled travel route of the second vehicle is less than a first threshold value. The plurality of vehicles is vehicles that are managed by the information processing device. The data rate in a scheduled travel route may be acquired, for example, from a data rate map in which results of measurement of a downlink data rate measured at all points are plotted on a map. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, it is possible to determine whether a communication environment is good or poor based on the data rate in each scheduled travel route.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the aspect of the present disclosure, the control unit may select the first vehicle out of the plurality of vehicles additionally based on a communication load. In this case, the control unit may select a vehicle in which the communication load is less than a second threshold value and the data rate is highest as the first vehicle out of a plurality of vehicles. For example, when a vehicle managed by the information processing device is a vehicle traveling autonomously or traveling automatically, a communication process load is increased due to traveling. The communication load may increase by causing the vehicle traveling autonomously or traveling automatically to download the first data in traveling, and there is a likelihood of traveling of the vehicle being affected. Accordingly, it is possible to secure traveling safety of a vehicle selected as the first vehicle by selecting the first vehicle in consideration of the communication load. The communication load may be an estimated value.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the aspect of the present disclosure, the control unit may acquire a communication load of each of the plurality of vehicles based on a type of a road included in a scheduled travel route of each of the plurality of vehicles. Examples of the road type include a highway and a public road. For example, a highway is likely to have a smaller communication load based on traveling than that of a public road because there are no signals, longer straight sections, and no pedestrians in comparison with the public road. According to the aspect of the present disclosure, a communication load of a vehicle can be acquired from a type of a road included in a scheduled travel route.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the aspect of the present disclosure, the control unit may select the first vehicle out of a plurality of vehicles which is scheduled to join the second vehicle. In this case, the control unit may instruct the first vehicle to transmit the first data to the first vehicle at a junction with the first vehicle. Accordingly, a vehicle that can reliably transmit the first data to the second vehicle can be selected as the first vehicle.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the aspect of the disclosure, the first data may be updating data of a program which is installed in the second vehicle. In this case, the control unit may further perform instructing the second vehicle to receive the first data from the first vehicle and to update the program with the first data. Accordingly, even when the second vehicle is located in an area with a poor communication environment, the second vehicle can acquire updating data of a program and update the program.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the aspect of the present disclosure, the first vehicle may download the first data by first communication using a relay and transmit the first data to the second vehicle by second communication not using a relay. The first communication is, for example, communication based on a mobile communication system such as 5th Generation (5G), Long Term Evolution (LTE), or 6th Generation (6G). The second communication is, for example, a radio communication system such as Bluetooth (registered trademark) and Wi-Fi. Accordingly, even when the second vehicle is located in an area with a poor communication environment of the first communication, the second vehicle can acquire the first data from the first vehicle by the second communication.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Other aspects of the present disclosure can be realized as an information processing method including processes of the information processing device, a program causing a computer to perform the processes of the information processing device, and a non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing the program. Another aspect of the present disclosure can also be realized as an information processing system including a plurality of vehicles and the information processing device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
