The cam lock <b>120</b> includes the cam <b>124</b> and a lever <b>152</b> extending from the cam to a paddle-shaped grip portion <b>154</b>. The cam <b>124</b> is housed within the shaft body <b>102</b> and is pivotably connected thereto by the fastener <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, the cam <b>124</b> has a continuously curved cam surface throughout its range of motion. In particular, the continuously curved cam surface includes a first portion <b>156</b> with a continuously increasing radius of curvature contiguous with a second portion <b>158</b> with a continuously decreasing radius of curvature, wherein a juncture of the first portion and the second portion defines a locking portion <b>160</b> of the continuously curved cam surface.

According to another aspect, the locking portion <b>160</b> is convex in shape and has no V-shaped or other ridge-shaped profile. According to an exemplary, although non-limitative embodiment, the first portion <b>156</b> has a minimum radius of about 7.6 mm (0.3005 inches) as measured from the center &#x201c;X&#x201d; of a fastener through hole <b>162</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>) that continuously increases toward the locking portion <b>160</b> to a maximum radius of about 8.7 mm (0.342 inches), the second portion <b>158</b> has a maximum radius of about 8.7 mm (0.342 inches) that continuously decreases from the locking portion <b>160</b> to a minimum radius of 8.4 mm (0.330 inches), and the locking portion has a substantially constant radius of about 8.7 mm (0.342 inches) spanning an arc length of about 1.6 mm (0.064 inches).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The continuously curved cam surface of the cam <b>124</b> avoids the &#x201c;jerking&#x201d; one feels when opening and closing conventional cam locks which have a V-shaped or other ridge-shaped profile at the peak of the cam surface. Additionally, it has been observed that the continuously curved cam surface of the cam <b>124</b> results in at least a 60% increase in clamping pressure and at least a 45% decrease in release force versus conventional cam handles which have a ridge or V-shaped profile at the peak of the cam surface. For example, it has been observed that when using a conventional cam handle having a ridge or V-shaped profile at the peak of the cam surface, the maximum clamping pressure exerted by such a cam is approximately 25,000,000 to 28,000,000 newtons/m<sup>2 </sup>(800-900 pounds applied over a contact area of 0.22 square inches (i.e., the contact area of the peak of the cam on the hardened fitting <b>123</b> at the proximal end <b>122</b> of the push rod <b>106</b>)) and the release force is approximately 160 newtons (36 pounds). In contrast, it has been observed that when using the present cam handle having a continuously curved cam surface, the maximum clamping force exerted by such a cam is approximately 45,000,000 newtons/m<sup>2 </sup>(1500 pounds applied over a contact area of 0.22 square inches (i.e., the contact area of the locking portion <b>160</b> of the cam on the hardened fitting <b>123</b> at the proximal end <b>122</b> of the push rod <b>106</b>)) and the release force is approximately 90 newtons (20 pounds). In addition, a generally paddle-shaped grip portion <b>154</b> of the cam lock <b>120</b> is more than 50% larger in surface area than corresponding grip portions of conventional cam handles, thereby reducing pressure on the hand and rendering operation of the hip stem implant extractor <b>100</b> more comfortable during use.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>23</b></figref> show the construction of another exemplary embodiment of an implant extractor in accordance with the subject disclosure. In many respects, the implant extractor <b>200</b> is constructed and functions substantially similarly to the implant extractor <b>100</b> described above. Accordingly, for brevity, only those features of the implant extractor <b>200</b> which materially depart in structure and/or function from those of the implant extractor <b>100</b> will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>23</b></figref>, a distinction between the implant extractor <b>200</b> and the implant extractor <b>100</b> is that the implant extractor <b>200</b> further comprises a replaceable gripping insert <b>270</b> received within a central passageway <b>272</b> at the distal end of the curved jaw support arm <b>210</b>.

According to an aspect, the curved jaw <b>212</b> can be provided with grip enhancing structure <b>246</b>, e.g., a plurality of ridges, teeth, or the like, that aligns with the grip enhancing structure <b>274</b> of the gripping insert.

The cam lock is then moved or pivoted downwardly to the locked position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, whereby the locking portion <b>160</b> of the cam <b>124</b> pushes the push rod <b>106</b> against the proximal end of the curved jaw <b>112</b> (or <b>212</b>), whereby the opposed gripping enhancing structures firmly grip the trunnion <b>500</b>. With the implant extractor so configured, an extraction tool may be connected to the threaded tool connector <b>104</b> and may be used to exert an extraction or pulling force on the implant extractor to extract the implant <b>502</b> from a patient's hip or other bone.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A typical anterior hip stem implant extractor tool has a longitudinal axis generally coextensive with the hip stem implant to be extracted. As a result, this allows the device to clear the patient's body which is necessary due to the typical orientation the patient's body needs to be placed in to perform the surgery via the direct anterior approach. In this approach, the incision is made on the anterior plane of the hip which differs from the posterior-lateral approach. Thus, in order to align the hip stem with an opening for extraction, the patient's leg needs to be dislocated and bent posterior or to the rear to allow access. Otherwise, the patient's mid-section would prevent the hip stem from being extracted. The patient's leg can only be positioned to such a maximum angle dependent on the patient's anatomy, thus the necessary surgical instrumentation to remove a patient's hip stem requires an offset to clear the patient's belly. Such an offset is not needed for a posterior lateral approach because the patient can easily be bent forward at the hip in a regular anatomical position and have the hip stem extracted posteriorly, i.e., out the rear. The direct anterior approach is gaining popularity because significantly less soft tissue needs to be severed to allow for the surgery when compared to the posterior-lateral approach, which in turn, allows for considerable reduction in recovery time for the patient. Indeed, in some cases the anterior approach allows patients to be walking on their own the day after surgery.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The subject disclosure, in contrast, provides an implant extractor which functions as an effective tool for achieving direct anterior hip stem implant extraction and the aforementioned benefits associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the exemplary embodiments described above without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof.
