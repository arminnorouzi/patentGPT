id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method performed by a computing device includes determining a set of identigens for each word of words of a product-service query to produce sets of identigens. The method further includes interpreting, using identigen pairing rules of a knowledge database, the sets of identigens to determine a most likely meaning interpretation of the product-service query and produce a query entigen group that includes query entigens. The method further includes identifying one or more characteristic entigen categories for a subjective category entigen of the query entigen group. The method further includes recovering a set of response entigens for the product-service query from the knowledge database utilizing the query entigen group and based on the one or more characteristic entigen categories. The set of response entigens provides an answer for the product-service query.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="135.04mm"

It is often difficult to produce useful information from this stored data due to many factors. The factors include the volume of available data, accuracy of the data, and variances in how text is interpreted to express knowledge. For example, many languages and regional dialects utilize the same or similar words to represent different concepts.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Computers are known to utilize pattern recognition techniques and apply statistical reasoning to process text to express an interpretation in an attempt to overcome ambiguities inherent in words. One pattern recognition technique includes matching a word pattern of a query to a word pattern of the stored data to find an explicit textual answer. Another pattern recognition technique classifies words into major grammatical types such as functional words, nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs. Grammar based techniques then utilize these grammatical types to study how words should be distributed within a string of words to form a properly constructed grammatical sentence where each word is forced to support a grammatical operation without necessarily identifying what the word is actually trying to describe.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

An embodiment of the various devices is discussed in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Each of the content sources <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>16</b>-N includes any source of content, where the content includes one or more of data files, a data stream, a tech stream, a text file, an audio stream, an audio file, a video stream, a video file, etc. Examples of the content sources include a weather service, a multi-language online dictionary, a fact server, a big data storage system, the Internet, social media systems, an email server, a news server, a schedule server, a traffic monitor, a security camera system, audio monitoring equipment, an information server, a service provider, a data aggregator, and airline traffic server, a shipping and logistics server, a banking server, a financial transaction server, etc. Alternatively, or in addition to, one or more of the various user devices may provide content. For example, a wireless user device may provide content (e.g., issued as a content message) when the wireless user device is able to capture data (e.g., text input, sensor input, etc.).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Generally, an embodiment of this invention presents solutions where the computing system <b>10</b> supports the generation and utilization of knowledge extracted from content. For example, the AI servers <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>20</b>-N ingest content from the content sources <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>16</b>-N by receiving, via the core network <b>24</b> content messages <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>28</b>-N as AI messages <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>32</b>-N, extract the knowledge from the ingested content, and interact with the various user devices to utilize the extracted knowledge by facilitating the issuing, via the core network <b>24</b>, user messages <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>22</b>-N to the user devices <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>12</b>-N and wireless signals <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>26</b>-N to the wireless user devices <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>14</b>-N.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Each content message <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>28</b>-N includes a content request (e.g., requesting content related to a topic, content type, content timing, one or more domains, etc.) or a content response, where the content response includes real-time or static content such as one or more of dictionary information, facts, non-facts, weather information, sensor data, news information, blog information, social media content, user daily activity schedules, traffic conditions, community event schedules, school schedules, user schedules airline records, shipping records, logistics records, banking records, census information, global financial history information, etc. Each AI message <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>32</b>-N includes one or more of content messages, user messages (e.g., a query request, a query response that includes an answer to a query request), and transaction messages (e.g., transaction information, requests and responses related to transactions). Each user message <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>22</b>-N includes one or more of a query request, a query response, a trigger request, a trigger response, a content collection, control information, software information, configuration information, security information, routing information, addressing information, presence information, analytics information, protocol information, all types of media, sensor data, statistical data, user data, error messages, etc.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">When utilizing a wireless signal capability of the core network <b>24</b>, each of the wireless user devices <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>14</b>-N encodes/decodes data and/or information messages (e.g., user messages such as user messages <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>22</b>-N) in accordance with one or more wireless standards for local wireless data signals (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee) and/or for wide area wireless data signals (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, satellite, point-to-point, etc.) to produce wireless signals <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>26</b>-N. Having encoded/decoded the data and/or information messages, the wireless user devices <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>14</b>-N and/receive the wireless signals to/from the wireless capability of the core network <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As another example of the generation and utilization of knowledge, the transactional servers <b>18</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>18</b>-N communicate, via the core network <b>24</b>, transaction messages <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>30</b>-N as further AI messages <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>32</b>-N to facilitate ingesting of transactional type content (e.g., real-time crypto currency transaction information) and to facilitate handling of utilization of the knowledge by one or more of the transactional servers (e.g., for a transactional function) in addition to the utilization of the knowledge by the various user devices. Each transaction message <b>30</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>30</b>-N includes one or more of a query request, a query response, a trigger request, a trigger response, a content message, and transactional information, where the transactional information may include one or more of consumer purchasing history, crypto currency ledgers, stock market trade information, other investment transaction information, etc.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another specific example of operation of the generation and utilization of knowledge extracted from the content, the user device <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> issues a user message <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> to the AI server <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, where the user message <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> includes a query request and where the query request includes a question related to a first domain of knowledge. The issuing includes generating the user message <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> based on the query request (e.g., the question), selecting the AI server <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> based on the first domain of knowledge, and sending, via the core network <b>24</b>, the user message <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> as a further AI message <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> to the AI server <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>. Having received the AI message <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>, the AI server <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> analyzes the question within the first domain, generates further knowledge, generates a preliminary answer, generates a quality level indicator of the preliminary answer, and determines to gather further content when the quality level indicator is below a minimum quality threshold level.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">When gathering the further content, the AI server <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> issues, via the core network <b>24</b>, a still further AI message <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> as a further content message <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> to the content source <b>16</b>-<b>1</b>, where the content message <b>28</b>-<b>1</b> includes a content request for more content associated with the first domain of knowledge and in particular the question.

The real-world includes items, actions, and attributes. The human expressions include textual words, textual symbols, images, and other sensorial information (e.g., sounds). It is known that many words, within a given language, can mean different things based on groupings and orderings of the words.

As a first step of the flow diagram to transition from human representations of things to a most precise computer representation of the things, the computer identifies the words, phrases, sentences, etc. from the human expressions to produce the sets of identigens <b>502</b>. Each identigen includes an identifier of their meaning and an identifier of an instance for each possible language, culture, etc. For example, the words car and automobile share a common meaning identifier but have different instance identifiers since they are different words and are spelled differently. As another example, the word duck is associated both with a bird and an action to elude even though they are spelled the same. In this example the bird duck has a different meaning than the elude duck and as such each has a different meaning identifier of the corresponding identigens.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">As a second step of the flow diagram to transition from human representations of things to the most precise computer representation of the things, the computer extracts meaning from groupings of the identified words, phrases, sentences, etc. to produce the sets of entigens <b>504</b>. Each entigen includes an identifier of a single conceivable and perceivable thing in space and time (e.g., independent of language and other aspects of the human expressions).

As time goes on, and as an entigen has been identified, it can encounter an experience transformations in time, space, attributes, actions, and words which are used to identify it without creating contradictions or ever losing its identity.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a relationship block diagram illustrating an embodiment of relationships between things <b>510</b> and representations of things <b>512</b> within a computing system.

While things in the real world are described with words, it is often the case that a particular word has multiple meanings in isolation. Interpreting the meaning of the particular word may hinge on analyzing how the word is utilized in a phrase, a sentence, multiple sentences, paragraphs, and even whole documents or more. Describing and stratifying the use of words, word types, and possible meanings help in interpreting a true meaning.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Humans utilize textual words <b>528</b> to represent things in the real world. Quite often a particular word has multiple instances of different grammatical use when part of a phrase of one or more sentences. The grammatical use <b>649</b> of words includes the nouns and the verbs, and also includes adverbs, adjectives, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, determiners, exclamations, etc.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">As an example of multiple grammatical use, the word &#x201c;bat&#x201d; in the English language can be utilized as a noun or a verb. For instance, when utilized as a noun, the word &#x201c;bat&#x201d; may apply to a baseball bat or may apply to a flying &#x201c;bat.&#x201d; As another instance, when utilized as a verb, the word &#x201c;bat&#x201d; may apply to the action of hitting or batting an object, i.e., &#x201c;bat the ball.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">To stratify word types by use, the words are associated with a word type (e.g., type identifier <b>542</b>). The word types include objects (e.g., items <b>524</b>), characteristics (e.g., attributes <b>526</b>), actions <b>522</b>, and the functionals <b>550</b> for joining other words and describing words. For example, when the word &#x201c;bat&#x201d; is utilized as a noun, the word is describing the object of either the baseball bat or the flying bat. As another example, when the word &#x201c;bat&#x201d; is utilized as a verb, the word is describing the action of hitting.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">To determine possible meanings, the words, by word type, are mapped to associative meanings (e.g., identigens <b>718</b>). For each possible associative meaning, the word type is documented with the meaning and further with an identifier (ID) of the instance (e.g., an identigen identifier).</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">For the example of the word &#x201c;bat&#x201d; when utilized as a noun for the baseball bat, a first identigen identifier <b>536</b>-<b>1</b> includes a type ID <b>542</b>-<b>1</b> associated with the object <b>524</b>, an instance ID <b>540</b>-<b>1</b> associated with the first identigen identifier (e.g., unique for the baseball bat), and a meaning ID <b>538</b>-<b>1</b> associated with the baseball bat. For the example of the word &#x201c;bat&#x201d; when utilized as a noun for the flying bat, a second identigen identifier <b>536</b>-<b>2</b> includes a type ID <b>542</b>-<b>1</b> associated with the object <b>524</b>, an instance ID <b>540</b>-<b>2</b> associated with the second identigen identifier (e.g., unique for the flying bat), and a meaning ID <b>538</b>-<b>2</b> associated with the flying bat. For the example of the word &#x201c;bat&#x201d; when utilized as a verb for the bat that hits, a third identigen identifier <b>536</b>-<b>2</b> includes a type ID <b>542</b>-<b>2</b> associated with the actions <b>522</b>, an instance ID <b>540</b>-<b>3</b> associated with the third identigen identifier (e.g., unique for the bat that hits), and a meaning ID <b>538</b>-<b>3</b> associated with the bat that hits.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">With the word described by a type and possible associative meanings, a combination of full grammatical use of the word within the phrase etc., application of rules, and utilization of an ever-growing knowledge base that represents knowledge by linked entigens, the absolute meaning (e.g., entigen <b>520</b>) of the word is represented as a unique entigen. For example, a first entigen e<b>1</b> represents the absolute meaning of a baseball bat (e.g., a generic baseball bat not a particular baseball bat that belongs to anyone), a second entigen e<b>2</b> represents the absolute meaning of the flying bat (e.g., a generic flying bat not a particular flying bat), and a third entigen e<b>3</b> represents the absolute meaning of the verb bat (e.g., to hit).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">An embodiment of methods to ingest text to produce absolute meanings for storage in a knowledge base are discussed in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>F-H</figref>.

For example, a first step includes identifying words of an ingested phrase to produce tokenized words. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref>, a specific example of the first step includes the content ingestion module <b>300</b> comparing words of source content <b>310</b> to dictionary entries to produce formatted content <b>314</b> that includes identifiers of known words. Alternatively, when a comparison is unfavorable, the temporary identifier may be assigned to an unknown word.

As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref>, a specific example of the second step includes the element identification module <b>302</b> performing a look up of identigen identifiers, utilizing an element list <b>332</b> and in accordance with element rules <b>318</b>, of the one or more identigens associated with each tokenized word of the formatted content <b>314</b> to produce identified element information <b>340</b>.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">A unique identifier is associated with each of the potential object, the characteristic, and the action (OCA) associated with the tokenized word (e.g. sequential identigens). For instance, the element identification module <b>302</b> identifies a functional symbol for &#x201c;the&#x201d;, identifies a single identigen for &#x201c;black&#x201d;, identifies two identigens for &#x201c;bat&#x201d; (e.g., baseball bat and flying bat), identifies a single identigen for &#x201c;eats&#x201d;, and identifies a single identigen for &#x201c;fruit.&#x201d; When at least one tokenized word is associated with multiple identigens, two or more permutations of sequential combinations of identigens for each tokenized word result. For example, when &#x201c;bat&#x201d; is associated with two identigens, two permutations of sequential combinations of identigens result for the ingested phrase.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">A third step of the processing of the content to produce the knowledge includes, for each permutation of sequential combinations of identigens, generating a corresponding equation package (i.e., candidate interpretation), where the equation package includes a sequential linking of pairs of identigens (e.g., relationships), where each sequential linking pairs a preceding identigen to a next identigen, and where an equation element describes a relationship between paired identigens (OCAs) such as describes, acts on, is a, belongs to, did, did to, etc. Multiple OCAs occur for a common word when the word has multiple potential meanings (e.g., a baseball bat, a flying bat).</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref>, a specific example of the third step includes the interpretation module <b>304</b>, for each permutation of identigens of each tokenized word of the identified element information <b>340</b>, the interpretation module <b>304</b> generates, in accordance with interpretation rules <b>320</b> and a groupings list <b>334</b>, an equation package to include one or more of the identifiers of the tokenized words, a list of identifiers of the identigens of the equation package, a list of pairing identifiers for sequential pairs of identigens, and a quality metric associated with each sequential pair of identigens (e.g., likelihood of a proper interpretation). For instance, the interpretation module <b>304</b> produces a first equation package that includes a first identigen pairing of a black bat (e.g., flying bat with a higher quality metric level), the second pairing of bat eats (e.g., the flying bat eats, with a higher quality metric level), and a third pairing of eats fruit, and the interpretation module <b>304</b> produces a second equation package that includes a first pairing of a black bat (e.g., baseball bat, with a neutral quality metric level), the second pairing of bat eats (e.g., the baseball bat eats, with a lower quality metric level), and a third pairing of eats fruit.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">A fourth step of the processing of the content to produce the knowledge includes selecting a surviving equation package associated with a most favorable confidence level. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref>, a specific example of the fourth step includes the interpretation module <b>304</b> applying interpretation rules <b>320</b> (i.e., inference, pragmatic engine, utilizing the identifiers of the identigens to match against known valid combinations of identifiers of entigens) to reduce a number of permutations of the sequential combinations of identigens to produce interpreted information <b>344</b> that includes identification of at least one equation package as a surviving interpretation SI (e.g., higher quality metric level).</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Non-surviving equation packages are eliminated that compare unfavorably to pairing rules and/or are associated with an unfavorable quality metric levels to produce a non-surviving interpretation NSI <b>2</b> (e.g., lower quality metric level), where an overall quality metric level may be assigned to each equation package based on quality metric levels of each pairing, such that a higher quality metric level of an equation package indicates a higher probability of a most favorable interpretation. For instance, the interpretation module <b>304</b> eliminates the equation package that includes the second pairing indicating that the &#x201c;baseball bat eats&#x201d; which is inconsistent with a desired quality metric level of one or more of the groupings list <b>334</b> and the interpretation rules <b>320</b> and selects the equation package associated with the &#x201c;flying bat eats&#x201d; which is favorably consistent with the one or more of the quality metric levels of the groupings list <b>334</b> and the interpretation rules <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">A fifth step of the processing of the content to produce the knowledge utilizing the confidence level includes integrating knowledge of the surviving equation package into a knowledge base. For example, integrating at least a portion of the reduced OCA combinations into a graphical database to produce updated knowledge. As another example, the portion of the reduced OCA combinations may be translated into rows and columns entries when utilizing a rows and columns database rather than a graphical database. When utilizing the rows and columns approach for the knowledge base, subsequent access to the knowledge base may utilize structured query language (SQL) queries.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref>, a specific example of the fifth step includes the IEI control module <b>308</b> recovering fact base information <b>600</b> from SS memory <b>96</b> to identify a portion of the knowledge base for potential modification utilizing the OCAs of the surviving interpretation SI <b>1</b> (i.e., compare a pattern of relationships between the OCAs of the surviving interpretation SI <b>1</b> from the interpreted information <b>344</b> to relationships of OCAs of the portion of the knowledge base including potentially new quality metric levels).</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The fifth step further includes determining modifications (e.g., additions, subtractions, further clarifications required when information is complex, etc.) to the portion of the knowledge base based on the new quality metric levels.

The identifying includes performing a lookup of identifiers of the one or more identigens associated with each tokenized word, where he different identifiers associated with each of the potential object, the characteristic, and the action associated with the tokenized word.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">The method continues at step <b>652</b> where the processing module, for each permutation of sequential combinations of identigens, generates a plurality of equation elements to form a corresponding equation package, where each equation element describes a relationship between sequentially linked pairs of identigens, where each sequential linking pairs a preceding identigen to a next identigen. For example, for each permutation of identigens of each tokenized word, the processing module generates the equation package to include a plurality of equation elements, where each equation element describes the relationship (e.g., describes, acts on, is a, belongs to, did, did too, etc.) between sequentially adjacent identigens of a plurality of sequential combinations of identigens. Each equation element may be further associated with a quality metric to evaluate a favorability level of an interpretation in light of the sequence of identigens of the equation package.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">The method continues at step <b>653</b> where the processing module selects a surviving equation package associated with most favorable interpretation. For example, the processing module applies rules (i.e., inference, pragmatic engine, utilizing the identifiers of the identigens to match against known valid combinations of identifiers of entigens), to reduce the number of permutations of the sequential combinations of identigens to identify at least one equation package, where non-surviving equation packages are eliminated the compare unfavorably to pairing rules and/or are associated with an unfavorable quality metric levels to produce a non-surviving interpretation, where an overall quality metric level is assigned to each equation package based on quality metric levels of each pairing, such that a higher quality metric level indicates an equation package with a higher probability of favorability of correctness.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">The method continues at step <b>654</b> where the processing module integrates knowledge of the surviving equation package into a knowledge base. For example, the processing module integrates at least a portion of the reduced OCA combinations into a graphical database to produce updated knowledge. The integrating may include recovering fact base information from storage of the knowledge base to identify a portion of the knowledge base for potential modifications utilizing the OCAs of the surviving equation package (i.e., compare a pattern of relationships between the OCAs of the surviving equation package to relationships of the OCAs of the portion of the knowledge base including potentially new quality metric levels). The integrating further includes determining modifications (e.g., additions, subtractions, further clarifications required when complex information is presented, etc.) to produce the updated knowledge base that is based on fit of acceptable quality metric levels, and implementing the modifications to the portion of the fact base information to produce the updated fact base information for storage in the portion of the knowledge base.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">The method described above in conjunction with the processing module can alternatively be performed by other modules of the computing system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or by other devices.

For example, a sum of the scores of the confirming entigen groups <b>802</b> is multiplied by a confirming weighting factor to produce a confirming intermediate confidence level, the sum of the scores of the inconclusive entigen groups <b>804</b> is multiplied by an inconclusive weighting factor to produce an inconclusive intermediate confidence level, and a sum of the scores of the disconfirming entigen groups <b>806</b> is multiplied by a disconfirming weighting factor to produce a disconfirming intermediate conference level. The disconfirming intermediate confidence level is subtracted (e.g., to lower an overall conference level) from a sum of the confirming intermediate confidence level and the inconclusive intermediate confidence level to produce the overall confidence level.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0324">When the confidence level is greater than a confidence threshold level, a reliable interpretation <b>807</b> is produced based on the initial interpretation <b>801</b> (e.g., the same, modified based on some of the entigen groups) and confirmed entigen groups <b>808</b> are produced to include at least some of the entigen groups associated with the confirming entigen groups <b>802</b>.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0325"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>E</figref> is a logic diagram of an embodiment of a method for curating knowledge within a computing system.

The method includes step <b>812</b> where a processing module of one or more processing modules of one or more computing devices of the computing system generates generating a plurality of entigen groups from a plurality of phrases. The plurality of entigen groups represents a plurality of most likely meanings for the plurality of phrases. The plurality of phrases is of a related topic.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0326">The generating the plurality of entigen groups from the plurality of phrases includes a series of generating steps. As an example of processing a first phrase, a first generating step includes determining a set of identigens for each word of at least some words of a string of words of the first phrase of the plurality of phrases to produce a plurality of sets of identigens. Each identigen of the set of identigens is a different meaning of a corresponding word. Each phrase is processed in a similar manner.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0327">A second generating step includes interpreting, based on a knowledge database, the plurality of sets of identigens to produce the first entigen group. Each entigen of the first entigen group corresponds to a selected identigen of one of the plurality of sets of identigens that represents a most likely meaning of a corresponding word of the at least some of the words of the string of words. The first entigen group is a most likely meaning of the string of words. The knowledge database includes a plurality of records that link words having a connected meaning. For example, a graphical database is utilized to represent entigens and linkages between the entigens.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0328">The method continues at step <b>813</b> where the processing module determines an initial interpretation of the related topic based on the plurality of most likely meanings for the plurality of phrases. The determining the initial interpretation of the related topic based on the plurality of most likely meanings for the plurality of phrases includes utilizing one or more of a variety of interpretation approaches.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0329">A first interpretation approach includes identifying a most frequent most likely meaning of the plurality of most likely meanings for the plurality of phrases as the initial interpretation. For example, the processing module stratified is the entigen groups by their associated most likely meaning and identifies the most likely meaning that occurs more often than others.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0330">A second interpretation approach includes identifying an entigen group associated with the most frequent most likely meaning of the plurality of most likely meanings for the plurality of phrases as the initial interpretation. For example, the processing module identifies an entigen group that corresponds to the identified most frequent most likely meaning.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0331">The third interpretation approach includes identifying an entigen group associated with a most likely meaning that compares favorably to a search phrase as the initial interpretation. For example, the processing module obtains the search phrase (e.g., a buzzword, a string of words), produces a search phrase entigen group using the search phrase, and compares the search phrase entigen group to the plurality of entigen groups to identify an entigen group that compares favorably to the search phrase entigen group.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0332">The method continues at step <b>814</b> where the processing module generates a plurality of scores for the plurality of entigen groups based on the initial interpretation of the related topic and source information (e.g., source reliability, age of phrase) of the plurality of phrases. A first score of the plurality of scores is for a first entigen group of the plurality of entigen groups. The generating of the scores includes utilizing one or more of a variety of score generating approaches.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0333">A first score generating approach includes determining a reliability score for the first entigen group based on a reliability level of a first source associated with a first phrase that is utilized to generate the first entigen group. For example, the processing module obtains a historical record of the reliability level of the first source to produce the reliability score.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0334">A second score generating approach includes determining an aging score for the first entigen group based on an age of the first phrase. For example, the processing module obtains a freshness level (e.g., a timestamp of generation of the first phrase, a timestamp of receipt of the first phrase, a timeframe between generation of the phrase and a current time, a timeframe between receipt of the phrase and a current time) and calculates the aging score utilizing the freshness level, where an aging score for an older phrase is less favorable (e.g., less than) that an aging score for a newer phrase.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0335">A third score generating approach includes determining an alignment score for the first entigen group based on alignment with the initial interpretation. The alignment score for a confirming alignment is greater than (e.g., more favorable) an alignment score for a disconfirming alignment. For example, the processing module compares the most likely meaning of the first entigen group to the initial interpretation and indicates the confirming alignment when the comparison is favorable (e.g., the entigen group supports the initial interpretation). As another example, the processing module indicates disconfirming alignment when the comparison is unfavorable (e.g., the entigen group opposes the initial interpretation). As yet another example, the processing module indicates neutral alignment when the comparison is neither favorable or unfavorable (e.g., the entigen group does not support or oppose the initial interpretation).</p><p id="p-0337" num="0336">A fourth score generating approach includes determining the first score for the first entigen group based on a weighting approach and the reliability score for the first entigen group, the aging score for the first entigen group, and the alignment score for the first entigen group. The weighting approaches includes establishing higher weighting to the reliability score when the first source has a superior historical record of issuing true phrases and establishes higher weighting to age when information freshness matters more.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0337">The method continues at step <b>815</b> where the processing module interprets the plurality of scores in relation to the initial interpretation to determine a confidence level of the initial interpretation. The interpreting of the plurality of scores includes a series of interpreting steps.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0338">A first interpreting step includes identifying confirming entigen groups of the plurality of entigen groups favorably aligned with the initial interpretation. For example, the processing module counts the number of entigen groups that support the initial interpretation.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0339">A second interpreting step includes identifying disconfirming entigen groups of the plurality of entigen groups unfavorably aligned with the initial interpretation. For example, the processing module counts the number of entigen groups that oppose the initial interpretation.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0340">A third interpreting step includes determining the confidence level based on a weighting approach and scores for the confirming entigen groups and other scores for the disconfirming entigen groups. For example, the processing module multiplies each score by a weighting factors for confirming and disconfirming to produce an intermediate confidence level and aggregates the intermediate confidence levels to produce the confidence level.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0341">When the confidence level of the initial interpretation compares unfavorably to a confidence threshold, the method branches to step <b>818</b> (e.g., the processing module indicates the unfavorable comparison when the confidence level is less than the confidence threshold). When the conference level of the initial interpretation compares favorably to the confidence threshold, the method continues at step <b>816</b> (e.g., the processing module indicates the favorable comparison when the confidence level is greater than the confidence threshold).</p><p id="p-0343" num="0342">When the confidence level of the initial interpretation compares favorably to a confidence threshold, the method continues at step <b>816</b> where the processing module indicates that the initial interpretation is reliable (e.g., ready for further processing is curated knowledge). The method continues at step <b>817</b> where the processing module stores a representation of the initial interpretation in a knowledge database as curated knowledge. For example, the processing module stores and the initial interpretation entigen group as the curated knowledge in the knowledge database. As another example, the processing module stores at least some of the plurality of entigen groups in the knowledge database as further curated knowledge (e.g., entigen groups that support the initial interpretation).</p><p id="p-0344" num="0343">When the confidence level of the initial interpretation compares unfavorably to the confidence threshold, the method continues at step <b>818</b> where the processing module facilitates one or more further steps to gather and process more uncurated knowledge to lead to producing curated knowledge by looping back to step <b>812</b>.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0344">A first further step includes generating an updated plurality of entigen groups from an updated plurality of phrases. The updated plurality of entigen groups represents a plurality of most likely meanings for the updated plurality of phrases. The updated plurality of phrases is of the related topic (e.g., the same topic when trying to curate knowledge around the related topic, alternatively a different related topic when several loops have occurred without generating curated knowledge).</p><p id="p-0346" num="0345">A second further step includes determining an updated initial interpretation of the related topic based on the plurality of most likely meanings for the updated plurality of phrases. For instance, the processing module modifies the initial interpretation to produce the updated initial interpretation based on more insights from the updated plurality of entigen groups.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0346">A third further step includes generating an updated plurality of scores for the updated plurality of entigen groups based on the updated initial interpretation of the related topic and updated source information (e.g., new sources, new timing) of the updated plurality of phrases. A first score of the updated plurality of scores is for a first entigen group of the updated plurality of entigen groups. For example, the processing module re-scores previously scored entigen groups and a science a score to new entigen groups resulting from the further gathering of more phrases.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0347">A fourth further step includes interpreting the updated plurality of scores in relation to the updated initial interpretation to determine an updated confidence level of the updated initial interpretation. For example, the processing module recalculates the confidence level based on all of the newly collected knowledge (e.g., the updated plurality of entigen groups etc.)</p><p id="p-0349" num="0348">A fifth further step includes, when the updated confidence level of the updated initial interpretation compares favorably to the confidence threshold, the processing module indicates that the updated initial interpretation is reliable. For example, the processing module utilizes the same confidence threshold with the new curated knowledge to determine whether the comparison is favorable. As another example, the processing module utilizes an updated confidence threshold (e.g., a lower threshold level) to determine whether the updated initial interpretation is reliable.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0349">The method described above in conjunction with the processing module can alternatively be performed by other modules of the computing system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or by other devices.
