In the random access procedure, a first terminal device needs to send a third message (Msg3) to the network device. Based on current specifications, a bandwidth of a resource for carrying the Msg3 may reach a bandwidth of an initial bandwidth part (BWP). The bandwidth of the initial BWP is configured based on a system information block (SIB) (for example, a SIB1), and is generally configured to be large, for example, 20 megabits per second (Mbps).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to some first terminal devices with proper functions, there are some terminal devices with a limited capability, for example, New Radio (NR) light terminal devices or reduced capability (REDCAP) devices. An NR light terminal device may have a limited bandwidth, and may, for example, support a maximum bandwidth of 5 Mbps or 10 Mbps. In this case, a channel bandwidth of the terminal device may be less than the bandwidth of the initial BWP. If the bandwidth of the resource for carrying the Msg3 is greater than the channel bandwidth of the terminal device, the terminal device cannot send the Msg3 to the network device. Consequently, the terminal device cannot complete random access.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this disclosure provide a communication method and apparatus, to improve a random access success rate of a first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, a first communication method is provided. The method includes determining a first resource, and sending a first random access message on the first resource. A bandwidth of the first resource is less than or equal to a channel bandwidth of a first terminal device. The channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is less than or equal to a channel bandwidth of a second terminal device. The channel bandwidth of the second terminal device is greater than or equal to a first bandwidth. The first bandwidth is configured by a network device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method may be performed by a first communication apparatus. The first communication apparatus may be a communication device, or may be a communication apparatus, for example, a chip, that can support the communication device in implementing a function required in the method. For example, the first communication apparatus is a terminal device, a chip that is disposed in the terminal device and that functions as the terminal device, or another component configured to implement the function of the terminal device. The following description process uses an example in which the first communication apparatus is the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this embodiment of this disclosure, when sending the first random access message, the first terminal device may determine a resource whose bandwidth is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device as the first resource. For example, the first random access message is a Msg3 or a message A (MsgA). If the bandwidth of the first resource is supported by the first terminal device, the first terminal device can properly send the Msg3 or the MsgA. According to the technical solution provided in this embodiment of this disclosure, even a terminal device with a limited capability can send the Msg3 or the MsgA. Therefore, the technical solution provided in this embodiment of this disclosure can improve a random access success rate of the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an optional implementation, the first resource is a part of a second resource. The second resource is used by the second terminal device to send a first random access message. A bandwidth of the second resource is less than or equal to the first bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The second resource may include one or more resources. That the bandwidth of the second resource is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device is that a bandwidth of each of the one or more resources is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device. For example, there are five resources that can be used by a terminal device to send a first random access message, and the five resources belong to the second resource. If a bandwidth of each of two of the five resources is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, the first terminal device may select one of the two resources as the first resource. The second terminal device may select the second resource to send the first random access message, or may select the first resource to send the first random access message. For example, the second terminal device may select one of the five resources to send the first random access message, or may select one of the two resources to send the first random access message. This is equivalent to that although a resource that can be selected by the first terminal device is specified, resource selection of the second terminal device is not affected, and optional resources for the second terminal device are not reduced. This can improve resource usage.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an optional implementation, the method further includes sending a random access request message on a third resource, where the third resource is a part of a fourth resource, and the fourth resource is used by the second terminal device to send a random access request message, and receiving a random access response message, where the random access response message is used for scheduling the first resource.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">If a random access procedure is a 4-step random access channel (RACH) procedure, the first random access message may be a Msg3. Before sending the Msg3 to the network device, the first terminal device may send the random access request message to the network device on the third resource, and the network device receives the random access request message from the first terminal device on the third resource. For example, the random access request message is a Msg1, namely, a preamble. In addition, if the Msg3 is initially transmitted, after receiving the random access request message, the network device may send the random access response message to the first terminal device, and the first terminal device receives the random access response message from the network device. The random access response message may be used for scheduling the first resource. In this way, the first terminal device may determine the first resource after receiving the random access response message. For example, the random access response message is a Msg2, namely, a random access response (RAR) message. The third resource may be a part of a fourth resource. The fourth resource may be used by the second terminal device to send a Msg1. A bandwidth of the fourth resource may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device (which may be an uplink channel bandwidth of the second terminal device herein). In addition, the bandwidth of the fourth resource may also be less than or equal to the bandwidth of the initial BWP (which may be the bandwidth of the initial uplink BWP herein).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an optional implementation, the third resource is a random access resource corresponding to a first random access occasion, the first random access occasion is one of N random access occasions, a bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the N random access occasions and that is used for sending a first random access message is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, the third resource is one of M random access resources, and a bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the M random access resources and that is used for sending a first random access message is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, or the third resource is one of K random access resources, the K random access resources are corresponding to H random access occasions, the H random access occasions belong to P random access occasions, and a bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the K random access resources and that is used for sending a first random access message is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">N, M, K, H, and P are all integers greater than or equal to 1, and H is less than or equal to P.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this embodiment of this disclosure, for example, in the 4-step RACH procedure, corresponding resources for sending the random access request message may be preset (for example, the resources that are preset are referred to as preset resources). In addition, it is specified that a bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the preset resources and that is used for sending the first random access message is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device (the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device may include an uplink channel bandwidth and a downlink channel bandwidth, and mainly refers to the uplink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device herein). In other words, the bandwidth of the resource that is corresponding to each of the preset resources and that is used for sending the first random access message (for example, a Msg3) is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. After receiving the random access request message from the first terminal device, the network device determines that a random access resource for sending the random access request message belongs to the preset resources. In this case, the network device may select a resource whose bandwidth is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device when allocating, to the first terminal device, the resource for sending the first random access message. The resource for sending the random access request message is preset, so that the resource that is scheduled by the network device and that is used for sending the first random access message can meet a capability requirement of the first terminal device, to improve a success rate of sending the first random access message by the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an optional implementation, the method further includes receiving a first downlink message from the network device. The first downlink message includes specific configuration information of the first terminal device. The specific configuration information is used for configuring a specific parameter.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">After accessing the network device, the first terminal device needs to perform communication under coverage of the network device. In this case, the network device further needs to configure corresponding specific parameters for the first terminal device, so that the first terminal device can perform communication under the coverage of the network device based on the specific parameters. For example, the network device may send, to the first terminal device, the first downlink message that includes the specific configuration information for configuring the specific parameter, so that the first terminal device can obtain the specific configuration information.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an optional implementation, the specific configuration information includes configuration information of a specific BWP. A bandwidth of the specific BWP is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The specific configuration information may include the configuration information of the specific BWP. For example, the bandwidth of the specific BWP allocated by the network device to the first terminal device may be less than or equal to the bandwidth of the first terminal device, so that the bandwidth of the specific BWP can meet the capability requirement of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an optional implementation, the third resource is used for determining the specific parameter, and the third resource is used for sending the random access request message, the first resource is used for determining the specific parameter, the first random access message includes first information, and the first information is used for determining the specific parameter, or the method further includes sending a first uplink message to the network device, where the first uplink message includes first information, and the first information is used for determining the specific parameter.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first information includes type information of the first terminal device and/or type information of a service, and the service is a service supported by the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, in the 4-step RACH procedure, it is specified in advance that specific parameters corresponding to the preset resources are limited configuration parameters. After receiving the random access request message, the network device determines that the third resource for sending the random access request message belongs to the preset resources. In this case, the specific parameter allocated by the network device to the first terminal device may be the limited configuration parameter. For example, the bandwidth of the specific BWP allocated to the first terminal device may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In this case, it may be considered that the network device determines the specific parameter of the first terminal device based on the third resource. Alternatively, for example, in a 2-step RACH procedure, it is specified in advance that specific parameters corresponding to G resources preconfigured by the network device are limited configuration parameters. After receiving the first random access message, the network device determines that the first resource for sending the first random access message belongs to the G resources. In this case, the specific parameter allocated by the network device to the first terminal device may be the limited configuration parameter. For example, the bandwidth of the specific BWP allocated to the first terminal device may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In this case, it may be considered that the network device determines the specific parameter of the first terminal device based on the first resource. In the foregoing two cases, the first terminal device does not need to additionally send information to the network device, and the network device may configure the specific parameter for the first terminal device based on the corresponding resource. This helps reduce signaling overheads.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Alternatively, if the first random access message may include the first information, the network device may configure the specific parameter for the first terminal device based on the first information. For example, the first information indicates that the first terminal device is a bandwidth-limited first terminal device. In this case, the specific parameter configured by the network device for the first terminal device based on the first information may be the limited configuration parameter. For example, the bandwidth of the specific BWP may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. Alternatively, the first terminal device sends the first information to the network device based on another message (the first uplink message) instead of the first random access message. In this case, the network device may also configure the specific parameter for the first terminal device based on the first information. In the foregoing two cases, the first terminal device may send the first information to the network device, and the network device may configure the specific parameter for the first terminal device based on the first information, so that the specific parameter configured by the network device can better meet the capability requirement of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an optional implementation, the third resource is a random access resource whose subcarrier spacing is adjusted. A bandwidth of the third resource existing before the subcarrier spacing is adjusted is greater than the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">To enable the bandwidth-limited terminal device to support more random access resources and improve a random access success rate of the bandwidth-limited terminal device, subcarrier spacings of random access resources on some random access occasions may be adjusted, so that the adjusted random access resources can meet a requirement of the bandwidth-limited terminal device. For example, the third resource may be a random access resource whose subcarrier spacing is not adjusted, or may be a random access resource whose subcarrier spacing is adjusted. If the third resource is a random access resource whose subcarrier spacing is adjusted, before the subcarrier spacing of the third resource is adjusted, the bandwidth of the third resource may be greater than the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In other words, before the subcarrier spacing is adjusted, the bandwidth-limited terminal device may not support the third resource, but after the subcarrier spacing is adjusted, the bandwidth-limited terminal device can support the third resource. The subcarrier spacing is adjusted, so that more resource options are provided for the bandwidth-limited terminal device to send the random access request message, to expand a resource selection range of the bandwidth-limited terminal device and also improve a resource selection success rate.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an optional implementation, the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device includes the uplink channel bandwidth and the downlink channel bandwidth. The method further includes determining that the uplink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is greater than or equal to a third bandwidth, and/or that the downlink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is greater than or equal to a second bandwidth, where the third bandwidth is a bandwidth for sending a random access request message in a first cell covered by the network device, and the second bandwidth is a bandwidth of a control resource set 0, and determining that the first terminal device can access the first cell.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A bandwidth of the random access resource used by the first terminal device to send the random access request message is the third bandwidth. In this case, provided that the uplink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is greater than or equal to the third bandwidth, the first terminal device can send the random access request message. A bandwidth of a resource used by the first terminal device to receive a random access response message is the bandwidth of a control resource set 0 (CORESET #0). Therefore, provided that the downlink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is greater than or equal to the second bandwidth, the first terminal device can receive the random access response message. If the first terminal device can send a random access request message in a cell and/or can receive a random access response message in the cell, this means that the first terminal device can access the cell. Therefore, if the first terminal device determines that the uplink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is greater than or equal to the third bandwidth, and/or determines that the downlink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is greater than or equal to the second bandwidth, it may be determined that the first terminal device can access the first cell. In this manner, the first terminal device does not need to perform determining based on the bandwidth of the initial BWP. This improves a cell access success rate of the bandwidth-limited terminal device. In addition, the bandwidth-limited terminal device is less limited when selecting a cell. Therefore, more terminal devices can access a cell.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an optional implementation, the method further includes receiving a system message in the first cell, and determining the second bandwidth and the third bandwidth based on the system message.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The second bandwidth and the third bandwidth may be configured based on the system message, or may be configured based on another message.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an optional implementation, the bandwidth of the control resource set 0 is less than or equal to the first bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the first bandwidth is the bandwidth of the initial BWP. The bandwidth of the control resource set 0 may be generally less than or equal to the bandwidth of the initial BWP.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to a second aspect, a second communication method is provided. The method includes receiving a first random access message from a first terminal device on a first resource, where a bandwidth of the first resource is less than or equal to a channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is less than or equal to a channel bandwidth of a second terminal device, the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device is greater than or equal to a first bandwidth, and the first bandwidth is configured by a network device, and sending a first downlink message to the first terminal device, where the first downlink message includes specific configuration information, and the specific configuration information is used for configuring a specific parameter.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The method may be performed by a second communication apparatus. The second communication apparatus may be a communication device, or may be a communication apparatus, for example, a chip, that can support the communication device in implementing a function required in the method. For example, the second communication apparatus is a network device, a chip that is disposed in the network device and that functions as the network device, or another component configured to implement the function of the network device.

In addition, it is specified that a bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the preset resources and that is used for sending the first random access message is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device (the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device may include an uplink channel bandwidth and a downlink channel bandwidth, and mainly refers to the uplink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device herein). In other words, if the bandwidth of the resource that is corresponding to each of the preset resources and that is used for sending the first random access message (for example, the Msg3) is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, the first configuration information may be used for configuring the preset resources. If the corresponding preset resources are preset, after receiving the random access request message from the first terminal device, the network device determines that a random access resource for sending the random access request message belongs to the preset resources. In this case, the network device may select a resource whose bandwidth is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device when allocating, to the first terminal device, the resource for sending the first random access message. In this manner, the network device can allocate, to a bandwidth-limited terminal device, a resource that meets a capability requirement of the terminal device, to improve a success rate of sending the first random access message by the terminal device and correspondingly improve a random access success rate of the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an optional implementation, the method further includes sending second configuration information to the first terminal device, where the second configuration information is used for configuring a second resource, the second resource is used by the second terminal device to send a first random access message, a bandwidth of the second resource is less than or equal to the first bandwidth, and the first resource is a part of the second resource.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the network device may configure G resources for the first terminal device in advance. For example, the G resources belong to the second resource. A bandwidth of each of the G resources is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, and G is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The first terminal device may select one of the G resources as the first resource. In this manner, the network device may preconfigure, for the first terminal device, resources that meet a capability requirement of the first terminal device. The first terminal device only needs to select a resource from the preconfigured resources to send the first random access message (for example, a MsgA), to reduce a delay in sending the first random access message by the first terminal device. In addition, because the preconfigured resources meet the capability requirement of the first terminal device, a success rate of sending the first random access message by the first terminal device can also be improved.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For technical effects brought by the second aspect or the corresponding implementations, refer to the descriptions of the technical effects brought by the first aspect or the corresponding implementations.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to a third aspect, a third communication method is provided. The method includes determining that an uplink channel bandwidth of a terminal device is greater than or equal to a third bandwidth, and/or that a downlink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to a second bandwidth, where the third bandwidth is a bandwidth for sending a random access request message in a first cell, and the second bandwidth is a bandwidth of a control resource set 0, and determining that the terminal device can access the first cell.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The method may be performed by a third communication apparatus. The third communication apparatus may be a communication device, or may be a communication apparatus, for example, a chip, that can support the communication device in implementing a function required in the method. For example, the third communication apparatus is a terminal device, a chip that is disposed in the terminal device and that functions as the terminal device, or another component configured to implement the function of the terminal device. The following description process uses an example in which the third communication apparatus is the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A bandwidth of the random access resource used by the terminal device to send the random access request message is the third bandwidth. In this case, provided that the uplink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the third bandwidth, the terminal device can send the random access request message. A bandwidth of a resource used by the terminal device to receive a random access response message is the bandwidth of the CORESET #0. Therefore, provided that the downlink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the second bandwidth, the terminal device can receive the random access response message. If the terminal device can send a random access request message in a cell and/or can receive a random access response message in the cell, this means that the terminal device can access the cell. Therefore, if the terminal device determines that the uplink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the third bandwidth, and/or determines that the downlink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the second bandwidth, it may be determined that the terminal device can access the first cell. The third bandwidth is generally less than a bandwidth of an initial uplink BWP, and the second bandwidth is generally less than a bandwidth of an initial downlink BWP. Therefore, such specifications in this embodiment of this disclosure improve a cell access success rate of a bandwidth-limited terminal device. In addition, the bandwidth-limited terminal device is less limited when selecting a cell. Therefore, more terminal devices can access a cell.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an optional implementation, the method further includes receiving a system message in the first cell, and determining the third bandwidth and the second bandwidth based on the system message.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The system message may be used for configuring the second bandwidth, or configuring the third bandwidth, or configuring the second bandwidth and the third bandwidth.

For example, the terminal device includes an information sensing device such as a barcode, radio frequency identification (RFID), a sensor, a Global Positioning System (GPS), or a laser scanner.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">By way of example, and not limitation, in embodiments of this disclosure, the terminal device may alternatively be a wearable device. The wearable device may be a wearable intelligent device, an intelligent wearable device, or the like, and is a general term of wearable devices that are intelligently designed and developed for daily wear by using a wearable technology, for example, glasses, gloves, watches, clothes, and shoes. The wearable device is a portable device that is directly worn on a body or integrated into clothes or an accessory of a user. The wearable device is not only a hardware device, but also implements a powerful function through software support, data exchange, and cloud interaction. In a broad sense, wearable intelligent devices include full-featured and large-sized devices that can implement all or a part of functions without depending on smartphones, for example, smart watches or smart glasses, and include devices that focus on only one type of application function and need to collaboratively work with other devices such as smartphones, for example, various smart bands, smart helmets, or smart jewelry for monitoring physical signs.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">If the various terminal devices described above are located in a vehicle (for example, placed in the vehicle or installed in the vehicle), the terminal devices may be all considered as vehicle-mounted terminal devices. For example, the vehicle-mounted terminal device is also referred to as an on-board unit (OBU).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In embodiments of this disclosure, the terminal device may further include a relay. Alternatively, it may be understood that any device that can perform data communication with a base station may be considered as a terminal device.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In embodiments of this disclosure, an apparatus functioning as a terminal device may be a terminal device, or may be an apparatus, for example, a chip system, that can support the terminal device in implementing the function. The apparatus may be installed in the terminal device. In this embodiment of this disclosure, the chip system may include a chip, or may include a chip and another discrete component. In the technical solutions provided in embodiments of this disclosure, an example in which an apparatus functioning as a terminal is a terminal device is used for describing the technical solutions provided in embodiments of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">(2) Network device: A network device includes, for example, an access network (AN) device such as a base station (for example, an access point), and may be a device that is in an access network and that communicates with a wireless terminal device over an air interface through one or more cells. Alternatively, the network device is, for example, a road side unit (RSU) in a V2X technology. The base station may be configured to mutually convert a received over-the-air frame and an Internet Protocol (IP) packet, and serve as a router between the terminal device and a remaining part of the access network, where the remaining part of the access network may include an IP network. The RSU may be a fixed infrastructure entity supporting a V2X application, and may exchange a message with another entity supporting the V2X application. The network device may further coordinate attribute management of the air interface. For example, the network device may include an evolved NodeB (eNB or e-NodeB) in a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) system or a LTE-advanced (LTE-A) system, may include a next-generation node B (gNB) in a 5<sup>th </sup>generation (5G) mobile communication technology NR system (or an NR system), or may include a centralized unit (CU) and a distributed unit (DU) in a cloud RAN system. This is not limited in this embodiment of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The network device may further include a core network device, and the core network device includes, for example, an access and mobility management function (AMF). Embodiments of this disclosure do not relate to a core network. Therefore, unless otherwise specified in the following, the network device refers to an access network device.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In embodiments of this disclosure, an apparatus functioning as a network device may be a network device, or may be an apparatus, for example, a chip system, that can support the network device in implementing the function. The apparatus may be installed in the network device. In the technical solutions provided in embodiments of this disclosure, an example in which an apparatus functioning as a network device is a network device is used for describing the technical solutions provided in embodiments of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">(3) Terms &#x201c;system&#x201d; and &#x201c;network&#x201d; may be used interchangeably in embodiments of this disclosure. &#x201c;At least one&#x201d; means one or more, and &#x201c;a plurality of&#x201d; means two or more. The term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; describes an association relationship for describing associated objects and represents that three relationships may exist. For example, A and/or B may represent the following three cases: only A exists, both A and B exist, and only B exists. A and B each may be singular or plural. The character &#x201c;/&#x201d; generally represents an &#x201c;or&#x201d; relationship between associated objects. At least one of the following items (pieces) or a similar expression thereof refers to any combination of these items, including any combination of singular items (pieces) or plural items (pieces). For example, at least one item (piece) of a, b, or c may represent: a, b, c, a and b, a and c, b and c, or a, b, and c, where a, b, and c may be singular or plural.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In addition, unless otherwise stated, in embodiments of this disclosure, ordinal numbers such as &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; are intended to distinguish between a plurality of objects, but are not intended to limit sizes, content, orders, time sequences, priorities, importance, or the like of the plurality of objects. For example, a first resource and a second resource are merely used for distinguishing between different resources, but do not indicate different sizes, priorities, importance degrees, or the like of the two resources.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The foregoing describes concepts of some terms in embodiments of this disclosure. The following describes technical features in embodiments of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">A terminal device may implement uplink synchronization with a network device in a random access procedure. The random access procedure includes a contention-based random access procedure and a non-contention-based random access procedure. The contention-based random access procedure is completed in four steps: 1. A terminal device sends a random access request to a network device. The random access request may also be referred to as a first message (Msg1), and includes a random access preamble. 2. The network device sends an RAR message to the terminal device. The RAR message may also be referred to as a second message (Msg2). 3. After receiving the RAR message, the terminal device transmits a message based on scheduling information carried in the RAR message. The message is referred to as a Msg3. 4. The network device sends contention resolution information to the terminal device. A message carrying the contention resolution information is referred to as a fourth message (Msg4). The RAR message may include a random access preamble (RAP) identifier (ID). When the RAP ID is matched with (or the same as) a preamble ID selected by the terminal device, the terminal device considers that the RAR message is an RAR message in response to the preamble sent by the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The contention-based 4-step random access procedure described above requires a large quantity of interaction procedures and a long delay, and therefore cannot be well applied to a scenario with a high requirement for a delay. Therefore, the contention-based 2-step random access procedure is introduced: 1. The terminal device sends a MsgA to the network device. The MsgA may also be referred to as a first message. The MsgA includes a preamble and possible uplink data (similar to the Msg1 and the Msg3 in the 4-step random access procedure). The uplink data is carried on a data channel (for example, a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH)). 2. The terminal device receives a message B (MsgB) from the network device. The MsgB may also be referred to as a second message (similar to the Msg2 and the Msg4 in the 4-step random access procedure). Therefore, contention resolution is completed, uplink synchronization is performed, and a cell-radio network temporary identifier (C-RNTI) is obtained. It is clear that in the 2-step random access procedure, because there are few interaction steps, a network access delay may be reduced, to help meet the scenario with a high requirement for a delay.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">To complete random access, there is a specific requirement on a bandwidth of the terminal device. However, in addition to some terminal devices with proper functions, there are some terminal devices with a limited capability, for example, an NR light terminal device (REDCAP), an enhanced machine type communication (eMTC) terminal device, or a narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) terminal device. Such a terminal device may have a limited bandwidth. For example, the NR light terminal device may support a maximum bandwidth of 5 Mbps, 10 Mbps, or 20 Mbps. If such a terminal device is limited based on a bandwidth requirement for an ordinary terminal device, random access may fail.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Therefore, in eMTC or NB-IoT, a specific RACH resource is reserved for the eMTC terminal device and the NB-IoT terminal device. The eMTC terminal device or the NB-IoT terminal device may select the reserved RACH resource to send a Msg1 to the network device. The network device may determine, based on the RACH resource used by the terminal device initiating random access, whether the terminal device is the eMTC terminal device or the NB-IoT terminal device. If the network device determines that the terminal device is the eMTC terminal device or the NB-IoT terminal device, the network device schedules, starting from an RAR message, the terminal device to use a narrow band control channel or a narrow band data channel.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">A problem of this method is that the specific RACH resource needs to be reserved, and the terminal device does not share a RACH resource with the ordinary terminal device. This may cause a waste of resources to some extent. For example, in some cases, if a quantity of eMTC terminal devices or NB-IoT terminal devices that initiate random access is small, reserved RACH resources are idle, but RACH resources for ordinary terminal devices may be insufficient.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The NR light terminal device can properly receive a synchronization signal and a physical broadcast channel block (SSB). Because the SSB includes a master information block (MIB), the NR light terminal device can properly receive the MIB. The MIB includes configuration information of a control channel for a SIB1 and configuration information of a CORESET #0. The NR light terminal device monitors, based on the configuration information of the CORESET #0, the control channel for scheduling the SIB1, to receive the SIB1. The SIB1 includes downlink configuration information and uplink configuration information. The uplink configuration information includes configuration information of a RACH. A bandwidth of the RACH resource may be determined according to Table 1.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>L<sub>RA</sub></entry><entry>&#x394;&#x192;<sup>RA</sup></entry><entry>&#x394;&#x192;</entry><entry>N<sup>RA</sup><sub>RB</sub></entry><entry><o ostyle="single">k</o></entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>839</entry><entry>&#x2003;1.25</entry><entry>&#x2002;15</entry><entry>&#x2002;6</entry><entry>&#x2003;7</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>839</entry><entry>&#x2003;1.25</entry><entry>&#x2002;30</entry><entry>&#x2002;3</entry><entry>&#x2003;1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>839</entry><entry>&#x2003;1.25</entry><entry>&#x2002;60</entry><entry>&#x2002;2</entry><entry>133</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>839</entry><entry>&#x2003;5</entry><entry>&#x2002;15</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>&#x2002;12</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>839</entry><entry>&#x2003;5</entry><entry>&#x2002;30</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>&#x2002;10</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>839</entry><entry>&#x2003;5</entry><entry>&#x2002;60</entry><entry>&#x2002;6</entry><entry>&#x2003;7</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>139</entry><entry>&#x2002;15</entry><entry>&#x2002;15</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>139</entry><entry>&#x2002;15</entry><entry>&#x2002;30</entry><entry>&#x2002;6</entry><entry>&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>139</entry><entry>&#x2002;15</entry><entry>&#x2002;60</entry><entry>&#x2002;3</entry><entry>&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>139</entry><entry>&#x2002;30</entry><entry>&#x2002;15</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>139</entry><entry>&#x2002;30</entry><entry>&#x2002;30</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>139</entry><entry>&#x2002;30</entry><entry>&#x2002;60</entry><entry>&#x2002;6</entry><entry>&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>139</entry><entry>&#x2002;60</entry><entry>&#x2002;60</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>139</entry><entry>&#x2002;60</entry><entry>120</entry><entry>&#x2002;6</entry><entry>&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>139</entry><entry>120</entry><entry>&#x2002;60</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>139</entry><entry>120</entry><entry>120</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>&#x2003;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">In Table 1, L<sub>RA </sub>is a sequence length of a preamble. &#x394;f<sup>RA </sup>is a subcarrier spacing of a RACH resource. &#x394;f is a subcarrier spacing of a PUSCH.

For example, in the second row of Table 1, a product of the first column and the second column is 839&#xd7;1.25=1048.75 in a unit of K, and is converted into 1.02 M. If the bandwidth of the NR light terminal device is 5 MVbps, 1.02 M is less than 5 MVbps, so that a configuration shown in the second row in Table 1 can be supported by the NR light terminal device. It can be learned based on this calculation manner that, if the bandwidth of the NR light terminal device is 5 MVbps, the NR light terminal device can support configurations from the second row to the thirteenth row in Table 1. If the bandwidth of the NR light terminal device is 10 MVbps, the NR light terminal device can support configurations from the second row to the fifteenth row in Table 1. If the bandwidth of the NR light terminal device is 20 MVbps, the NR light terminal device can support configurations from the second row to the seventeenth row in Table 1, namely, all the configurations in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">For configurations of processes such as sending and receiving of each message and a corresponding control channel, receiving of a system message, or receiving of a paging message in a random access procedure, a current protocol specifies that when the system message is received, a configuration corresponding to the CORESET #0 is used for the control channel, and a bandwidth of the data channel carrying the SIB1 is also limited within a bandwidth range of the CORESET #0.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">In the random access procedure, a bandwidth of a data channel for a downlink RAR message and a contention resolution message Msg4 is also limited within the bandwidth range of the CORESET #0. Therefore, for the NR light UE, provided that the NR light terminal device can monitor the CORESET #0, the NR light terminal device can receive the RAR and the Msg4.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">However, it can be learned from the foregoing description of the random access procedure that, in the random access procedure, the terminal device further needs to send a Msg3 to the network device. Based on current specifications, a bandwidth of a resource for sending the Msg3 may reach a bandwidth of an initial uplink BWP. The bandwidth of the initial uplink BWP is configured based on the system message, and is generally configured to be large. For the NR light terminal device, an uplink bandwidth may be less than the bandwidth of the initial uplink BWP. If a resource is allocated to the Msg3 within the entire bandwidth of the initial uplink BWP, for example, up to the bandwidth of the initial uplink BWP, a bandwidth of the resource for sending the Msg3 may be greater than the bandwidth of the NR light terminal device. In this case, the NR light terminal device cannot send the Msg3 to the network device. Consequently, the NR light terminal device cannot complete random access.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145">In view of this, the technical solutions in embodiments of this disclosure are provided. In this embodiment of this disclosure, when sending a first random access message, a first terminal device may determine a resource whose bandwidth is less than or equal to a channel bandwidth of the first terminal device as a first resource. For example, the first random access message is a Msg3 or a MsgA. If the bandwidth of the first resource is supported by the first terminal device, the first terminal device can properly send the Msg3 or the MsgA. According to the technical solution provided in this embodiment of this disclosure, even a terminal device with a limited capability can send the Msg3 or the MsgA. Therefore, the technical solution provided in this embodiment of this disclosure can improve a random access success rate of the terminal device. In addition, even a terminal device with an unlimited capability or the ordinary terminal device can select the first resource to send the first random access message. In other words, these resources are not reserved only for a bandwidth-limited terminal device, and a bandwidth-unlimited terminal device can also use these resources. This manner can improve resource usage and reduce a waste of resources.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">The technical solutions provided in embodiments of this disclosure may be applied to a 4<sup>th </sup>generation (4G) mobile communication technology system, for example, an LTE system, or may be applied to a 5G system, for example, an NR system, or may be applied to a next-generation mobile communication system or another similar communication system.

A bandwidth of the first resource is less than or equal to a channel bandwidth of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">For example, the first terminal device is a bandwidth-limited terminal device. In this embodiment of this disclosure, the limited bandwidth of the first terminal device means that the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is less than or equal to a channel bandwidth of the second terminal device. The second terminal device is an ordinary terminal device, for example, an NR terminal device. The channel bandwidth of the second terminal device may be greater than or equal to a first bandwidth, and the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device may also be less than or equal to a carrier bandwidth. The carrier bandwidth may be a bandwidth of a carrier for the first terminal device and the second terminal device. Alternatively, in this embodiment of this disclosure, the limited bandwidth of the first terminal device means that the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is less than the first bandwidth. The first bandwidth may be configured by the network device. For example, the first bandwidth is a bandwidth of an initial BWP configured by the network device. Certainly, in practice, because the first bandwidth is configured by the network device, the first bandwidth configured by the network device may be greater than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, or may be less than the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. For example, the first terminal device is an NR light terminal device. Certainly, the first terminal device may alternatively be another type of bandwidth-limited terminal device, for example, an eMTC terminal device or an NB-IoT terminal device.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">The first resource is used for sending a first random access message in a random access procedure. It should be noted that the first random access message does not refer to a Msg1. If the random access procedure is a 4-step RACH procedure, the first random access message may be a Msg3, or if the random access procedure is a 2-step RACH procedure, the first random access message may be a MsgA.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">It can be learned from the foregoing analysis that, if the first terminal device can camp on a cell, a bandwidth risk point of the first terminal device during random access is that a bandwidth of a resource for sending the Msg3 is based on the bandwidth of the initial BWP, and the bandwidth of the resource for sending the Msg3 may reach the bandwidth of the initial BWP. The initial BWP may include an initial uplink BWP and an initial downlink BWP. Both a bandwidth of the initial uplink BWP and a bandwidth of the initial downlink BWP are configured by the network device based on a SIB1. The resource for sending the Msg3 is an uplink resource. Therefore, that the bandwidth of the resource for sending the Msg3 reaches the bandwidth of the initial BWP may be that the bandwidth of the resource for sending the Msg3 is allocated within an entire bandwidth range of the initial uplink BWP, for example, fully occupies the entire initial uplink BWP. If the Msg3 is initially transmitted, the resource for sending the Msg3 may be allocated by the network device based on an RAR message, or if the Msg3 is retransmitted, the resource for sending the Msg3 may be allocated by the network device through a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) scrambled by using a temporary C-RNTI. However, if the first terminal device is a bandwidth-limited terminal device, such a bandwidth may be required to be greater than a capability of the first terminal device, causing a random access failure.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157">Therefore, in this embodiment of this disclosure, a bandwidth of the first resource that is used for sending the first random access message and that is determined by the first terminal device is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. The channel bandwidth of the first terminal device may include an uplink channel bandwidth and a downlink channel bandwidth. That the bandwidth of the first resource is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device may be that the bandwidth of the first resource is less than or equal to the uplink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In this way, the bandwidth of the first resource can be supported by the first terminal device, to improve a success rate of sending the first random access message by the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">If the random access procedure is a 2-step RACH procedure and the first random access message is a MsgA, the first resource may be configured by the network device. For example, before S<b>201</b>, S<b>202</b> may be further performed. The network device sends second configuration information to the first terminal device, and the first terminal device receives the second configuration information from the network device. The second configuration information may be used for configuring G resources. A bandwidth of each of the G resources is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, and G is an integer greater than or equal to 1. S<b>202</b> is an optional step, and is not necessarily performed. Therefore, S<b>202</b> is represented by a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The first terminal device may select one of the G resources as the first resource. In this manner, the network device may preconfigure, for the first terminal device, resources that meet a capability requirement of the first terminal device. The first terminal device only needs to select a resource from the preconfigured resources to send the MsgA, to reduce a delay in sending the MsgA by the first terminal device. In addition, because the preconfigured resources meet the capability requirement of the first terminal device, a success rate of sending the MsgA by the first terminal device can also be improved.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">The G resources may be a part of a second resource. In this case, the first resource is a part of the second resource. The second resource is used by the second terminal device to send a MsgA. For example, the first terminal device is a bandwidth-limited terminal device, and the second terminal device is a bandwidth-unlimited terminal device. In other words, channel bandwidth of the first terminal device is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device. In addition, the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device is greater than or equal to the first bandwidth. Because the second terminal device may send the MsgA on the second resource, the bandwidth of the second resource is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">The second resource may include one or more resources. That the bandwidth of the second resource is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device is that a bandwidth of each of the one or more resources is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device. For example, there are five resources that can be used by a terminal device to send a MsgA, and the five resources belong to the second resource. In the five resources, if a bandwidth of each of two resources is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, the G resources configured by the network device are the two resources. The first terminal device may select one of the two resources as the first resource. The second terminal device may select the second resource to send the MsgA, or may select the first resource to send the MsgA. For example, the second terminal device may select one of the five resources to send the MsgA, or may select one of the two resources to send the MsgA.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">Alternatively, if the random access procedure is a 4-step RACH procedure and the first random access message is a Msg3, the first resource may be scheduled by the network device. If the random access procedure is the 4-step RACH procedure, before S<b>201</b>, S<b>203</b> may be further performed. The first terminal device sends a random access request message to the network device on a third resource, and the network device receives the random access request message from the first terminal device on the third resource. A bandwidth of the third resource may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device (which may be the uplink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device herein). In addition, the bandwidth of the third resource may be less than or equal to the bandwidth of the initial BWP (which may be the bandwidth of the initial uplink BWP herein). For example, the random access request message is a Msg1, namely, a preamble. In addition, if the Msg3 is initially transmitted, after S<b>203</b> and before S<b>201</b>, S<b>204</b> may be further performed. The network device sends a random access response message to the first terminal device, and the first terminal device receives the random access response message from the network device. The random access response message may be used for scheduling the first resource. In this way, the first terminal device may determine the first resource after receiving the random access response message. For example, the random access response message is a Msg2, namely, an RAR message. Alternatively, if the Msg3 is retransmitted, S<b>204</b> may include that the network device sends, to the first terminal device, the PDCCH scrambled by using the Temporary C-RNTI (TC-RNTI), and the first terminal device receives the PDCCH from the network device. The PDCCH may be used for scheduling the first resource. In this way, the first terminal device may determine the first resource after receiving the PDCCH. S<b>203</b> and S<b>204</b> are optional steps, and are not necessarily performed. Therefore, S<b>203</b> and S<b>204</b> are represented by dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In addition, for example, the network device sends the random access response message in S<b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0162">In this implementation, the third resource for sending the random access request message may be configured by the network device. For example, before S<b>203</b>, S<b>205</b> may be further performed. The network device sends first configuration information to the first terminal device, and the first terminal device receives the first configuration information from the network device. For ease of description, resources for sending the Msg3 are collectively referred to as scheduling transmission resources in this specification. In this embodiment of this disclosure, corresponding resources for sending the random access request message may be preset (for example, the resources that are preset are referred to as preset resources). In addition, it is specified that a bandwidth of a scheduling transmission resource corresponding to each of the preset resources is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device (the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device may include the uplink channel bandwidth and the downlink channel bandwidth, and mainly refers to the uplink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device herein). In other words, if the bandwidth of the resource that is corresponding to each of the preset resources and that is used for sending the first random access message (for example, the Msg3) is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, the first configuration information may be used for configuring the preset resources. The first terminal device may be the bandwidth-limited terminal device, for example, the NR light terminal device. Therefore, the preset resources may be resources that can be supported by the bandwidth-limited first terminal device. For specific random access resources that can be supported by the bandwidth-limited terminal device, refer to Table 1. If the corresponding preset resources are preset, after receiving the random access request message from the first terminal device, the network device determines that a random access resource for sending the random access request message belongs to the preset resources. In this case, the network device may select a resource whose bandwidth is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device when allocating a scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device. If the Msg3 is initially transmitted, the network device may allocate, to the first terminal device based on the RAR message, the resource for sending the Msg3, or if the Msg3 is retransmitted, the network device may allocate, to the first terminal device through the PDCCH scrambled by using the TC-RNTI, the resource for sending the Msg3.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0163">In addition, the third resource may be a part of a fourth resource. The fourth resource may be used by the second terminal device to send a Msg1. A bandwidth of the fourth resource may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the second terminal device (which may be an uplink channel bandwidth of the second terminal device herein). In addition, the bandwidth of the fourth resource may be less than or equal to the bandwidth of the initial BWP (which may be the bandwidth of the initial uplink BWP herein). For example, there are seven resources that can be used by a terminal device to send a Msg1, and the seven resources belong to the fourth resource. In the seven resources, three resources may be used by the first terminal device to send the Msg1. For example, if a bandwidth of each of the three resources is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device (which may be the uplink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device herein), the preset resources configured by the network device include the three resources. The first terminal device may select one of the three resources as the third resource. The second terminal device may select the fourth resource to send the Msg1, or may select the third resource to send the Msg1. For example, the second terminal device may select one of the seven resources to send the Msg1, or may select one of the three resources to send the Msg1.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0164">In an implementation of the preset resources, the preset resources include N random access occasions (ROs). The first configuration information may be used for configuring the N random access occasions. A bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the N random access occasions and that is used for sending a first random access message is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. The random access occasions may include time-frequency resources for random access. In this case, the third resource may be a random access resource corresponding to a first random access occasion of the N random access occasions. In other words, the first terminal device may select the random access resource corresponding to the first random access occasion of the N random access occasions as the third resource. The first random access occasion may be any one of the N random access occasions. If the first terminal device selects a random access resource corresponding to one of the N random access occasions to send the random access request, when the network device receives the random access request message from the first terminal device on the random access resource and allocates a scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device, the bandwidth of the allocated scheduling transmission resource may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In addition, such a bandwidth can be supported by the first terminal device, to improve a success rate of sending the Msg3. Alternatively, if a resource used by the first terminal device to send the random access request message is not a random access resource corresponding to any one of the N random access occasions, when the network device receives the random access request message from the first terminal device and allocates a scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device, the bandwidth of the allocated scheduling transmission resource may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, or may be greater than the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. If the random access occasions are corresponding to the scheduling transmission resources, a quantity of the configured random access resources is large, and an amount of information for indicating the random access resources is small. The random access resource described in this specification is a resource for sending a random access request message. One random access occasion may be corresponding to one or more random access resources. This implementation may also be used for MsgA resource selection in the 2-step RACH procedure. For example, a bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the N random access occasions and that is used for sending uplink data (carried on a PUSCH) in the MsgA is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0165">Alternatively, in another implementation of the preset resources, the preset resources include M random access resources. The first configuration information may be used for configuring the M random access resources. A bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the M random access resources and that is used for sending a first random access message is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. The random access resource may be a random access preamble, for example, a preamble. In this case, the third resource may be any one of the M random access resources. In other words, the first terminal device may select one of the M random access resources as the third resource. If the first terminal device selects one of the M random access resources to send the random access request, when the network device receives the random access request message from the first terminal device on the random access resource and allocates a scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device, the bandwidth of the allocated scheduling transmission resource may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In addition, such a bandwidth can be supported by the first terminal device, to improve a success rate of sending the Msg3. Alternatively, if a resource used by the first terminal device to send the random access request message is not any one of the M random access resources, when the network device receives the random access request message from the first terminal device and allocates a scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device, the bandwidth of the allocated scheduling transmission resource may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, or may be greater than the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. If the random access resources are corresponding to the scheduling transmission resources, a configuration granularity of the random access resources may be small, to help the bandwidth-limited terminal device and the ordinary terminal device select a random access resource. This implementation may also be used for MsgA resource selection in the 2-step RACH procedure. For example, a bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the M random access resources and that is used for sending uplink data (carried on a PUSCH) in the MsgA is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0166">Alternatively, in still another implementation of the preset resources, the preset resources include K random access resources corresponding to H random access occasions. The H random access occasions belong to P random access occasions. The K random access resources are all or some random access resources corresponding to the H random access occasions. It may be understood that the preset resource is a specific random access resource corresponding to a specific random access occasion. In this case, the first configuration information may be used for configuring the K random access resources corresponding to the H random access occasions. A bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the K random access resources and that is used for sending a first random access message is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In this case, the third resource may be any one of the K random access resources. In other words, the first terminal device may select one of the K random access resources as the third resource. If the first terminal device selects one of the K random access resources to send the random access request, when the network device receives the random access request message from the first terminal device on the random access resource and allocates a scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device, the bandwidth of the allocated scheduling transmission resource may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In addition, such a bandwidth can be supported by the first terminal device, to improve a success rate of sending the Msg3. Alternatively, if a resource used by the first terminal device to send the random access request message is not any one of the K random access resources, when the network device receives the random access request message from the first terminal device and allocates a scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device, the bandwidth of the allocated scheduling transmission resource may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, or may be greater than the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. The random access occasions are corresponding to the scheduling transmission resources. This helps reduce an amount of information in the correspondence. If the random access resources are corresponding to the scheduling transmission resources, a configuration granularity of the random access resources may be small, to help the bandwidth-limited terminal device and the ordinary terminal device select a random access resource. In addition, all or some random access resources corresponding to one random access occasion may establish a correspondence to the scheduling transmission resources, so that the random access resources corresponding to the random access occasions are more flexibly used. This implementation may also be used for MsgA resource selection in the 2-step RACH procedure. For example, a bandwidth of a resource that is corresponding to each of the K random access resources and that is used for sending uplink data (carried on a PUSCH) in the MsgA is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">N, M, K, H, and P are all integers greater than or equal to 1, and H is less than or equal to P.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168">Certainly, in addition to the foregoing setting manner, corresponding preset resources may be set in another manner, and it is specified that a bandwidth of a scheduling transmission resource corresponding to these preset resources is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0169">Alternatively, the third resource may not be configured by the network device, for example, may be specified in a protocol. For example, the protocol may specify the N random access occasions, or specify the M random access resources, or specify the K random access resources corresponding to the H random access occasions. In this case, S<b>205</b> does not need to be performed. It can be learned that S<b>205</b> is an optional step, and is not necessarily performed. Therefore, S<b>205</b> is represented by a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0170">If the corresponding preset resources are preset in the foregoing manner, after receiving the random access request message from the first terminal device, the network device still needs to allocate a corresponding scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device. In other words, in the foregoing manner, it is equivalent to that a bandwidth of a scheduling transmission resource corresponding to a corresponding preset resource is set to be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, but it is not specified that these preset resources are corresponding to a specific scheduling transmission resource or specific scheduling transmission resources. The network device further needs to allocate a scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device based on the requirement (to be specific, a bandwidth of a scheduling transmission resource corresponding to the preset resources needs to be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0171">To reduce burdens on the network device, this embodiment of this disclosure proposes that a correspondence between the preset resources and the scheduling transmission resources may be directly set. For the preset resources and the scheduling transmission resources that have the correspondence, a bandwidth of these scheduling transmission resources is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. Herein, for example, the first terminal device is a bandwidth-limited first terminal device. In other words, in addition to the preset resources, the scheduling transmission resources corresponding to these preset resources are set. In this case, after selecting the preset resource, the first terminal device may learn of the corresponding scheduling transmission resource, and may send the Msg3 on the scheduling transmission resource. Although the network device can still send the RAR message (or the PDCCH scheduled by using the TC-RNTI) to the first terminal device after receiving the random access request message from the first terminal device and determining that the random access resource for sending the random access request message is the corresponding preset resource, the network device does not need to allocate the scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device based on the RAR message (or the PDCCH scheduled by using the TC-RNTI). Instead, the network device may learn of the scheduling transmission resource corresponding to the random access resource based on the correspondence, and therefore can receive the Msg3 from the first terminal device on the scheduling transmission resource. In other words, in this manner, the first resource is also preconfigured.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0172">In a first optional implementation of the correspondence, the preset resources include N random access occasions. In other words, a correspondence between the N random access occasions and the scheduling transmission resources may be set. In this case, the first configuration information may be used for configuring the correspondence between the N random access occasions and the scheduling transmission resources, or the correspondence may be specified in a protocol. Each of the N random access occasions may be corresponding to one or more random access resources, and each random access resource may be corresponding to one or more scheduling transmission resources. Therefore, each of the N random access occasions may be corresponding to at least one scheduling transmission resource. When the first terminal device selects a random access resource corresponding to the corresponding random access occasion to send the random access request message, a bandwidth of the scheduling transmission resource corresponding to the random access resource is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In other words, the first terminal device may send the Msg3 on the scheduling transmission resource whose bandwidth is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In addition, such a bandwidth can be supported by the first terminal device, to improve a success rate of sending the Msg3. In addition, the network device no longer needs to allocate the scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device. The first terminal device may determine the scheduling transmission resource corresponding to the selected random access occasion based on the correspondence, and therefore send the Msg3 on the corresponding scheduling transmission resource. This reduces resource allocation burdens on the network device. The random access occasions are corresponding to the scheduling transmission resources. This helps reduce an amount of information in the correspondence.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0173">In a second optional implementation of the correspondence, the preset resources include M random access resources. In other words, a correspondence between the M random access resources and the scheduling transmission resources may be set. In this case, the first configuration information may be used for configuring the correspondence between the M random access resources and the scheduling transmission resources, or the correspondence may be specified in a protocol. M is an integer greater than or equal to 1. One random access resource may be corresponding to one or more scheduling transmission resources. Therefore, the M random access resources may be corresponding to at least one scheduling transmission resource. When the first terminal device selects a corresponding random access resource to send the random access request, a bandwidth of the scheduling transmission resource corresponding to the random access resource is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In other words, the first terminal device may send the Msg3 on the scheduling transmission resource whose bandwidth is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In addition, such a bandwidth can be supported by the first terminal device, to improve a success rate of sending the Msg3. In addition, the network device no longer needs to allocate the scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device. The first terminal device may determine the scheduling transmission resource corresponding to the selected random access resource based on the correspondence, and therefore send the Msg3 on the corresponding scheduling transmission resource. This reduces resource allocation burdens on the network device. If the random access resources are corresponding to the scheduling transmission resources, a configuration granularity in the correspondence may be small, to help the bandwidth-limited first terminal device and the ordinary first terminal device select a random access resource.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0174">In a third optional implementation of the correspondence, the preset resources include K random access resources corresponding to H random access occasions. In other words, a correspondence between the K random access resources corresponding to the H random access occasions and the scheduling transmission resources may be set. In this case, the first configuration information may be used for configuring the correspondence between the K random access resources corresponding to the H random access occasions and the scheduling transmission resources, or the correspondence may be specified in a protocol. The H random access occasions belong to P random access occasions. H, K, and P are all integers greater than or equal to 1, and H is greater than K, or H is less than K, or H is equal to K. H is less than or equal to P. Each of the H random access occasions may be corresponding to one or more random access resources. The K random access resources may be all or some random access resources corresponding to the H random access occasions. One random access resource may be corresponding to one or more scheduling transmission resources. Therefore, the K random access resources may be corresponding to at least one scheduling transmission resource. When the first terminal device selects a corresponding random access resource to send the random access request, a bandwidth of the scheduling transmission resource corresponding to the random access resource is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In other words, the first terminal device may send the Msg3 on the scheduling transmission resource whose bandwidth is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. In addition, such a bandwidth can be supported by the first terminal device, to improve a success rate of sending the Msg3. In addition, the network device no longer needs to allocate the scheduling transmission resource to the first terminal device. The first terminal device may determine the scheduling transmission resource corresponding to the selected random access resource based on the correspondence, and therefore send the Msg3 on the corresponding scheduling transmission resource. This reduces resource allocation burdens on the network device. If the random access occasions and the random access resources are corresponding to the scheduling transmission resources, a configuration granularity in the correspondence may be small, to help the bandwidth-limited terminal device and the ordinary terminal device select a random access resource. In addition, all or some random access resources corresponding to one random access occasion may establish a correspondence to the scheduling transmission resources, so that the random access resources corresponding to the random access occasions are more flexibly used.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0175">Certainly, in addition to the foregoing correspondence, the correspondence between the preset resources and the scheduling transmission resources may be set in another manner.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0176">The preset resources in the foregoing need to be resources that can be supported by the bandwidth-limited terminal device. Table 1 shows random access resources that can be supported by the bandwidth-limited terminal device. Optionally, to enable the bandwidth-limited terminal device to support more random access resources and improve a random access success rate of the bandwidth-limited terminal device, subcarrier spacings of random access resources on some random access occasions may be adjusted, so that the adjusted random access resources can meet a requirement of the bandwidth-limited terminal device. For example, the bandwidth-limited terminal device is an NR light terminal device. If a bandwidth of the NR light terminal device is, for example, 5 Mbps, a configuration in the fourteenth row and a configuration in the fifteenth row in Table 1 are not supported by the NR light terminal device. In this case, subcarrier spacings of random access resources (or preambles) on some random access occasions may be temporarily adjusted, so that the NR light terminal device can support the preambles.

Generally, the network device configures a specific parameter for the first terminal device, so that the first terminal device operates under the coverage of the network device based on the specific parameter. The specific parameter includes, for example, a parameter of a specific BWP. The parameter of the specific BWP includes, for example, a parameter such as a bandwidth of the specific BWP. The specific parameter may further include some other configuration parameters. For the bandwidth-limited first terminal device, it is better that the specific parameter allocated by the network device can meet the capability requirement of the first terminal device, so that the first terminal device can properly operate. For example, the bandwidth of the specific BWP of the first terminal device meets the capability requirement of the first terminal device. For example, in an implementation, the bandwidth of the specific BWP of the first terminal device is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. The operating bandwidth of the first terminal device may include the uplink channel bandwidth and the downlink channel bandwidth. The specific BWP of the first terminal device may also include an uplink specific BWP and a downlink specific BWP. In this case, that the bandwidth of the specific BWP of the first terminal device is less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device may include that a bandwidth of the uplink specific BWP of the first terminal device is less than or equal to the uplink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device, and a bandwidth of the downlink specific BWP of the first terminal device is less than or equal to the downlink channel bandwidth of the first terminal device.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0182">Therefore, in an optional implementation, regardless of whether the first random access message is the Msg3 or the MsgA, the first random access message may include first information. The first information may include type information of the terminal device, or include type information of a service supported by the terminal device, or include the type information of the terminal device and the type information of the service supported by the terminal device. The type information of the terminal device may be used for determining whether the terminal device is the bandwidth-limited terminal device. In other words, the network device may determine, based on the type information of the terminal device, whether the terminal device is the bandwidth-limited terminal device. For example, if the first random access message includes the first information, it may be indicated that the first random access message is sent by the bandwidth-limited terminal device, or if the first random access message does not include the first information, it may be indicated that the first random access message is not sent by the bandwidth-limited terminal device. For example, the terminal device includes several types: an NR light terminal device, an eMTC terminal device, or an NB-IoT terminal device. In addition, the several types may be further subdivided. For example, the NR light terminal device may further include a type 1 terminal device or a type 2 terminal device. The service supported by the terminal device includes, for example, an industrial sensor service, a wearable service, or a monitoring service. In this embodiment of this disclosure, because the first information is sent by the first terminal device to the network device, if the first information includes the type information of the terminal device, the type information may be the type information of the first terminal device. Similarly, if the first information includes the type information of the service supported by the terminal device, the type information may be the type information of the service supported by the first terminal device. After receiving the first random access message from the first terminal device, the network device may obtain, based on the first information, the type information of the first terminal device and/or the type information of the service supported by the first terminal device.

For example, if the random access procedure is used for establishing an RRC connection, the RRC message may be an RRC setup message, or if the random access procedure is used for reestablishing an RRC connection, the RRC message may be an RRC reestablishment message or an RRC setup message. Alternatively, if the first terminal device is in an RRC inactive state before random access, and the random access procedure is used for resuming an RRC connection, the RRC message may be an RRC setup message or an RRC resume message.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0185">If the first random access message includes the first information, the network device may configure, based on the first information, the specific parameter for the terminal device for sending the first information.

For example, the bandwidth of the configured specific BWP may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device. Alternatively, if the first information indicates that the terminal device for sending the first information is a bandwidth-unlimited terminal device, the specific parameter configured by the network device for the terminal device based on the first information may be a limited configuration parameter. For example, the bandwidth of the configured specific BWP may be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the terminal device.

After receiving the first downlink message, the first terminal device may obtain the specific configuration information of the first terminal device based on the first downlink message. In this case, the first downlink message is a Msg4, an RRC message included in the Msg4, an RRC message (for example, an RRC reconfiguration message) existing after the Msg4, a MsgB, an RRC message included in the MsgB, an RRC message (for example, an RRC reconfiguration message) existing after the MsgB, or the like.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0189">Alternatively, if it is not specified in advance that the specific parameters corresponding to the preset resources in S<b>201</b> are limited configuration parameters, and the first random access message does not include the first information, the network device may properly allocate the specific parameter to the first terminal device.

To be specific, if the first terminal device does not send the first information based on the first random access message, the first terminal device may send the first information to the network device based on a subsequent first uplink message. After the network device receives the first uplink message from the first terminal device and determines, based on the first information, that the first terminal device is a bandwidth-limited terminal device, if the specific parameter allocated by the network device to the first terminal device based on the message such as the Msg4 or the MsgA does not meet the capability of the first terminal device (for example, the bandwidth of the allocated specific BWP is greater than the channel bandwidth of the first terminal device), or if the network device does not allocate the specific parameter to the first terminal device based on the message such as the Msg4 or the MsgA, the network device may allocate the specific parameter to the first terminal device based on the first information. In this case, the specific parameter allocated by the network device to the first terminal device can meet the actual capability requirement of the first terminal device.

The terminal device may further subsequently send the type information of the terminal device and/or the type information of the service supported by the terminal device to the network device, and the network device may allocate the specific BWP to the terminal device based on the information. Therefore, even when the bandwidth-unlimited terminal device uses the preset resources, the capability of the terminal device can still be fully used. In addition, the preset resources are not specific to the bandwidth-limited terminal device. This also reduces a waste of resources.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0198">Next, another question is considered.

For example, the bandwidth of the initial BWP is set to be less than or equal to the channel bandwidth of the NR light terminal device. However, for a cell, all terminal devices covered by the cell share a same initial BWP. If the bandwidth of the initial BWP is limited, a capability of the ordinary terminal device cannot be fully used, causing a waste of the capability and reducing communication quality of the entire cell.

Therefore, provided that the downlink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the second bandwidth, the terminal device can receive the random access response message. If the terminal device can send a random access request message in a cell and/or can receive a random access response message in the cell, this means that the terminal device can access the cell. Therefore, if the terminal device determines that the uplink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the third bandwidth, and/or determines that the downlink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the second bandwidth, it may be determined that the terminal device can access the first cell.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0209">The third bandwidth and the second bandwidth may be configured based on a system message. For example, before S<b>301</b>, S<b>303</b> may be further performed. The network device sends the system message in the first cell, and the terminal device receives the system message from the network device in the first cell. The system message may be used for configuring the third bandwidth, or may be used for configuring the second bandwidth, or may be used for configuring the third bandwidth and the second bandwidth. If the system message is used for configuring the third bandwidth, the terminal device may determine the third bandwidth based on the system message, or if the system message is used for configuring the second bandwidth, the terminal device may determine the second bandwidth based on the system message, or if the system message is used for configuring the second bandwidth and the third bandwidth, the terminal device may determine the second bandwidth and the third bandwidth based on the system message. For example, if the system message is used for configuring the second bandwidth but not the third bandwidth, the terminal device may determine, in S<b>301</b>, whether the downlink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the second bandwidth, or if the system message is used for configuring the third bandwidth but not the second bandwidth, the terminal device may determine, in S<b>301</b>, whether the uplink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the third bandwidth, or if the system message is used for configuring the second bandwidth and the third bandwidth, the terminal device may determine, in S<b>301</b>, whether the downlink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the second bandwidth, or determine whether the uplink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the third bandwidth, or determine whether the downlink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the second bandwidth and whether the uplink channel bandwidth of the terminal device is greater than or equal to the third bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0210">For example, the system message is a SIB1.

Therefore, such specifications in this embodiment of this disclosure improve a cell access success rate of the bandwidth-limited terminal device. In addition, the bandwidth-limited terminal device is less limited when selecting a cell.
