On the other hand, tires used under a heavy load, such as for trucks and buses (TBRs), emphasize the reinforcing property and durability under the heavy load rather than the reduction of the rolling resistance. Therefore, many of the conventional TBRs have carbon black blended into a natural rubber which can obtain good the reinforcing property and durability, and the blending of the hydrous silica is small.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, from viewpoint of environmental problems, there has been an increasing demand for the reduction of the rolling resistance not only for PCRs but also for TBRs, and there is a demand for development of the hydrous silica suitable for TBRs containing the natural rubber as main component.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses the hydrous silica suitable for reinforcing fillers for polymers, particularly for tires. Furthermore, for example, Patent Literature 2 discloses a rubber composition for the heavy load tire excellent in abrasion resistance and low rolling resistance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literature 1: Published Japanese Translation No. 2017-514773 of PCT International Publication WO2015/121332.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Publication No. 2019-56068.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000">The entire description of Patent Literatures 1 and 2 is specifically incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0008">As described above, the TBRs are usually blended with the natural rubber as main component since the reinforcing property and durability under the heavy load are emphasized. When the present inventors experimentally produced a natural rubber composition containing the hydrous silica blended therein for the purpose of reducing the rolling resistance, they found the following problems compared with a rubber composition for PCRs blended with the hydrous silica.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">(1) When a conventional hydrous silica was blended into the natural rubber, rolling resistance could be reduced compared with the case where only carbon black was blended. However, the natural rubber composition blended with the hydrous silica has an inferior reinforcing property compared with the natural rubber composition blended with only carbon black since the hydrous silica has a poor compatibility with the natural rubber and causes a poor dispersion in the rubber. Therefore, the present inventors have considered that the dispersibility of the hydrous silica in the natural rubber needs to be improved to obtain good reinforcing property.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0010">(2) When sufficient mixing dispersion was performed by applying a high shear force (shear) at the time of mixing and taking time for mixing in order to disperse the hydrous silica in the natural rubber, the effect of reducing the rolling resistance was reduced. The possible cause of this was that when the sufficient mixing dispersion is performed, most of the hydrous silica is excessively dispersed in the natural rubber, and the primary particles or the aggregated particles of the hydrous silica become too close to each other, resulting in greater interaction between the particles.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0011">(3) In the method described in Patent Literature 1, an aluminum compound is added in producing the hydrous silica. The hydrous silica containing aluminum has features of a strong aggregation structure and a poor dispersibility. Therefore, even when the strong shear force (shear) is applied, no excessive dispersion in the natural rubber is observed, and a reducing effect on the rolling resistance is observed. However, the reinforcing property (abrasion resistance, tensile strength) and workability (mooney viscosity) tended to deteriorate due to residual particles that are difficult to disperse.</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0012">(4) Patent Literature 2 discloses a method for producing a load tire excellent in abrasion resistance and low rolling resistance (tan &#x3b4;) by blending 40 to 60 parts by mass of a hydrous silica having CTAB adsorption specific surface area of 180 to 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g, 3 to 10 parts by mass of carbon black and a silane coupling agent in an amount of 6 to 15 mass % relative to an amount of the hydrous silica into 100 parts by mass of a rubber component consisting of 55 to 70 mass % of a natural rubber and 30 to 45 mass % of a butadiene rubber and undergoing a mixing step, a roll step and a final step. This method provides rubber compositions which are excellent in abrasion resistance and low rolling resistance than conventional products. However, the above method needs to undergo many steps including uses of special mixing machines and temperature controls.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to provide a hydrous silica which has equivalent or excellent reinforcing property (abrasion resistance, tensile strength) and which allows to greatly reduce the rolling resistance when it is blended into the rubber based on the natural rubber for TBRs, which is often used under the heavy load, compared with conventional hydrous silicas. Another object of the present invention is to provide a hydrous silica which has excellent reinforcing property (abrasion resistance, tensile strength) and which allows to reduce the rolling resistance when blended into the rubber based on the natural rubber for TBRs, compared with the hydrous silica described in Patent Literature 1.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">In order to solve the above problems and achieve the object of the present invention, the present inventors have intensively studied to provide a hydrous silica which allows to improve the reinforcing property (abrasion resistance, tensile strength) and allows to reduce the rolling resistance in the rubber composition obtained by blending the hydrous silica into the rubber based on the natural rubber for TBRs, which is often used under the heavy load.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">As a result, the present inventors found that: a hydrous silica having CTAB specific surface area in the range of 220 to 350 m<sup>2</sup>/g and a pore volume over the range of pore radius 1.9 to 100 nm measured by mercury press-in method in the range of 1.7 to 2.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, wherein a volume average particle diameter D50 in a volume particle size distribution measured by laser diffraction method for the slurry obtained by dispersing 50 ml of a hydrous silica slurry adjusted to 4 mass % with an ultrasonic homogenizer at an output of 140 W for 10 minutes is in the range of 5.0 to 12.0 &#x3bc;m, and a cumulative value of hydrous silica particles over the range of 4.0 to 35.0 &#x3bc;m in the volume particle size distribution is 80% or more, allows to maintain or improve the reinforcing property (abrasion resistance, tensile strength) and allows to reduce the rolling resistance since adequate dispersion is obtained even if the hydrous silica blended into the rubber including the natural rubber as main component.

CTAB specific surface area is measured based on JIS-K6430 (Rubber compounding ingredients-Silica-Test methods). CTAB is an abbreviation for Cetyl Tri-methyl Ammonium Bromide, which is one kind of surfactants, and CTAB specific surface area means a specific surface area (m<sup>2</sup>/g) when CTAB is adsorbed. CTAB specific surface area in the hydrous silica is considered as an index of specific surface area involved in the interaction with rubber molecules. A sufficient rubber reinforcing property (abrasion resistance and tensile strength) cannot be obtained when CTAB specific surface area of the hydrous silica is less than the lower limit of 220 m<sup>2</sup>/g in the present invention. A production of the hydrous silica is substantially difficult when CTAB specific surface area of the hydrous silica exceeds the upper limit of 350 m<sup>2</sup>/g in the present invention. CTAB specific surface area of the hydrous silica of the present invention is preferably in the range of 220 to 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and even more preferably in the range of 220 to 270 m<sup>2</sup>/g from the viewpoint of the rubber reinforcing property (abrasion resistance, tensile strength).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0036">The hydrous silica of the present invention has the pore volume over the range of pore radius 1.9 to 100 nm measured by mercury press-in method in the range of 1.7 to 2.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g. Pores with pore radii in the range of 1.9 to 100 nm, as measured by mercury press-in method, are pores with sizes that allow easy penetration of rubber molecules. When the pore volume over the range of pore radius 1.9 to 100 nm measured by mercury press-in method is less than the lower limit 1.7 cm<sup>3</sup>/g in the present invention, the hydrous silica of the present invention cannot obtain sufficient reinforcing property. When the pore volume of the hydrous silica exceeds the upper limit 2.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g in the present invention, a production of the hydrous silica is substantially difficult. The pore volume over the range of pore radius 1.9 to 100 nm measured by mercury press-in method is preferably in the range of 1.75 to 1.95 cm<sup>3</sup>/g.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0037">The hydrous silica of the present invention has a volume average particle diameter D50 in a volume particle size distribution measured by laser diffraction method for the slurry obtained by dispersing 50 ml of a hydrous silica slurry adjusted to 4 mass % with an ultrasonic homogenizer at an output of 140 W for 10 minutes in the range of 5.0 to 12.0 &#x3bc;m. The hydrous silica for rubber reinforcing fillers is generally mixed and dispersed with a raw rubber, carbon black, or other additives using a banbury mixer or a mixing roll. The inventors found that the dispersion state of the hydrous silica when dispersed in the natural rubber can be approximated to the volume particle size distribution measured by laser diffraction method for the slurry obtained by dispersing 50 ml of the hydrous silica slurry adjusted to 4 mass % with the ultrasonic homogenizer at the output of 140 W for 10 minutes, based on the measurements of the mechanical energy amount when mixed and dispersed into the natural rubber and of the dispersion state of the hydrous silica when actually dispersed into the natural rubber. Furthermore, the present inventors found that when the volume average particle diameter D50 measured under this condition is in the range of 5.0 to 12.0 &#x3bc;m and the cumulative value of the hydrous silica particles over the range of 4.0 to 35.0 &#x3bc;m in the volume particle size distribution is 80% or more, the hydrous silica can solve the problem of the present invention and achieve the purpose. Hereinafter, unless otherwise specified, the &#x201c;volume particle size distribution&#x201d; in the specification indicates a volume particle size distribution measured by laser diffraction method for the hydrous silica in the slurry obtained by dispersing 50 ml of the hydrous silica slurry adjusted to 4 mass % with the ultrasonic homogenizer at the output of 140 W for 10 minutes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0038">When the volume average particle diameter D50 in the volume particle size distribution is in the range of 5.0 to 12.0 &#x3bc;m, the hydrous silica can be moderately dispersed in the natural rubber. When D50 is less than 5.0 &#x3bc;m, the hydrous silica excessively disperses in the natural rubber, the primary particles or the aggregated particles are too close to each other, and thereby the interaction between the particles becomes large (cause of heat generation), and the effect of reducing the rolling resistance becomes small. When D50 exceeds 12.0 &#x3bc;m, the reinforcing property deteriorates since the hydrous silica causes the poor dispersion in the natural rubber. The volume average particle diameter D50 is preferably in the range of 6.0 to 12.0 &#x3bc;m, more preferably in the range of 7.0 to 12.0 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0039">The cumulative value of 80% or more of the hydrous silica particles over the range of 4.0 to 35.0 &#x3bc;m in the volume particle size distribution indicates a sharper volume particle size distribution. In other words, the fact that the amounts of fine particles and coarse particles are small is indicated. Since D50 is the volume average of particle size and indicates the point at which the accumulation reaches 50%, it is not possible to define whether the volume particle size distribution of the particle is sharp or broad by simply specifying the value as being in the range of 5.0 to 12.0 &#x3bc;m. Therefore, the present invention combines the features of that D50 in the volume particle size distribution is 5.0 to 12.0 &#x3bc;m and that the cumulative value of the hydrous silica particles over the range of 4.0 to 35.0 &#x3bc;m in this volume particle size distribution is 80% or more, thereby defining that the volume particle size distribution is sharp while the target volume average particle diameter is obtained.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0040">When the cumulative value of the hydrous silica particles over the range of 4.0 to 35.0 &#x3bc;m in the volume particle size distribution is less than 80%, the proportion of fine particles or coarse particles increases, which leads to deterioration of physical properties in incorporating into the natural rubber. When too many fine particles are present, the rolling resistance tends to worsen. When too many coarse particles are present, there is a tendency for the poor dispersion and reduced reinforcing properties (especially reduced abrasion resistance). From such viewpoint, the cumulative value of the hydrous silica particles over the range of 4.0 to 35.0 &#x3bc;m in the volume particle size distribution is preferably 80% or more, more preferably 85% or more.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0041">The hydrous silica of the present invention preferably has BET specific surface area in the range of 230 to 350 m<sup>2</sup>/g. When 230 m<sup>2</sup>/g or more is achieved, sufficient reinforcing property (abrasion resistance, tensile strength) can be obtained. When BET specific surface area increases, the production of the hydrous silica tends to be difficult, but the production of the hydrous silica is sufficiently feasible as long as BET specific surface area is 350 m<sup>2</sup>/g or less. The range of BET specific surface area is preferably from 230 to 330 m<sup>2</sup>/g, more preferably from 230 to 320 m<sup>2</sup>/g.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0042">The hydrous silica of the present invention preferably has pH of the 4 mass % slurry in the range of 5 to 8, an electrical conductivity of the filtrate of the slurry of 1,000 &#x3bc;S/cm or less, and a water content of less than 9%. When the electrical conductivity is less than 1,000 &#x3bc;S/cm, aggregations over time hardly occur, more preferably less than 800 &#x3bc;S/cm, and even more preferably less than 500 &#x3bc;S/cm.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0043">The hydrous silica of the present invention preferably has pH of the 4 mass % slurry in the range of 5 to 8, which is equivalent to pH of a general hydrous silica.

The electrical conductivity and pH can be controlled in the water washing process in the producing process, and the water content can be controlled in the drying process.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0045">The hydrous silica of the present invention is suitable for reinforcing fillers used for the rubber component containing the natural rubber. The rubber component containing the natural rubber may be, for example, a rubber component containing 70 mass % or more of the natural rubber. However, this should not be construed as a limitation to the preceding.
