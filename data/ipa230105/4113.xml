The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> of this embodiment is an electrophotographic monochrome laser printer, which forms an image on a sheet S (a recording material) with toner (developer) according to image information transmitted from an external device, such as a personal computer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the following description, the height direction (the vertical direction) of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> installed on a horizontal surface is the Z-direction. The direction crossing the Z-direction and parallel to the axis of rotation (the main scanning direction) of a photosensitive drum <b>101</b> (described later) is the X-direction. The direction crossing the X-direction and the Z-direction is the Y-direction. The X-direction, the Y-direction, and the Z-direction may cross each other at right angles.
