This in particular holds for the case of anisotropic metal nanoparticles, since their strongly shape-dependent properties make them very versatile in their applications.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In addition to the size- and shape-controlled synthesis of nanoparticles, the precise organization of metal nanoparticles in a controlled manner become an important tool for manipulating light, in the respective fields of photonics and electronics. For example, under resonant excitation, metal nanoparticles have the unique ability to concentrate the free-space optical field within subwavelength regions, wherein this ability is based on surface plasmon excitation. The overall plasmonic behavior of gold (Au) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles is similar, however, silver is known to give higher field effects due to a lower plasmon damping leading to more intriguing optical properties and thus to enhanced optical performances.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ag nanoparticles are known to have excellent optical properties, however, they are chemically very unstable compared to their Au counterparts. Therefore, despite their weaker optical performance, Au nanoparticles are favored for optical studies and have become widely used. Further, the cooperative behavior of bimetallic Ag&#x2014;Au nanoparticles is a very active field of research.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, Ag nanoparticles are sensitive to light induced disintegration and aggregation which has so far strongly limited their potential application as single metal component but also in bimetallic compositions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The development of bimetallic Au&#x2014;Ag nanoparticles with synergistic effects offered a compromise by providing stability as well as cooperative and enhanced optical behavior. The use of stabilizing agents, typically large molecules adsorbing to the particle's surface, avoids aggregation and effectively increases stability.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Common stabilizers like the surfactant (deutsch: Tensid) Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium citrate can be employed to increase stability, nonetheless, the overall lifetime of such silver nanocrystals is still shorter compared to their gold counterparts. Other stabilizers like high molecular weight polymers (e.g. polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), PEG,) impart a higher degree of stabilization. However, due to their steric effect, subsequent ligand replacement with biomolecules such as DNA is hindered.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typical methods for the functionalization of Au nanoparticles with DNA, such as the salt-aging method, have proven successful, but could only be partially applied to Ag nanoparticles, for example depending on their shape greater care needs to be taken to avoid Ag nanoparticle aggregation, through additional time-consuming steps thereby increasing effort and inconvenience. While individual reports claim successful functionalization of prisms and wires with DNA via such methods, yields and reproducibility is highly questionable.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the salt-aging method, in the presence of an excess amount of DNA, NaCl is gradually added to the DNA/Au (or DNA/Ag)&#x2014;nanoparticle mixture upon which more DNA becomes attached to the nanoparticles. With increasing NaCl addition more and more DNA can be conjugated to the nanoparticle surface, which in turn increases the stability of the particles. This iterative process takes 1-2 days until stable conjugates are formed. Consequently, although the salt aging method is commonly used by the scientific community to produce DNA-Au (or DNA/Ag) NP-conjugates, it is very time-consuming due to a slow reaction and a large number of steps making it inconvenient for broad applications. A further disadvantage is that DNA-Ag nanoparticles prepared according to the salt aging method already degrade throughout the process of formation, which results in poor yields. Further, such particles can be stored only in the absence of light but also degrade over short periods of time, typically one or few weeks, also in the dark.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In particular, anisotropic Ag nanoparticles, i.e. substantially non-spherical Ag nanoparticles, are very unstable and require careful handling. A major disadvantage of the salt-aging method is that this method is restricted to functionalizing substantially spherical Ag nanoparticles. The salt-aging method is basically not suitable to functionalize and stabilize Ag nanoparticles of non-spherical shapes, in particular Ag-nanorods or Au-nanorods having a Ag-shell. Consequently, the low yields, poor reproducibility and the time consuming preparation of the salt-aging method has become a major bottleneck for ease-of-use and therefore has impeded a full exploitation of the potential application of Ag nanoparticles and particle conjugates and complexes involving Ag particles.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Hence, because of the above mentioned aspects, it is in particular of great interest for research and industry to access commercial DNA-functionalized silver nanoparticles and to arrange them within various assemblies, such as for example rows, rings, star-shapes, lattices (2D and 3D), of varying sizes also within the respective assembly, of varying materials also within the respective assembly, as the optical behavior of such arranged interacting Ag nanoparticles is tunable and versatile but, as of yet, poorly studied due to the above-mentioned shortcomings in stability and functionality.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also other relevant aspects of silver nanoparticles such as catalytic or anti-inflammatory properties can be explored with greater rigor if the particles remain intact, that is the particles do not aggregate during the study. Longer activity with less toxicity of colloidal silver could be achievable this way.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, it is an object of the present application to provide a method for fabrication of nanoparticles, which are easy to synthesize that is the production of the nanoparticles can be performed within a short period of time.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a further object of the invention to provide a plurality of nanoparticles which are functionalized and prevented from aggregation over a long period of time, which at least is a period longer than two weeks.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is a further object of the invention to provide a test method, in particular a lateral flow test, and a test device for a lateral flow test, and a method of producing the test device, which utilize the functionalized nanoparticles according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A solution to this problem is provided, in particular, by the teaching of the independent claims, specifically by a method according to claim <b>1</b> and a plurality of functionalized nanoparticles according to claim <b>7</b> or <b>12</b>, and by the test device of claim <b>14</b> or the method of claim <b>15</b> for producing the test device. Various preferred embodiments presented by the invention are particularly provided by the teachings of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A method, according to the invention, of preparing a functionalized nanoparticle, which comprises or consists of a metal core, a silver coating and a sulfide bond substituent, in an aqueous solution, the method comprising a step of chemical functionalization of a metal nanoparticle in the aqueous solution, wherein the aqueous solution comprises or consists of water and ingredients, wherein the ingredients comprise or consist of the metal nanoparticle, a thiol of the form R&#x2014;SH, where R represents a substituent, and a silver compound, the substituent being, preferably, organic, and having, preferably, a functional group.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The functional group, respectively preferably, comprises or consists of a carboxyl group (&#x2014;COOH), an aldehyde group (&#x2014;CHO), a hydroxyl group (&#x2014;OH), an amino group (&#x2014;NH2), an amide group (&#x2014;CONH), and/or wherein the substituent comprises a carboxyl group, an amino acid, a protein, an antibody, a virus or a hormone, or two or more thereof.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A nanoparticle hereby relates to nanometer sized structures, i.e. nanoparticles. A functionalized nanoparticle hereby refers to a nanoparticle, which has a functional substituent attached to it. The function of the functional substituent is related, in particular, to the effect of preventing aggregation of the functionalized nanoparticle in solution. The substituent is linked to the nanoparticle's surface. Linkage of the substituent to the nanoparticle's surface is achieved at least through a binding group. The binding group, also referred to as &#x201c;binding agent&#x201d; within the present description of the invention, at least forms a bond with the substituent and with the surface of the nanoparticle. In particular the binding group forms a bond with the silver surface of the nanoparticle. The binding group used for attaching the substituent to the nanoparticle is a thiol moiety of the form R&#x2014;SH. The substituent is bonded to the silver via sulfur. That is the substituent is bonded to a silver atom via a sulfide bond, whereas the silver atom is attached to the surface of the metal nanoparticle. That is, functionalization of the nanoparticle through binding of a plurality of substituents to a plurality of respective silver atoms can occur during deposition of the respective silver atoms onto the nanoparticles surface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The substituent can be any molecule, which is capable of having a binding group (R&#x2014;SH). Within the present description of the invention, the terms &#x201c;substituent&#x201d; and &#x201c;ligand&#x201d; have the same meaning, if not defined to the contrary. In particular, the thiol, which includes the substituent, comprises or consists of mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), mercapto methoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG-SH), PEG-SH, or most preferably DNA-SH. Preferably, the thiol, which includes the substituent, comprises at least one of 2,5,8,11,14,17,20-Heptaoxadocosane-22-thiol, or CH3O(CH2CH2O)nCH2CH2SH. The substituent preferably further comprises a functional group, e.g. carboxyl group, an amino acid, a protein, an antibody, a virus or a hormone.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A metal nanoparticle hereby forms the core of the functionalized nanoparticle. The metal nanoparticle comprises or consists of a metal element, e.g. Au. Upon initialization of a wet chemical reaction the silver of the silver compound is deposited on the surface of the metal nanoparticle.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The binding agent is attached to the silver surface, which covers the metal core nanoparticle through a chemical binding of the thiol-group (&#x2014;SH). The binding agent is attached to the silver surface, which covers the metal core nanoparticle through chemically binding of the thiol-group (&#x2014;SH) during the reaction, in particular during the wet chemical reaction. That is, during the silver deposition on the surface of the metal core nanoparticle binding of the substituents occurs. Upon this reaction a color change of the solution visibly occurs.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thereby most preferably a sulfide bond is formed. Chemical binding comprises a covalent bond, an ionic bond or a coordinate bond.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Chemical functionalization refers to binding of the substituent onto the surface of the nanoparticle having a metal core.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The water of the aqueous solution preferably is a purified water, preferably a distilled water, most preferably a double-distilled water (abbreviated &#x201c;ddH2O&#x201d;). Storage of the functionalized nanoparticle according to the invention preferably takes place in aqueous solution, preferably in ddH2O, preferably in the absence of a buffer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the method provided by the invention an aqueous solution comprising water and the essential ingredients of at least a metal nanoparticle, a thiol of the form R&#x2014;SH and a silver compound is used. A wet chemical reaction is started. In particular upon adding a pH increasing ingredient to the aqueous solution the wet chemical reaction is initialized. Upon initiation of the reaction, silver of the silver compound is deposited on the surface of the metal nanoparticles. Further, the thiolated substituents and or those substituents comprising an SH-group attach to the silver.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The method provided by the invention advantageously prevents agglomeration of the functionalized nanoparticles. In particular, the method turns out to effectively prevent agglomeration of the functionalized nanoparticles even after freezing, when the solution of nanoparticles is thawed again. Hence, the as-prepared functionalized nanoparticles can be stored in the freezer. Thereby colloidal stability over a long time is ensured. Preferably, colloidal stability over at least two weeks, preferably longer than three weeks, preferably longer than four weeks, preferably longer than two month, the period preferably extending up to three weeks, preferably four weeks, preferably two month, preferably three, four five or six month. The period being preferably over at least two month, or over at least half a year is ensured. In a freezer, in particular at &#x2212;18&#xb0; C., the period can be between several month and several years.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The nanoparticles can be stored under ambient temperature and/or under air&#x2014;meanwhile the quality of the nanoparticles only slowly changes by a depletion of the Ag shell around the metal core, over several weeks. The method provided allows easy control of the Ag shell thickness. The method further allows ease of selection of different types of substituents. Choosing, in particular DNA modified strands as the substituent and adapting the density as later described, aggregation is hindered. Hence, the method provided offers the person skilled in the art easy to control parameters for advantageously adjusting the solution to prevent aggregation specifically.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method further advantageously provides the preparation of nanoparticles in short time, e.g. within one hour after the wet chemical reaction has been started. An initial color change of the solution containing the functionalized nanoparticles followed by the color remaining constant indicates the wet chemical reaction being finished.

Also the length of the Au nanorod core of L<sub>AU</sub>=155 &#x212b; with a PD ratio of 0.3 is obtained. The measured parameters can additionally be compared to the dimensions obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. Moreover, the SAXS data additionally serve to indicate a closed cover of the Au core <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>&#x2032; by the silver shell <b>3</b>. That is the silver shell <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>&#x2032; forms a continuous layer on the metal core <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>&#x2032;. The Au core <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>&#x2032; is homogeneously covered by the shell <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>&#x2032;. The SAXS data thus can be used to verify the exclusion of porosity of the Ag shell. The X-ray data further serve to proof binding of the substituent onto the shell.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0088">Further verification of the crystallinity and crystal structure of the Au/Ag core-shell nanorods, and the Au nanorods is obtained by comparison of WAXS data, having the nanorods functionalized with and without DNA substituent <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>&#x2032;. From the WAXS profiles fcc diffraction peaks with a refined lattice parameter for the Au nanorods, a lattice parameter for the Au/Ag nanorods without DNA shell, and a lattice parameter for the Au/Ag nanorods with DNA shell are obtained.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>shows two electron microscopy images in a bottom and a top zoomed view. The images represent the DNA&#x2014; stabilized Au/Ag core shell nanorods according to one preferred embodiment of the invention. The scale bar is 50 nm. The DNA layer <b>4</b>&#x2032; formed on the surface of the silver shell <b>3</b>&#x2032; of the functionalized nanorods appears as a thin white layer in the top zoom image.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0090">Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>shows two further electron microscopy images representing a further embodiment of the DNA&#x2014; stabilized Au/Ag core shell nanorods, wherein the number of attached DNA substituents <b>5</b>&#x2032; on the shell <b>3</b>&#x2032;, forming the respective DNA layer <b>4</b>&#x2032; is increased. The feature can be recognized as the white layer <b>4</b>&#x2032; appears brighter. A denser DNA loading is achieved by freezing and thawing the solution containing the functionalized nanoparticles.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0091">Whether the wet chemical reaction is finished appears from optically inspecting the solution after the reaction has started. That is upon silver growth and functionalization a color change of the solution visibly appears. The synthesized DNA&#x2014; stabilized Au/Ag core shell nanorods are then frozen. The presence of DNA on the particle's surface and in solution prevents the functionalized nanoparticles from aggregation upon freezing. The freezing procedure gives rise to an increased DNA loading owing to the excess DNA. It is noteworthy, that after a removal of the excess DNA the Au/Ag nanorods comprising DNA can be frozen as well, which further demonstrates their stability. In contrast, conventionally stabilized nanoparticles aggregate immediately and irreversibly upon freezing. A further advantage provided here is the possibility of a long-term storage of the Au/Ag nanorods comprising DNA in the frozen state, which makes them equally convenient for use as the Au nanoparticles. Further, neither a change in quality, i.e. stability, nor in their optical properties takes place. Neither, after different freezing durations or freezing and thawing cycles.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0092">In order to determine the number of DNA loaded onto the silver shell and using the method according to the invention, a displacement reaction using dithiothreitol (DTT) can be performed. Upon addition of DTT to the solution comprising the Au/Ag nanorods with DNA attached, the conjugated DNA is released as the DTT exhibits a higher affinity to the metal surface. The Au/Ag nanorods comprising DTT are then removed from the solution by centrifugation and the DNA concentration in the solution can be determined by UV/vis spectroscopy, which then can be related to the concentration of nanorods. Alternatively, fluorescently labeled DNA strands can be used as to-be-displaced molecule to increase the sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c </i></figref>shows two electron microscopy images of an embodiment of a functionalized nanorod <b>1</b>&#x2032;.
