More specifically, the present invention relates to a wireless communication method and a wireless communication terminal for increasing data communication efficiency by expanding a data transmission bandwidth of a terminal.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, with supply expansion of mobile apparatuses, a wireless LAN technology that can provide a rapid wireless Internet service to the mobile apparatuses has been significantly spotlighted. The wireless LAN technology allows mobile apparatuses including a smart phone, a smart pad, a laptop computer, a portable multimedia player, an embedded apparatus, and the like to wirelessly access the Internet in home or a company or a specific service providing area based on a wireless communication technology in a short range.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 has commercialized or developed various technological standards since an initial wireless LAN technology is supported using frequencies of 2.4 GHz. First, the IEEE 802.11b supports a communication speed of a maximum of 11 Mbps while using frequencies of a 2.4 GHz band. IEEE 802.11a which is commercialized after the IEEE 802.11b uses frequencies of not the 2.4 GHz band but a 5 GHz band to reduce an influence by interference as compared with the frequencies of the 2.4 GHz band which are significantly congested and improves the communication speed up to a maximum of 54 Mbps by using an OFDM technology. However, the IEEE 802.11a has a disadvantage in that a communication distance is shorter than the IEEE 802.11b. In addition, IEEE 802.11g uses the frequencies of the 2.4 GHz band similarly to the IEEE 802.11b to implement the communication speed of a maximum of 54 Mbps and satisfies backward compatibility to significantly come into the spotlight and further, is superior to the IEEE 802.11a in terms of the communication distance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, as a technology standard established to overcome a limitation of the communication speed which is pointed out as a weak point in a wireless LAN, IEEE 802.11n has been provided. The IEEE 802.11n aims at increasing the speed and reliability of a network and extending an operating distance of a wireless network. In more detail, the IEEE 802.11n supports a high throughput (HT) in which a data processing speed is a maximum of 540 Mbps or more and further, is based on a multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) technology in which multiple antennas are used at both sides of a transmitting unit and a receiving unit in order to minimize a transmission error and optimize a data speed. Further, the standard can use a coding scheme that transmits multiple copies which overlap with each other in order to increase data reliability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the supply of the wireless LAN is activated and further, applications using the wireless LAN are diversified, the need for new wireless LAN systems for supporting a higher throughput (very high throughput (VHT)) than the data processing speed supported by the IEEE 802.11n has come into the spotlight. Among them, IEEE 802.11ac supports a wide bandwidth (80 to 160 MHz) in the 5 GHz frequencies. The IEEE 802.11ac standard is defined only in the 5 GHz band, but initial 11ac chipsets will support even operations in the 2.4 GHz band for the backward compatibility with the existing 2.4 GHz band products. Theoretically, according to the standard, wireless LAN speeds of multiple stations are enabled up to a minimum of 1 Gbps and a maximum single link speed is enabled up to a minimum of 500 Mbps. This is achieved by extending concepts of a radio interface accepted by 802.11n, such as a wider radio frequency bandwidth (a maximum of 160 MHz), more MIMO spatial streams (a maximum of 8), multi-user MIMO, and high-density modulation (a maximum of 256 QAM). Further, as a scheme that transmits data by using a 60 GHz band instead of the existing 2.4 GHz/5 GHz, IEEE 802.11ad has been provided. The IEEE 802.11ad is a transmission standard that provides a speed of a maximum of 7 Gbps by using a beamforming technology and is suitable for high bit rate moving picture streaming such as massive data or non-compression HD video. However, since it is difficult for the 60 GHz frequency band to pass through an obstacle, it is disadvantageous in that the 60 GHz frequency band can be used only among devices in a short-distance space.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, in recent years, as next-generation wireless LAN standards after the 802.11ac and 802.11ad, discussion for providing a high-efficiency and high-performance wireless LAN communication technology in a high-density environment is continuously performed. That is, in a next-generation wireless LAN environment, communication having high frequency efficiency needs to be provided indoors/outdoors under the presence of high-density stations and access points (APs) and various technologies for implementing the communication are required.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Especially, as the number of devices using a wireless LAN increases, it is necessary to efficiently use a predetermined channel. Therefore, required is a technology capable of efficiently using bandwidths by simultaneously transmitting data between a plurality of stations and APs.</p><heading id="h-0003"

In such a case, the first wireless communication terminal may not change data transmission for any one second wireless communication terminal into a reception state until data transmission for all the plurality of second wireless communication terminals is completed. Therefore, the duration field value of a frame indicating that there is data transmitted from the first wireless communication terminal to the plurality of second wireless communication terminals may be a value based on data having the longest transmission time among data to be transmitted to each of the plurality of second wireless communication terminals.

Specifically, the dummy data may be a continuous pattern of a specific value such as &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Specifically, the dummy data may be referred to as a busytone. In a specific embodiment, the second wireless communication terminal may transmit data and then, transmit the dummy data during a time for transmitting data after the data frame transmission. The FCS field indicates whether an error occurs. Therefore, when the dummy data is transmitted before the FCS field, the first wireless communication terminal should receive the dummy data until the FCS field is received and confirm whether the FCS field is received. Therefore, in such a case, the first wireless communication terminal may not stop an operation. Therefore, after the data frame transmission, it may indicate after the FCS field of the data frame is transmitted.

Specifically, the second wireless communication terminal may obtain the time for transmitting data from the duration field of the frame indicating the channel allocated to the second wireless communication terminal. It is possible to prevent another wireless communication terminal from using a corresponding channel through such an operation of the second wireless communication terminal. In addition, if the second wireless communication terminal transmits dummy data after the data frame transmission, the first wireless communication terminal does not need to perform calculation on the data transmitted on a corresponding channel while the dummy data is transmitted.
