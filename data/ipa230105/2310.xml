Despite the increased research activity and use of diglycolamides in recent years, their cost remains high. For example, one kilogram of N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraoctyl diglycolamide (TODGA) may cost upwards of five or six thousand U.S. dollars. The high cost of DGAs is a direct result of the complex and costly processes currently in use for their synthesis. For example, the conventional process for producing symmetrical DGAs is as follows, as also shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>: First, diglycolic acid is converted into diglycolyl chloride using, for example, thionyl chloride as a reagent. In this reaction, toxic and corrosive hydrochloric (HCl) gas is produced as a byproduct, which thus requires special equipment and a special set-up to ensure a safe working environment. As another example, the conventional process for producing asymmetrical DGAs is a four-step convergent synthesis shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A key drawback of this synthetic method is the use of sodium hydride (NaH) as a base to promote nucleophilic substitution reaction between glycolamide and alkyl chloride. In this reaction, flammable hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas is produced as a byproduct, which thus requires a special protocol to ensure a safe working environment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0005">With the demand for DGAs increasing, the cost of DGAs may decrease to some extent, but not enough to make industrial scale production of DGAs cost-effective. Alternative processes that could substantially lower the cost of producing DGAs has remained elusive. Thus, such a process would represent a significant advance in the art of DGA production.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0006">In a first aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a lower-cost and more direct method for producing symmetric DGAs of the formula:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="18.80mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230002311A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0012" num="0007">In Formula (1), R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>are independently selected from alkyl groups (R) and acyl groups (C(O)R) in which the alkyl groups (R) contain 1-30 carbon atoms and optionally contain an ether or thioether linkage between carbon atoms, and R<sup>5 </sup>and R<sup>6 </sup>are independently selected from hydrogen atom and alkyl groups containing 1-3 carbon atoms; and one or both pairs of R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>are optionally interconnected to form a ring.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0008">The method for producing a DGA of Formula (1) is a one-pot synthesis that proceeds by combining a diglycolic acid molecule (A) and a secondary amine (B) to form a salt intermediate (C), and heating the salt intermediate (C) to a temperature of 100&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C. to form the diglycolamide of Formula (1) in a dehydration process.

Alkyl groups in different compounds described herein, or in different positions of a compound, may possess the same or different number (or preferred range thereof) of carbon atoms in order to independently adjust or optimize such properties as the complexing ability, extracting (extraction affinity) ability, selectivity ability, or third phase prevention ability of the compound.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0021">In one set of embodiments, the alkyl group is composed solely of carbon and hydrogen (i.e., without containing any heteroatoms, such as fluorine, oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen).
