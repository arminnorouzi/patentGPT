The process <b>100</b> uses a vaporizer <b>102</b> to vaporize glycol from a feed stream <b>104</b>. The feed stream <b>104</b> is provided to the vaporizer <b>102</b> at a feed location <b>106</b>. A liquid phase <b>108</b> is maintained inside the vaporizer <b>102</b>. The feed location <b>106</b> is a port through a sidewall <b>110</b> of the vaporizer <b>102</b>. The feed stream <b>104</b> may flow through the feed location <b>106</b> into the liquid phase <b>108</b>, or, as here, the feed stream <b>104</b> may flow through the feed location <b>106</b> into a vapor phase <b>112</b> located above the liquid phase <b>108</b>. In some cases, as shown here, an optional delivery conduit <b>114</b> may extend from the feed location <b>106</b> into an interior <b>116</b> of the vaporizer <b>102</b>, such that the feed stream <b>104</b> flows to a location in the interior <b>116</b> that is spaced apart from the sidewall <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The feed stream <b>104</b> contains glycol, for example MEG, from an oil and gas processing facility. The feed stream <b>104</b> typically also contains water and potentially other solid and liquid components. The liquid phase <b>108</b> is maintained at a temperature that vaporizes at least a portion of the glycol from the feed stream <b>104</b>. In the case of a feed stream containing MEG and water, the liquid phase <b>108</b> is maintained at a temperature that heats at least a portion of the feed stream to a temperature between the vaporization temperature of MEG and water, at an operating pressure of the vaporizer <b>102</b>, and a degradation temperature of MEG. Pressure of the vaporizer <b>102</b> is maintained such that the vaporization temperature of the glycol is less than a degradation temperature of the glycol.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The glycol, and potentially some water, is vaporized by thermal contact with a heating medium in the vaporizer <b>102</b>. The heating medium may be the liquid of the liquid phase <b>108</b>, or may be separated from the liquid phase <b>108</b> by a thermal contact structure, such as a heat exchanger or thermal coil. In some cases the heating medium is a material that is immiscible with glycol, such as a hydrocarbon material. In other cases, the heating medium may be a concentrated glycol material. A portion of the heating medium is withdrawn from the vaporizer <b>102</b> through a withdrawal line <b>119</b> and routed to a thermal section <b>120</b>, optionally using a recycle pump <b>121</b>. The thermal section <b>120</b> increases a temperature of the heating medium to a temperature that supports vaporization of glycol in the vaporizer <b>102</b>. The heating medium is routed from the thermal section <b>120</b> back to the vaporizer <b>102</b> through a recycle line <b>122</b>. Dissolved materials in the feed stream <b>104</b> can precipitate in the liquid phase <b>108</b> as vapor leaves the liquid phase <b>108</b> and enters the vapor phase <b>112</b>. Buildup of these solids can be managed by withdrawing a purge portion of the liquid phase <b>108</b> through a purge line <b>124</b>, optionally using a purge pump <b>126</b>. The purge portion can be routed to disposal through a disposal line <b>128</b>, or can optionally be routed to a remediation section <b>130</b> that removes some or all of the solids to form a cleaned heating medium. The cleaned heating medium can then be routed back to the vaporizer <b>102</b> through a clean line <b>132</b>. The remediation section <b>130</b> can feature any solids removal unit, or combination thereof, including centrifuges, hydrocyclones, filters, settlers, and the like.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Vapor evaporated in the vaporizer <b>102</b> enters the vapor phase <b>112</b>, which is withdrawn from the vaporizer as a vaporized stream through a vapor line <b>134</b> coupled to the vaporizer <b>102</b> at a vapor withdrawal location <b>136</b>, which may be located at a top <b>138</b> of the vaporizer <b>102</b> or in an upper portion <b>140</b> of the vaporizer <b>102</b>. The vapor line <b>134</b> is coupled to a pressurizing unit <b>142</b> that increases a pressure of the vapor in the vapor line <b>134</b>. The pressurizing unit <b>142</b> may include a compressor <b>144</b> to compress all of, or part of, the vapor in the vapor line <b>134</b>. Pressurizing the vaporized stream in the vapor line raises the vapor pressure of components in the vapor line <b>134</b>, thus forming a pressurized stream having a dew point temperature higher than the vaporized stream. The vaporized stream is pressurized to an extent that the dew point temperature of the pressurized stream is above the temperature of the heating medium entering the thermal section <b>120</b>. The pressurized stream is routed through a pressurized line <b>146</b> to the thermal section <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Using a thermal contactor <b>148</b>, the pressurized stream is thermally contacted with the heating medium routed to the thermal section <b>120</b>. The thermal contactor <b>148</b> may be a heat exchanger of any useful type, such as a plate exchanger, a shell and tube exchanger, a spiral plate exchanger, a wide-gap exchanger, a falling film tube exchanger, or other type of exchanger. In some embodiments, a scale resistant exchanger design can be helpful in this service. The heating medium is at a temperature, upon entering the thermal contactor <b>148</b>, that results in thermal energy flowing from the pressurized stream to the heating medium. The thermal energy is extracted from the pressurized stream mostly as latent heat, so that at least a portion of the pressurized stream condenses in the thermal contactor <b>148</b>, forming an extracted stream that exits the thermal contactor <b>148</b> through an extracted stream conduit <b>150</b>. The extracted stream conduit <b>150</b> is coupled to a phase separator <b>152</b>, where liquid is withdrawn through a condensate line <b>154</b> and vapor is withdrawn through a reduced vapor line <b>156</b>, which can be routed to further processing such as glycol purification.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The condensate can be returned to the vaporizer <b>102</b> through a condensate return line <b>158</b>, optionally using a condensate pump <b>159</b>. Condensate can also be withdrawn or purged using a condensate withdrawal line <b>161</b>. The condensate return line <b>158</b> enters the vaporizer <b>102</b> at a condensate return location <b>160</b> of the sidewall <b>110</b> that may be located in the liquid phase <b>108</b> or the vapor phase <b>112</b> of the vaporizer <b>102</b>. In this case, the condensate return location <b>160</b> is in the vapor phase <b>112</b>, and the condensate return line <b>158</b> extends to a central region of the vaporizer <b>102</b> and couples to a distributor <b>162</b>. The distributor <b>162</b> distributes the condensate as droplets in the interior <b>116</b> of the vaporizer <b>102</b> to scavenge particles and droplets of the heating medium that might entrain in the vapor phase <b>112</b>. Droplets of condensate travel downward through the vapor phase <b>112</b>, interacting with droplets of heating medium and other entrained liquids, encouraging the entrained liquids downward to the liquid phase <b>108</b>. A surface area structure <b>170</b>, which may be any convenient type of packing or tray structure, can optionally be used to increase area of contact between downgoing condensate and upgoing vapor and entrained liquid droplets to increase removal of small liquid droplets in the vapor stream. Returning condensate the vaporizer <b>102</b> in this way reduces entrainment of liquid in the vapor exiting the vaporizer <b>102</b>. Liquid from the heating medium that might emerge in the vaporized stream <b>134</b> will be returned to the vaporizer <b>102</b> with the condensate. It should be noted that the feed stream <b>104</b> may also be charged to the vaporizer <b>102</b> in a similar way, by spraying the liquid feed stream into the upgoing vapor of the vapor phase <b>112</b> to further reduce entrained liquid droplets.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A temperature of the heating medium is increased in the thermal contactor <b>148</b>. The thermal section <b>120</b> generally increases the temperature of the heating medium to a temperature selected to vaporize glycol in the vaporizer <b>102</b>. Since the heating medium flows from the thermal section <b>120</b> back to the vaporizer <b>102</b>, enduring some heat loss along the way, the temperature of the heating medium upon leaving the thermal section <b>120</b> is selected such that the temperature of the heating medium upon re-entering the vaporizer <b>102</b> is such that glycol is vaporized in the vaporizer <b>102</b>. If necessary, a heater <b>164</b> can be provided in the thermal section <b>120</b> to achieve a target temperature of the heating medium. The pressurizing unit <b>142</b> and the heater <b>164</b> can be used together to optimize energy input to the heating medium to achieve the desired temperature therein. Depending on the composition of the vaporized stream, more or less latent heat may be available in the vaporized stream. Additional energy needed to achieve the target temperature of the heating medium can be obtained using the heater <b>164</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The glycol reclamation process <b>100</b> is controlled to maximize glycol recovery per unit energy consumption. Temperature of the heating medium returned to the vaporizer <b>102</b> is measured, and the pressurizing unit <b>142</b> and the heater <b>164</b> adjusted to maintain the recycled heating medium temperature. In one case, duty of the heater <b>164</b> is adjusted to maintain the recycled heating medium temperature, and pressurizing unit duty is then used to minimize energy consumption. Duty of the pressurizing unit <b>142</b> will directly affect flow rate of condensate <b>154</b>, and will inversely affect flow rate of reduced vapor <b>156</b>. The more condensate formed, the more latent heat is used to heat the heating medium, and the less additional energy added using the heater <b>164</b>. If an increment of energy used to create one degree of heating using latent heat is less than achieving the same degree of heating using the heater <b>164</b>, pressurizing duty should be increased until the marginal energy for each unit is the same. Likewise, if an increment of energy used to create one degree of heating using the heater <b>164</b> is less than achieving the same degree of heating using latent heat, pressurizing duty should be decreased until the marginal energy for each unit is the same. In one case, energy consumption of the pressurizing unit <b>142</b> and the heater <b>164</b> can be directly measured, duty of the pressurizing unit <b>142</b> can be adjusted by a small increment, and the control response of the heater <b>164</b> determined. The overall change in energy consumption can then be evaluated to determine whether the new operating state consumes less energy than the old operating state. Such manipulations can be repeated, increasing or decreasing the pressurizing unit duty to seek an optimum. In another case, pressurizing unit duty can be adjusted based on recycled heating medium temperature, and heat input using the heater <b>164</b> can be manipulated to reduce overall energy consumption. Simulators can also be used to predict the effect of changes in pressurizing unit duty or heater input, by measuring composition of the vaporized stream and simulating the latent heat available in the stream and it's effect on temperature of the heating medium.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic process view of a glycol reclamation process <b>200</b> according to another embodiment. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a vaporized stream <b>202</b> is recovered from the vaporizer <b>102</b> at the vapor withdrawal location <b>136</b> and routed to a treater <b>204</b>, which may be a distillation column. A treated vapor stream exits from an upper region <b>206</b> of the treater <b>204</b>, in some cases the top <b>208</b> of the treater <b>204</b>, and is the routed to the pressurizing unit <b>142</b> by a treated vapor line <b>210</b>. The treated vapor stream may be a purified glycol stream that has been reduced in water content. A condensate line <b>212</b> routes all or a portion of the condensate from the phase separator <b>152</b> to the upper region <b>206</b> of the treater <b>204</b>. In this case, the condensate line <b>212</b> extends to an interior <b>214</b> of the treater <b>204</b>, through a sidewall <b>216</b> thereof to couple to a distributor <b>218</b>. In this case, a surface area structure <b>220</b>, which may be any of the types of surface area structures listed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is disposed in the treater <b>204</b> to enhance the process performed by the treater <b>204</b>. In one case, the surface area structure <b>220</b> may aid in mass transfer for a distillation process. Downgoing liquid exits the treater <b>204</b> at a bottom of the treater <b>204</b> through a bottoms line <b>222</b>. The bottoms line <b>222</b> is not shown directed to any particular use in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, but may be recycled back to the vaporizer <b>102</b>, recovered as lean glycol product, or routed to disposal or further processing elsewhere. The bottoms in the bottoms line <b>222</b> may be mixed with reduced vapor <b>156</b>, if desired, for routing to further glycol purification.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this embodiment, overall evaporative load on the vaporizer <b>102</b> is reduced because less glycol containing material is recycled to the vaporizer <b>102</b> relative to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Instead of recycling condensate into the vaporizer, the condensate is recycled to the scrubber <b>204</b> and then routed to further processing.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow diagram summarizing a method <b>300</b> according to one embodiment. The method <b>300</b> is a method of recovering glycol from a mixture. The mixture may be a glycol containing stream from an oil and/or gas processing facility. In many situations, the glycol is MEG, and the glycol containing stream also has water and solids. At <b>302</b>, the glycol containing stream is provided to a vaporizer. The vaporizer is a vessel for applying thermal energy to the glycol containing stream to vaporize glycol, and in some cases water or other light materials, from the glycol containing stream.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At <b>304</b>, the glycol containing stream is thermally contacted with a heating medium to form a vaporized stream. Thermal energy is transmitted from the heating medium to the glycol containing stream to vaporize glycol, and in some cases water, from the glycol containing stream to form the vaporized stream. The glycol containing stream may directly contact the heating medium in a liquid pool of the heating medium with unvaporized components from the glycol containing stream, or the thermal contact may be mediated by a thermal contact structure, such as a heat exchanger. The heating medium is maintained at a vaporization temperature selected to vaporize glycol from the glycol containing stream or from the liquid pool without substantially degrading the glycol.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The heating medium may be any material that can be heated and can transmit heat to another material. The material may be in direct contact with the glycol containing stream in the vaporizer, so a material that is immiscible, or only partially miscible with glycol can be used. The material can also be miscible with glycol, but azeotrope formation should be avoided. Hydrocarbon materials can be used, and are immiscible with most glycols, including MEG. The hydrocarbon materials generally have a boiling point significantly higher than the glycol to be recovered.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At <b>306</b>, a pressure of the vaporized stream is increased to form a pressurized stream. All or a portion of the vaporized stream can be compressed using any suitable compressor, rotating or reciprocating. A portion of the vaporized stream may be obtained by simple flow separation, or the portion of the vaporized stream may be obtained by a process, such as distillation, flashing, or extraction performed on the vaporized stream to yield a portion thereof. For example, a distillation process performed on the vaporized stream may yield a portion of the vaporized stream as overhead, which portion can be increased in pressure and used subsequently in the method <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pressure of the vaporized stream, or portion thereof, is increased to raise the vapor pressure of components of the stream such that the pressurized stream will have a temperature to support heat transfer to the heating medium. Thus, the vaporized stream, or portion thereof, is pressurized to a pressure that yields a target temperature for heating the heating medium. The pressurization can be essentially adiabatic or sub-adiabatic. In this context, sub-adiabatic pressurization is a pressurization process that yields a temperature rise less than the temperature rise that an adiabatic pressurization would yield due to thermal losses. The pressurized stream is brought to a thermodynamic state that is mainly, or completely, gas phase with a temperature at or above the dew point of the pressurized stream, but near enough to the dew point of the stream that reducing the temperature of the stream by thermal contact with a cooler stream will result in some condensation of the pressurized stream, and accompanying release of latent heat. In some cases, the pressurized stream may be de-superheated.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, flow rate and thermal condition of the pressurized stream may be selected to maximize transferrable thermal energy to the heating medium. A controller can monitor composition of the vaporized stream formed at <b>304</b>, or a portion of the vaporized stream derived from other processing. The controller can use a thermodynamic model to determine the conditions for deriving maximum transferrable thermal energy from any such streams, and can manipulate control valves to deliver a flow rate of a selected composition to be pressurized to a selected pressure using a controllable compressor. Depending on available mass and composition, a slip stream of the vaporized stream can be routed to the compressor, or a distilled overhead stream can be routed to the compressor, or a mixture of the two. The controller can also adjust circulation rate of the heating medium and other variables to maximize or optimize recovery of thermal energy from the vaporized stream.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Adjusting thermal condition of the pressurized stream includes adjusting temperature and/or pressure. In some cases, one or both of temperature and pressure may be adjusted to move the thermal condition of the pressurized stream to a state that maximizes available transferrable thermal energy. For example, where increasing pressure to form the pressurized stream produces a small amount of condensate, the pressurized stream can be heated using a trim heater to vaporize the condensate. Alternately, or additionally, compressor duty can be reduced to avoid condensation. In other cases, a trim cooler can be used to de-superheat the pressurized stream, or even to subcool the pressurized stream in some cases.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At <b>308</b>, the pressurized stream is thermally contacted with the heating medium. A portion of the heating medium is withdrawn from the vaporizer and routed to a thermal contactor. The pressurized stream is also routed to the thermal contactor, where thermal exchange occurs between the pressurized stream and the heating medium. The thermal contactor is typically an apparatus that provides a thermally conductive interface between the pressurized stream and the heating medium. One or more metal walls may contact both the pressurized stream and the heating medium to facilitate flow of thermal energy from the pressurized stream to the heating medium.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">At <b>310</b>, the flow of thermal energy from the pressurized stream to the heating medium condenses at least a portion of the pressurized stream. The condensed portion of the pressurized stream can be separated from the non-condensed portion, if desired, and the condensed portion can be returned to the vaporizer or routed to other processing.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">At <b>312</b>, a temperature of the heating medium is increased to a target temperature selected to vaporize at least a portion of the glycol in the vaporizer. A second heater may be used to achieve the target temperature. The temperature of the heating medium is initially increased by thermal contact with the pressurized stream, and processing in the second heater brings the temperature to the target. The heating medium is then routed back to the vaporizer.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, MEG and water are vaporized in a vaporizer. The MEG and water are brought into direct contact with a heating medium that is immiscible with MEG. The heating medium in the vaporizer is maintained at a vaporization temperature that is between a boiling temperature of MEG and a boiling temperature of water. In some cases, the vaporizer is operated under reduced pressure so that the heating medium can be maintained at a lower temperature. Maintaining the heating medium at a lower temperature to vaporize MEG can reduce degradation rate of the MEG.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The MEG/water vapor is taken overhead in the vaporizer and routed to a compressor. The compressor boosts the pressure of the MEG/water vapor substantially adiabatically, raising the temperature of the MEG/water vapor along, or near, a saturation limit. Meanwhile, a portion of the heating medium is withdrawn from the vaporizer and routed to a thermal contactor. Upon entering the thermal contactor, the heating medium is at an inlet temperature that may be below the temperature of the heating medium in the vaporizer due to thermal losses. The compression of the MEG/water vapor is configured to raise the temperature of the MEG/water vapor to a level at or above the inlet temperature of the heating medium. The compressed MEG/water vapor is then routed to the thermal contactor to heat the heating medium. The compressed MEG/water vapor is cooled somewhat in the thermal contactor and caused to condense, at least partially. The heat released by the condensation heats the heating medium to an outlet temperature at the thermal contactor. The heating medium is then optionally routed to a trim heater that raises the temperature of the heating medium to a target temperature such that the heating medium is maintained at the vaporization temperature.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The cooled MEG/water stream is routed to a settler to separate vapor from liquid. The liquid may be routed back to the vaporizer for further purification, or may be sent on to subsequent purification operations. The vapor is also typically routed to subsequent purification operations. In this way, heat of vaporization added to the MEG/water vapor is at least partially recovered into the heating medium to conserve energy.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Use of latent heat to heat the heating medium can generally be maximized by measuring flow rates of reduced vapor and condensate after the MEG/water stream is cooled. Maximizing condensate maximizes use of latent heat, but incremental compression duty to achieve incremental condensation may take more energy to heat the heating medium than using the trim heater. Energy consumption by a compressor can be directly measured by measuring electrical current to the compressor. Energy consumption by the trim heater can be measured by measuring inlet and outlet temperatures, and flow rate, of thermal fluid used in the trim heater, or by measuring current if the trim heater is electrical. In any case, marginal changes in energy consumption by the compressor and by the trim heater can be compared to determine whether to increase compressor duty to capture more latent heat. Compressor duty or trim heating can then be adjusted. The component that is not adjusted can be slaved to temperature of the heating medium so that as compression duty is increased, trim heating will automatically decrease, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the subject matter of this disclosure, other and further embodiments of the present disclosure may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
