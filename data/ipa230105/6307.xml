More specifically, the present disclosure relates to battery systems that may be used in vehicular contexts, as well as other energy storage/expending applications.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art that may be related to various aspects of the present disclosure, which are described and/or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vehicles generally use one or more battery systems to power features in the vehicle including the air conditioning, radio, alarm system, and other electronics. To reduce the amount of undesirable emissions products and improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles, improvements have been made to vehicle technologies. For example, some vehicles, such as a micro-hybrid vehicle, may disable the internal combustion engine when the vehicle is idling and utilize a battery system to continue powering the electronics as well as restarting (e.g., cranking) the engine when propulsion is desired. As used herein, the ability to disable the engine and restart the engine when a vehicle is idling is referred to as an &#x201c;auto-stop&#x201d; operation. Additionally, some vehicles may utilize techniques, such as regenerative braking, to generate and store electrical power as the vehicle decelerates or coasts. More specifically, as vehicle reduces in speed, a regenerative braking system may convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, which may then be stored and/or used to power to the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, as vehicle technologies (e.g., auto-stop and regenerative braking technology) continue to evolve, there is a need to provide improved power sources (e.g., battery systems or modules) for such vehicles. For example, it may be beneficial to improve the power storage and power distribution efficiency for such power sources.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Certain embodiments commensurate in scope with the disclosed subject matter are summarized below. These embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure, but rather these embodiments are intended only to provide a brief summary of certain disclosed embodiments. Indeed, the present disclosure may encompass a variety of forms that may be similar to or different from the embodiments set forth below.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates to batteries and battery systems. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to various electrochemical and electrostatic energy storage technologies (e.g. lead-acid batteries, nickel-zinc batteries, nickel-metal hydride batteries, and lithium batteries). Particular embodiments are directed to dual chemistry battery modules that may be used in vehicular contexts (e.g., micro-hybrid vehicles) as well as other energy storage/expending applications (e.g., energy storage for an electrical grid).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">More specifically, the dual chemistry battery modules may include a first battery utilizing a first battery chemistry and a second battery utilizing a second battery chemistry. The first battery and the second battery may be connected in various parallel architectures, such as passive, semi-passive, switch passive, semi-active, or active architectures. For example, in a passive architecture the first battery and the second battery may be directly coupled to the terminals of the battery module. To increase the amount of control over the battery module, in a semi-passive architecture, a switch may be included between either the first battery or the second battery and the terminals of the battery module. The switch may then be opened/closed to selectively connect either the first battery or the second battery. In a switch passive architecture, switches may be included between both the first battery and the second battery and the terminals of the battery module. Thus, the switches enable both the first battery and the second battery to be controlled relatively independently. In a semi-active architecture, a DC/DC converter may be included between either the first battery or the second battery and the terminals of the battery module. The DC/DC converter may function to selectively connect either the first battery or the second battery and to enable the use of a constant voltage alternator. In an active architecture, DC/DC converters may be included between both the first battery and the second battery and the terminals of the battery module. The DC/DC converters enable both the first battery and the second battery to be controlled relatively independently and the use of a constant voltage alternator.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, the battery chemistries used in the first battery and the second battery may be selected based on desired characteristics for each. For example, the first battery may utilize a lead-acid chemistry to supply large surges of current, which may be utilized to start (e.g., crank) an internal combustion engine. The second battery may utilize various battery chemistries (e.g., nickel manganese cobalt oxide, lithium manganese oxide/nickel manganese cobalt oxide, or lithium manganese oxide/lithium titanate) with a higher coulombic efficiency and/or a higher charge power acceptance rate (e.g., higher maximum charging voltage or charging current) than the first battery. As used herein, &#x201c;coulombic efficiency&#x201d; and &#x201c;charge power acceptance rate&#x201d; may be used interchangeably to describe charging efficiency. In other words, the second battery may be recharged more efficiently and at a faster rate, for example while capturing regenerative power. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the first battery may be the primary source of electrical power and the second battery may supplement the first battery, for example by capturing, storing, and distributing regenerative power.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, in a first embodiment, a battery system includes a first battery coupled directly to an electrical system, in which the first battery includes a first battery chemistry, and a second battery coupled directly to the electrical system in parallel with the first battery, in which second battery includes a second battery chemistry that has a higher coulombic efficiency than the first battery chemistry. The second battery is configured to capture a majority of regenerative power generated during regenerative braking, and to supply the captured regenerative power to power the electrical system by itself or in combination with the first battery.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, a battery system includes a first battery coupled to an electrical system, in which the first battery includes a first battery chemistry, and a second battery selectively coupled to the electrical system via a switch and in parallel with the first battery, in which the second battery includes a second battery chemistry that has a higher coulombic efficiency than the first battery chemistry. The switch is configured to couple the second battery to the electrical system to enable the second battery to capture a majority of regenerative power generated during regenerative braking and to enable the second battery to supply the regenerative power to power the electrical system by itself or in combination with the first battery.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, a battery system includes a first battery selectively coupled to an electrical system via a switch, in which the first battery includes a first battery chemistry, and a second battery directly coupled to the electrical system in parallel with the first battery, in which the second battery includes a second battery chemistry that has a higher charge power acceptance rate than the first battery chemistry. The switch is configured to disconnect the first battery from the electrical system to enable the second battery to be charged at a voltage higher than the first battery maximum charging voltage during regenerative braking.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, a battery system includes a first battery coupled to an electrical system, in which the first battery includes a first battery chemistry, and a second battery selectively coupled to the electrical system via a DC/DC converter and in parallel with the first battery, in which the second battery includes a second battery chemistry that has a higher coulombic efficiency and/or a higher charge power acceptance rate than the first battery chemistry. The DC/DC converter is configured to couple the second battery to the electrical system to enable the second battery to capture a majority of regenerative power generated during regenerative braking and to enable the second battery to supply the regenerative power to power the electrical system by itself or in combination with the first battery.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of

end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">One or more specific embodiments of the present techniques will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As discussed above, vehicle technology has improved to increase fuel economy and/or reduce undesirable emissions compared to more traditional gas-powered vehicles. For example, micro-hybrid vehicles disable the vehicle's internal combustion engine when the vehicle is idling. While the vehicle's internal combustion engine is disabled, the battery system may continue supplying power to the vehicle's electrical system, which may include the vehicle's radio, air conditioning, electronic control units, and the like. Additionally, regenerative braking vehicles capture and store electrical power generated when the vehicle is braking or coasting. In some embodiments, the generated electrical power may then be utilized to supply power to the vehicle's electrical system. In other embodiments, the generated electrical power may be utilized to stabilize voltage during high demand, for example in regenerative storage systems.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Based on the advantages over traditional gas-power vehicles, manufactures, which generally produce traditional gas-powered vehicles, may desire to utilize improved vehicle technologies (e.g., micro-hybrid technology or regenerative braking technology) within their vehicle lines. These manufactures often utilize one of their traditional vehicle platforms as a starting point. Generally, traditional gas-powered vehicles are designed to utilize 12 volt battery systems (e.g., voltage between 7-18 volts), such as a single 12 volt lead-acid battery. Accordingly, the single lead-acid battery may be adapted for the improved vehicle technologies. For example, the lead-acid battery may be utilized to capture and store regenerative power and/or supply power to the electrical system during auto-stop. However, in some embodiments, a lead-acid battery may be less efficient at capturing regenerative electrical power due to the lower coulombic efficiency and/or lower charge power acceptance rate associated with the lead-acid battery chemistry. As used herein, &#x201c;coulombic efficiency&#x201d; and &#x201c;charge power acceptance rate&#x201d; may be used interchangeably to describe charging efficiency and charging rate. Additionally, the lead-acid battery capacity may be increased to account for the electrical power demand during auto-stop, which may increase cost. As such, it would be beneficial to improve the efficiency of the power storage in the battery system and the efficiency of the power distribution to the vehicle's electrical system while largely conforming with existing vehicle electrical systems.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Accordingly, present embodiments include physical battery system features, and so forth, that facilitate providing improved 12 volt battery systems. As used herein, a &#x201c;12 volt battery system&#x201d; is intended to describe a battery system that supplies between 7-18 volts to an electrical system. For example, in some embodiments, the battery module may include multiple differing battery chemistries to improve the storage and distribution efficiency of the battery module. More specifically, as will be described in more detail below, the battery module may include a first battery (e.g., primary battery) with a first battery chemistry and a second battery (e.g., secondary battery) with a second battery chemistry. As used herein, &#x201c;battery&#x201d; is intended describe energy storage devices that utilize various chemical reactions to store and/or distribute electrical power. In some embodiments, the first battery and the second battery may operate in tandem. For example, the first (e.g., primary) battery may efficiently supply large amounts of current, for example to crank the internal combustion engine, and the second battery (e.g., power device) may efficiently capture and store power generated due to its higher coulombic efficiency and/or higher power charge acceptance rate. Additionally, the power stored in the second battery may be expended to provide power to the vehicle's electrical system. In other words, the first battery may be the primary source of electrical power and the second battery may supplement the battery, which in some embodiments may enable the storage capacity and/or the overall physical dimensions of the battery module to be reduced.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">To facilitate supplementing the first battery with the second battery, the first battery and the second battery may be connected in various parallel architectures. For example, the battery module may utilize a passive architecture, a semi-passive architecture, a switch passive architecture, a semi-active architecture, or an active architecture. As will be described in more detail below, in a passive architecture, the first battery and the second battery may be directly coupled to the terminals of the battery module, which may reduce the complexity of a control algorithm for the battery system. In a semi-passive architecture, one of the first battery and the second battery may be coupled to the terminals of the battery module via a switch while the other may be directly coupled. In some embodiments, the switch may increase the control over operation of the battery module by enabling either the first battery or the second battery to be selectively connected/disconnected. In a switch passive architecture, both the first battery and the second battery may be coupled to the terminals of the battery module via switches. In some embodiments, the switches may further increase the control over operation of the battery module by enabling both the first battery and the second battery to be controlled (e.g., connected/disconnected) relatively independently. In other embodiments, the switches may be replaced by DC/DC converters to enable the use of a constant voltage alternator. For example, in a semi-active architecture, one of the first battery or the second battery is coupled to the terminals of the battery module via a DC/DC converter. In an active architecture, both the first battery and the second battery may be coupled to the terminals of the battery module via DC/DC converters. In some embodiments, utilizing the techniques described herein may increase fuel economy and reduce undesirable emissions by 3-5% as compared to auto-stop technology utilizing traditional 12 volt battery systems (e.g., a single 12 volt lead-acid battery) because the load on the alternator is reduced by more efficiently capturing regenerative power.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">With the foregoing in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of a vehicle <b>10</b>, such as a micro-hybrid vehicle. Although the following discussion is presented in relation to micro-hybrid vehicles, the techniques described herein may be applied to other vehicles including electrical-powered and gas-powered vehicles. As discussed above, it would be desirable for a battery system <b>12</b> to be largely compatible with traditional vehicle designs. Accordingly, the battery system <b>12</b> may be placed in a location in the micro-hybrid vehicle <b>10</b> that would have housed the traditional battery. For example, as illustrated, the micro-hybrid vehicle <b>10</b> may include the battery system <b>12</b>A positioned similarly to a lead-acid battery of a typical combustion-engine vehicle (e.g., under the hood of the vehicle <b>10</b>). By further example, in certain embodiments, the micro-hybrid vehicle <b>10</b> may include the battery system <b>12</b>B positioned near a center of mass of the micro-hybrid vehicle <b>10</b>, such as below the driver or passenger seat. By still further example, in certain embodiments, the micro-hybrid vehicle <b>10</b> may include the battery system <b>12</b>C positioned below the rear passenger seat or near the trunk of the vehicle. It should be appreciated that, in certain embodiments, positioning a battery system <b>12</b> (e.g., battery system <b>12</b>B or <b>12</b>C) in or about the interior of the vehicle may enable the use of air from the interior of the vehicle to cool the battery system <b>12</b> (e.g., using a heat sink or a forced-air cooling design).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">To simplify discussion of the battery system <b>12</b>, the battery system <b>12</b> will be discussed in relation to the battery system <b>12</b>A disposed under the hood of the vehicle <b>10</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As depicted, the battery system <b>12</b> includes a battery module <b>14</b> coupled to an ignition system <b>16</b>, an internal combustion engine <b>18</b>, and a regenerative braking system <b>20</b>. More specifically, the battery module <b>14</b> may supply power to the ignition system <b>16</b> to start (i.e., crank) the internal combustion engine <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, the ignition system <b>16</b> may include a traditional starter and/or a belt starter generator (BSG). The regenerative braking system <b>20</b> may capture energy to charge the battery module <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the regenerative braking system <b>20</b> may include an alternator, such as a belt starter generator (BSG), one or more electric motors, to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, and/or control components.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, as described above, the battery system <b>12</b> may supply power to components of the vehicle's electrical system. For example, the battery system <b>12</b> may supply power to the radiator cooling fans, climate control system, electric power steering systems, active suspension systems, auto park systems, electric oil pumps, electric super/turbochargers, electric water pumps, heated windscreen/defrosters, window lift motors, vanity lights, tire pressure monitoring systems, sunroof motor controls, power seats, alarm systems, infotainment systems, navigation features, lane departure warning systems, electric parking brakes, external lights, or any combination thereof. Illustratively, the battery system <b>12</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> supplies power to a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system <b>22</b> and a vehicle console <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">To facilitate supply of power from the battery system <b>12</b> to the various components in vehicle's electrical system (e.g., HVAC system <b>22</b> and vehicle console <b>24</b>), the battery module <b>14</b> includes a first terminal <b>26</b> and a second terminal <b>28</b>. In some embodiments, the second terminal <b>28</b> may provide a ground connection and the first terminal <b>26</b> may provide a positive voltage ranging between 7-18 volts. A more detailed view of an embodiment of a battery module <b>14</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As previously noted, the battery module <b>14</b> may have dimensions comparable to those of a typical lead-acid battery to limit modifications to the vehicle <b>10</b> design to accommodate the battery system <b>12</b>. For example, the battery module <b>14</b> may be of similar dimensions to an H6 battery, which may be approximately 13.9 inches&#xd7;6.8 inches&#xd7;7.5 inches. As depicted, the battery module <b>14</b> may be included within a single continuous housing. In other embodiments, the battery module <b>14</b> may include multiple housings coupled together (e.g., a first housing including the first battery and a second housing including the second battery).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As depicted, the battery module <b>14</b> includes the first terminal <b>26</b>, the second terminal <b>28</b>, a first battery (e.g., a lead acid battery) <b>30</b>, a second battery <b>32</b>, and a battery control unit <b>34</b>. As used herein, the &#x201c;battery control unit&#x201d; generally refers to control components that control operation of the battery system <b>12</b>, such as switches within the battery module or an alternator. The operation of the battery module <b>14</b> may be controlled by the battery control unit <b>34</b>. For example, the battery control unit <b>34</b> may regulate (e.g., restrict or increase) power output of each battery in the battery module <b>14</b>, perform load balancing between the batteries, control charging and discharging of the batteries (e.g., via switches or DC/DC converters), determine a state of charge of each battery and/or the entire battery module <b>14</b>, activate an active cooling mechanism, and the like. Accordingly, the battery control unit <b>34</b> may include at least one memory <b>35</b> and at least one processor <b>37</b> programmed to execute control algorithms for performing such tasks. Additionally, as depicted, the battery control unit <b>34</b> may be included within the battery module <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, the battery control unit <b>34</b> may be included separate from the battery module <b>14</b>, such as a standalone module.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, as depicted, the first battery <b>30</b> and the second battery <b>32</b> are connected in parallel across the first terminal <b>26</b> and the second terminal <b>28</b> to enable charging and discharging of the batteries. As described above, the battery terminals <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may output the power stored in the battery module <b>14</b> to provide power to the vehicle's electrical system. Additionally, the battery terminals <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may also input power to the battery module <b>14</b> to enable the first battery <b>30</b> and the second battery <b>32</b> to charge, for example, when the alternator generates electrical power through regenerative braking.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first battery <b>30</b> and the second battery <b>32</b> are separate, which enables each to be configured based on desired characteristics, such as output voltage. For example, the output voltage of the first battery <b>30</b> and second battery <b>32</b> may depend on the configuration of battery cells <b>36</b> within each (e.g., in serial or parallel) and the battery chemistries selected. As will be described in more detail below, the configuration of battery cells and the battery chemistries selected may cause different voltage characteristics (e.g., non-voltage matched, partial voltage matched, or voltage matched). More specifically, the differing voltage characteristics may cause the first battery <b>30</b> and the second battery <b>32</b> to operate differently in the various architectures (e.g., passive, semi-passive, switch passive, semi-active, or active) described herein.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Examples of various chemistries that may be utilized for the first battery <b>30</b> and second battery <b>32</b> are described in Table 1 below.

In some embodiments, a battery chemistry selected for the second battery <b>32</b> may have a higher coulombic efficiency and/or a higher power charge acceptance rate (e.g., higher maximum charge current or charge voltage) to improve the capture, storage, and/or distribution efficiency of the battery system <b>12</b>. For example, the NMC battery chemistry due to its higher maximum charging voltage (e.g., 16.8 volts when four in series) and its higher maximum charging current (e.g., 200 A) may be selected to reduce the recharge time of the second battery <b>32</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;maximum charging voltage&#x201d; is intended to describe a voltage above which may negatively affect the battery. Illustratively, the maximum charging voltage of a lead-acid battery may be 14.8 volts because when charged at a higher voltage (e.g., 16.8 volts) the lead-acid battery may begin gassing (e.g., producing hydrogen gas and/or oxygen gas), which may negatively affect the lifespan of the lead-acid battery. Furthermore, the chemistry selected for the first battery <b>30</b> may have a high energy density (e.g., lead-acid) and the chemistry selected for the secondary battery (e.g., power device) may have a high power density.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">Moreover, as described above, the battery cells <b>36</b> may be arranged (e.g., in serial or parallel) to achieve desired characteristics.

To simplify the following discussion, the first battery <b>30</b> will be described as a lead-acid battery and the second battery <b>32</b> will be described as a battery that utilizes the one of the other battery chemistries described above. As described will be described in more detail below, the voltage of each battery may vary with its state of charge (SOC). For example, a lead-acid battery <b>30</b> at 0% state of charge may have a voltage of 11.2 volts, at 50% state of charge may have a voltage of 12.2 volts, and at 100% state of charge may have a voltage of 12.9 volts. In other words, the lead-acid battery has a voltage range of 11.2-12.9 volts. Although the following discussion is made in reference to a lead-acid battery and a second battery, the present techniques may be applied to other battery pairings that have the same characteristics (e.g., non-voltage matched, partial voltage matched, or non-voltage matched).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when the second battery <b>32</b> is a NMC battery, the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> and the second battery <b>32</b> are non-voltage matched because at no point do the PbA voltage curve <b>50</b> and the NMC voltage curve <b>38</b> overlap. In other words, regardless of their respective state of charge (SOC), the open circuit voltage of the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> and the second battery <b>32</b> voltages do not overlap. To help illustrate, the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> has an open circuit voltage range of 11.2-12.9 volts and the NMC battery <b>32</b> has an open circuit voltage range between 13.3-16.4 volts. Accordingly, when the second battery <b>32</b> is at its lowest voltage (e.g., at 0% state of charge), its voltage is approximately 13.3 volts.

Accordingly, the operation of the battery <b>30</b> and the second battery <b>32</b> may be controlled by the characteristics of each of the batteries.

For example, when the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> is fully charged or close to fully charged (e.g., generally full state of charge), the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> may have a high internal resistance that steers current toward the second battery <b>32</b>. On the other hand, when the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> is less fully charged, the current may be shared between the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> and the second battery <b>32</b>.

Accordingly, the LTO/LMO battery is capable of utilizing 65% of its storage capacity to capture regenerative power (e.g., 35-100% state of charge).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">In operation, the voltage match embodiment may function similarly to the second embodiment of the partial voltage match embodiment. During key-off <b>168</b> (e.g., between time 0 and time 1) both the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> and the LTO/LMO battery <b>32</b> may supply power to electrical components in the vehicle, and at cold crank <b>170</b> (e.g., at time 1) both the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> and the LTO/LMO battery <b>32</b> may supply power to the starter <b>62</b> to start (e.g., crank) the internal combustion engine <b>18</b>. Accordingly, as depicted, the battery system voltage <b>166</b> begins to decrease as the lead-acid battery and LTO/NMC battery states of charge decrease. However, similar to the second embodiment of the partial voltage match, reducing the threshold voltage also reduces the amount of electrical power stored in the battery system (e.g., 60-65% lead-acid state of charge and 35% LTO/LMO battery state of charge). Accordingly, the storage capacity of the battery system may be increased even further to enable the vehicle to cold crank <b>170</b> after sitting idle for thirty days.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">Similar to the embodiments described above, the battery system voltage <b>166</b> is micro-cycled as the vehicle <b>10</b> accelerates <b>172</b> and cruises <b>174</b>.

As the vehicle <b>10</b> decelerates and generates electrical power via regenerative braking <b>176</b> (e.g., between time 3 and time 4), the alternator <b>64</b> outputs electrical power to charge both the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> and the LTO/LMO battery <b>32</b> because the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> is maintained at less than full state of charge. Accordingly, as depicted, the battery system voltage <b>166</b> increases as the lead-acid battery and LTO/LMO battery states of charge increase. However, as described above, the LTO/LMO battery <b>32</b> may have a higher coulombic efficiency and/or a higher charge power acceptance rate than the lead-acid battery <b>30</b>, which may result in the regenerative power being less efficiently captured in the lead-acid battery <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">Furthermore, when the vehicle <b>10</b> begins to cruise <b>178</b> (e.g., between time 4 and time 5), the LTO/LMO battery <b>32</b> may supply electrical power to the vehicle's electrical system <b>66</b> until it nears the threshold voltage (e.g., approximately 35% state of charge). As described above, the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> may begin to discharge before the LTO/NMC battery <b>32</b> reaches threshold voltage depending on the internal resistance of the second battery <b>32</b> as it discharges and/or diffusional resistance of the electrical system <b>66</b>. Upon reaching the threshold voltage, the alternator <b>64</b> may periodically micro-cycle the battery system voltage <b>166</b>. Additionally, as depicted, the battery system voltage <b>166</b> increases as regenerative electrical power is captured in both the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> and the LTO/LMO battery <b>32</b> during regenerative braking <b>180</b> (e.g., between time 5 and 6), the battery system voltage <b>166</b> decreases as the battery system supplies electrical power to the electrical system <b>66</b> during auto-stop <b>182</b> (e.g., between time 6 and time 7). In some embodiments, both the lead-acid battery <b>30</b> and the LTO/LMO battery <b>32</b> may supply power during auto-stop <b>182</b>. Furthermore, in other embodiments, the alternator may be restarted to maintain the battery system voltage <b>166</b> above the threshold voltage. The battery system voltage <b>166</b> then drops sharply as the battery system supplies electrical power to the alternator <b>64</b> to warm crank <b>184</b> (e.g., at time 7) the internal combustion engine <b>18</b>, and the battery system voltage <b>144</b> is micro-cycled as the vehicle accelerates <b>186</b> (e.g., between time 7 and time 8).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">Based on the various embodiments of passive battery systems <b>52</b> described above, the control algorithm utilized by the battery control unit <b>34</b> may be less complex than the algorithm utilized for other architectures.

In other words, some losses may be experience as each DC/DC converter adjusts (i.e., steps up or steps down) voltage. Generally, the efficiency of a DC/DC converter may be between 75-98% efficient. Accordingly, to reduce the losses that may result from use of a DC/DC converter, it may be beneficial to bypass the DC/DC converter.
