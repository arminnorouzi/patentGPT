See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,931,760 and United States Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0316715, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a metallic device or component base <b>10</b> is made of copper or a copper alloy. The metallic device or component base <b>10</b> may, for example, comprise an electrical connection terminal or a lead frames for an integrated circuit device. A tin or tin-based film <b>12</b> is formed over the base <b>10</b> (for example, using an electroless deposition process). The film <b>12</b> has a preferred thickness. A thermal treatment is then applied at a desired temperature and for a desired length of time as a function of the preferred thickness in order to diffuse copper from the base <b>10</b> into the film <b>12</b>. As an example, the desired temperature may be in the range of 90-160&#xb0; C., and the desired length of time may be in the range of 30 to 90 minutes. Due to the film having the preferred thickness, the applied thermal treatment converts substantially all (preferably, completely all) of the tin or tin-based film <b>12</b> into a stable copper-tin compound (Cu&#x2014;Sn alloy) barrier film <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. As an example, the barrier film <b>14</b> may comprise Cu<sub>3</sub>Sn. Next, a tin or tin-based film <b>16</b> is formed over the barrier film <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. The stability of the Cu<sub>3</sub>Sn barrier film <b>14</b> prevents formation of uncontrolled intermetallic Cu<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>5 </sub>growth, even in the presence of the overlying tin or tin-based film <b>16</b>. As a result, tin whisker growth is inhibited.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an alternative implementation, the thermal treatment is instead performed after formation of the tin film <b>16</b> (referred to by those skilled in the art as a &#x201c;post bake&#x201d;).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an embodiment, a method comprises: electrochemically depositing a uniform copper-tin compound layer on a surface of a copper-based base structure; and forming a tin-based film on the copper-tin compound layer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, an apparatus comprises: a copper-based base structure; a uniform electrochemically deposited copper-tin compound layer on a surface of the copper-based base structure; and a tin-based film on the copper-tin compound layer.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For a better understanding of the embodiments, reference will now be made by way of example only to the accompanying figures in which:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> show steps of a prior art process for plating metallic devices and components for inhibiting growth of whiskers; and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> show steps of a process for plating metallic devices and components for inhibiting growth of whiskers.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> which show steps of a process for plating metallic devices and components for inhibiting growth of whiskers. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a metallic device or component base <b>20</b> is made of copper or a copper alloy. The metallic device or component base <b>20</b> may, for example, comprise an electrical connection terminal or a lead frames for an integrated circuit device. Using an electroplating process, a uniform layer <b>22</b> of a copper-tin compound (Cu&#x2014;Sn alloy) is deposited on the base <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. In this context, the term &#x201c;uniform&#x201d; as relates to the layer <b>22</b> means that the layer has a same thickness, same morphology and same stoichiometry across the entire surface of the base <b>20</b>. This is contrasted to intermetallic growth of Cu&#x2014;Sn alloy where that growth is non-uniform due to localized growth at grain boundaries. The use of the electroplating process is critical to ensuring uniform growth of the Cu&#x2014;Sn alloy as distinguished from natural growth of the Cu&#x2014;Sn alloy which tends to segregate at grain boundaries.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In terms of thickness, the layer <b>22</b> may, for example, have a thickness on the order of 1 &#x3bc;m (more generally, a thickness in a range from 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m). In this regard, it is noted that a thickness less than 0.5 &#x3bc;m may not be sufficient to inhibit whisker growth. Conversely, a thickness exceeding 1.0 &#x3bc;m can lead to formation of a fragile interface with increased risk of cracking.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In terms of morphology, the layer <b>22</b> exhibits a homogenous granular structure with a smooth surface. The layer <b>22</b> may be characterized as having a relatively fine grain structure (for example, less than or equal to about 1 &#x3bc;m) with a nodular formation and minimal to no presence of dendritic formations on preferential locations.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In terms of stoichiometry, the layer <b>22</b> may comprise Cu<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>5</sub>, for example with a weight percent of copper at 56% and a weight percent of tin at 44%. The proportion of metallic elements in the layer <b>22</b> is consistent across the lateral extent and thickness of the layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The electrochemical deposition of the Cu&#x2014;Sn alloy for forming the layer <b>22</b> may be performed using, for example, the process as taught by Meudre, et al., &#x201c;Elaboration of copper-tin alloys coatings: effect of glycine,&#x201d; J. Mater. Environ. Sci. 6 (7) (2015), incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Next, a tin or tin-based film <b>24</b> is formed, for example, using a plating process, over the layer <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>. The film <b>24</b> may, for example, have a thickness on the order of 1 &#x3bc;m (more generally, a thickness in a range from 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m). In this regard, it is noted that a ratio of about 1:1 for the thicknesses of the layer <b>22</b> and the film <b>24</b> is preferred in order to ensure stability of the Cu&#x2014;Sn alloy.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is important to note some significant advantages of the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> over the prior art process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">First, there is no need to perform any form of a thermal treatment. In this context, there is specifically no need to perform a thermal treatment after plating the tin or tin-based film <b>24</b>, and this is advantageous because such &#x201c;post bake&#x201d; processing can lead to oxidation of the tin and give rise to solderability problems. Notably, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> supports the formation of a barrier between the copper base <b>20</b> and the tin film <b>24</b> that is achieved naturally at room temperature. In this context, it is noted that the diffusion mechanism changes from grain boundary to bulk at a temperature greater than two-thirds of the melting point of the lower of the two elements in the alloy. In this case, that would be at about 155&#xb0; C. for tin, which has a melting point of 232&#xb0; C. This difference between grain boundary diffusion and bulk diffusion as a function of temperature is critical to the formation of the desired uniform intermetallic Cu&#x2014;Sn alloy layer <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Second, the electroplating of the copper-tin compound to directly form the layer <b>22</b> on the surface(s) of the copper base <b>10</b> advantageously produces a uniform layer, where prior art copper diffusion processing as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> can produce non-uniformities in the barrier film leading to an increased risk of whisker growth. In this regard, it is recognized that the Cu<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>5 </sub>alloy will not uniformly grow at room temperature; it is through the use of the electroplating process that the uniform layer <b>22</b> is possible.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; or &#x201c;on the order of&#x201d; are used to designate a tolerance of plus or minus 10%, more preferably 5%, of the value in question.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The foregoing description has provided by way of exemplary and non-limiting examples of a full and informative description of the exemplary embodiment of this invention. However, various modifications and adaptations may become apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts in view of the foregoing description, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.
