V2X features a wide application scope, great industry potential, and strong social benefits, and is of great significance to promote the innovation and development of the automobile and information communication industry, build new models and new forms of automobile and transportation services, promote the innovation and application of autonomous driving technologies, and improve transportation efficiency and safety. Development of an intelligent transportation system promotes development of an Internet of vehicles (IoV) from a conventional Internet of Vehicles that supports only an in-vehicle information service to a next-generation Internet of Vehicles that supports a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) service. Applications of a V2X system include: vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P), vehicle to network (V2N), and the like. The application of the V2X system improves driving safety, reduces congestion and vehicle energy consumption, improves transportation efficiency, provides in-vehicle entertainment information, and so on. A related communication standard for V2X is introduced in a long term evolution (LTE) system of the 3<sup>rd </sup>generation partnership project (3GPP). V2X is also a hot topic for discussion in a new radio (NR) system. NR-V2X needs to support a variety of more complex scenarios, for example, unicast, broadcast, and multicast scenarios. With expansion of application scenarios and service requirements, a higher requirement is imposed on power consumption of a device in V2X.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This disclosure provides a wireless communication method and a communication apparatus, to reduce power consumption of a terminal device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect, a wireless communication method is provided.

In addition the wearable smart device focuses only on one type of application function, and needs to be used together with another device such as a smartphone, for example, various smart bands or smart jewelries that perform sign monitoring.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In addition, the terminal device may alternatively be a terminal device in an internet of things (IoT) system. The IoT is an important part of future information technology development. A main technical feature of the IoT is to connect things to a network by using a communication technology, to implement an intelligent network for human-machine interconnection and thing-thing interconnection.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">It should be understood that a specific form of the terminal device is not limited in this application.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The technical solutions in embodiments of this application may be further applied to a network device. The network device includes but is not limited to an evolved node B (eNB), a radio network controller (RNC), a road side unit (RSU), a node B (NB), a base station controller (BSC), a base transceiver station (BTS), a home base station (for example, a home evolved node B, or a home node B, HNB), a baseband unit (BBU), an access point (AP) in a wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) system, a wireless relay node, a wireless backhaul node, a transmission point (TP), a transmission and reception point (TRP), or the like. Alternatively, the network device may be a gNB or a transmission point (TP) in a 5G (for example, NR) system, may be one antenna panel or a group (including a plurality of antenna panels) of antenna panels of a base station in a 5G system, or may be a network node, such as a baseband unit (BBU) or a distributed unit (DU), that constitutes a gNB or a transmission point. Alternatively, the network device may be a network side apparatus that provides a communication service or communication control for the terminal device in the internet of vehicles.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The network device provides a communication service for a terminal device in a cell. The terminal device in the cell communicates with the network device by using a transmission resource (for example, a frequency domain resource or a time domain resource) allocated by the network device. The cell may belong to a macro base station (for example, a macro eNB or a macro gNB).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">To facilitate understanding of the embodiments of this application, terms used in this application are first briefly described.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">1. A Broadcast or Multicast Communication Mode on a Sidelink</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Broadcast or multicast means that broadcast or multicast data sent by a sending device may be received by one or more terminal devices. For example, when service data is transmitted on a PC5 interface, a used destination layer-2 identifier (Destination Layer-2 ID) is predefined. The sending device may directly send broadcast service data through a user plane protocol stack, and fill a destination layer-2 ID corresponding to a broadcast service at a media access control (MAC) layer and/or a physical (PHY) layer. A terminal device interested in the broadcast service may monitor, at the PHY layer, whether there is service data of the destination layer-2 ID corresponding to the broadcast service, and receive and parse the service data. However, this application is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">2. A Unicast Communication Mode on a Sidelink</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Unicast is a one-to-one communication manner of terminal devices. A sending device indicates, based on a destination address, a receiving device of unicast data that is sent by the sending device. The receiving device determines, based on the destination address of the unicast data, whether the unicast data is sent to the receiving device, and determines, based on a source address of the unicast data, a device that sends the unicast data. Optionally, the two terminal devices may establish a unicast connection between the two devices by signaling interaction. Unicast communication may be performed after the unicast connection is established.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">3. Sidelink Transmission Mode 1 (Mode 1)</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The sidelink mode 1 means that a terminal device determines, based on a sidelink scheduling grant (sidelink scheduling grant) that is sent by a network device, a resource that is used to send sidelink data. The sidelink scheduling grant is used to grant the terminal device a dedicated resource for sending the sidelink data. For example, before sending a sidelink, the terminal device reports a buffer status report (BSR) to the network device, to notify the network device of a data amount to be sent. The network device grants, based on the data amount reported by the terminal device, a corresponding resource to the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">4. Sidelink Transmission Mode 2 (Mode 2)</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The sidelink mode 2 means that a network device pre-allocates a resource that is used for a sidelink, and a plurality of terminal devices may compete for a resource in the resource that is used for the sidelink. When obtaining the resource, the terminal device may send data on the sidelink in the obtained resource. For example, the terminal device selects, based on whether each time-frequency resource in the resource that is used for the sidelink, an unoccupied resource and transmit the resource. However, this application is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The following describes in detail the communication method provided in the embodiments of this application with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a communication method according to an embodiment of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">S<b>210</b>: A terminal device A (namely, an example of a first terminal device) determines first configuration information of first DRX.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The first DRX is used to control the terminal device A to receive SCI and/or data on a sidelink.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In an implementation, the terminal device A may determine the first configuration information based on a quality of service (QoS) requirement of a service. Alternatively, the terminal device A may determine, based on auxiliary information that is sent by a terminal device B (an example of a second terminal device) to the terminal device A, the first configuration information. Optionally, when the terminal device A is in a connected mode, the terminal device A may further send, to a network device, the auxiliary information that is sent by the terminal device B. The network device determines first configuration information of the terminal device A and indicates the first configuration information to the terminal device A.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The QoS requirement of the service in this application may include but is not limited to one or more of the following:</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">a 5G quality of service identifier (5QI), a 5G quality of service identifier (PQI) of a PC5 interface, a logical channel priority for service, or another QoS parameter reflecting a priority, reliability, a delay, a data rate, or the like of service data.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">By way of example and not for limitation, the auxiliary information may include but is not limited to at least one of the following: resource configuration information, load information, speed information, QoS requirement information of the service, a traffic pattern, and first configuration information recommended by the terminal device B. For example, a service mode may include information such as a service period, an offset relative to a time reference point at an arrival moment of the service data, and a size of a maximum transmission block of the service data.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">The terminal device B may detect or determine the auxiliary information, and then send the auxiliary information to the terminal device A. Alternatively, the network device indicates the auxiliary information to the terminal device B, and then the terminal device B forwards the auxiliary information to the terminal device A. Alternatively, the auxiliary information may include a portion of information that is detected or determined by the terminal device and/or a portion of information that is indicated by the network device. This is not limited in this application.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In another implementation, the terminal device A may determine the first configuration information from one or more pieces of configuration information A. The one or more pieces of configuration information A may be preconfigured on a system and/or configured by the network device for the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">By way of example and not for limitation, the network device configures, by using an RRC message and/or a system message, the one or more pieces of configuration information A for the terminal device A.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Optionally, the terminal device A may simultaneously have a plurality of pieces of configuration information A that are configured in at least two of the following manners: preconfigured on the system, configured by the network device by using the RRC message, or configured by using the system message. The terminal device A may determine, based on a priority, the first configuration information from a specific piece of configuration information A. For example, a priority of configuration information A that is configured by the network device is higher than that of configuration information A that is preconfigured on the system, and a priority of configuration information A that is configured by the network device by using a dedicated RRC message of the terminal device is higher than that of configuration information A that is configured by using the system message. However, this application is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The terminal device A may determine the first configuration information based on but is not limited to one or more of the following manners:</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Manner 1: The terminal device A may determine, based on the auxiliary information that is sent by the terminal device B to the terminal device A, the first configuration information from the one or more pieces of configuration information A.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">Manner 2: The terminal device A may determine, based on a service requirement, the first configuration information from the one or more pieces of configuration information A.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Optionally, the terminal device A may specifically determine, based on the QoS requirement of the service and/or a first mapping relationship, the first configuration information from the one or more pieces of configuration information A.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">For example, the first mapping relationship may be that value ranges of QoS requirements of a plurality of services correspond to a plurality of pieces of configuration information. The first mapping relationship may be that shown in Table 1. The terminal device A may determine the first configuration information based on a QoS requirement of a service of the terminal device A. For example, if the QoS requirement of the service of the terminal device A falls within a QoS requirement range 3 in Table 1, the terminal device A determines that the first configuration information is configuration information 3 corresponding to the QoS requirement range 3. Optionally, when the terminal device A includes a plurality of services corresponding to different value ranges, the terminal device A may determine the first configuration information based on priorities of the services. The priority of the service may be specified in a protocol or preset on a system. Alternatively, the priorities of the services may be sequentially arranged in ascending order or descending order based on the values of QoS requirements. This is not limited in this application. For example, the terminal device A includes two services. For example, a QoS requirement of a service 1 falls within a range 1, and a QoS requirement of another service 2 falls within a range 3. Because a priority of the service 2 is higher than that of the service 1, the terminal device A determines that the first configuration information is configuration information 3 corresponding to the service 2.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>QoS requirement</entry><entry>Configuration information A</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>QoS requirement range 1</entry><entry>Configuration information 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>QoS Requirement range 2</entry><entry>Configuration information 2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>QoS requirement range 3</entry><entry>Configuration information 3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0172" num="0170">Optionally, the terminal device A may specifically determine, based on a service type and/or a second mapping relationship, the first configuration information from the one or more pieces of configuration information A.

This can avoid the following case: If the sending devices configure a sidelink DRX operation for the receiving device, information configured by the plurality of sending devices is inconsistent. As a result, the receiving device receives a signal in DRX operation activation time configured by each sending device, and energy cannot be saved. This solution in this application can effectively reduce power consumption of the terminal device. Optionally, this solution in this application provides that a sending device for performing a DRX operation used for the sidelink notifies the receiving device of HARQ-related DRX operation configuration information used for the sidelink, so that proper timer duration can be determined based on a workload, to save energy.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0293">In this application, a unicast connection on the sidelink may be identified by using source layer-2 identifiers (source Layer-2 ID) of two terminal devices. However, when the sending device sends unicast data on the sidelink, for example, sending a media access control protocol data unit (MAC PDU), the identifiers that are carried in the SCI are the source layer-1 identifier (source Layer-1 ID) of the sending device, and are used to identify the sending device. In other words, after receiving the SCI, the receiving device may determine, based on the source layer-1 identifier, a terminal device that sends the SCI. Based on regulations of the existing NR release 16 (NR release 16), a length of the source layer-2 identifier of the terminal device is 24 bits, and the source layer-1 identifier that is sent by the terminal device in the SCI is the lowest 8 bits of the source layer-2 identifier. A destination layer-1 identifier (destination Layer-1 ID) that is carried in the SCI is the lowest 16 bits of a destination layer-2 identifier (destination Layer-2 ID). In other words, after receiving the SCI, the receiving device may determine, based on whether the destination layer-1 identifier that is carried in the SCI is the lowest 16 bits of the source layer-2 identifier of the receiving device, whether sending the SCI to the receiving device.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0294">Therefore, the foregoing manner may cause a problem of the layer-1 identifier (the source layer-1 identifier or the destination layer-1 identifier) conflicts. For example, the source layer-2 identifiers of the terminal device A, the terminal device B, and the terminal device C are respectively DEF, ABC, and PQC. For example, each letter in the identifier identifies an 8-bit value. In this case, in a SCI 3 corresponding to data that is sent by the terminal device B to the terminal device A, the source layer-1 identifier is C, and the destination layer-1 identifier is EF. In a SCI 4 corresponding to data that is sent by the terminal device C to the terminal device A, the source layer-1 identifier is C, and the destination layer-1 identifier is EF. Therefore, the terminal device A cannot distinguish, by using the source layer-1 identifier in the SCI, whether the SCI is sent by the terminal device B or the terminal device C. Similarly, if destination layer-1 identifiers are the same, data between two terminal devices may also be incorrectly received.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0295">For the problem that the identifiers conflicts, this application provides a method for resolving identifier conflicts in sidelink communication.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0296">In an implementation, when the terminal device A determines that the source layer-1 identifiers or the destination layer-1 identifiers of the terminal device B and the terminal device C are the same, the terminal device A sends indication information F (that is, an example of second indication information) to one of the terminal device B or the terminal device C. The indication information F is used to request the terminal device B or the terminal device C to update the identifier. Optionally, the indication information may indicate that the updated identifier may be one of the source layer-1 identifier, the destination layer-1 identifier, or the source layer-2 identifier. After receiving the indication information F, the terminal device B or the terminal device C updates the identifier, and sends the updated identifier to the terminal device A.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0297">In another implementation, when the terminal device A determines that the source layer-1 identifiers or the destination layer-1 identifiers of the terminal device B and the terminal device C are the same, for example, the identifiers are a first identifier, the terminal device A may update an identifier that is used when communicating with the terminal device B or the terminal device C to a second identifier. The terminal device A sends indication information G (that is, an example of third indication information) to the one of the terminal device B or the terminal device C. The indication information G indicates the terminal device B or the terminal device C to update the identifier of the terminal device A to the second identifier. In other words, after determining that identifiers of two terminal devices conflict, the terminal device A updates the identifier used by the terminal device A when communicating with the one of the terminal devices (the terminal device B or the terminal device C), to be specific, updates the identifier to the second identifier, and notifies the one terminal device. Therefore, after receiving the SCI from the one terminal device, the terminal device A determines, based on that the destination identifier carried in the SCI is the second identifier, that the SCI is sent by the one terminal device to the terminal device A. When the terminal device A sends the SCI to the one terminal device, the source identifier that is carried in the SCI is the second identifier or the lowest 8 bits of the second identifier, so that after the one terminal device receives the SCI that is sent by the terminal device A, the one terminal device may determine, based on that a source identifier that is carried in the SCI is the second identifier or the lowest 8 bits of the second identifier, that the SCI is sent by the terminal device A to the one terminal device.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0298">For example, when the terminal device A determines that both the source layer-1 identifiers of the terminal device B and the terminal device C are C (that is, the first identifier is C), the terminal device A determines to update the identifier used by the terminal device A when communicating with the terminal device B, for example, update the identifier to ED (that is, the second identifier is ED), and sends the indication information G to the terminal device B. The terminal device B receives the indication information G, and determines to update the identifier of the terminal device A to ED. When the terminal device B sends the SCI to the terminal device A, the destination identifier that is indicated by the SCI is ED. After receiving one piece of SCI, the terminal device B determines, based on that the source identifier in the SCI is ED or D, that the SCI is sent by the terminal device A. However, this application is not limited thereto. According to the foregoing solution, a problem that the terminal device cannot determine actual data of the sending device or the receiving device due to an identifier conflict may be resolved, and so that communication security and communication reliability may be improved.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0299">In this disclosure, the terminal device may determine, based on the destination identifier of the broadcast service or the multicast service, a time domain resource or a frequency domain resource for receiving data of the broadcast service or the multicast service.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0300">By way of example and not for limitation, the terminal device may determine, based on the destination identifier of the broadcast service or the multicast service and/or third mapping relationship, the time domain resource or the frequency domain resource of the data of the broadcast service or the multicast service data.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0301">By way of example and not for limitation, the destination identifier may be the destination layer-2 identifier of the broadcast service or the multicast service, that is, the destination Layer-2 ID.
