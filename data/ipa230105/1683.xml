to form a printing form for use in relief printing; and, a process of making the photosensitive element. The printing form precursor includes a layer of a photosensitive composition, a digital layer that is adjacent to a side of the photosensitive layer, and a cell pattern layer that is disposed between the photosensitive layer and the digital layer. The cell pattern layer includes a plurality of features in which each feature an area between 5 to 750 square microns and is composed of an ink that is opaque to actinic radiation and transparent to infrared radiation. Since the cell pattern layer is integral with the printing form precursor, digital imaging can occur rapidly with relatively low resolution optics to form a mask without needing to also form a microcell pattern of the digital layer. The printing form precursor having the integrated cell pattern layer facilitates the preparation of relief printing forms to have a print surface suitable for printing solids with uniform, dense coverage of ink.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="49.19mm" wi="128.27mm" file="US20230001684A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="170.43mm" wi="130.30mm" file="US20230001684A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="211.16mm" wi="131.23mm" file="US20230001684A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="196.17mm" wi="140.63mm" file="US20230001684A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="215.90mm" wi="143.76mm" file="US20230001684A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="226.23mm" wi="76.71mm" file="US20230001684A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="162.48mm" wi="80.94mm" file="US20230001684A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119 from U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention pertains to a photosensitive element and a method for preparing a printing form from the photosensitive element, and in particular, to a photosensitive element that is a printing form precursor useful for forming a printing form suitable for relief printing.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Flexographic printing plates are widely used for printing of packaging materials ranging from corrugated carton boxes to cardboard boxes and to continuous web of plastic films. Flexographic printing plates are used in relief printing in which ink is carried from a raised-image surface and transferred to a substrate. Flexographic printing plates can be prepared from photopolymerizable compositions, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,323,637 and 4,427,759. Photosensitive elements generally have a solid layer of the photopolymerizable composition interposed between a support and a coversheet or a multilayer cover element. Photopolymerizable elements are characterized by their ability to crosslink or cure upon exposure to actinic radiation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Photopolymerizable elements undergo a multi-step process to be converted to a flexographic relief printing form. The photopolymerizable element is imagewise exposed with actinic radiation through an image-bearing art-work, such as a photographic negative, transparency, or phototool (e.g., silver halide films) for so called analog workflow, or through an in-situ mask having radiation opaque areas that had been previously formed above the photopolymerizable layer for so called digital workflow. The actinic radiation exposure is typically conducted with ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The actinic radiation enters the photosensitive element through the clear areas and is blocked from entering the black or opaque areas of the transparency or in-situ mask. The areas of the photopolymerizable layer that were exposed to the actinic radiation crosslink and harden; and, the areas of the photopolymerizable layer that were unexposed, i.e., areas that were under the opaque regions of the transparency or the in-situ mask during exposure, are not cross-linked or hardened, and are removed by treating with a washout solution or with heat leaving a relief image suitable for printing. After all desired processing steps, the printing form is then mounted on a cylinder and used for printing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Analog workflows involve making an intermediate, i.e., the photographic negative, transparency, or phototool. Preparation of a phototool, such as from a silver halide film, is a complicated, costly and time-consuming process that can require separate processing equipment and chemical development solutions. Alternatively, a phototool can also be prepared from thermal imaging films, or by inkjet methods. Also, quality issues can arise with the use of phototool since the phototool may change slightly in dimension due to changes in temperature and humidity, and all surfaces of the phototool and the photopolymer plate should be clean and free of dust and dirt. The presence of such foreign matter can cause lack of intimate contact between the phototool and plate as well as image artifacts.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An alternative to analog workflow is termed digital workflow, which does not require the preparation of a separate phototool. Photosensitive elements suitable for use as the precursor and processes capable of forming an in-situ mask in digital workflow are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,275; U.S. 5,719,009; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,607,814; 6,238,837; 6,558,876; 6,929,898; 6,673,509; 6,037,102; and 6,284,431. The precursor or an assemblage with the precursor includes a layer sensitive to laser radiation, typically infrared laser radiation, and opaque to actinic radiation. The infrared-sensitive layer is imagewise exposed with laser radiation of a digital imager unit whereby the infrared-sensitive material is removed from, or transferred onto/from a superposed film of the assemblage, to form the in-situ mask having radiation opaque areas and clear areas adjacent the photopolymerizable layer. Conventionally, the precursor is exposed through the in-situ mask to actinic radiation in the presence of atmospheric oxygen (since no vacuum is needed). Due in part to the presence of atmospheric oxygen during imagewise exposure, the flexographic printing form has a relief structure that is different from the relief structure formed in analog workflow (based upon the same size mask openings in both workflows). Digital workflow creates a raised element (i.e., dot or line) in the relief structure having a surface area of its uppermost surface (i.e., printing surface) that is significantly less than the opening in the in-situ mask corresponding to the relief structure, depending on the specific precursor chemistry and actinic radiation irradiance. Digital workflow results in the relief image having a different structure for raised elements that print small dots (i.e., raised surface elements) that is typically smaller, with a rounded top, and a curved sidewall profile, often referred to as dot sharpening effect. Dots produced by analog workflow are typically conical and have a flat-top. The relief structure formed by digital workflow results in positive printing properties such as, finer printed highlight dots fading into white, increased range of printable tones, and sharp linework. As such, the digital workflow because of its ease of use and desirable print performance has gained wide acceptance as a desired method by which to produce the flexographic printing form. But not all end-use applications view this dot-sharpening effect as beneficial.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is known by those skilled in the art that the presence of oxygen (<b>02</b>) during exposure in free-radical photopolymerization processes will induce a side reaction in which the free radical molecules react with the oxygen, while the primary reaction between reactive monomer molecules occurs. This side reaction is known as inhibition (i.e., oxygen inhibition) as it slows down the polymerization or formation of crosslinked molecules. Many prior disclosures acknowledge that it is desirable for photopolymerization exposure to actinic radiation to occur in air (as is the case for digital workflow), under vacuum (as is the case for analog workflow), or in an inert environment. As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,241,835, conventional digital workflow has been modified in which imagewise exposure of a precursor occurs in an environment having an inert gas and a concentration of oxygen less than atmospheric oxygen but greater than a completely inert gas environment, i.e., the concentration of oxygen is between 190,000 parts per million (ppm) and 100 ppm. The modified digital workflow provides ease of use of digital workflow while avoiding the dot-sharpening effect of the relief features associated with conventional digital workflow to create relief features having an analog-like appearance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, it is often desirable for the flexographic relief printing form to print images, particularly solid areas, with uniform, dense coverage of ink, so-called solid ink density. Poor transfer or laydown of ink from the printing form to the substrate, especially in large areas, results in print defects, such as mottle and graininess. Unsatisfactory printing results are especially obtained with solvent-based printing inks, and with UV-curable printing inks.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are a number of ways to try and improve the ink density in solid areas of an image printed by a flexographic relief printing form. One way to improve solid ink density is to increase the physical impression between the printing form and the substrate. While this will increase solid ink density, the increased pressure will tend to deform smaller plate elements resulting in increased dot gain and loss of resolution. Another method of improving solid ink density involves increasing the surface area of the relief printing form, since a relief printing form with a roughened surface may hold and thus transfer to the substrate more ink than a smooth surface, and may result in a more uniform appearance. However, the surface roughness should be sufficient to increase ink transfer but not so much as to cause discreet features to directly print as this would result in undesirable artifacts in the final print. Typically a printing form that includes a matted layer and is prepared by analog workflow successfully retains the roughened surface, but in some instances there can be some loss of the fine structure of the roughened surface when prepared by conventional digital workflow because of the dot sharpening effect.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Solid screening is a well-known process for improving the solid ink density in flexographic printing. Solid screening consists of creating a pattern in the solid printing areas of the relief printing form which is small enough that the pattern is not reproduced in the printing process (i.e., printed image), and large enough that the pattern is substantially different from the normal, i.e., unscreened, printing surface. A pattern of small features that is used for solid screening is often referred to as a plate cell pattern or a microcell pattern.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">GB 2 241 352 A discloses a process for preparing photopolymer plates having a plurality of well-like depressions by exposing the photopolymer layer to actinic radiation through a photographic mask containing optically transparent areas and optically opaque image areas, and a screen having a plurality of opaque discrete dots or other geometric shapes onto a photopolymer plate and developing the plate, to form a plurality of depressions in the relief planar surface of the exposed portions of the photopolymer layer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Samworth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,492,095 discloses a flexographic printing plate having solid image areas which are covered by a plurality of very small and shallow cells. The cells are created via a screened film halftone negative, an intermediate photomask, or via a top layer on the plate that is used as a mask.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Currently, various microcell patterns are widely used to improve the capability of relief printing forms to print solids with uniform, dense coverage of ink, i.e., solid ink density. The microcell patterns may be used in solid areas to improve printed ink density, as well as for text, line work, halftones, that is, any type of image element where an improvement in ink transfer characteristics is realized. In digital workflow, a microcell pattern is made into a digital file which is used by the digital imager unit to incorporate the pattern of microcells with the formation of the in-situ mask using laser radiation, usually infrared laser radiation. That is, the microcell pattern is formed from the infrared-sensitive layer that forms the in-situ mask. The microcell pattern is effectively superimposed in the digital file on image areas (often solids) where improved solid ink density is desired. Examples of patterns are small &#x201c;negative&#x201d; (blocking actinic radiation) features, e.g. a 96% halftone dot at 400 lines per inch, representing an array of approximately 14 micron diameter actinic radiation-blocking dots approximately 64 microns apart; and small &#x201c;positive&#x201d; (passing actinic radiation) features much closer together, e.g. a 12% halftone dot at 1400 lines per inch, representing an array of approximately 7 micron diameter actinic radiation-passing dots approximately 18 microns apart. In the latter example of small &#x201c;positive&#x201d; features, the effect of oxygen (dot sharpening) associated with conventional digital workflow can impact the ability to hold the microcell patterns in solid printing areas of the relief printing form. Typically, the finer the pattern of microcells, i.e. the smaller the size of each cell and closer the spacing of the cells, that is formed, the better the results. One problem with this method is that the additional cells increase the amount of time for laser imaging by the laser imager unit of the photosensitive element. In order to provide finer microcell patterns, companies that manufacture digital imager units have had to improve the optical resolution of their imagers and improve their imaging software as well. Both aspects substantially increase the cost of the imager and the time needed to image the photosensitive element.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Stolt et al. in US Patent Publication 2010/0143841 disclose a method to increase solid ink density printing capability for a relief printing form through digital patterning of image areas of the precursor. Stolt et al. disclose applying a pattern to all image feature areas in halftone data that is used to produce an image mask, which is then used to convert the precursor into a relief printing form. After processing, the printing form carries a relief image that resolves the pattern in the surface of the relief features, and provides solid relief features to maintain or increase printed solid ink densities. A problem with this method is that it is still essentially an analog workflow since a phototool is created that is then contacted by lamination with the photopolymerizable layer of the precursor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">So a need arises for a relief printing form to meet the increasing demands for print quality to improve the transfer of ink to printed substrate and to print, particularly solid areas, with uniform, dense coverage of ink. It is also desirable for the printing form to have a relief structure capable of printing a full tonal range including printing of fine print elements and highlight dots and thereby providing improved print quality. There is a need for a method that is simple and relatively quick in preparing the relief printing form from a photosensitive printing form precursor, and yet can provide the printing form with a relief structure that improves transfer of ink to the substrate, without detrimental impact to dot gain and/or image resolution. It is desirable that the method utilizes a digital-like workflow for its ease and simplicity that results in the printing form having a relief structure with features necessary for high quality printing, without the additional expense to upgrade or purchase new digital imaging equipment and software and without the loss in productivity for high resolution imaging in order to form microcell patterns.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An embodiment provides a printing form precursor comprising:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">a photopolymerizable layer comprising a first binder, a monomer, and a photoinitiator;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">an infrared ablation layer that is ablatable by infrared radiation and opaque to non-infrared actinic radiation, the infrared ablation layer comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0019">(i) at least one infrared absorbing material;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0020">(ii) a radiation opaque material, wherein (i) and (ii) can be the same or different;

The photosensitive element includes a layer of a composition sensitive to actinic radiation which in most embodiments is a composition that is photopolymerizable. The photosensitive element includes a layer of the photosensitive composition, a digital layer adjacent to the photosensitive layer, and a cell pattern layer. The cell pattern layer includes a plurality of features in which each feature has an area between 5 to 750 square microns and is composed of an ink that is opaque to actinic radiation and transparent to infrared radiation. In most embodiments, the digital layer is ablatable by infrared radiation and opaque to non-infrared actinic radiation.

The presence of the cell pattern layer avoids the need for end-users to form a microcell pattern in the digital layer with a digital imager device, and can increase productivity in the preparation of the printing form since the mask can be formed in the digital layer by a low resolution digital imager device that is operated at high speed. And since the cell pattern layer is pre-printed at manufacture, cell patterns can be created and printed using high resolution systems, such as gravure printing and high resolution flexographic printing, and thus end-users can avoid the need for a costly high resolution digital imager device with substantially increased imaging time to create the plate cell pattern and the mask from the digital layer. Furthermore, the relief printing form that results from the present photosensitive precursor advantageously meets the increasing demands for print quality to improve the transfer of ink to printed substrate and to print, particularly solid areas, with uniform, dense coverage of ink, and capable of printing a full tonal range including printing of fine print elements and highlight dots.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Photosensitive Element</heading><p id="p-0115" num="0117">The photosensitive element includes a layer of the photosensitive composition, a digital layer adjacent to the photosensitive layer, and a cell pattern layer.

Each feature of the pattern is a two-dimensional shape (based on a planar view) that is not limited, and can have a convex perimeter, or a non-convex perimeter. Non-limiting examples of features with two-dimensional shapes having a convex perimeter include circles, squares, and rectangles. Non-limiting examples of features with two-dimensional shapes having a non-convex perimeter include kidney shapes, and crescent shapes. Each feature can be separate or disconnected from other adjacent features. Alternatively, each feature can overlap with other adjacent features to thereby form larger &#x201c;super-features&#x201d; that refers to a union of two-dimensional areas covered by overlapping portions, and as such features may appear larger in shape or have a connected shape. The plurality of features are printed as a pattern to create a layer-like effect (but not a continuous layer of ink) that is integrated and superimposed on the entire or substantially entire surface area of the photosensitive element, thereby forming the cell pattern layer.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0123">The plurality of features can be applied directly or indirectly to a layer of the photosensitive element to form the cell pattern layer by printing with the ink that in most embodiments is opaque to actinic radiation and transparent to infrared radiation. The ink that is used to print the features of the cell pattern layer is transparent to, i.e., does not absorb, infrared radiation, particularly at the wavelength/s of infrared laser radiation that is used to form the mask of the digital layer, so that the features of the cell pattern layer are not removed by, or disturbed, or modified by, the impinging laser radiation. The ink that is used to print the features of the cell pattern layer is opaque to, i.e., does absorb, actinic radiation, particularly at the wavelength/s of actinic radiation (such as ultraviolet radiation at 350 to 380 nm), that is used to expose and cure the photosensitive layer, so that the features can sufficiently block the radiation and provide for the formation of corresponding microcells on the print surface of the resulting printing form.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0124">It should be understood that &#x201c;opaque to actinic radiation&#x201d; with particular reference to the property of the ink that prints the features encompasses &#x201c;opaque or substantially opaque to actinic radiation&#x201d;, that is, the feature that is printed with the ink can, but need not, absorb 100% of the incident actinic radiation, and can absorb less than 100% of the incident actinic radiation with the proviso that a microcell can be created in the print surface of the resulting relief printing form. The absorbance of the ink after printing to actinic radiation, particularly to ultraviolet radiation, can be determined by transmission density measurement. One example of a device suitable for measuring transmission density, and used for the present invention, is an X-Rite 361T tabletop transmission densitometer, in UV mode, (X-Rite, Inc., Grand Rapids, Mich., U.S.A.)</p><p id="p-0123" num="0125">It should also be understood that &#x201c;transparent to infrared radiation&#x201d; with particular reference to the property of the ink that prints the features encompasses &#x201c;transparent or substantially transparent to infrared radiation&#x201d;, that is, the feature that is printed with the ink can, but need not, transmit 100% of the incident infrared (laser) radiation, and can transmit less than 100% of the incident infrared (laser) radiation with the proviso that a feature is not removed or modified, or not substantially removed or modified, by the infrared laser radiation that is used to create the mask from the digital layer. One method to determine if the ink is suitably transparent to infrared laser radiation is to print the ink as a patch onto a transparent film substrate, such as a polyester film; mount the printed film in a digital imager; and expose the printed film to infrared laser radiation from the imager. If the printed patch after digital exposure is not changed or altered, or not substantially changed or altered, the ink is acceptably transparent to infrared radiation.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0126">In other embodiments of the photosensitive element, the plurality of features can be applied directly or indirectly to a layer of the photosensitive element to form the cell pattern layer by printing with an ink that is opaque to actinic radiation, and is not necessarily transparent to infrared radiation. Since absorbance, and transparency, of an ink is directly proportional to the thickness of the ink laid down and the concentration of the absorbing materials in the ink, the determination of the ability of the ink to prevent or substantially prevent transmission of actinic radiation and to transmit or substantially transmit infrared radiation is most appropriately determined after ink is applied or printed onto the surface of the printing precursor by the desired method. In one embodiment, the plurality of features of the cell pattern layer is generated with an ink that is suitable for printing and blocks 80 to 100% of the actinic radiation and transmits 80 to 100% of the infrared radiation, i.e., incident infrared laser radiation, particularly after printing the features. In another embodiment, the plurality of features of the cell pattern layer is generated with a printing ink and blocks 80 to 99% of the actinic radiation and transmits 80 to 99% of the infrared radiation, i.e., incident infrared laser radiation, particularly after printing features.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0127">Ink is a fluid or paste used for printing that is composed of a pigment or dye in a liquid vehicle. Inks are formulated to meet various requirements that include color, opacity, fade resistance, pliability, odorlessness, drying, and health and environmental safety. In some embodiments inks can include one or more components that absorb actinic radiation, particularly ultraviolet radiation. Inks can be formulated by those skilled in the art to eliminate or to reduce the absorbance of infrared radiation. Inks suitable for use in the present invention are not limited. It is within the skill of a person in the art to formulate an ink to accommodate the particular printing method, e.g., relief printing, gravure printing, ink-jet printing, letterpress printing, lithographic printing, screen printing with ink jet, thermal transfer printing, and electrophotographic printing, which is used to print the features of the cell pattern layer and to provide the features of the printed microcell pattern to be sufficiently opaque actinic radiation and transparent infrared radiation on a surface of the printing precursor. Although the printing method that is used to print the cell pattern layer should facilitate production purposes, e.g., suitable to print the cell pattern layer on a moving web, the cell pattern layer could also be printed by other methods that are not conventionally printed onto a web, such as, intaglio printing, and stencil printing, as well. The ink laid down or applied or printed on layer of the photosensitive element has a thickness which is dependent upon the particular printing method, the printing conditions, the ink, and the particular surface on which the cell pattern layer is printed. The thickness of the ink printed for the plurality of features is not limited. Acceptable results can occur over a wide range of ink thicknesses.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0128">To the extent that the ink is opaque to actinic radiation and transparent to infrared radiation, the color of the ink is not limited. However, the selection of color for the ink may be influenced by the inherent absorbance of the ink relative to the actinic radiation, and transparency of the ink to infrared radiation. In most embodiments, the ink is cyan colored since the absorbance of cyan inks into the ultraviolet region is typically sufficient to block actinic radiation and transparent to infrared radiation. If the ink is not sufficiently absorptive of actinic radiation, particularly ultraviolet radiation, ultraviolet absorbing compound/s could be added to the ink. One exception is that while the addition of certain compound/s, such as carbon black, to an ink would increase its absorbance of ultraviolet radiation, the compound would also increase its absorbance of infrared radiation, particularly near-infrared radiation, which would be problematic for digital imaging with infrared laser radiation.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0129">The digital layer <b>16</b> is employed in digital direct-to-plate image technology in which laser radiation, typically infrared laser radiation, is used to form a mask of the image for the photosensitive element (instead of the conventional image transparency or phototool). The digital layer is opaque or substantially opaque to actinic radiation that corresponds with the sensitivity of the photopolymerizable material; and is sensitive to infrared laser radiation. The digital layer can be a single layer that provides both functions of opaque to actinic radiation and sensitive to infrared radiation. Alternatively, the digital layer can be a composite of two or more separate layers in which the each functionality of opaque to actinic radiation and sensitive to infrared radiation is provided in one of the separate layers. In one embodiment, digital methods use the laser radiation to create from the digital layer a mask image that can be formed in situ on or disposed above the photopolymerizable layer of the printing form precursor. In other embodiments, digital methods use the laser radiation to create from the digital layer a mask that is formed on a digital element that is separate from the photopolymerizable layer, and subsequently the digital element with the mask is applied to the photopolymerizable layer forming the printing form precursor.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0130">In some embodiments, the photosensitive element initially includes the digital layer disposed above and covers or substantially covers the entire surface of the photopolymerizable layer; and the cell pattern layer is disposed between the digital layer and the photopolymerizable layer.

A material capture sheet adjacent the digital layer may be present during laser exposure to capture the material of the digital layer as it is removed from the photosensitive element as disclosed by Van Zoeren in U.S. Pat.

A separate element bearing the digital layer will form an assemblage with the photosensitive element (that in this embodiment includes primarily the photopolymerizable layer and the optional support) such that the digital layer is adjacent the surface of the photosensitive element opposite the support, which is typically is the photopolymerizable layer. If present, a coversheet associated with the photosensitive element typically is removed prior to forming the assemblage. In one embodiment, the cell pattern layer is printed onto the surface of the photopolymerizable layer that is opposite the support. The separate element includes at least the digital layer on a polymeric film, and may include one or more other layers, such as ejection layers or heating layers, to aid in the digital exposure process. Hereto, the digital layer is also sensitive to infrared radiation. In one embodiment, the assemblage is exposed imagewise with infrared laser radiation to selectively transfer or selectively alter the adhesion balance of the digital layer and form the mask on or disposed above the photopolymerizable layer, so that the cell pattern layer is not covered by the non-transferred portions of the digital layer (and the cell pattern layer is between the photopolymerizable layer and the transferred portions of the digital layer).

If used with the barrier layer, the barrier layer is disposed between the photopolymerizable layer and the digital layer to minimize migration of materials between the photopolymerizable layer and the digital layer. Monomers and plasticizers can migrate over time if they are compatible with the materials in an adjacent layer, which can alter the laser radiation sensitivity of the digital layer or can cause smearing and tackifying of the digital layer after imaging.

In other embodiments, the photopolymerizable layer has a thickness from about 0.112 inches to about 0.250 inches or greater (0.28 cm to about 0.64 cm or greater). As is conventional in the art, manufacturers typically identify the printing precursors relative to the total thickness of the printing form on press, which includes the thickness of the support and the photopolymerizable layer. The thickness of the photopolymerizable layer for the printing form is typically less than the manufacturer's designated thickness since the thickness of the support is not included.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0144">The photosensitive element can include one or more additional layers on or adjacent the photosensitive layer. In most embodiments the one or more additional layers are on a side of the photosensitive layer opposite the support. Examples of additional layers include, but are not limited to, a protective layer, a capping layer, an elastomeric layer, a barrier layer, and combinations thereof. The one or more additional layers can be removable, in whole or in part, during one of the steps to convert the element into a printing form, such as treating.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0145">Optionally, the photosensitive element may include an elastomeric capping layer on the at least one photopolymerizable layer. The elastomeric capping layer is typically part of a multilayer cover element that becomes part of the photosensitive printing element during calendering of the photopolymerizable layer. Multilayer cover elements and compositions suitable as the elastomeric capping layer are disclosed in Gruetzmacher et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,427,759 and 4,460,675. In some embodiments, the composition of the elastomeric capping layer includes an elastomeric binder, and optionally a monomer and photoinitiator and other additives, all of which can be the same or different than those used in the bulk photopolymerizable layer. Although the elastomeric capping layer may not necessarily contain photoreactive components, the layer ultimately becomes photosensitive when in contact with the underlying bulk photopolymerizable layer. As such, upon imagewise exposure to actinic radiation, the elastomeric capping layer has cured portions in which polymerization or crosslinking have occurred and uncured portions which remain unpolymerized, i.e., uncrosslinked. Treating causes the unpolymerized portions of the elastomeric capping layer to be removed along with the photopolymerizable layer in order to form the relief surface. The elastomeric capping layer that has been exposed to actinic radiation remains on the surface of the polymerized areas of the photopolymerizable layer and becomes the actual printing surface of the printing plate. In embodiments of the photosensitive element that include the elastomeric capping layer, the cell pattern layer is disposed between the elastomeric capping layer and the digital layer.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0146">For some embodiments of photosensitive elements useful as relief printing forms, the surface of the photopolymerizable layer may be tacky and a release layer having a substantially non-tacky surface can be applied to the surface of the photopolymerizable layer. Such release layer can protect the surface of the photopolymerizable layer from being damaged during removal of an optional temporary coversheet or other digital mask element and can ensure that the photopolymerizable layer does not stick to the coversheet or other digital mask element. During image exposure, the release layer can prevent the digital element with the mask from binding with the photopolymerizable layer. The release layer is insensitive to actinic radiation. The release layer is also suitable as a first embodiment of the barrier layer which is optionally interposed between the photopolymerizable layer and the digital layer. The elastomeric capping layer may also function as a second embodiment of the barrier layer. Examples of suitable materials for the release layer are well known in the art, and include polyamides, polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxyalkyl cellulose, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate, amphoteric interpolymers, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0147">The photosensitive printing element may also include a temporary coversheet on top of an uppermost layer of the element, which may be removed prior to preparation of the printing form. One purpose of the coversheet is to protect the uppermost layer of the photosensitive printing element during storage and handling. Examples of suitable materials for the coversheet include thin films of polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, fluoropolymers, polyamide or polyesters, which can be subbed with release layers. The coversheet is preferably prepared from polyester, such as Mylar&#xae; polyethylene terephthalate film.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0148">The optional support <b>12</b> can be any flexible material that is conventionally used with photosensitive elements <b>10</b> used to prepare printing forms. In most embodiments the support is transparent to actinic radiation to accommodate &#x201c;backflash&#x201d; exposure through the support. Examples of suitable support materials include polymeric films such those formed by addition polymers and linear condensation polymers, transparent foams and fabrics. Under certain end-use conditions metals, such as aluminum, may also be used as a support, even though a metal support is not transparent to radiation. Supports of a film composed of a synthetic resin and an antihalation agent as disclosed by Swatton et al. in EP 0 504 824 B1 are also suitable for use in the present invention. The support can be planar for use in a printing form that is plate-shaped, and can be cylindrical for use in a printing form that is a cylinder, often referred to as a printing sleeve. In one embodiment, the support is a polyester film; and, particularly a polyethylene terephthalate film. In some embodiments, the support itself can include an ultraviolet absorbent material in the film composition and/or the material can be included in a layer on the support.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0149">The support may be in sheet form or in cylindrical form, such as a sleeve. The sleeve may be formed from single layer or multiple layers of flexible material. Flexible sleeves made of polymeric films or composite materials are preferred, as they typically are sufficiently transparent to ultraviolet radiation to accommodate backflash exposure for building a floor in the cylindrical printing element. A preferred sleeve is a multiple layered sleeve as disclosed in EP 2460657 A1. The sleeve may also be made of non-transparent, actinic radiation blocking materials, such as nickel or glass epoxy. The support has a thickness that can be from 0.002 to 0.250 inch (0.0051 to 0.635 cm). The support typically has a thickness from 0.002 to 0.050 inch (0.0051 to 0.127 cm). In some embodiments, the thickness for the sheet form is 0.003 to 0.016 inch (0.0076 to 0.040 cm). In some embodiments, the sleeve has a wall thickness from 4 to 80 mils (0.010 to 0.203 cm) or more. In other embodiments, the sleeve has a wall thickness of 10 to 40 mils (0.025 to 0.10 cm).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0150">Optionally, the element includes an adhesive layer between the support <b>12</b> and the photopolymerizable layer <b>14</b>, or a surface of the support that is adjacent the photopolymerizable layer has an adhesion promoting surface. The adhesive layer on the surface of the support can be a subbing layer of an adhesive material or primer or an anchor layer as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,760,863 and 3,036,913 to give suitable adhesion between the support and the photopolymerizable layer. Alternatively, the surface of the support on which the photopolymerizable layer resides can be treated to promote adhesion between the support and the photopolymerizable layer, with flame-treatment or electron-treatment, e.g., corona-treated.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Process to Make Photosensitive Element</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0151">The process of making the photosensitive element includes a step in which the cell pattern layer is created by printing a microcell pattern with an ink onto a layer of the photosensitive element; or, onto a layer of a separate element or film that forms an assemblage with the photopolymerizable layer to form the photosensitive element. The cell pattern layer is a microcell pattern that is preprinted, i.e., printed microcell pattern, and integrated into the photosensitive element at time of manufacture. In most embodiments, the cell pattern layer is created and incorporated as an integral layer between the digital layer and the photopolymerizable layer of the photosensitive element. In some embodiments, the cell pattern layer is printed onto a surface of the digital layer that will be adjacent to and substantially contacting a surface of the photopolymerizable layer that is opposite the support. In some other embodiments, the cell pattern layer is printed onto a surface of a film support and a digital layer is formed by coating over the cell pattern layer, which the composite of the film support, cell pattern layer, the digital layer form a digital coversheet that is combined with the photopolymerizable layer before or after selective removal by ablation of the digital layer. In yet other embodiments, the cell pattern layer is printed onto a surface of the photopolymerizable layer that is opposite the support, and will be adjacent to the digital layer. In one embodiment, the ink that prints the features of the microcell pattern is opaque to actinic radiation and is transparent to infrared radiation. In other embodiments, the ink that prints the features of the microcell pattern is opaque to actinic radiation and need not be transparent to infrared radiation. The printing of the cell pattern layer can be done online during manufacture of the digital layer, or online during manufacture of the photosensitive element, or offline separate from either manufacture process. The printing of the cell pattern layer can be done in one pass; or, in multiple passes, using one or more print forms to print the particular features. In some embodiments, the cell pattern layer is printed onto a surface, e.g., digital layer, of an element of the precursor that is in web form. In this embodiment, the cell pattern layer is printed onto the surface of a moving web with a printing form that is cylindrical, such as a CYREL&#xae; Round photopolymer form, so that the microcell pattern is continuously printed without seams or disruption to the printed microcell pattern.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0152">It is well within the skill of the practitioner in the art to make or manufacture a photosensitive element printing form precursor that includes a layer of the photopolymerizable composition formed by admixing the binder, monomer, photoinitiator, and other optional additives. Since in most embodiments, the cell pattern layer is applied by printing onto a surface of the digital layer that will be adjacent the photopolymerizable layer, the cell pattern layer should withstand and not be disturbed or destroyed by the elevated temperature/s that is typically used to manufacture the photopolymerizable printing form precursor. In most embodiments, the photopolymerizable mixture is formed into a hot melt, extruded, calendered at temperatures above room temperature to the desired thickness between two sheets, such as the support and the temporary coversheet having the digital layer, or between one flat sheet and a release roll. Alternately, the photopolymerizable material can be extruded and/or calendered to form a layer onto a temporary support and later laminated to the desired final support or to a digital coversheet. The printing form precursor can also be prepared by compounding the components in a suitable mixing device and then pressing the material into the desired shape in a suitable mold.

Generally, digital methods of mask formation either selectively remove or transfer the digital layer, from or to a surface of the photosensitive element opposite the support. In most embodiments, the digital layer is sensitive to infrared laser radiation, particularly near-infrared laser radiation. The method by which the mask is formed with the digital layer on the photosensitive element is not limited.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0173">Digital workflow is the formation of the mask digitally with laser radiation, and may also be referred to as a digital exposure or process, and the use of a digitally formed mask may be referred to as digital direct-to plate image process. Some suitable direct-to-plate image formation methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,262,275; 5,719,009; 5,607,814; van Zoeren, U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,086; and EP 0 741 330 A1. For the digital workflow, the presence of the digital layer is required. An image-bearing mask is formed directly onto the digital layer using an infrared laser of a digital imager device, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,760,880 and 5,654,125. The exposure can be carried out using various types of infrared lasers, which emit in the range 750 to 20,000 nm, preferably in the range 780 to 2,000 nm. Diode lasers may be used, but Nd:YAG lasers emitting at 1060 nm, and Ytterbium fiber lasers emitting at 1090 nm are preferred. Alternative methods of forming the mask digitally, i.e., by transfer of actinic radiation opaque mask, or lamination of a digitally formed mask, as well as formation of the mask by ink-jetting are described above for the photosensitive element.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0174">After mask formation digitally, the photosensitive element is then exposed to actinic radiation through the mask. Imagewise exposure of printing form precursors through such digitally formed mask to actinic radiation can be done in the presence of atmospheric oxygen; in an environment of an inert gas; or in controlled environment having an inert gas and a concentration of oxygen that is less than atmospheric but greater than completely inert gas. In other embodiments, imagewise exposure of the precursor to actinic radiation can be done with or without a coversheet or other protective film that is transparent to actinic radiation, that is placed on or disposed above the mask, with or without lamination, or with or without a vacuum.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0175">On exposure, the transparent areas of the negative or the blank areas of the digital mask allow addition polymerization or crosslinking to take place, while the opaque areas remain uncrosslinked. Imagewise exposing the photopolymerizable element to actinic radiation creates exposed portions that polymerize, and unexposed portions that remain unpolymerized of the photopolymerizable layer. Exposure is of sufficient duration to crosslink the exposed areas down to the support or to the back exposed layer, i.e., floor. Imagewise exposure time is typically much longer than backflash time. Exposure time can vary from a few seconds to tens of minutes, depending on the intensities and wavelengths of the actinic radiation, the nature and volume of the photopolymerizable layer, the desired image resolution, and the distance from the photosensitive element.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0176">The next step in preparing the relief printing form, the photosensitive element of the present invention is exposed to actinic radiation from suitable sources. Actinic radiation sources encompass the ultraviolet and visible wavelength regions. The suitability of a particular actinic radiation source is governed by the photosensitivity of the initiator and the at least one monomer used in preparing the photosensitive element. The preferred photosensitivity of most common relief printing forms is in the UV and deep visible area of the spectrum, as they afford better room-light stability. Examples of suitable visible and UV sources include carbon arcs, mercury-vapor arcs, fluorescent lamps, electron flash units, electron beam units, lasers, and photographic flood lamps. The most suitable sources of UV radiation are the mercury vapor lamps, particularly the sun lamps. Examples of industry standard radiation sources include the Sylvania 350 Blacklight fluorescent lamp (FR48T12/350 VL/VHO/180, 115w), and the Philips UV-A &#x201c;TL&#x201d;-series low-pressure mercury-vapor fluorescent lamps. These radiation sources generally emit long-wave UV radiation between 310-400 nm. Flexographic printing plates sensitive to these particular UV sources use initiators that absorb between 310-400 nm. It is contemplated that the imagewise exposure to infrared radiation for those embodiments which include the infrared-sensitive layer and the overall exposure to actinic radiation can be carried out in the same equipment. The radiation source can be used at a distance of about 1.5 to about 60 inches (about 3.8 to about 153 cm) from the photosensitive element. Exposure temperatures are preferably ambient or slightly higher, i.e., about 20&#xb0; C. to about 35&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0177">Imagewise exposure of the present photosensitive element can occur in the presence of atmospheric oxygen (conventional digital workflow); in the absence of atmospheric oxygen, such as under an inert gas blanket or a layer of fluid, or with an oxygen barrier film or layer; or, in a controlled environment having an inert gas and a concentration of oxygen that is less than atmospheric but greater than a completely inert gas environment (modified digital workflow). Conventional digital workflow methods imagewise expose the photosensitive element to actinic radiation in air under normal atmospheric conditions, which is 78% nitrogen, &#x2dc;21% oxygen, &#x3c;1% each argon and carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases. In other words, the concentration of oxygen is about 210,000 ppm when the imagewise exposure is in air.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0178">In some embodiments, imagewise exposure of the present photosensitive element occurs in a modified digital workflow, which is in a controlled environment of an inert gas and concentration of oxygen. Imagewise exposure of the photosensitive element to actinic radiation is conducted in an environment that includes the presence of an inert gas and an oxygen concentration of between 190,000 to 100 part per million (ppm). The inert gas is a gas that exhibits no or a low reaction rate with the photosensitive element (that is, inert to the polymerization reaction), and is capable of displacing oxygen in the exposure environment (i.e., closed exposure chamber). Suitable inert gases include, but are not limited to, argon, helium, neon, krypton, xenon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and combinations thereof. Although the inert gas and combinations or mixtures of inert gases may include a small portion of oxygen, the presence of the small portion of oxygen does not significantly alter the capability of the inert gas to replace the atmospheric air in the chamber or to maintain the desired oxygen concentration in the chamber. In one embodiment, the inert gas is nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0179">Imagewise exposure of the photosensitive element in the particular environment of inert gas and oxygen concentration between 190,000 and 100 ppm provides the printing form with a relief structure of a plurality of raised surfaces each having a ink carrying top surface area that is structurally similar to an ink carrying top surface area created in a printing form that was prepared with analog workflow. That is, the top surface area of the raised surfaces in the relief printing form prepared according to the present method is flat or substantially flat, and not rounded as is typical of conventional digital workflow wherein the element is exposed in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. Imagewise exposure in the modified digital workflow also provides for the creation and retention of the microcells on the top surface area, i.e. printing surface of the resulting printing form. In one embodiment, the photosensitive element does not include any additional layers on top of the in-situ mask, which additional layers may act as a barrier to the environment to the surface being imagewise exposed.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0180">Exposure devices that provide a chamber for exposing the photosensitive element in a controlled environment are disclosed. Exposure devices include a closed exposure chamber, a source of actinic radiation, a source of gas for introduction to the closed exposure chamber, and a means for measuring the concentration of oxygen within the closed exposure chamber. The source of actinic radiation is capable of impinging the actinic radiation on a side of the photosensitive element having the in-situ mask while the photosensitive element resides in the closed exposure chamber. The source of actinic radiation can be located adjacent to the photosensitive element. In some embodiments, the source of actinic radiation is located adjacent the closed exposure chamber.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0181">For modified digital workflow, during imagewise exposure of the photosensitive element, the photosensitive element is encased or substantially encased within the closed exposure chamber, such that the closed exposure chamber has an internal environment that is different during exposure from an environment external to the closed exposure chamber. The internal environment in the closed exposure chamber is a particular environment of a gas or gases, i.e., inert gas, and a concentration of oxygen between 190,000 ppm and 100 ppm. The closed exposure chamber encloses the photosensitive element in the internal environment during exposure so as to control or maintain the oxygen concentration in the exposure chamber. The closed exposure chamber can be a separate enclosure appended within or mounted to an existing exposure apparatus, or can be incorporated into the frame of an exposure apparatus, or can be formed from an existing structure integrated in an exposure apparatus, such as a housing. In one embodiment, the closed exposure chamber is an integral part of an exposure apparatus, such that the exposure apparatus can accommodate all workflows, that is, analog workflow process with exposure under vacuum, conventional digital workflow with exposure in air, and modified digital workflow with exposure in the environment of inert gas and oxygen concentration between 190,000 and 100 ppm. The source of actinic radiation can be located within or outside the closed exposure chamber, provided that the source is capable of impinging the actinic radiation onto the side of the photosensitive element having the in-situ mask. The source of actinic radiation is or can be positioned adjacent the closed exposure chamber, and in particular is or can be positioned adjacent the photosensitive element. In particular, the source of actinic radiation should be located, positioned, or positionable such that the source can expose the photosensitive element through the in-situ mask while the element is enclosed in the chamber.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0182">For printing form precursors that will be used as relief printing forms, the method usually includes a back exposure and a front image-wise exposure. The back exposure or &#x201c;backflash&#x201d; can take place before, after, or during image-wise exposure. Backflash prior to image-wise exposure is generally preferred. A backflash is an overall or blanket exposure of actinic radiation through the support of the photopolymerizable precursor, for a time that can range from a few seconds to about 30 minutes. The backflash creates a shallow layer of polymerized material, or a floor, on the support side of the photopolymerizable layer and sensitizes the photopolymerizable layers, helps highlight dot resolution and also establishes the depth of the relief surface for the printing form. The floor improves adhesion of the photopolymerizable layer to the support, and provides better mechanical integrity to the photosensitive element. The floor thickness varies with the time of exposure, exposure source, the thickness of the photopolymerizable layer, etc. In some embodiments, the backflash exposure suitable to establish the floor is conducted during manufacture of the precursor, after the precursor is structurally assembled and includes photopolymerizable layer adjacent the support with the at least one indicia. In most other embodiments, a backflash exposure of minimal time and/or energy is conducted during manufacture of the precursor to assure adhesion of the photopolymerizable layer to the support, and another backflash exposure of a time and/or energy is conducted by the user during conversion from precursor to printing form to establish the floor and depth of the relief.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0183">Following overall exposure to UV radiation through the image-bearing mask, the photosensitive printing element is treated to remove unpolymerized areas in the photopolymerizable layer and thereby form a relief image. The treating step is not limited, and includes conventional steps to transform the exposed photosensitive element into the desired printing form. Treating can include treatment with one or more solutions, such as washout or by applying heat, etc. as appropriate for the particular type of photosensitive element that converts the imaged photosensitive layer to a printing form. Treatment of the photosensitive printing element can include (1) &#x201c;wet&#x201d; development wherein the photopolymerizable layer is contacted with a suitable developer solution to washout unpolymerized areas and (2) &#x201c;dry&#x201d; development wherein the photopolymerizable layer is heated to a development temperature which causes the unpolymerized areas to melt or soften or flow and is contacted with an development medium to blot or wick away the unpolymerized material. Dry development may also be called thermal development.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0184">Wet development is usually carried out at about room temperature. The developer solution can include an organic solvent, an aqueous or a semi-aqueous solution, or water. The choice of the developer solution will depend primarily on the chemical nature of the photopolymerizable composition to be removed. A suitable organic solvent developer includes an aromatic or an aliphatic hydrocarbon, an aliphatic or an aromatic halohydrocarbon solvent, or a mixture of such solvents with a suitable alcohol. A suitable semi-aqueous developer can contain water and a water miscible organic solvent and an alkaline material. A suitable aqueous developer can contain water and an alkaline material. Other suitable aqueous developer solution combinations are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,796,602. Development time can vary, but it is preferably in the range of about 2 to about 25 minutes. The developer solution can be applied in any convenient manner, including immersion, spraying, and brush or roller application. Brushing aids can be used to remove the unpolymerized portions of the photosensitive printing element. Washout can be carried out in an automatic processing unit which uses developer and mechanical brushing action to remove the unexposed portions of the resulting relief printing form, leaving a relief constituting the exposed image and the floor.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0185">Following treatment by developing in solution, the printing forms are generally blotted or wiped dry, and then more fully dried in a forced air or infrared oven. Drying times and temperatures may vary, however, typically the plate can be dried for about 60 minutes to about 120 minutes at about 60&#xb0; C. High temperatures are not recommended because the support can shrink, and this can cause registration problems.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0186">In thermal development, the photopolymerizable layer can be heated to a development temperature typically between about 40&#xb0; C. and 200&#xb0; C. which causes the unpolymerized areas to liquefy, that is, to melt, soften, or flow. The photopolymerizable layer can then be contacted with a development medium, such as an absorbent material, to remove the unpolymerized photopolymerizable composition. The polymerized areas of the photopolymerizable layer have a higher melting temperature than the unpolymerized areas and therefore do not melt at the development temperatures (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,859 and WO 98/13730). Apparatus suitable for thermal development of photosensitive printing elements is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,279,697 and 6,797,454.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0187">The printing forms prepared by the method of the present invention can be uniformly post-exposed to ensure that the photopolymerization process is complete and that the photosensitive printing form will remain stable during printing and storage. This post-exposure step can utilize the same radiation source as the main exposure. Detackification is an optional post-development treatment which can be applied if the surface of the flexographic printing plate is still tacky, such tackiness not generally being removed in post-exposure. Tackiness can be eliminated by methods well known in the art, such as treatment with bromine or chlorine solutions, and by exposure to radiation sources having a wavelength not longer than 300 nm.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0188">After treating, the printing form has a relief surface of raised elements for carrying and transferring ink imagewise to a substrate, and recessed portions that do not print. The features of the printed cell pattern layer create microcells, which are image elements that alter a print surface that can appear as dimples and/or very tiny reverses, and that are each smaller in at least one dimension than the spacing between halftone dots of the highest line screen halftone areas (if areas of halftone dots are being printed) by the relief printing form. The microcells are each smaller in at least one dimension than the spacing between smallest periodic structures on the printing form.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0189">The present method provides the printing form with the raised printing surfaces composed of fine raised surface elements, in which each raised surface element is well-characterized by its three-dimensional relief shape and has a flat or substantially flat top surface area sufficient to accurately reproduce the desired image on the substrate. No longer is the relief structure in a relief printing form fabricated by digital workflow limited by oxygen inhibition effect on the photopolymerizable layer. The present invention provides for the capability to create the relief surface of the raised surface elements on the printing form that essentially is the recreation of the in-situ mask image, particularly in terms of size of openings in mask relative to the size of the raise surface element (e.g., halftone dot). The present invention avoids the cost and production disadvantages associated with analog workflow, and capitalizes on the efficiencies of digital workflow while avoiding the difficulty of establishing a completely inert environment.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0190">Depending upon many factors, but not limited to, the composition of the photopolymerizable layer; the method used to digitally create the mask; the assembly of the photosensitive element that forms the printing form precursor; the workflow used to imagewise expose the photosensitive element to actinic radiation; the features that were printed in the cell pattern layer provide a one-to-one correspondence, or substantially a one-to-one correspondence with the microcells that are formed in the printing surface of the relief printing form.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0191">The photosensitive element of the present invention is particularly useful in forming a relief printing form for flexographic printing on surfaces which are soft and easily deformable, such as packaging materials, e.g., cardboard and plastic films. The photosensitive elements of the present invention are converted to printing forms that can be used in the form of plates, plates-on-sleeves, plates-on-carriers, plate segments-on-carriers, or as seamless, continuous flexographic printing forms.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0192">Those skilled in the art, having benefit of the teachings of the present invention as hereinabove set forth, can effect numerous modifications thereto.

Each cell pattern unit has a percent mask transparency value which is obtained by dividing the total number of black blocks by the total number of blocks in the pattern. The mask transparency value is one easy way of distinguishing patterns, but it is not all inclusive. In some instances, cell pattern units can have the same percent mask transparency value, but could produce different results, i.e., solid ink density or graininess. Each cell pattern unit was tiled to provide desired coverage and used by the digital imager unit to form an in-situ mask of the digital layer on the 45DPR precursor.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0197">A relief printing plate was prepared for printing each of the five cell patterns as follows. The coversheet was removed from the 45DPR precursor. The precursor was mounted on a drum of an Esko CDI Advance 5080 digital imager unit (from Esko-Graphics, a Danaher company (Gent, Belgium)), that was equipped with Optics 40, High Resolution Optics and Pixel+imager at 4000 pixels per inch, and an in-situ mask was formed on the precursor by laser ablating the infrared ablatable layer by repeating one of the particular cell pattern units as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>e</i></figref>.

The nitrogen gas environment eliminated oxygen from the chamber during exposure so that the resulting relief surface of the printing plate would hold the extremely fine details that were necessary to print cell patterns on the laser ablatable layer of a Digital Coversheet. The precursor was overall exposed through the support at the wavelength and energy described above for a time sufficient to form a floor of photopolymer for the relief plate. The exposed precursor was treated in a CYREL&#xae; processor using CYLOSOL washout solvent, dried, post-exposed, and light finished in accordance with the conditions recommended for 45DPR plate precursors to form a printing plate having a relief surface suitable for flexographic relief printing.

The ink is opaque to actinic radiation, specifically ultraviolet (uv) radiation, but is transparent to the wavelength of laser radiation used in the digital imager, i.e., infrared (IR) radiation. Earlier, the ink was evaluated for its ability to be opaque to ultraviolet radiation and transparent to infrared radiation, by printing the ink as a solid area with the same or substantially the same print density as will be used to print the cell pattern layer on a clear (i.e., transparent) polyester film, and measuring the printed area of ink for UV radiation absorbance, and testing the IR radiation transmittance on the digital imager. The UV radiation absorbance of the ink was about 1.5 units, which means that less than about 4% of the UV radiation passed through the printed solid area of ink, and thus is sufficiently opaque to UV radiation. The area of the printed ink on the film was placed on the drum of the digital imager and then exposed to the IR laser radiation. The solid ink area was shown not effected, i.e., not altered, changed, or ablated, by the IR radiation from the digital imager. This meant that the ink sample does not absorb at the wavelength of light that was used in the digital imager (1064 nanometers).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0201">Separately, an infrared sensitive ablatable composition was prepared and coated as a layer onto a web of a MYLAR&#xae; polyester film substantially as described in Example 1 of U.S. Pat.

The photopolymerizable layer included an elastomeric binder of an ABA block copolymer, monomer/s, photoinitiator, and other additives.

This is resulted in a construction structure consisting of in order the base support, the photopolymerizable layer, and the siliconized PET film, that will be referred to as a Lamination Plate throughout the remainder of the Example. The Lamination Plate is useful, because the siliconized PET film can be easily removed without affecting the photopolymerizable and base support layers; and, other coversheets (having the laser ablatable layer and a particular cell pattern layer) can then be easily laminated to the photopolymerizable layer in order to test printing plate precursors having different coversheets with the same type of photopolymerizable composition.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Preparation of Test Printing Plate Precursors</heading><p id="p-0195" num="0206">A Lamination Plate, size 8&#xd7;25 inch, was placed on a 20&#xd7;30 inch sheet of stainless steel (2 mils thick). The siliconized PET film was removed from the Lamination Plate, uncovering the photopolymerizable layer of the Lamination Plate. A Cromalin&#x2122; Laminator was heated to 100&#xb0; C. A Test Digital Coversheet (prepared as described above), which was at least 1 inch larger than the Lamination Plate in all directions, was held so that its leading edge contacted a leading edge of the Lamination Plate; and, was oriented so that the layer of the printed cell pattern would be disposed between the infrared-sensitive ablation layer of the Test Coversheet and the photopolymerizable layer of the Lamination Plate. The assembly of the Lamination Plate with the Test Coversheet was then fed, leading edge first, through the heated laminator with minimal pressure.

The in-situ mask was a simple solid pattern, in which the infrared-sensitive ablation layer was removed, i.e., ablated, from the entire plate surface.

This is because the cell pattern units (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>e</i></figref>) that were designed for printing on the laser ablation layer were not faithfully reproduced during the printing process as shown in the images of the Digital Coversheets of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>d </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>e</i></figref>, respectively. The cell pattern units of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>e </i></figref>may have been faithfully reproduced by printing with the specific ink on the infrared-sensitive laser ablation layer of the Digital Coversheet and thus effective at creating suitable microcell pattern on the relief printing plate, if the printing of the cell pattern on the Digital Coversheets was done on a better press with improved resolution as compared to the Mark Andy 830 that used during this test, and could faithfully print the desired cell patterns.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0214">In general, if the percent mask transparency value is too low, little improvement in solid ink density is observed; and if the value is too high, it can be difficult to print the cell pattern since the ink tends to flow together and can becomes a solid (instead of printing individual elements of the pattern).</p><p id="p-0205" num="0215">Example 1 (Test Plate 1 through Test Plate 5) demonstrated that significant increases in solid ink density can be accomplished by a relief printing form that incorporates a microcell pattern as an integral layer of a printing form precursor having a digitally imageable layer, i.e., an infrared-sensitive laser ablatable layer. Example 1 also demonstrated that a cell pattern, which is useful in forming microcell pattern on a relief printing form, can be incorporated into a printing form precursor by printing a cell pattern image with a particular ink onto a surface of a laser ablatable layer, which is then joined with a photopolymerizable layer to create the digital precursor. Best results are achieved with the cells of the printed cell pattern that have a size that is less than 20 microns, and more preferably less than 10 microns.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0216">The printed image of cell pattern that is included with the digital coversheet should be transparent to the wavelength of the laser radiation, i.e., near infrared radiation, used to ablate the laser ablatable layer from the precursor and form the in-situ mask, so that the cell pattern is not also removed during ablation; and also should be opaque or sufficiently opaque to actinic radiation, e.g., ultraviolet radiation, so that the printed cell pattern can produce microcell structures on the printing surface of the printing form that will result in printing with increased solid ink density.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0207" num="0217">This example demonstrates the method of creating a digital printing form precursor having a layer of a cell pattern, which was printed with an ink and integrated between an infrared-sensitive laser ablatable layer and a photopolymerizable layer of the precursor.

However, mis-registration of the two different cell patterns and web stretch resulted in a semi-random pattern as shown in the reproduction of the microscopic image taken of the Digital Coversheet as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>f</i></figref>.

However, printing was done with an anilox roll having 2000 cells per inch with a volume of 0.9 BCM and a cell angle of 60 degrees, which was different from the anilox roll used to print the cell pattern on digital coversheet in Example 1.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0222">The Test Printing Plate Precursors were formed of the Laminated Plate and the Digital Coversheet as described above, and allowed to age for two weeks at ambient conditions.
