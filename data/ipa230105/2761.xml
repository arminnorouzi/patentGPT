Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0001">The use of synthetic oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents has witnessed remarkable progress over recent decades leading to the development of molecules acting by diverse mechanisms including RNase H activating gapmers, splice switching oligonucleotides, microRNA inhibitors, siRNA or aptamers (S. T. Crooke, <i>Antisense drug technology: principles, strategies, and applications, </i>2nd ed. ed., Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC Press, 2008). However, oligonucleotides are inherently unstable towards nucleolytic degradation in biological systems. Furthermore, they show a highly unfavorable pharmacokinetic behavior. In order to improve on these drawbacks a wide variety of chemical modifications have been investigated in recent decades. Arguably one of the most successful modification is the introduction of phosphorothioate linkages, where one of the non-bridging phosphate oxygen atoms is replaced with a sulfur atom (F. Eckstein, <i>Antisense and Nucleic Acid Drug Development </i>2009, 10, 117-121.). Such phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides show an increased protein binding as well as a distinctly higher stability to nucleolytic degradation and thus a substantially higher half-live in plasma, tissues and cells than their unmodified phosphodiester analogues. These crucial features have allowed for the development of the first generation of oligonucleotide therapeutics as well as opened the door for their further improvement through later generation modifications such as Locked Nucleic Acids (LNAs). Replacement of a phosphodiester linkage with a phosphorothioate, however, creates a chiral center at the phosphorous atom. As a consequence, all approved phosphorothioate oligonucleotide therapeutics are used as mixtures of a huge amount of diastereoisomeric compounds, which all potentially have different (and possibly opposing) physiochemical and pharmacological properties.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0002">While the stereospecific synthesis of single stereochemically defined phosphorothioate oligonucleotides is now possible (N. Oka, M. Yamamoto, T. Sato, T. Wada, <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>2008, 130, 16031-16037) it remains a challenge to identify the stereoisomer with optimal properties within the huge number of possible diastereoisomers. In this context, the reduction of the d iastereoisomeric complexity by the use of non-chiral thiophosphate linkages is of great interest. For example, the symmetrical non-bridging dithioate modification (see e.g. W. T. Wiesler, M. H. Caruthers, <i>J. Org. Chem. </i>1996, 61, 4272-4281), where both non-bridging oxygen atoms within the phosphate linkage are replaced by sulfur has been applied to immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (A. M. Krieg, S. Matson, E. Fisher, <i>Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. </i>1996, 6, 133-139), siRNA (e.g. X. Yang, M. Sierant, M. Janicka, L. Peczek, C. Martinez, T. Hassell, N. Li, X. Li, T. Wang, B. Nawrot, <i>ACS Chem. Biol. </i>2012, 7, 1214-1220) and aptamers (e.g. X. Yang, S. Fennewald, B. A. Luxon, J. Aronson, N. K. Herzog, D. G. Gorenstein, <i>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. </i>1999, 9, 3357-3362). Interestingly, attempts to make use of this non-chiral modification in the context of antisense oligonucleotides have met with limited success to date (see e.g. M. K. Ghosh, K. Ghosh, O. Dahl, J. S. Cohen, <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>1993, 21, 5761-5766. and J. P. Vaughn, J. Stekler, S. Demirdji, J. K. Mills, M. H. Caruthers, J. D. Iglehart, J. R. Marks, <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>1996, 24, 4558-4564).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">To our surprise we have now found that non-bridging phosphorodithioates can be introduced into oligonucleotide, in particular to oligonucleotide gapmers or mixmers in general and LNA-DNA-LNA gapmers or LNA/DNA mixmers in particular. The modification is well tolerated and the resulting molecules show great potential for therapeutic applications, while every non-bridging phosphorodithioate modification reduces the size of the overall library of possible diastereoisomers by 50%. When the modification is placed in the LNA flanks of gapmers, the resulting oligonucleotides turn out to be generally more potent than the corresponding all-phosphorothioate parent. In general, the modification is additionally well tolerated within the gap region and even more surprisingly can lead to an improved potency as well, when positioned appropriately.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">We have thus surprisingly found that the invention provides oligonucleotides with improved physiochemical and pharmacological properties, including, for example, improved potency. In some aspects, the oligonucleotide of the invention retains the activity or efficacy, and may be as potent or is more potent, than the identical compound where the phosphodithioate linkages of formula (IA or IBIB) are replaced with the conventional stereorandom phosphorothioate linkages (phosphorothioate reference compound). Every introduction of the non-bridging phosphorodithioate modification removes one of the chiral centers at phosphorous and thereby reduces the diastereoisomeric complexity of the compound by 50%. Additionally, whenever a dithioate modification is introduced, the oligonucleotide appears to be taken up dramatically better into cells, in particular into hepatocytes, muscle cells, heart cells for example.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The introduction of non-bridging dithioate modifications into the LNA flanks of gapmers appears to be particularly beneficial, leading to molecules demonstrating a higher target reduction and a substantially better uptake behavior, higher stability and good safety profile.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The chemical synthesis of non-bridging phosphorodithioate linkages in oligonucleotides is best achieved by solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis techniques using appropriate thiophosphoramidite building blocks. The successful application of such thiophosphoramidites has been described for regular DNA (X. Yang, <i>Curr Protoc Nucleic Acid Chem </i>2016, 66, 4.71.71-74.71.14.) as well as RNA (X.

Therefore, a very low &#x394;G&#xb0; of the reaction between an oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid reflects a strong hybridization between the oligonucleotide and target nucleic acid. &#x394;G&#xb0; is the energy associated with a reaction where aqueous concentrations are IM, the pH is 7, and the temperature is 37&#xb0; C. The hybridization of oligonucleotides to a target nucleic acid is a spontaneous reaction and for spontaneous reactions &#x394;G&#xb0; is less than zero. &#x394;G&#xb0; can be measured experimentally, for example, by use of the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) method as described in Hansen et al., 1965<i>, Chem. Comm. </i>36-38 and Holdgate et al., 2005<i>, Drug Discov Today. The skilled person will know that commercial equipment is available for &#x394;G&#xb0; measurements. &#x394;G&#xb0; can also be estimated numerically by using the nearest neighbor model as described by SantaLucia, </i>1998<i>, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. </i>95: 1460-1465 using appropriately derived thermodynamic parameters described by Sugimoto et al., 1995<i>, Biochemistry </i>34:11211-11216 and McTigue et al., 2004<i>, Biochemistry </i>43:5388-5405. In order to have the possibility of modulating its intended nucleic acid target by hybridization, oligonucleotides of the present invention hybridize to a target nucleic acid with estimated &#x394;G&#xb0; values below &#x2212;10 kcal for oligonucleotides that are 10-30 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments the degree or strength of hybridization is measured by the standard state Gibbs free energy &#x394;G&#xb0;. The oligonucleotides may hybridize to a target nucleic acid with estimated &#x394;G&#xb0; values below the range of &#x2212;10 kcal, such as below &#x2212;15 kcal, such as below &#x2212;20 kcal and such as below &#x2212;25 kcal for oligonucleotides that are 8-30 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments the oligonucleotides hybridize to a target nucleic acid with an estimated &#x394;G&#xb0; value of &#x2212;10 to &#x2212;60 kcal, such as &#x2212;12 to &#x2212;40, such as from &#x2212;15 to &#x2212;30 kcal or &#x2212;16 to &#x2212;27 kcal such as &#x2212;18 to &#x2212;25 kcal.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0179">Sugar Modifications</p><p id="p-0219" num="0180">The oligomer of the invention may comprise one or more nucleosides which have a modified sugar moiety, i.e. a modification of the sugar moiety when compared to the ribose sugar moiety found in DNA and RNA.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0181">Numerous nucleosides with modification of the ribose sugar moiety have been made, primarily with the aim of improving certain properties of oligonucleotides, such as affinity and/or nuclease resistance.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0182">Such modifications include those where the ribose ring structure is modified, e.g. by replacement with a hexose ring (HNA), or a bicyclic ring, which typically have a biradical bridge between the C2 and C4 carbons on the ribose ring (LNA), or an unlinked ribose ring which typically lacks a bond between the C2 and C3 carbons (e.g. UNA). Other sugar modified nucleosides include, for example, bicyclohexose nucleic acids (WO 2011/017521) or tricyclic nucleic acids (WO 2013/154798). Modified nucleosides also include nucleosides where the sugar moiety is replaced with a non-sugar moiety, for example in the case of peptide nucleic acids (PNA), or morpholino nucleic acids.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0183">Sugar modifications also include modifications made via altering the substituent groups on the ribose ring to groups other than hydrogen, or the 2&#x2032;-OH group naturally found in DNA and RNA nucleosides. Substituents may, for example be introduced at the 2&#x2032;, 3&#x2032;, 4&#x2032; or 5&#x2032; positions.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0184">2&#x2032; Sugar Modified Nucleosides.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0185">A 2&#x2032; sugar modified nucleoside is a nucleoside which has a substituent other than H or &#x2014;OH at the 2&#x2032; position (2&#x2032; substituted nucleoside) or comprises a 2&#x2032; linked biradical capable of forming a bridge between the 2&#x2032; carbon and a second carbon in the ribose ring, such as LNA (2&#x2032;-4&#x2032; biradical bridged) nucleosides.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0186">Indeed, much focus has been spent on developing 2&#x2032; substituted nucleosides, and numerous 2&#x2032; substituted nucleosides have been found to have beneficial properties when incorporated into oligonucleotides. For example, the 2&#x2032; modified sugar may provide enhanced binding affinity and/or increased nuclease resistance to the oligonucleotide. Examples of 2&#x2032; substituted modified nucleosides are 2&#x2032;-O-alkyl-RNA, 2&#x2032;-O-methyl-RNA, 2&#x2032;-alkoxy-RNA, 2&#x2032;-O-methoxyethyl-RNA (MOE), 2&#x2032;-amino-DNA, 2&#x2032;-fluoro-RNA and 2&#x2032;-F-ANA nucleoside.

These nucleosides are also termed bridged nucleic acid or bicyclic nucleic acid (BNA) in the literature. The locking of the conformation of the ribose is associated with an enhanced affinity of hybridization (duplex stabilization) when the LNA is incorporated into an oligonucleotide for a complementary RNA or DNA molecule.

The one or more sugar modified nucleosides in region F and F&#x2032; enhance the affinity of the oligonucleotide for the target nucleic acid (i.e. are affinity enhancing sugar modified nucleosides). In some embodiments, the one or more sugar modified nucleosides in region F and F&#x2032; are 2&#x2032; sugar modified nucleosides, such as high affinity 2&#x2032; sugar modifications, such as independently selected from LNA and 2&#x2032;-MOE.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0265">In a gapmer design, the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; most nucleosides of the gap region are DNA nucleosides, and are positioned adjacent to a sugar modified nucleoside of the 5&#x2032; (F) or 3&#x2032; (F&#x2032;) region respectively. The flanks may further defined by having at least one sugar modified nucleoside at the end most distant from the gap region, i.e. at the 5&#x2032; end of the 5&#x2032; flank and at the 3&#x2032; end of the 3&#x2032; flank.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0266">Regions F-G-F&#x2032; form a contiguous nucleotide sequence.

RNaseH is a cellular enzyme which recognizes the duplex between DNA and RNA, and enzymatically cleaves the RNA molecule. Suitable gapmers may have a gap region (G) of at least 5 or 6 contiguous DNA nucleosides, such as 5-16 contiguous DNA nucleosides, such as 6-15 contiguous DNA nucleosides, such as 7-14 contiguous DNA nucleosides, such as 8-12 contiguous DNA nucleotides, such as 8-12 contiguous DNA nucleotides in length. The gap region G may, in some embodiments consist of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16 contiguous DNA nucleosides. Cytosine (C) DNA in the gap region may in some instances be methylated, such residues are either annotated as 5-methyl-cytosine (<sup>me</sup>C or with an e instead of a c). Methylation of Cytosine DNA in the gap is advantageous if cg dinucleotides are present in the gap to reduce potential toxicity, the modification does not have significant impact on efficacy of the oligonucleotides.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0273">In some embodiments the gap region G may consist of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 16 contiguous phosphorothioate linked DNA nucleosides.

Modified nucleosides which have been reported as being capable of recruiting RNaseH when included within a gap region include, for example, alpha-L-LNA, C4&#x2032; alkylated DNA (as described in PCT/EP2009/050349 and Vester et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 18 (2008) 2296-2300, both incorporated herein by reference), arabinose derived nucleosides like ANA and 2&#x2032;F-ANA (Mangos et al. 2003 J. AM. CHEM. SOC. 125, 654-661), UNA (unlocked nucleic acid) (as described in Fluiter et al., Mol. Biosyst., 2009, 10, 1039 incorporated herein by reference). UNA is unlocked nucleic acid, typically where the bond between C2 and C3 of the ribose has been removed, forming an unlocked &#x201c;sugar&#x201d; residue. The modified nucleosides used in such gapmers may be nucleosides which adopt a 2&#x2032; endo (DNA like) structure when introduced into the gap region, i.e. modifications which allow for RNaseH recruitment). In some embodiments the DNA Gap region (G) described herein may optionally contain 1 to 3 sugar modified nucleosides which adopt a 2&#x2032; endo (DNA like) structure when introduced into the gap region.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0275">Region G&#x2014;&#x201c;Gap-breaker&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0303" num="0276">Alternatively, there are numerous reports of the insertion of a modified nucleoside which confers a 3&#x2032; endo conformation into the gap region of gapmers, whilst retaining some RNaseH activity.

Gap-breaker oligonucleotides retain sufficient region of DNA nucleosides within the gap region to allow for RNaseH recruitment. The ability of gapbreaker oligonucleotide design to recruit RNaseH is typically sequence or even compound specific&#x2014;see Rukov et al. 2015 Nucl. Acids Res. Vol. 43 pp. 8476-8487, which discloses &#x201c;gapbreaker&#x201d; oligonucleotides which recruit RNaseH which in some instances provide a more specific cleavage of the target RNA. Modified nucleosides used within the gap region of gap-breaker oligonucleotides may for example be modified nucleosides which confer a 3&#x2032;endo confirmation, such 2&#x2032;-O-methyl (OMe) or 2&#x2032;-O-MOE (MOE) nucleosides, or beta-D LNA nucleosides (the bridge between C2&#x2032; and C4&#x2032; of the ribose sugar ring of a nucleoside is in the beta conformation), such as beta-D-oxy LNA or ScET nucleosides.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0277">As with gapmers containing region G described above, the gap region of gap-breaker or gap-disrupted gapmers, have a DNA nucleosides at the 5&#x2032; end of the gap (adjacent to the 3&#x2032; nucleoside of region F), and a DNA nucleoside at the 3&#x2032; end of the gap (adjacent to the 5&#x2032; nucleoside of region F&#x2032;).

In a preferred embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide, or the contiguous nucleotide sequence thereof, is a mixmer oligonucleotide wherein either (A<sup>1</sup>) or (A<sup>2</sup>) is a DNA nucleoside, or both (A<sup>1</sup>) and (A<sup>2</sup>) are DNA nucleosides.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0446">In the context of the present invention an antisense oligonucleotide is a single stranded oligonucleotide which is complementary to a nucleic acid target, such as a target RNA, and is capable of modulating (e.g. splice modulating of a pre-mRNA target) or inhibiting the expression of the nucleic acid target (e.g. a mRNA target, a premRNA target, a viral RNA target, or a long non coding RNA target). Depending on the target the length of the oligonucleotide or the length of the region thereof which is complementary to (i.e. antisense&#x2014;preferably the complementary region is fully complementary to the target) may be 7-30 nucleotides (the region which is referred to as the contiguous nucleotide sequence). For example LNA nucleotide inhibitors of microRNAs may be as short as 7 contiguous complementary nucleotides (and may be as long as 30 nucleotides), RNaseH recruiting oligonucleotides are typically at least 12 contiguous complementary nucleotides in length, such as 12-26 nucleotides in length. Splice modulating antisense oligonucleotides typically has a contiguous nucleotide region of 10-30 complementary nucleotides.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0447">Splice modulating oligonucleotides, also known as splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) are short, synthetic, antisense, modified nucleic acids that base-pair with a pre-mRNA and disrupt the normal splicing repertoire of the transcript by blocking the RNA-RNA base-pairing or protein-RNA binding interactions that occur between components of the splicing machinery and the pre-mRNA. Splicing of pre-mRNA is required for the proper expression of the vast majority of protein-coding genes, and thus, targeting the process offers a means to manipulate protein production from a gene. Splicing modulation is particularly valuable in cases of disease caused by mutations that lead to disruption of normal splicing or when interfering with the normal splicing process of a gene transcript may be therapeutic. SSOs offer an effective and specific way to target and alter splicing in a therapeutic manner. See Haven's and Hasting NAR (2016) 44, 6549-6563. SSOs may be complementary to an Exon/Intron boundary in the target pre-mRNA or may target splicing enhanced or silencer elements (collectively referred to as cis-acting splice elements) within the pre-mRNA that regulates spleing of the pre-mRNA. Splice modulation may result in exon skipping, or exon inclusion and thereby modulates alternate splicing of a pre-mRNA. SSOs function by non nuclease mediated modulation of the target pre-mRNA, and therefore are not capable of recruiting RNaseH, they are often either fully modified oligonucleotides, i.e. each nucleoside comprises a modified sugar moiety, such as a 2&#x2032;sugar substituted sugar moiety (for example fully 2&#x2032;-O-MOE oligonucleotides of e.g. 15-25 nucleotides in length, often 18-22 or 20 nucleotides in length, based on a phosphorothioate back bone), or LNA mixmer oligonucleotides (oligonucleotides 10-30 nucleotides in length which comprises DNA and LNA nucleosides, and optimally other 2&#x2032; sugar modified nucleosides, such as 2&#x2032;-O-MOE. Also envisaged are LNA oligonucleotides which do not comprises DNA nucleosides, but comprise of LNA and other 2&#x2032;sugar modified nucleosides, such as 2&#x2032;-O-MOE nucleosides.

The enhanced nuclease resistance of achiral phosphordithioates is expected to provide notable pharmacological benefits, such as enhanced activity and prolonged duration of action, and possibly avoidance of toxic degradation products.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="1">Example 16: In Vivo&#x2014;Long Term Liver Activity (ApoB)</heading><heading id="h-0044" level="2">Compounds Tested (Sequence Motif=SEQ ID NO 1):</heading><p id="p-0718" num="0946"></p><p id="p-0719" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00016" num="00016"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="126pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Ref.</entry><entry>GCattggtatTCA</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>#1</entry><entry>G*C*attggtatT*C*A</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>#2</entry><entry>GCattggtatTCA</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>#3</entry><entry>G*C*attggtatT*C*A</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="left" id="FOO-00024">Upper case letter: beta-D-oxy LNA nucleoside; lower case letter DNA nucleoside;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="left" id="FOO-00025">* =&#x2003;achiral phosphorodithioate modified linkages; all other linkages phosphorothioate.

Cells were seeded in 96 well plates (25,000 cells per well) and the oligonucleotide added. Three days after addition of oligonucleotides, total RNA was isolated from 96 well plates using Qiagen setup. The percentage of splice-switching was analyzed by droplet digital PCR (BioRad) with a FAM-labelled probe spanning the exon 6-8 junction (exon 7 skipping) and the total amount of TNFRSF1B (wild type and exon 7 skipped) was analyzed with a HEX-labelled probe and primers from IDT spanning exon 2-3. The presence of a phosphorodithioate linkage has an effect on the ability of an oligonucleotide to introduce exon skipping (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>). At 5 &#x3bc;M, the most potent PS2 oligonucleotide increases the exon skipping by more than two fold, where the parent (SSO #26) shows approximately 10% exon skipping, SSO #25 shows more than 20% exon 7 skipping. At 25 &#x3bc;M, the most potent oligonucleotide reaches more than 60% exon skipping (SSO #7), again more than 2 fold better than the parent. Oligonucleotide SSO #22, in which all DNA nucleotides have a dithioate modification (PS2) instead of the phosphorothioate modification (PS) shows increased activity, compared to the parent, and is the third most potent oligonucleotide at 5 &#x3bc;M, and second most potent splice switching oligonucleotide at 25 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>). Exchanging all linkages between LNA nucleosides with a PS2 linkage (SSO #16) however reduced the potency in splice switching compared to the parent oligonucleotide (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>). Furthermore, it is clear that introducing a PS2 at certain positions, may not be beneficial for the exon skipping activity and at 5 &#x3bc;M, SSO #1, SSO #9, SSO #11, SSO #12 and SSO #14 do not show significant splice switching activity at the lower concentration, but all were effective at the higher concentration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>). This examples illustrate that the PS2 linkage is compatible with splice modulating oligonucleotides and further emphasizes a clear benefit in introducing PS2 linkages adjacent to DNA nucleosides, or between adjacent DNA nucleosides, within the mixmer oligonucleotide, such as LNA mixmers&#x2014;these designs were notably more effective in modulating splicing.</p><heading id="h-0059" level="2">Materials and Methods</heading><p id="p-0748" num="0969">Assay to detect TNFRSF1B exon 7 skipping by droplet digital PCR</p><p id="p-0749" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00023" num="00023"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="168pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Forward&#x2003;sequence:</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO&#x2003;6)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>CAACTCCAGAACCCAGCACT</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Reverse&#x2003;sequence:</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO&#x2003;7)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>CTTATCGGCAGGCAAGTGAG</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Probe&#x2003;Sequence:</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO&#x2003;8)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>GCACAAGGGCTTCTCAACTGGAAGAG</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Fluorophore:</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>FAM</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0750" num="0970">Assay to detect total amount of TNFRSF1B</p><p id="p-0751" num="0971">IDT assay Hs.PT.58.40638488 spanning exon 2-3</p><heading id="h-0060" level="1">Example 22: The Stability of Mixmer Oligos Containing Phosphorodithioates Modifications</heading><p id="p-0752" num="0972">Three dithioate modified oligonucleotides of the parent (SSO #26) were selected for stability assay using S1 nuclease (table 2). The selected oligonucleotides were incubated at 37&#xb0; C. at 25 &#x3bc;M for either 30 min or 2 h in 100 &#x3bc;L reaction buffer containing 1&#xd7;S1 Nuclease buffer, and 10 U of S1 nuclease according to manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen, Catalogue no. 18001-016). The S1 nuclease reaction was stopped by adding 2 &#x3bc;L of 500 mM EDTA solution to the 100 &#x3bc;L reaction mixture. 2.5 &#x3bc;L of the reaction mixture was diluted in Novex&#x2122; TBE-Urea 2&#xd7; sample buffer (LC6876 Invitrogen) and loaded onto Novex&#x2122; 15% TBE-Urea gels (EC6885BOX, Invitrogen). The gels were run for approximately 1 hour at 180 V, afterwards gel images were acquired with SYBR gold staining (S11494, Invitrogen) and the ChemiDoc&#x2122; Touch Imaging System (BIO-RAD).</p><p id="p-0753" num="0973">The stability of the PS2 containing oligonucleotides was tested with 30 and 120 minutes incubation of the S1 nuclease. The position of the PS2 linkage is influencing the stability, and the presence of a PS2 3&#x2032; to a DNA nucleotide (SSO #14) has the greatest impact (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>). After 30 minutes of incubation with S1 nuclease, the parent oligonucleotide is almost degraded, whereas the PS2 modified oligos shows a strong band representing the 13&#x2032;mer. In addition, SSO #14 shows stronger bands representing degradation products indicating a stabilization of the remaining oligo, even after the initial cleavage by S1 nuclease (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, lane 5+9).</p><p id="p-0754" num="0974">These data illustrate that the presence of a phosphorodithioates when introduced into oligonucleotides, such as mixmer oligonucleotides, provides protection against endonuclease activity&#x2014;and surprisingly this is achieved whilst maintaining efficacy of the oligonucleotides, indeed as shown in the present experiments, the splice modulating activity may be notably improved. It is considered that PS2 linkages adjacent to DNA nucleosides, or between DNA nucleosides, in a mixmer oligonuclotides, herein illustrated by mixmers comprising LNA and DNA nucleosides enhances endonuclease stability. For use in antisense oligonucleotides, such as mixmers (SSOs or antimiRs for example), it is therefore considered that using PS2 linkages between contiguous DNA nucleosides is beneficial. Such benefits can also be provided by using a 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; PS2 linkage adjacent to a DNA nucleoside which is flanked 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; (respectively) by a 2&#x2032;sugar modified nucleoside, such as LNA or MOE.</p><p id="p-0755" num="0975">The invention therefore further provides improved antisense oligonucleotides for use in occupation based mechanisms, such as in splice
