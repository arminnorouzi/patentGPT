Although the diode Di<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a PN junction diode, it is not limited thereto, and may be another diode such as a Zener diode or a Schottky barrier diode. In the first embodiment, the material of the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>1</b> and the diode Di<b>1</b> includes silicon (Si).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The diode Di<b>1</b> is connected in antiparallel to the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>1</b>. That is, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>1</b> is a P-channel type semiconductor switching element, the cathode and anode of the diode Di<b>1</b> are connected to the collector and the emitter of the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>1</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The second parallel connection body <b>2</b> to the sixth parallel connection body <b>6</b> include the semiconductor switching elements Tr<b>2</b> to Tr<b>6</b> and the diodes Di<b>2</b> to Di<b>6</b>, respectively, similarly to the first parallel connection body <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first parallel connection body <b>1</b>, the second parallel connection body <b>2</b>, the third parallel connection body <b>3</b>, and the fourth parallel connection body <b>4</b> are connected in series in this order from the high potential terminal P to the low potential terminal N. The high potential terminal P is a first terminal having a first potential, and the low potential terminal N is a second terminal having a second potential which is lower than the first potential. The connection portion between the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> and the third parallel connection body <b>3</b> is connected to an AC terminal AC.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b> and the sixth parallel connection body <b>6</b> are connected in series in this order from the connection portion between the first parallel connection body <b>1</b> and the second parallel connection body <b>2</b>, to the connection portion between the third parallel connection body <b>3</b> and the fourth parallel connection body <b>4</b>. The connection portion between the fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b> and the sixth parallel connection body <b>6</b> is connected to an intermediate terminal C. The intermediate terminal C is a third terminal having a third potential that is smaller than the first potential of the high potential terminal P and larger than the second potential of the low potential terminal N.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Next, in the semiconductor device according to the first embodiment, the energization path of the first parallel connection body <b>1</b>, the second parallel connection body <b>2</b>, and the fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When a current flows from the high potential terminal P to the AC terminal AC, the current flows through the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>1</b> and the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>2</b>. When a current flows from the AC terminal AC to the high potential terminal P, the current flows through the diode Di<b>2</b> and the diode Di<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">When a current flows from the intermediate terminal C to the AC terminal AC, the current flows through the diode Di<b>5</b> and the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>2</b>. When a current flows from the AC terminal AC to the intermediate terminal C, the current flows through the diode Di<b>2</b> and the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As described above, the energization frequency of the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> connected to the AC terminal AC (corresponding to the energization ratio) is higher than that of both the first parallel connection body <b>1</b> and the fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b>. In view of this, in the first embodiment, the voltage drop of the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> is configured to be smaller than any of the voltage drops of the first parallel connection body <b>1</b> and the fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Here, it is assumed that Vcesat is the on-voltage of the semiconductor switching element (collector-emitter saturation voltage) when a predetermined current flows, and VF is the on-voltage of the diode when the predetermined current flows (that is, forward voltage). The voltage drop of the semiconductor switching element corresponds to the Vcesat of the semiconductor switching element, and the voltage drop of the diode corresponds to the VF of the diode.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The establishment of the relationship that the voltage drop of the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> described above is smaller than the voltage drops of the first parallel connection body <b>1</b> and the fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b> indicates that in Vcesat and VF, the relationships of (1) and (2) as follows are established. (1) The Vcesat of the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>2</b> is smaller than the Vcesat of the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>1</b> and the VF of the diode Di<b>5</b>. (2) The VF of the diode Di<b>2</b> is smaller than the VF of the diode Di<b>1</b> and the Vcesat of the semiconductor switching element Tr<b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the semiconductor device of the first embodiment in which the voltage drop satisfies the above relationship, the conduction loss in the energization path of the first parallel connection body <b>1</b>, the second parallel connection body <b>2</b>, and the fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b> can be reduced; therefore, the power efficiency can be improved.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Similarly, the energization frequency of the third parallel connection body <b>3</b> connected to the AC terminal AC is higher than that of both the fourth parallel connection body <b>4</b> and the sixth parallel connection body <b>6</b>. In view of this, in the first embodiment, the voltage drop of the third parallel connection body <b>3</b> is configured to be smaller than any of the voltage drops of the fourth parallel connection body <b>4</b> and the sixth parallel connection body <b>6</b>. According to the semiconductor device of the first embodiment, the conduction loss in the energization path of the third parallel connection body <b>3</b>, the fourth parallel connection body <b>4</b>, and the sixth parallel connection body <b>6</b> can be reduced; therefore, the power efficiency can be improved.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The operation patterns of the first parallel connection body <b>1</b>, the second parallel connection body <b>2</b>, and the fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b> correspond to the operation patterns of the fourth parallel connection body <b>4</b>, the third parallel connection body <b>3</b>, and the sixth parallel connection body, respectively. Therefore, for example, the energization frequency of the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> being higher than the energization frequency of the first parallel connection body <b>1</b> and the fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b> corresponds to the energization frequency of the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> being higher than the energization frequency of the fourth parallel connection body <b>4</b> and the sixth parallel connection body <b>6</b>. Therefore, the voltage drop of the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> is configured to be smaller than any of the voltage drops of the fourth parallel connection body <b>4</b> and the sixth parallel connection body <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Summarizing the above, in the first embodiment, both of the voltage drops of the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> and the third parallel connection body <b>3</b> are smaller than the voltage drop of every one of the first parallel connection body <b>1</b>, the fourth parallel connection body <b>4</b>, the fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b>, and the sixth parallel connection body <b>6</b>. According to such a configuration, the conduction loss can be reduced and the power efficiency of the semiconductor device can be improved.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Expanding the above, the configuration may be adopted in which, at least one of the voltage drops of the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> and the third parallel connection body <b>3</b> becomes smaller than the voltage drop of at least one of the first parallel connection body <b>1</b>, the fourth parallel connection body <b>4</b>, the fifth parallel connection body <b>5</b>, and the sixth parallel connection body <b>6</b>.

Further, by making the chip area of the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> relatively large, the heat dissipation area of the second parallel connection body <b>2</b> can be increased.
