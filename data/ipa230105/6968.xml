Thus, it is highly likely that the IP address of the origin of an attack is deleted immediately after the attack.

It is hence highly likely that the generated block list immediately becomes obsolete.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">In view of this, the present example embodiments have an example object to appropriately manage address information that may be a target of access control.
