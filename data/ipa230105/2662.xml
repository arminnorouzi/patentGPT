Usually, this extremely low temperature environment is realized by a cold storage type refrigerator represented by a Gifford-McMahon (GM) refrigerator.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several types of cold storage materials, which have a large specific heat for each operating temperature region, are used in the refrigerators. In the GM refrigerators that are currently widely used, Cu mesh is used as the cold storage material for the first cold storage device, and spherical particles of Pb and Bi alloy are used as the cold storage material on the high-temperature side of the second cold storage device, and particles of rare earth compounds such as Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S (GOS), HoCu<sub>2</sub>, and Er<sub>3</sub>Ni are used as the cold storage material on the low-temperature side of the second cold storage device. Among such cold storage materials, GOS has a high specific heat characteristic in a temperature region near 5K.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to synthesize an oxide cold storage material such as GOS, a multi-step process such as synthesis of raw materials, granulation, sintering at a high temperature, and spherical finishing by polishing is required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many refrigerators configured to achieve extremely low temperatures are used to cool superconducting coils. Thus, when the magnetization of the cold storage material is large, the cold storage material receives a large force due to the magnetic field generated by the superconducting coil and problems such as damage to the shaft containing the cold storage material may occur, which reduces the reliability of the refrigerator. Although superconducting coils are used for MRI and the like as described above, when the magnetization of the cold storage material is large, noise may be included in images due to magnetic noise derived from the cold storage material. Hence, the magnetization of the cold storage material is required to be small.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In refrigerators such as a GM refrigerator, a pulse tube refrigerator, and a Stirling refrigerator, high-pressure working gas fluidly reciprocates through the gap between the cold storage materials packed in the cold storage device. Further, in a GM refrigerator and a Stirling refrigerator, the cold storage device filled with cold storage materials vibrates. Thus, the cold storage materials are required to have mechanical strength.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In terms of manufacturing cold storage materials, it is preferred to use intermetallic compounds that can be manufactured by a simple process of melt-solidification. An oxide cold storage material such as GOS require a multi-step manufacturing process such as synthesis of raw materials, granulation, sintering at a high temperature, and spherical finishing by polishing. RCu<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2 </sub>(R&#x2550;Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, X&#x2550;Si, Ge) is known to have a large specific heat at extremely low temperatures as a choice for the cold storage material of intermetallic compounds.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the RCu<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2 </sub>compound is produced by, for example, melting the raw materials under an arc melting method and then subjecting the obtained ingot to a uniform heat treatment at a high temperature for a long time (for example, at 800&#xb0; C. for one week). When a high-temperature and long-time heat treatment process is required after melt-solidification as described above, its cost increases in the case of being applied to industrial mass production.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0010">[Patent Document 1] JP H09-014774 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0011">[Patent Document 2] JP H06-101915 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Non-Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">[Non-Patent Document 1] L.

The cold storage material according to the first embodiment is a granular body composed of an intermetallic compound in which ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure <b>11</b> occupies 80% by volume or more, and has a crystallite size of 70 nm or less.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">In the above-described ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure <b>11</b>, Th site <b>12</b> is at least one element selected from the group consisting of La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Sc, and Y.

Thus, the cold storage material to be mounted on the refrigerator is required to have a large specific heat characteristic in the operating temperature region.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028">When the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure <b>11</b> occupies 80% by volume or more in this intermetallic compound, the intermetallic a cold storage material having a high specific heat characteristic in an extremely low temperature region can be obtained. If the proportion of the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure <b>11</b> in the intermetallic compound is less than 80% by volume, the specific heat characteristic is deteriorated in some cases compared with general substances listed as cold storage materials in the extremely low temperature region. The volume % of the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure can be calculated from the Rietveld analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction method and/or evaluation of the ratio of the phases of a plurality of fields of view by observation with a scanning electron microscope.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">In a GM refrigerator and a Stirling refrigerator, the cold storage device filled with the cold storage material vibrates, and thus, the cold storage material is required to have mechanical strength. Thus, crystallite size of the cold storage material is as fine as 70 nm or less, which ensures excellent mechanical strength of the cold storage material. The crystallite size L is calculated by evaluating the peak width (half width) &#x3b2; in the X-ray diffraction pattern and using Scherrer's equation (Equation (1)). When the crystallite size is small, the half width of the X-ray diffraction pattern becomes large.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>L=K</i>&#x3bb;/(&#x3b2; cos &#x3b8;)&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">(wherein K is the Scherrer constant and &#x3bb; is wavelength of X-rays to be used)</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">The mechanical strength can be evaluated by a vibration test.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">If the crystallite size of the cold storage material is larger than 70 nm, the mechanical strength is reduced, the granules are fatigue-fractured and pulverized as the period of use elapses, and the predetermined performance of the refrigerator cannot be maintained. The crystallite size is preferably 1 nm or more, more preferably 10 nm or more.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a grain shape of the cold storage material according to the first embodiment. As the particle size of the granular body of the cold storage material, &#x3c6;max is defined as the length of the granular body in the longest direction and &#x3c6;min is defined as the length of the longest portion in the direction perpendicular to the longest direction. &#x3c6;max and &#x3c6;min are included in the range of 0.01 mm to 1 mm, and more preferably, &#x3c6;max and &#x3c6;min are included in the range of 0.05 mm to 0.5 mm. When an area of a projected image <b>15</b> of this cold storage material is defined as A and an area of the smallest circumscribed circle <b>16</b> circumscribing this projected image <b>15</b> is defined as M, the shape coefficient represented by M/A is included in the range of 1.0 to 5.0 in every projection direction.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">Since the particle size of the cold storage material is included in the range of 0.01 mm to 1 mm, in the refrigerator described below, the flow of the working gas (He gas) that fluidly reciprocates in the cold storage device filled with the cold storage material is not obstructed, and satisfactory heat exchange between the working gas and the cold storage material is achieved. When the particle size of the cold storage material is less than 0.01 mm (10 &#x3bc;m), the gap between the particles of the cold storage material (i.e., space through which the working gas flows) may be narrowed and the pressure loss of the gas may increase. When the particle size of the cold storage material is larger than 1 mm, the filling rate of the cold storage material in the cold storage device may decrease and the heat exchange between the working gas and the cold storage material may decrease.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035">The production of such a cold storage material is performed by at least going through a process of blending and melting the component elements of an intermetallic compound, which can form the above-described ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure <b>11</b>, at its stoichiometric ratio and a process of injecting this molten liquid into a dynamic cooling medium and rapidly cooling and solidifying it into granules.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">That is, the elemental metal blended to have the stoichiometric ratio of the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure <b>11</b> is melted by high frequency induction heating or the like. Further, the molten metal is supplied to the surface of a high-speed rotating body installed in the atmosphere of vacuum or inert gas. This molten metal is finely dispersed by the motion of the rotating body and is simultaneously subjected to rapid-solidification so as to form spherical granules. Additionally or alternatively, the above-described molten metal is made to flow out into a vacuum or an atmosphere of inert gas, and a non-oxidizing atomizing gas is allowed to act on it. As a result, the molten metal is atomized and dispersed, and at the same time, is rapidly cooled and solidified to form spherical granules.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">Specific methods for rapidly cooling and solidifying the above-described molten metal include a rotary disc process (RDP) method, a single roll method, a double roll method, an inert gas atomizing method, and a rotary nozzle method. According to these methods, the molten metal can be rapidly cooled at a cooling rate of 10<sup>5 </sup>to 10<sup>6</sup>&#xb0; C./s, and thus, an intermetallic compound having the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure can be readily produced in the form of granules at low cost. Details of the rapid-solidification method for the molten metal are described in Japanese Patent No. 2609747.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0038">When an intermetallic compound having a different magnetic-phase transition-temperature is added to the intermetallic compound having the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure, the specific heat characteristic per unit volume of the cold storage material can be enhanced. For example, when a phase having an AlB<sub>2</sub>-type structure and a LiGaGe-type structure is present in the intermetallic compound having the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure, the specific heat in the 4K to 20K region can be increased. When a phase having a Gd<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>4</sub>Ge<sub>4</sub>-type structure is present in the intermetallic compound having the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure, the specific heat in the vicinity of 7K to 50K can be increased. However, when the amount of the phases excluding the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure is 20% by volume or more, the volume specific heat derived from the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure becomes small. When the intermetallic compound is composed of phases having different crystal structures, the mechanical strength of the cold storage material can be increased.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a two-stage expansion type GM refrigerator exemplified as the refrigerator <b>30</b> according to the second embodiment.

Thus, in particular, in order to enhance the heat recovery effect of the second cold storage materials <b>40</b>, it is effective to selectively dispose the second cold storage materials <b>40</b> having satisfactory heat recovery characteristics in the respective temperature regions depending on the temperature gradient.

In the first cold storage device <b>34</b>, the temperature region from room temperature to 100K or less is the main operating temperature region, and thus, Cu having a large specific heat per unit volume in this temperature region is selected.

In the diagnosis by this MRI apparatus <b>50</b>, a movable base (not shown) on which a subject <b>52</b> lies is moved into a tunnel-shaped bore space <b>51</b>. Further, a static magnetic field is applied by a first electromagnet <b>53</b>, and a gradient magnetic field is applied by the second electromagnet <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0055">Further, a radio wave is transmitted from an RF coil <b>55</b>, and a magnetic resonance signal is received as a response signal from the subject <b>52</b>. Due to the gradient magnetic field, positional information on the position where the response signal is generated is also received at the same time. The received response signals are analyzed by a signal processing system (not shown) to reconstruct an internal image of the body of the subject <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0056">In the MRI apparatus <b>50</b> currently used as the mainstream, a superconducting coil configured to generates a strong magnetic field such as 1.5 T and 3 T is used for the first electromagnet <b>53</b>. The stronger the magnetic field is, the better the S/N (signal/noise) ratio of the magnetic resonance response signal becomes, which enables generation of a clearer image. As the superconducting coil to be used for the first electromagnet <b>53</b>, a solenoid coil wound with metal-type low-temperature superconducting wires such as NbTi and Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn is usually used.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0057">Since these wires need to be kept at the critical temperature of the superconducting transition or lower, the first electromagnet <b>53</b> is installed in a He bath <b>56</b> filled with liquid He that liquefies at 4.2K (about &#x2212;269&#xb0; C.) or less under 1 atm. Since the liquid He is rare and expensive, an adiabatic vacuum layer <b>57</b> is provided on the outside of the He bath <b>56</b> in order to suppress evaporation of the liquid He. Further, in order to reduce the influence of heat intrusion from the environment (room temperature: about 300K) in which the MRI apparatus <b>50</b> is installed, two radiation shields <b>58</b> and <b>59</b> are provided in the adiabatic vacuum layer <b>57</b>. The shield <b>58</b> is cooled to about 4K and the shield <b>59</b> is cooled to about 40K by the installed refrigerator <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0058">The refrigerator <b>30</b> is not limited to a particular one, and a GM refrigerator and a JT refrigerator may be used in combination as the refrigerator <b>30</b>. Additionally or alternatively, a refrigerator such as a GM refrigerator, a pulse tube refrigerator, a Claude refrigerator, and a Sterling refrigerator is used alone as the refrigerator <b>30</b> in some cases. In particular, the GM refrigerator has significantly improved in refrigeration performance by being equipped with a magnetic cold storage material in the 1990s, which has enabled generation of an extremely low temperatures below the liquid He temperature by using only the GM refrigerator. Thus, the GM refrigerator is often used in the MRI apparatus <b>50</b>, which is widely used at the time of filing of the present application.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the first cooling stage <b>43</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the GM refrigerator <b>30</b> is connected to the shield <b>59</b>, and the second cooling stage <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) is connected to the shield <b>58</b>. At the time of filing of the present application, GM refrigerators capable of stably obtaining a refrigeration capacity of 1 W or more at 4K are widespread. Thus, the heat invasion into the He bath <b>56</b> and the cooling by the GM refrigerator <b>30</b> are balanced, and thereby, an extremely low temperature can be maintained and evaporation of the liquid He can be almost completely suppressed.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0060">Consequently, in medical institutions such as hospitals, when the liquid He is injected at the initial start-up of the MRI apparatus <b>50</b>, it is not necessary to regularly add the liquid He, which is expensive and not easy to handle, in the subsequent operation. Due to this significant improvement in convenience, the introduction of MRI apparatus <b>50</b> to small and medium-sized hospitals is expanding. In addition, an MRI apparatus including a direct cooling type superconducting coil, which conducts and cools the superconducting coil with a refrigerator without using the liquid He, has also been commercialized. In the case of such an MRI apparatus, the liquid He bath <b>6</b> can be omitted.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0061">In recent years, MRI apparatuses using high-temperature superconducting wires such as Y-type, Bi-type, and MgB<sub>2 </sub>have been developed. In also these apparatuses similarly to the MRI apparatus using a low-temperature superconducting material, the superconducting coil needs to be equal to or lower than the critical temperature of the superconducting transition and needs to be cooled below 10K to 30K (about &#x2212;257&#xb0; C.) at which the current required to generate the magnetic field can flow.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0062">Thus, in the MRI apparatus using a high-temperature superconducting material, it is necessary to cool the superconducting coil by applying conduction cooling on the superconducting coil with the use of a refrigerator or by submerging it in liquid He, liquid H<sub>2</sub>, and/or liquid Ne, liquefaction temperature of each of which is 4K to 30K (about &#x2212;269&#xb0; C.) or lower under 1 atm. Also in the latter method, it is desirable to cool it by using a refrigerator in order to prevent evaporation of liquids He, liquid H<sub>2</sub>, and liquid Ne. In order to improve the performance of the refrigerator at 10K to 30K, it is preferred to mount a cold storage material having a large specific heat in the same temperature region on the refrigerator.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0063">The device incorporating a superconducting coil (i.e., an apparatus with a built-in superconducting-coil) according to the third embodiment is equipped with the refrigerator of the second embodiment, which is provided with the cold storage material of the first embodiment. The magnetization of this cold storage material is 10 emu/g or less, more preferably 5 emu/g or less, and further preferably 2 emu/g or less at an external magnetic field of 1000 Oe and a temperature of 5K or lower. Since the magnetization of the cold storage material is small as described above, the influence of magnetic noise derived from the cold storage material can be reduced and a high-quality image can be obtained. The device incorporating a superconducting coil according to the third embodiment is not limited to the above-described MRI apparatus <b>50</b>. The device incorporating a superconducting coil according to the third embodiment includes a superconducting magnet for a magnetically levitated train, a superconducting magnet device, a cryopump device, a Josephson voltage standard device, and a magnetic-field application type monocrystal pulling device.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0064">In particular, the cryopump device achieves a high degree of vacuum by being cooled to about 10K.

When the content percentage of the ThCr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>-type structure is less than 801; by volume, the peak value of specific heat is significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a graph showing the magnetization characteristics in the extremely low temperature region for Example 1 The magnetization characteristics were measured with the use of a magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) manufactured by Quantum Design Japan, Inc. When the external magnetic field is 1000 Oe, the magnetization in the temperature region 2K to 5K is 0.97 emu/g or lower. The magnetization of DOS, which has almost the same high specific heat characteristics as in Examples 1 to 3 in the temperature region near 5K, is 1.5 emu/g, the magnetization of HoCu<sub>2 </sub>used on the low-temperature side of the second cold storage device excluding GCS is 3.5 emu/g, and the magnetization of Er<sub>3</sub>Ni is 7 emu/g. Accordingly, the cold storage materials of Examples 1 to 3 have small magnetization characteristics, and thus contribute to improvement of image quality and reduction of magnetic noise of the device incorporating a superconducting coil when being mounted on an MRI apparatus.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0092">In the case of the cold storage material of Example 1 having a granular particle size below 0.01 mm (10 &#x3bc;m), the gap between the particles of the cold storage material (i.e., space through which the working gas flows) becomes narrower, and the pressure loss of the gas increases, which deteriorates the refrigeration performance. When the granular particle size of the cold storage material is larger than 1 mm, the filling rate of the cold storage material in the cold storage device decreases, and thus the refrigeration performance deteriorates.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0093">According to the cold storage material of at least one embodiment as described above, a cold storage material, which has a large specific heat and a small magnetization in an extremely low temperature region and has satisfactory manufacturability, can be provided. Additionally, a refrigerator having high efficiency and excellent cooling performance can be provided by filling the refrigerator with this cold storage material. Further, a device incorporating a superconducting coil capable of reducing the influence of magnetic noise derived from the cold storage material can be provided.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0094">While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions.
