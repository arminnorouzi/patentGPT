More specifically, pathology refers to performing tests and analysis that are used to diagnose diseases. For example, tissue samples may be placed onto slides to be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist (e.g., a physician that is an expert at analyzing tissue samples to determine whether any abnormalities exist). That is, pathology specimens may be cut into multiple sections, stained, and prepared as slides for a pathologist to examine and render a diagnosis. When uncertain of a diagnostic finding on a slide, a pathologist may order additional cut levels, stains, or other tests to gather more information from the tissue. Technician(s) may then create new slide(s) which may contain the additional information for the pathologist to use in making a diagnosis. This process of creating additional slides may be time-consuming, not only because it may involve retrieving the block of tissue, cutting it to make a new a slide, and then staining the slide, but also because it may be batched for multiple orders. This may significantly delay the final diagnosis that the pathologist renders. In addition, even after the delay, there may still be no assurance that the new slide(s) will have information sufficient to render a diagnosis.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Pathologists may evaluate cancer and other disease pathology slides in isolation. The present disclosure presents a method of using AI to detect and predict biomarkers and genomic panel features. In particular, the present disclosure describes various exemplary user interfaces available in the workflow, as well as AI tools that may be integrated into the workflow to expedite and improve a pathologist's work.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, computers may be used to analyze an image of a tissue sample to quickly identify whether additional information may be needed about a particular tissue sample, and/or to highlight to a pathologist an area in which he or she should look more closely. Thus, the process of obtaining additional stained slides and tests may be done automatically before being reviewed by a pathologist. When paired with automatic slide segmenting and staining machines, this may provide a fully automated slide preparation pipeline. This automation has, at least, the benefits of (1) minimizing an amount of time wasted by a pathologist determining a slide to be insufficient to make a diagnosis, (2) minimizing the (average total) time from specimen acquisition to diagnosis by avoiding the additional time between when additional tests are ordered and when they are produced, (3) reducing the amount of time per recut and the amount of material wasted by allowing recuts to be done while tissue blocks (e.g., pathology specimens) are in a cutting desk, (4) reducing the amount of tissue material wasted/discarded during slide preparation, (5) reducing the cost of slide preparation by partially or fully automating the procedure, (6) allowing automatic customized cutting and staining of slides that would result in more representative/informative slides from samples, (7) allowing higher volumes of slides to be generated per tissue block, contributing to more informed/precise diagnoses by reducing the overhead of requesting additional testing for a pathologist, and/or (8) identifying or verifying correct properties (e.g., pertaining to a specimen type) of a digital pathology image, etc.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The process of using computers to assist pathologists is known as computational pathology. Computing methods used for computational pathology may include, but are not limited to, statistical analysis, autonomous or machine learning, and AI. AI may include, but is not limited to, deep learning, neural networks, classifications, clustering, and regression algorithms. By using computational pathology, lives may be saved by helping pathologists improve their diagnostic accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and accessibility. For example, computational pathology may be used to assist with detecting slides suspicious for cancer, thereby allowing pathologists to check and confirm their initial assessments before rendering a final diagnosis.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above, computational pathology processes, and devices of the present disclosure, may provide an integrated platform allowing a fully automated process including data ingestion, processing and viewing of digital pathology images via a web-browser or other user interface, while integrating with a laboratory information system (LIS). Further, clinical information may be aggregated using cloud-based data analysis of patient data. The data may come from hospitals, clinics, field researchers, etc., and may be analyzed by machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and/or statistical algorithms to do real-time monitoring and forecasting of health patterns at multiple geographic specificity levels.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for quickly and correctly identifying and/or verifying a specimen type of a digital pathology image, or any information related to a digital pathology image, without necessarily accessing an LIS or analogous information database. One embodiment of the present disclosure may include a system trained to identify various properties of a digital pathology image, based on datasets of prior digital pathology images. The trained system may provide a classification for a specimen shown in a digital pathology image. The classification may help to provide treatment or diagnosis prediction(s) for a patient associated with the specimen.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The systems and methods of the present disclosure may use artificial intelligence to detect a scanned slide with any feature that may be a predicate to further testing (e.g., the highest tumor volume for molecular or invasive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (HER2/ER/PR)). This feature detection may be accomplished at the case, part, or block levels of a specimen. The results may be available via any user interface (e.g., through a viewer, report, through a laboratory information system (LIS), etc.). The systems and methods of the present disclosure may also provide immediate visualization of a predicted immunohistochemistry (IHC) result, genomics panel, derived information using AI (e.g., treatment resistance), etc., from one or digital pathology specimen images acquired from a patient. This may provide turnaround time and cost efficiencies for both the hospitals and patients. In addition to showing the results of a digital IHC or digital genomic panel, the present system may further manage the reimbursement elements for that purchase. This may provide additional efficiency for hospitals and patients.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The systems and methods of the present disclosure may use artificial intelligence to detect a scanned slide with any feature that may be a predicate to further testing (e.g., the highest tumor volume for molecular or invasive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (HER2/ER/PR)).

The quality score determiner module <b>133</b> may identify quality control (QC) issues (e.g., imperfections) for the training images at a global or local level that may greatly affect the usability of a digital pathology image. For example, the quality score determiner module may use information about an entire image, e.g., the specimen type, the overall quality of the cut of the specimen, the overall quality of the glass pathology slide itself, or tissue morphology characteristics, and determine an overall quality score for the image. The treatment identification module <b>134</b> may analyze images of tissues and determine which digital pathology images have treatment effects (e.g., post-treatment) and which images do not have treatment effects (e.g., pre-treatment). It is useful to identify whether a digital pathology image has treatment effects because prior treatment effects in tissue may affect the morphology of the tissue itself. Most LIS do not explicitly keep track of this characteristic, and thus classifying specimen types with prior treatment effects can be desired.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to one embodiment, the target image platform <b>135</b> may include a target image intake module <b>136</b>, a specimen detection module <b>137</b>, and an output interface <b>138</b>.
