A small-scale network complements the service offered by the network operator and can offer improved communication performance, such as in a particular venue or environment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, it can be difficult to flexibly restrict or control access to a small-scale network. Notably, the access-control techniques used in larger cellular-telephone networks (which are sometimes referred to as &#x2018;macrocells&#x2019;), which are operated or provided by mobile network operators, may not be suitable for a small-scale network. For example, it may be difficult to scale down the access-control techniques from a lager cellular-telephone network to the smaller number of users in a small-scale network.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A computer that restricts access to a private or neutral-host network associated with an entity is described. This computer includes: an interface circuit that communicates with a radio node; a processor coupled to the interface circuit; and memory, coupled to the processor, storing program instructions. When executed by the processor, the program instructions cause the computer to perform operations. Notably, the computer receives an attachment request from the radio node, where the attachment request is associated with an electronic device (e.g., the attachment request may have been sourced from the electronic device, such as the attachment request may include a source address of the electronic device), and includes an identifier of the radio node, an identifier of the electronic device and an identifier of a service provider. Then, the computer determines a first entity identifier of the entity based at least in part on the identifier of the radio node, and a second entity identifier of the entity based at least in part on the identifier of the electronic device. When the first entity identifier matches the second entity identifier, the computer performs authentication of the electronic device. Alternatively, when the first entity identifier is different from the second entity identifier, and the identifier of the service provider matches a predefined identifier of the service provider that is stored in the memory, the computer performs the authentication of the electronic device.

During operation, the computer receives an attachment request from a radio node, where the attachment request is associated with an electronic device, and includes an identifier of the radio node, an identifier of the electronic device and an identifier of a service provider. Then, the computer determines a first entity identifier of the entity based at least in part on the identifier of the radio node, and a second entity identifier of the entity based at least in part on the identifier of the electronic device. When the first entity identifier matches the second entity identifier, the computer performs authentication of the electronic device. Alternatively, when the first entity identifier is different from the second entity identifier, and the identifier of the service provider matches a predefined identifier of the service provider that is stored in memory associated with the computer, the computer performs the authentication of the electronic device. Otherwise, the computer does not allow the electronic device to attach to the private or neutral-host network.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">By restricting access to a private or neutral-host network, these communication techniques may allow the entity to selectively allow users (via their associated electronic devices) to attach to the private or neutral-host network without using a CSG. Notably, the communication techniques may provide controlled access, which is needed for security and so the entity can successfully operate the private or neutral-host network, without using access-control techniques from larger cellular-telephone networks that do not scale down well for use with the private or neutral-host network. Consequently, the communication techniques may improve offer the advantages of controlled or restricted access, as well as reduced cost and complexity.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">We now describe some embodiments of the communication techniques. A cellular-telephone network may include base stations (and associated cell towers) that implement so-called macrocells. These macrocells may facilitate communication with hundreds of users (such as hundreds of cellular telephones) over distances of kilometers. In general, the positioning of the cell towers (and the antennas) is carefully designed and optimized to maximize the performance of the cellular-telephone network (such as the throughput, the capacity, the block error rate, etc.) and to reduce crosstalk or interference between the signals transmitted by different cell towers and/or different macrocells. Small cells are generally radio access nodes providing lower power than macrocells and therefore providing smaller coverage areas than macrocells. It is common to subcategorize &#x2018;small cells&#x2019; even further by ascribing relative general ranges. For example, a &#x2018;microcell&#x2019; might have a range of less than 2 kilometers, a &#x201c;picocell&#x201d; less than 200 meters, and a &#x2018;femtocell&#x2019; on the order of 10 meters. These descriptions are for general relative comparison purposes and should not be limiting on the scope of the disclosed embodiments of the communication techniques.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, there are often gaps in the coverage offered by macrocells. Consequently, some users operate local transceivers that provide short-range communication in the cellular-telephone network. These so-called &#x2018;femto cells&#x2019; provide short-range communication (e.g., up to 10 m) for a few individuals.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, larger organizations (such as those with 50-60 users, which is a non-limiting numerical example) may operate local transceivers that provide communication in the cellular-telephone network over a range of 100 m. This intermediate-range coverage in the cellular-telephone network can be typically referred to as a &#x2018;small cell&#x2019; as well.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">One challenge with a small-scale network (such as a small cell) is how to flexibly restrict or control access. In a large-scale network, such as a cellular-telephone network or macrocell, access may be restricted using subscriber identity module (SIM) cards in cellular telephones and a CSG, which is sometimes referred to as a &#x2018;closed user group.&#x2019; (More generally, access may be restricted using an access-restriction technique, such as those specified by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project of Sophia Antipolis, Valbonne, France.)</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Notably, an electronic device (such as a cellular telephone) of a user or subscriber to a cellular-telephone network operated or provided by a mobile network operator may include a SIM card with a unique identifier of the cellular telephone, such as an IMSI or a SUPI. (In the discussion that follows, an IMSI is used as an illustrative example.) When the electronic device attempts to attach to the cellular-telephone network, the cellular telephone provides information included in the SIM card, such as the IMSI, which facilitates controlled network access. For example, access may be restricted to an IMSI of a registered subscriber to the cellular-telephone network, and the cellular-telephone network may be specified by a PLMN identifier that is included in the IMSI of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Some small cells are operated as private or closed networks. In these small cells, access may be restricted to a predefined group of users. For example, allowed users in the predefined group of users may be issued private-network-specific SIM cards, which are installed in the electronic devices of the predefined group of users. Then, when an electronic device of one of these users attempts to access or attach to the private network, the electronic device may provide an attach request with an IMSI that is included in a private-network-specific SIM card. A packet core in the private network may compare the IMSI to a stored list of allowed IMSIs in a predefined CSG. When there is a match, the electronic device may be allowed to attach to the private network.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">However, there are often problems with this access-restriction technique. Notably, the use of SIM cards and a predefined CSG is typically inflexible. It is difficult to add or modify the electronic devices that are allowed to access a small cell. For example, in this approach, a new user may need to be issued a SIM card for their electronic device, and the predefined CSG may need to be updated. This is time-consuming and cumbersome.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, private-network-specific SIM cards are often expensive. This is because there may be far fewer users of a private network than of a larger cellular-telephone network. For example, there may be 50-100 users of a private network, which may significantly increase the cost of the private-network-specific SIM cards.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">These challenges are addressed in the communication techniques described below. In the discussion that follows, Long Term Evolution or LTE (from the 3rd Generation Partnership Project) is used as an illustration of a data communication protocol in a small cell that is used during communication between one or more radio nodes and a computer. (In the present discussion, a small cell is used as an illustration of a small-scale network.) Consequently, eNodeBs or eNBs are used as illustrative examples of the radio nodes. However, a wide variety of communication techniques or protocols may be readily used for the various embodiments. For example, an electronic device and a radio node may communicate frames or packets in accordance with a wireless communication protocol, such as an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standard (which is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;Wi-Fi,&#x2019; from the Wi-Fi Alliance of Austin, Tex.), Bluetooth (from the Bluetooth Special Interest Group of Kirkland, Wash.), a cellular-telephone or data network (such as using a third generation or 3G communication protocol, a fourth generation or 4G communication protocol, e.g., LTE, LTE Advanced or LTE-A, a fifth generation or 5G communication protocol, or other present or future developed advanced cellular communication protocol) and/or another type of wireless interface (such as communication protocol). Thus, the radio nodes may include: an eNodeB, a UMTS NodeB and RNC, an NR gNB or gNodeB, etc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Moreover, a radio node may communicate with other radio nodes and/or computers in a network using a wired communication protocol, such as an IEEE 802.3 standard (which is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;Ethernet&#x2019;) and/or another type of wired interface. In the discussion that follows, Ethernet is used as an illustrative example.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> presents a block diagram illustrating an example of communication among electronic devices according to some embodiments. Notably, radio nodes <b>110</b> can communicate LTE data frames or packets using LTE with an electronic device <b>112</b> (which is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;user equipment&#x2019; or UE, such as a cellular telephone and, more generally, a portable electronic device). Again, while LTE is used as an example of a cellular protocol, the embodiments herein are not so limited. Moreover, radio nodes <b>110</b> may also communicate (via wireless or wired communication, such as Ethernet, in network <b>114</b>) with each other and with computer <b>124</b> (or a computer system). Note that computer <b>124</b> may implemented in close proximity to radio nodes <b>110</b> (i.e., locally) and/or remotely (such as in a cloud-based computer system).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Note that radio nodes <b>110</b> may be associated with a private or neutral-host network <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> at a venue (such as building, a location, etc.). In some embodiments, radio nodes <b>110</b> associated with another private or neutral-host network <b>108</b>-<b>2</b> at a different venue may also communicate with computer <b>124</b>. For example, computer <b>124</b> may implement a packet core. The instances of the private or neutral-host networks <b>108</b> at the different venues may be associated with a common entity, such as a company or an organization. Moreover, the instances of the private or neutral-host networks <b>108</b> may share the packet core implemented by computer <b>124</b>.

Thus, if one or more antennas <b>520</b> include N antenna pattern shapers, the one or more antennas may have 2<sup>N </sup>different antenna pattern configurations. More generally, a given antenna pattern may include amplitudes and/or phases of signals that specify a direction of the main or primary lobe of the given antenna pattern, as well as so-called &#x2018;exclusion regions&#x2019; or &#x2018;exclusion zones&#x2019; (which are sometimes referred to as &#x2018;notches&#x2019; or &#x2018;nulls&#x2019;). Note that an exclusion zone of the given antenna pattern includes a low-intensity region of the given antenna pattern. While the intensity is not necessarily zero in the exclusion zone, it may be below a threshold, such as 3 dB or lower than the peak gain of the given antenna pattern. Thus, the given antenna pattern may include a local maximum (e.g., a primary beam) that directs gain in the direction of electronic device <b>500</b> that is of interest, and one or more local minima that reduce gain in the direction of other electronic devices that are not of interest.
