The stator winding terminates in a winding bus terminal for connection to a terminal of the inverter. As most state of the art electric motors for electric vehicles comprise water or oil cooling systems to dissipate heat from the stator windings, a dedicated separation device is required between the stator windings and the inverter to prevent the oil of the cooling system to contaminate the inverter and the contacts of the connection between the winding bus terminal and the inverter terminal. The winding bus terminal and the inverter terminal are indirectly connected to each other via the separation device. Electrical terminals of the separation device are typically bolted the inverter terminals to obtain a secure and durable connection, while the separation device ensures that the connection is not contaminated with oil from the cooling system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The separation device, however, takes up precious space of a drive unit of an electric vehicle, and adds to the overall assembly time and costs of the drive unit.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an object of the invention to overcome or at least ameliorate some of the disadvantages of the known drive units of electric vehicles.
