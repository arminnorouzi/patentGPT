More particularly, the presently disclosed subject matter relates to isolating said SMS stem cells and employing the same, optionally after in vitro manipulation, to treat tissue and/or organ damage in a subject in need thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The use of stem cells and stem cell derivatives is currently of great interest to medical research, particularly for the prospects of providing reagents for treating tissue damaged by various causes such as genetic disorders, injuries, and/or disease processes. In theory, stem cells, capable of asymmetric division; replenishing them self and providing various differentiated cell types could replace any damaged cells and tissues of an organism of choice. This process of regeneration is inherently present, to various extents, in all living multicellular organisms. Human organs however vary greatly in their potential for regeneration and repair. Many vital organs such as the heart and the brain show little capacity for repair after injury.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A lot of effort was concentrated at isolating and identifying human stem cells from a number of different tissues for use in regenerative medicine. And since bone marrow transplants have been successfully performed for decades, such efforts were concentrated initially on identifying stem cells in bone marrow. U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,397 discloses the isolation and growth of human hematopoietic stem cells that are reported to be capable of differentiating into lymphoid, erythroid, and myelomonocytic lineages. U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,396 discloses methods for lineage-directed differentiation of isolated human mesenchymal stem cells under the influence of appropriate growth and/or differentiation factors. The derived cells can then be introduced into a host for mesenchymal tissue regeneration or repair.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another area of interest was the use of embryonic stem (ES) cells. These stem cells have been shown in mice to have the potential to differentiate into all the different cell types of the animal. Mouse ES cells are derived from cells of the inner cell mass of early mouse embryos at the blastocyst stage, and other pluripotent and/or totipotent cells have been isolated from germinal tissue (e.g., primordial germ cells; PGCs). Unfortunately, the development of human ES (hES) cells was not as successful.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to the ethical controversy inherent to the use of human ES cells, significant other challenges face the use of ES cells or other pluripotent cells for regenerative therapy. The control of growth and differentiation of the cells into the particular cell type required for treatment of a subject is difficult. There have been several reports of the effect of growth factors on the differentiation of ES cells. For example, Schuldiner et al. report the effects of eight growth factors on the differentiation of cells into different cell types from hES cells (Schuldiner et al. (2000) 97 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 11307-11312). As disclosed therein, after initiating differentiation through embryoid body-like formation, the cells were cultured in the presence of bFGF, TGF&#x3b2;1, activin-A, BMP-4, HGF, EGF, &#x3b2;NGF, or retinoic acid. Each growth factor had a unique effect on the differentiation pathway, but none of the growth factors directed differentiation exclusively to one cell type. Also the current strategies for isolating ES cell lines, particularly human ES cell lines, preclude isolating the cells from a subject and reintroducing them into the same subject (autologous transfer). The use of a subject's own cells would obviate the need for adjunct immunosuppressive therapy, maintaining thereby full competency of the immune system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Adult human stem cells such as MSCs have been shown to have the potential to differentiate into several lineages including bone (Haynesworth et al. (1992) 13 Bone 81-88), cartilage (Mackay et al. (1998) 4 Tissue Eng 415-28; Yoo et al. (1998) 80 J Bone Joint Surg Am 1745-57), adipose tissue (Pittenger et al. (2000) 251 Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 3-11), tendon (Young et al. (1998) 16 J Orthop Res 406-13), muscle, and stroma (Caplan et al. (2001) 7 Trends Mol Med 259-64).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another population of cells, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAP Cs), has also been purified from bone marrow (BM; Reyes et al. (2001) 98 Blood 2615-2625; Reyes &#x26; Verfaillie (2001) 938 Ann NY Acad Sci 231-235). These cells have been shown to be capable of expansion in vitro for more than 100 population doublings. MAPCs have also been shown to be able to differentiate under defined culture conditions into various mesenchymal cell types (e.g., osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, and skeletal myoblasts), endothelium, neuroectoderm cells, and more recently, into hepatocytes (Schwartz et al. (2000) 109 J Clin Invest 1291-1302).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In vivo experiments in humans demonstrated that transplantation of CD34+ peripheral blood (PB) stem cells led to the appearance of donor-derived hepatocytes (Korbling et al. (2002) 346 N Engl J Med 738-746), epithelial cells (Korbling et al. (2002) 346 N Engl J Med 738-746), and neurons (Hao et al. (2003) 12 J Hematother Stem Cell Res 23-32). Additionally, human BM-derived cells have been shown to contribute to the regeneration of infarcted myocardium (Stamm et al. (2003) 361 Lancet 45-46). Currently Adult stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells are widely investigated in clinical trials for a variety of diseases (Ali et al. (2012) 2 (1) Stem Cell Discovery 15-23).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Recently a population of very small stem cells has been isolated using FACS cell sorting. These were named very small embryonic like stem cell (VSEL). This is a rare cell population that possess very primitive morphology and express pluripotent stem cell markers (e.g., Oct4, Nanog, and SSEA-4) as well as the surface phenotype Seal+/CD133+Lin&#x2212;CD 45&#x2212; in mice/humans. VSELs can be mobilized into peripheral blood following acute myocardial infarction (Kucia et al. (2008) 26 Stem Cells 2083-2092), and is reported to improve heart function and alleviate cardiac remodeling (Dawn et al. (2008) 26 Stem cells 1646-55, Zuba-Surma et al. (2011) 15 J Cell Mol Med 1319-28).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Attempts to culture these cells (VSEL) were unsuccessful, which led some researchers to question their very presence in human (Danova et al. (2012) 7 PLoS One e34899). Other researchers such as Gu et al. (2013) found also that it is very difficult expand or culture human VSELs in vitro using general culture conditions. Thus it is not clear yet whether these cells are merely developmental remnants found in the adult tissue that cannot be harnessed effectively for regeneration or that they represent real stem cell population suitable for regenerative medicine.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Generally obtaining Adult stem cells from tissues other than bone marrow continues to be difficult; especially for the case of providing sufficient cells for autologous transfer. Non-autologous transfer of cells implanting stem cells to others is on the other hand prone to problems associated with an immune rejection reaction and would require an adjunct immune suppressive therapy. Ex vivo culturing of adult stem cells is used as an alternative for providing sufficient cells. However adult stem cells are relatively sensitive to incubation conditions and if successfully cultured require strict control of these conditions (Bhattacharya et al., (2009) Frontiers of Cord Blood Science, Springer-Verlag London Limited).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The concept of transdifferentiation of adult tissue-specific stem cells is a topic of extensive disagreement within the scientific and medical communities (see e.g., Lemischka (2002) 30 Exp Hematol 848-852; Holden &#x26; Vogel (2002) 296 Science 2126-2129). Studies attempting to reproduce results suggesting transdifferentiation with neural stem cells have been unsuccessful (Castro et al. (2002) 297 Science 1299). It has also been shown that the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) found in muscle tissue originate in the BM (McKinney-Freeman et al. (2002) 99 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1341-1346; Geiger et al. 100 Blood 721-723; Kawada &#x26; Ogawa (2001) 98 Blood 2008-2013). Additionally, studies with chimeric animals involving the transplantation of single HPCs into lethally irradiated mice demonstrated that transdifferentiation and/or plasticity of circulating HPSC and/or their progeny, if it occurs at all, is an extremely rare event (Wagers et al. (2002) 297 Science 2256-2259).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The clinical experimental use of stem cells is based mainly on providing individual cells that are more or less differentiated. The success of engraftment is dependent on introduced cells homing to the correct location and positioning there in a correct manner that would create a functional tissue (Chute et al (2006) 13(6) Curr Opin Hematol. 399-406). Reliance on cell therapy, as opposed to tissue therapy, is mainly due to the difficulty of inducing cells to structure tissue typical macrostructures in vitro. Many of the newly investigated and introduced innovations are targeting this problem by applying natural or artificial scaffolds or various other means, including the use of extracellular matrix derived from other cells and tissues.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">There continues to be a need in cell therapy for new approaches to generate populations of transplantable cells suitable for a variety of applications. These cells should be easy to isolate, cheap to maintain, and provide efficient ex vivo proliferation and differentiation. On the other hand there is the need for stem cells capable of establishing in vitro pre-prepared tissue like structures, engineered preferably of autologous components.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a newly isolated human adult stem cell: Small Mobile Stem cell (SMS). In various embodiments, this cell line is isolated from umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, bone marrow, solid tissues such as placenta, liver, heart, brain, kidney, or gastro intestinal tract.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The SMS cells described herein are technically stem cells (i.e., undifferentiated cells of a multicellular organism that are capable of giving rise to indefinitely more cells of the same type, and from which certain other kinds of cells arise by differentiation) but have significant difference. Specifically, SMS cells do not merely regenerate lost cells but rather have the ability to reconstruct a whole complex set up of tissue-like structures in the absence of special stimuli or supporting agents.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In specific embodiments, the SMS cells are successfully cultured for at least 3 months using the same growth medium without a serum, e.g., Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). In these embodiments, the cells are cultured without serum with no significant effect on the proliferation potential, shape or appearance of the cells.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In contrast to cells which affect the positioning of other cells by remotely secreting signal substances, the SMS cells described herein and cells derived therefrom, displace the position of cells by physically carrying them.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In various embodiments, the SMS cell line exhibits exceptional characteristics, including but not limited to: robust growth in standard medium for more than 30 passages, resistance to adverse conditions, growth in absence of serum, formation of cell culture multilayer, capacity for differentiation into different specialized cells, which makes it most ideal for autologous cell therapy. In some embodiments, the SMS cell lines also excrete heavily extra cellular matrix (ECM) providing therefore an important source of this valuable substances.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Production of ECM, makes SMS cell type a candidate supportive cell for productive coculturing with other cells. SMS cell line demonstrates further an extraordinary ability for forming complex multicellular macrostructures in vitro. These macrostructures resemble those observed in human and animal tissues and organs, making it a potential riche source for autologous tissue replacement.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various embodiments, provided herein are isolated cell line comprising Small Mobile Stem cells (SMS) and uses thereof.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the SMS cells have a size of less than about 10 &#x3bc;m, or less that about 8 &#x3bc;m, or less that about 6 &#x3bc;m, or between about 3 &#x3bc;m to about 6 &#x3bc;m, or between about 4 &#x3bc;m to about 6 &#x3bc;m, or between about 4.5 &#x3bc;m to about 6.5 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The SMS cells disclosed herein maintain a geometrically defined characteristic for the nucleus, allowing them to be differentiated from other cells without the need for one or more probes.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In various embodiments, the SMS cells exhibit a translucent-like cytoplasm. In some embodiments the SMS cells also exhibit a circular nucleus (2.5-3.5 &#x3bc;m) that includes a centrally located very small circle (1-1.5 &#x3bc;m) of different light contrast. In specific embodiments, the circular nucleus is about 2.5-3.5 &#x3bc;m and includes a centrally located very small circle with a size of 1-1.5 &#x3bc;m and having a different light contrast. In these embodiments, depending on focusing plane, the minute circle appears darker or lighter. These contours of the cell bear resemblance to the shape of a human &#x201c;Iris&#x201d; and, for cells that remain undifferentiated, are stable throughout cell culture.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the undifferentiated SMS cells do not stain with standard staining techniques. Non-limiting examples of standard staining techniques include Wright's stain, Coomassie blue, Neutral red, Safranin, Silver staining, Masson's trichrome, Amido black, Toluidine blue, methylene blue, PAS staining, Trypan-blue, and Haematoxylin. In other embodiments, the cell that remains undifferentiated is stable through cell culture.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In various embodiments, the speed of moving SMS cells reaches about 1.5 &#x3bc;m/sec; which is about three times faster than the fastest reported cell of human origin: the neutrophils (a maximum speed of 0.5 &#x3bc;m/sec). See, e.g., Stossel, T. P. &#x201c;The E. Donnall Thomas Lecture, 1993. The machinery of blood cell movements&#x201d;, Blood 84.2 (1994):367. In some embodiments, the high mobility speed of the SMS cells is greater than about 0.5 &#x3bc;m/sec. In specific embodiments, the high mobility speed is about 1.5 &#x3bc;m/sec.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the SMS cells are expressive of extracellular matrices m standard media, including but not limited to DMEM low glucose, DMEM high glucose, with or without Hepes and/or serum.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various embodiments, the SMS sells are capable of forming an organized extracellular matrix (ECM). In these embodiments, the formation of the organized ECM makes the cells amenable for practical applications, including but not limited to industrial applications as well as medical applications. The ability of the SMS cells to produce ECMs is unique to these cells and allows for the production of a protein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The SMS cells disclosed herein are sensitive to environmental changes while being resistant to adverse conditions. For example, the SMS cells are sensitive to media compositions conducive to differentiation, as well as changes to PH and temperature. These same cells are resistant to adverse conditions that cause death to other human cells including but not limited to elevated or reduced temperatures, PH, ionic strength, freezing and thawing in growth medium. For example, various embodiments of the SMS cells described herein can be frozen and then thawed without the need for a protectant.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the media is DMEM low glucose or DMEA high glucose, optionally with Hepes or serum. In other embodiments, the environmental change is a media composition conducive to differentiation, a change to the pH, an elevated temperature or a reduced temperature and the adverse condition that causes death to other human cells is freezing and thawing in a growth medium, ionic strength, elevated or reduced temperature, or pH. In specific embodiments, the elevated temperature is about 90&#xb0; C. and the reduced temperature is less than about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. In other specific embodiments, the pH is between about 6 to 9.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Various embodiments of the SMS cells are robust and highly proliferative in standard media. For example, a single SMS cell line maintains a state of continuous growth for at least one 1 year, at least 2 years, at least 3 years, at least 4 years, or between 1-5 years, between 1-4 years, or between 2-3 years.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In various embodiments, the SMS cell lines can be grown in a basal medium without serum or special additives, including but not limited to growth factors.

However, although various embodiments of the present invention will be described herein, it is understood that these embodiments are presented by way of example only, and not limitation.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The invention described and elaborated herein refers to by us discovered human Small Mobile stem cell line (SMS) (Rahmo et al (2013) 1 Journal of life sciences and technologies 56-61) its isolation, and its differentiation into other cell types and to multicellular macrostructures. While the present application is exemplified using the SMS stem cell line derived from the human cord blood and from peripheral blood, this is not intended to limit the scope and subject of the present application and those skilled in the art will recognize that the novel stem cell type its isolation, differentiation and resulting complex cellular macrostructures described herein may be derived from a variety of different tissue sources that include SMS cells.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The present invention arose from the present inventors initial observations of very small sized adherent cells (&#x2dc;5 &#x3bc;m) in a standard cell culture system. These uniquely shaped SMS cells were equi-dimensional, with strict radial symmetry. They exhibit in a light microscope a translucent cytoplasm, and a circular nucleus (&#x2dc;3 &#x3bc;m) that includes a centrally located very small circle (&#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;m) of different light contrast. Depending on focusing plane, the minute circle appeared darker or lighter. These, throughout cell culture, stable contours of the small cell bear resemblance to the shape of a human &#x201c;Iris&#x201d; (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). The observed concentric inner circle appears to be a result of cell surface invagination. This observation is comparable to what is microscopically perceived for the biconcave surface structure of red blood cells (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">SMS cells were clearly distinguished following 3-4 weeks of cell culture initiation. Cells with the described appearance did not stain with any of the standard Staining techniques (giemsa, methylene blue, Papanicola, and Wright staining) (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). SMS cells strongly adhered to plastic, and detachment using trypsin recipes was unsuccessful. Cells were therefore dislodged using a scraper or through cold shock treatment. Primary culture cells reached confluency in 3-4 weeks. SMS cells were able to proliferate into a multilayer.

(2010) &#x201c;Cell motility studies using digital holographic microscopy,&#x201d;. in: Microscopy: Science, Technology, Applications and Education. A. Mendez-Vilas, J. Diaz, Ed.

Fast cellular movements were microscopically observed real time in some cells; that is during normal cell culture conditions. Cell speeds of about 1.5 &#x3bc;m/sec were readily measured (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Such fast cellular movements can be induced in almost the entire cell population; that is by applying what can be categorized as adverse cellular conditions (PH shock, cold chock, dislodging). Cellular movement was also observed in cell cultures containing osteogenic inductive media; in this case whole clusters of cells appeared to be dragged by single cells. The motile features of SMS cell line were quite surprising, since obtained speed values exceeded that of neutrophiles; they are therefore an important defining feature of SMS cells.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Cell movements include also movements characterized by a cell cluster moving collectively (i.e., remaining in contact during movement). Collective movement is now widely recognized in embryogenesis and cancer (Mayor et al. (2010) 20 (6) Trends Cell Biol 319-28). SMS fast moving cells allow observation in short time intervals; in which holding culture parameters constant is easily achieved. Accordingly, they serve as an important model, amenable for studying such complex tissue pattern forming movements (Rahmo et al (2013) 1 (1) Journal of life sciences and technologies 56-61).</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Multilayer Formation</heading><p id="p-0110" num="0109">SMS cell lines display a robust proliferative potential with formation of cellular multilayer in vitro using the growth medium including serum and the one excluding serum and in the absence of any added substance such as matrigel or cell extracellular matrix proteins.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Extensive ECM Production</heading><p id="p-0111" num="0110">SMS cell lines are able to co-synthesize organized layers of ECM during extensive cell proliferation.

Radial symmetry is converted hence into bilateral symmetry (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Flat Longitudinal SMS derived cell assemblies (FLS) appear to apply a wrapping mechanism for creating a tubular structure (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref>). Edges of FLS cell assembly fold and connect forming a hollow core (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref>). SMS derived cells of differing shape are attracted to the assembly, and coat the extended tubular structure (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>F</figref>). The coated tubular assembly structure appears to extend by mobilizing other FLS derived cells (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>G</figref>). Depending on FLS association pattern (sideway or at the tip), tubes may grow in length or diameter, or even extend branches (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>H</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). These large structures detach readily from the adherent fraction and are observed floating in media. Occasionally several of coated tubular assemblies are floating, attached by connective membrane (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>I</figref>). This process can be easily observed on living cells in culture.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Two dimensional leaf mesh assembly and derivatives (membrane&#x2014;tube transition by crescent formation, fusion, and slicing, two dimensional membrane fenestration): SMS cells aggregate in a characteristic organized ramification, embedded as a 2D planar complex within ECM. The core is mostly linear. From that core perpendicular branches at regular intervals are extending and yet smaller ones grow at regular intervals perpendicular to primary branches (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>E</figref>). This leaf vein like formation is quite invisible in unstained culture flask. Merely the portions of the fixed culture flask stained with Masson Goldner trichrome method, reveal the actual presence of the leaf vein like organized assemblies (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>). The organized ramification matures into a fine mesh that covers a large surface area and appears rather like a network of fine connecting tubular web (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>G</figref>).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Membrane&#x2014;tube transition by crescent formation, fusion and slicing: Side branches tend to form characteristic crescent structures. They include flat longitudinal SMS cell derived assemblies (FLS) that appear to move in targeted directions. Concomitantly, a membrane layer is being digested in the direction of FLS movement (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>D</figref>). The merger of the crescent structures establishes large membrane folds, representing pre-tubular structures embedded in a planar connective membrane (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>G</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>H</figref>). Large pre-tubular structures are further processed by slicing it out from the embedding connective membrane (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>I</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>J</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>K</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>L</figref>). The result is a rather long free nascent tube.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Chronically coordinated asymmetrical cuts, appear to be involved, and may ensure correct membrane curvature, coaxing membrane into predestined tube. The internal stress exerted by the fibrous components of the connective membrane could be an essential contributor to membrane curvature and tube formation. The size of the nascent tube varies depending on the number of crescent fusions at earlier stage. However, even the pre-tube appears to exert the ability to fuse with other tubes (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>H</figref>). Depending on fusion site, the outcome may be a tube of larger diameter, or extended length, or the formation of a branching tube (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>H</figref>). Physical properties of the tube (including but not limited to, flexibility, ability to fuse, ability to branch, etc.) may relate to membrane chemical constitution, which is suggested by the observed different susceptibility of nascent tubes to different dyes.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Membrane fenestration: Some of the crescent formations merge to create fenestrations (holes) in the connective membrane. These may appear like circular windows of various diameters opening to other layers (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>I</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>J</figref>). The white background observed in these figures is mostly crammed with unstained, almost unrecognizable, SMS cells. These fenestrations provide access for fluids (including nutrients or signal molecules) into other histological layers. Since many tubes of the present mesh assembly appear well connected to these fenestrations (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>I</figref>), they may also permit easy access of fluids to the tubular mesh assembly system. In addition, they may provide depending on diameter easy access for individual cells, cell aggregates and/or cell constructs.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Comparison of observed structures with sheep heart tissue: The structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> is consistent with the one observed in three dimensional cluster mesh assembly in cell culture (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>H</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, the structure is similar to intermediary step of the coated tubular assembly. Two dimensional leaf mesh assembly stained using Amido black is observed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>C</figref> and related structures stained with Masson Goldner trichrome in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>D</figref>. Clearly observed in stained preparation are also: crescent formation (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>E</figref>) Membrane Tube transition (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>G</figref>). Fenestrations are also obvious (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>H</figref>) but may take at times different shapes than the one produced in SMS cell culture (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>I</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 6: Screening Sheep/Rat Tissues for Cells with Characteristic SMS Cell Shape</heading><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Screening various tissues from sheep and rat organs indicated the abundant presence of cells that have the exceptional characteristic shape of SMS cells (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> to <b>39</b></figref>). Microscopic examination using histochemical staining demonstrate also the presence of the tissue like structure observed in the in Vitro SMS cell culture (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>). Several obtained microscopic pictures of various stained tissues suggest farther a continuum in the process of differentiation, from the small simple SMS cell type to other type differentiated cells (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>). This is suggested by a gradual shift, from the typical characteristic morphology of SMS cells, to other diverse cellular forms (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 7: Neuronal Antigens in Differentiated SMS Cells</heading><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Cells obtained by in vitro neurogenic differentiation of cultured SMS cells were tested for various antigens that are typical to neuronal cells.
