In particular, the present invention is directed to a bandage including an absorbent layer including at least one incision in the shape of a spiral to improve flexibility of the bandage as a whole.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional bandages typically include an absorbent layer, sometimes referred to as an absorbent core, that absorbs liquid as a wound or abrasion heals. The absorbent core, in many cases, is made of materials that are generally stiff which limits flexibility of the bandage. This may result in discomfort for the patient. In addition, since the bandage is stiff, in many cases, it is difficult for the bandage to conform properly to the part of the user's body that it is being applied to. For example, a stiff bandage may not drape properly over certain body parts such as heels and elbows, which may result in an unsecure fit. Since absorbency is important to encourage healing, effective absorbent materials must be used even if they are uncomfortable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, it would be beneficial to provide a bandage that avoids these and other problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present disclosure to provide a bandage that is absorbent, stable and includes at least one incision in the shape of a spiral in an absorbent layer thereof to improve flexibility and comfort of the bandage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A bandage in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure includes a top film;

In embodiments, the bandage <b>10</b> may include an absorbent core <b>16</b> positioned substantially in a center of the bandage. In embodiments, a top film <b>12</b> may be provided above the absorbent core <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for example). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the term &#x201c;above&#x201d; refers to a position further from a user's skin when the bandage <b>10</b> is applied thereto. In embodiments, this top film <b>12</b> may be made of polyurethane, however, the film <b>12</b> is not limited to this material and may be made of any suitable material.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In embodiments, an adhesive layer (not shown) may be provided under the top film layer <b>12</b>, closer to the patient's skin when the bandage <b>10</b> is in place. In embodiments, the adhesive layer keeps the top film layer <b>12</b> in place and prevents buckling of the bandage <b>10</b>. In embodiments, the adhesive layer may be implemented as a continuous or discontinuous coating of adhesive provided on a bottom (lower) surface of the film <b>12</b>, rather than as a separate layer of material. In embodiments, the adhesive layer may be made of or include acrylic adhesive, but any suitable adhesive may be used. In embodiments, the adhesive layer may be a separate layer including a substrate with an adhesive material provided on a top (upper) and bottom (lower) surface thereof. In embodiments, the adhesive may be applied in a pattern using a roller and template. In embodiments, different patterns may be used for the adhesive.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In embodiments, the adhesive layer may be used to connect the film layer <b>12</b> to the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b>. An advantage of using this configuration is that the adhesive layer prevents bunching or folding of the bandage <b>10</b> during application and use. In embodiments, the adhesive layer may not be used at all.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In embodiments, the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b> may be provided under the adhesive layer and in contact therewith such that it is adhered to the top film <b>12</b>. In embodiments, the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b> may be directly in contact with the film <b>12</b>. In embodiments, the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b> may be made of a hydrogel or a hydrocolloid and absorbs moisture from the wound covered by the bandage <b>10</b>. While a hydrocolloid or a hydrogel are preferred materials to be included on the layer <b>16</b>, other suitably absorbent materials may be used, provided that they are sufficiently absorbent. In embodiments, the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b> may be translucent or transparent. In embodiments, the absorbent core <b>16</b> may include multiple layers. In embodiments, the absorbent core <b>16</b> may include at least one layer of hydrophilic foam. In embodiments, silicone in combination with superabsorbent polymers or fibers may be used to form the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b>, or a portion thereof. In embodiments, the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b> may include polyvinyl alcohol foam. In embodiments, the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b> may be made of a super absorbent polymer. In embodiments, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the absorbent layer <b>16</b> may include two layers of material. In embodiments, a top layer <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the core <b>16</b> may be made of a super absorbent polymer while the bottom layer <b>16</b><i>c </i>of the core <b>16</b> may be made of hydrophilic polyurethane foam. In embodiments, adhesive may be provided to connect the two layers <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>together. In embodiments, an adhesive layer, with adhesive on both sides may be provided to connect the layers <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>. In embodiments, no adhesive may be used between layers of the absorbent layer <b>16</b>. In embodiments, the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b> may include additional layers. In embodiments, the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b> may include a single layer. In embodiments, the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b> may be made of, or include, other materials provided that it is sufficiently absorbent to absorb substantial fluid from the wound without requiring replacement, since frequent removal of the bandage <b>10</b> increases the risk of infection. In embodiments, the absorbent layer <b>16</b> may be sufficiently absorbent to absorb fluid from a wound continuously.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Since wounds excrete fluid at different rates depending on the condition of the wound, bandages may need to be changed more frequently depending on the rate of healing of the wound. In embodiments, a caregiver may monitor the status of the bandage <b>10</b> and will change it after it has absorbed sufficient fluid such that it swells to the point that it is uncomfortable to the patient. In embodiments, the patient them self may monitor the status of the bandage <b>10</b> and determine when it becomes uncomfortable. In embodiments, the bandage <b>10</b> may be removed where observation indicates that a wound is not healing or where a wound is developing for treatment and a new bandage may be applied. In embodiments, the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b> may include one or more active ingredients. In embodiments, the active ingredient may be an antimicrobial substance. In embodiments, the active ingredient may be an additive that provides an indication of infection in the wound. In embodiments, an additive may be provided to reduce odors. In embodiment, other active ingredients may be added to provide other features.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In embodiments, a perforated adhesive lower layer <b>18</b> may be provided under the absorbent layer <b>16</b> between the absorbent material and the user's skin. In embodiments, the perforated adhesive lower layer <b>18</b> may be implemented using a polyurethane, or other film with a silicone based adhesive provided thereon to secure the bandage <b>10</b> to the user's skin. In embodiments, an acrylic based adhesive may be provided on the upper surface of the perforated adhesive layer <b>18</b> to secure it to the absorbent layer <b>16</b> while a silicone based adhesive is provided on a bottom surface and contacts the user's skin. In embodiments, the silicone adhesive on the lower surface of the perforated adhesive lower layer <b>18</b> adheres to the user's skin around the wound while avoiding a strong bond with the wound. In embodiments, other materials may be used to make the layer <b>18</b>, provided that the adhesive that faces the user's skin is silicone based. In embodiments, perforations in the adhesive lower layer <b>18</b> allow fluid to pass from the wound on the user's skin, through the lower layer <b>18</b> and into the absorbent layer <b>16</b> where it is absorbed. In embodiments, the perforated adhesive lower layer <b>18</b> provides a stable and firm connection to the user's skin to keep the bandage <b>10</b> in place while being relatively comfortable. In addition, the silicone based adhesive allows for relatively easy removal, without damaging the wound.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In embodiments, the absorbent layer <b>16</b> includes at least one incision <b>16</b><i>a</i>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example. In embodiments, the incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>may be in the shape of a spiral that begins substantially at a center of the absorbent layer <b>16</b> and extends toward the edge thereof. In embodiments the incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>may extend through the entire absorbent layer <b>16</b>. In embodiments, the spiral incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>may extend through only a portion of the absorbent layer. In embodiments, where the absorbent layer <b>16</b> includes multiple layers <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>, the incision may extend completely through the foam layer <b>16</b><i>c </i>and not through the polymer layer <b>16</b><i>b</i>. In embodiments, the incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>may extend completely through both the foam layer <b>16</b><i>c </i>and the polymer layer <b>16</b><i>b</i>. In embodiments, the incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>may extend completely through the foam layer <b>16</b><i>c </i>and partially through the polymer layer <b>16</b><i>b </i>or vice versa. In embodiments, the incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>may extend partially through the foam layer <b>16</b><i>c</i>, and not into the polymer layer <b>16</b><i>b </i>at all or vice versa. In embodiments, the incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>may pass through one or more layers of the core <b>16</b> and not through others. In embodiments, the incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>may pass through one or more layers of the core <b>16</b> and partially through others. The incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>allows for flexing of the absorbent layer <b>16</b> so that the bandage <b>10</b> is more flexible. As a result, the bandage <b>10</b> is generally more comfortable to wear and flexes with the user as they move such that it stays better attached to the user's body. In addition, the incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>allows the bandage <b>10</b> to bend and flex to conform the shape of the user's body at the point where it is attached to provide for a more secure connection to the user's skin. In embodiments, the spiral shape of the incision <b>16</b><i>a </i>allows for flexing in all directions from the center out to the edges of the absorbent layer or core <b>16</b>.
