The spindle arms that reside in the processing module can accumulate deposition material from deposition processes carried out in the processing module. In a processing module that deposits a slippery film on wafers, a wafer can slip from a spindle arm while being indexed between stations after the spindle arm accumulates the deposition material over a period of time. The accumulation of the deposition material on the spindle arm over time limits the batch size for the processing module, which significantly impacts the throughput. The present disclosure provides a purging system that can generate concentrated purge around points of wafer contact on the spindle arms. The purging system prevents or reduces buildup of the deposition material on the spindle arms and prevent wafer sliding.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The ring-less wafer transfer system comprises spindle arms located between two adjacent stations in the processing module. The spindle arms can move over the pedestal. The lift pins transfer the wafer from the pedestal to the spindle arms. Then the spindle arms can index to move the wafer from one station to another in the processing module. The spindle arms can reside in the processing module. The spindle arms are exposed to the deposition processes performed on the wafers in the processing module. Accordingly, the film being deposited on a wafer can also deposits on the spindle arms during the deposition process. After accumulation of a slippery film on a spindle arm, a wafer being transported by the spindle arm can slide off the spindle arm during indexing. A slipped wafer in most cases can lead to either a broken wafer or a scrapped wafer. Further, recovering the wafer in most cases requires opening the processing module, which causes significant downtime. One way to contain the problem of wafer slippage is to reduce the batch size, which impacts the throughput of the tool.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present disclosure generally provides a purging system that introduces a purge gas over the contact pads of the spindle arms to prevent deposition on the contact pads of the spindle arms. Alternatively, the purging system can also introduce the purge gas over the entire spindle arms to prevent deposition on the spindle arms. The purging system can reduce or mitigate the risk of wafer sliding. The purging is performed during the deposition process. That is, the purging is performed while the deposition on a wafer is in progress. The purge gas can be any inert gas such. For example, argon can be used as the purge gas.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The purge gas can be brought into the processing chamber through an opening or an inlet in the processing chamber using a custom seal. The flow rate of the purge gas can be regulated using a pressure regulator. The inlet to the processing chamber can have an orifice. By controlling pressure and the orifice size, the flow rate of the purge gas into the processing chamber can be controlled.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The purge gas can be equally distributed to the stations in the processing chamber using a network of gas lines inside the processing chamber. The gas lines can be connected to each other using interconnecting assemblies with custom designed seals. The purge gas can then flow into liners/filler plates surrounding each station. An inlet to a liner can have an orifice to equally distribute the gas between the stations of the processing chamber. The liners can have an internal channel within them that takes in the purge gas from one inlet and channels the purge gas to four outlets (called purge orifices) that are concentrated around the points of wafer contact on the spindle arms. For example, the gas lines and the liners can be made of aluminum. The liners are manufactured using, for example, friction stir welding process.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Notably, the purge system can be independent of the recipes and chemistries used for wafer deposition. That is, the purging process using the purge gas can prevents or reduces deposition on the spindle arms regardless of the recipes and chemistries used for depositing material on wafers. Further, the purging process prevent or reduce deposition on the spindle arms regardless of the pressure and temperature used in the processing chamber during wafer deposition. The purging process can be carried out during wafer deposition. For example, the gas lines run below the lift pin ring in each station. Thus, the gas lines do not interfere with the movements of the lift pins.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The present disclosure is organized as follows. Initially, an example of a processing chamber is shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Subsequently, various layouts and structures of the purging system according to the present disclosure are shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>. Thereafter, additional views and structural details of various elements of the purging system are shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>17</b></figref>.

While the example is described in the context of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), the teachings of the present disclosure can be applied to other types of substrate processing such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD), CVD, or also other processing including etching processes. The system <b>100</b> comprises the processing chamber <b>102</b> that encloses other components of the system <b>100</b> and contains an RF plasma (if used). The processing chamber <b>102</b> comprises an upper electrode <b>104</b> and an electrostatic chuck (ESC) <b>106</b> or other substrate support. During operation, a substrate <b>108</b> is arranged on the ESC <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the upper electrode <b>104</b> may include a gas distribution device <b>110</b> such as a showerhead that introduces and distributes process gases. The gas distribution device <b>110</b> may include a stem portion including one end connected to a top surface of the processing chamber <b>102</b>. A base portion of the showerhead is generally cylindrical and extends radially outwardly from an opposite end of the stem portion at a location that is spaced from the top surface of the processing chamber <b>102</b>. A substrate-facing surface or faceplate of the base portion of the showerhead includes a plurality of holes through which vaporized precursor, process gas, or purge gas flows. Alternately, the upper electrode <b>104</b> may include a conducting plate, and the process gases may be introduced in another manner.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The ESC <b>106</b> comprises a baseplate <b>112</b> that acts as a lower electrode. The baseplate <b>112</b> supports a heating plate <b>114</b>, which may correspond to a ceramic multi-zone heating plate. A thermal resistance layer <b>116</b> may be arranged between the heating plate <b>114</b> and the baseplate <b>112</b>. The baseplate <b>112</b> may include one or more channels <b>118</b> for flowing coolant through the baseplate <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">If plasma is used, an RF generating system <b>120</b> generates and outputs an RF voltage to one of the upper electrode <b>104</b> and the lower electrode (e.g., the baseplate <b>112</b> of the ESC <b>106</b>). The other one of the upper electrode <b>104</b> and the baseplate <b>112</b> may be DC grounded, AC grounded, or floating. For example only, the RF generating system <b>120</b> may include an RF generator <b>122</b> that generates RF power that is fed by a matching and distribution network <b>124</b> to the upper electrode <b>104</b> or the baseplate <b>112</b>. In other examples, the plasma may be generated inductively or remotely.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A gas delivery system <b>130</b> includes one or more gas sources <b>132</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>132</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . , and <b>132</b>-N (collectively gas sources <b>132</b>), where N is an integer greater than zero. The gas sources <b>132</b> are connected by valves <b>134</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>134</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . , and <b>134</b>-N (collectively valves <b>134</b>) and mass flow controllers <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>136</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . , and <b>136</b>-N (collectively mass flow controllers <b>136</b>) to a manifold <b>140</b>. A vapor delivery system <b>142</b> supplies vaporized precursor to the manifold <b>140</b> or another manifold (not shown) that is connected to the processing chamber <b>102</b>. An output of the manifold <b>140</b> is fed to the processing chamber <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A temperature controller <b>150</b> may be connected to a plurality of thermal control elements (TCEs) <b>152</b> arranged in the heating plate <b>114</b>. The temperature controller <b>150</b> may be used to control the plurality of TCEs <b>152</b> to control a temperature of the ESC <b>106</b> and the substrate <b>108</b>. The temperature controller <b>150</b> may communicate with a coolant assembly <b>154</b> to control coolant flow through the channels <b>118</b>. For example, the coolant assembly <b>154</b> may include a coolant pump, a reservoir, and one or more temperature sensors (not shown). The temperature controller <b>150</b> operates the coolant assembly <b>154</b> to selectively flow the coolant through the channels <b>118</b> to cool the ESC <b>106</b>. A valve <b>156</b> and pump <b>158</b> may be used to evacuate reactants from the processing chamber <b>102</b>. A system controller <b>160</b> controls the components of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Lift pins are retained by lift pin holders arranged on a lift pin ring (shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> below) and are used to allow delivery and removal of the substrate <b>108</b> from the processing chamber <b>102</b> using a robot arm (e.g., a spindle arm described below). Normally, an upper end of the lift pins is located flush with or below an upper surface of the substrate support assembly <b>106</b>. During substrate delivery or removal, the lift pins are raised relative to an upper surface of the substrate support assembly <b>106</b> to lift the substrate <b>108</b> and provide clearance between the substrate <b>108</b> and the substrate support assembly <b>106</b>. The clearance between the substrate <b>108</b> and the substrate support assembly <b>106</b> allows an end effector of the robot arm to be inserted or removed.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a processing chamber <b>200</b> including a plurality of stations. For example, the processing chamber <b>200</b> includes four stations <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>202</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>202</b>-<b>3</b>, and <b>202</b>-<b>4</b> (collectively the plurality of stations <b>202</b>; or synonymously, the stations <b>202</b>). In general, the processing chamber <b>200</b> may include two or more stations <b>202</b>. The processing chamber <b>200</b> includes a plurality of spindle arms. For example, since the processing chamber <b>200</b> includes four stations <b>202</b>, the processing chamber <b>200</b> includes four spindle arms <b>204</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>204</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>204</b>-<b>3</b>, and <b>204</b>-<b>4</b> (collectively the plurality of spindle arms <b>204</b>; or synonymously, the spindle arms <b>204</b>). A spindle <b>205</b> drives the spindle arms <b>204</b>. A controller (e.g., the controller <b>160</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) controls the spindle <b>205</b> and the spindle arms <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Each station <b>202</b> includes a liner that lines an upper circumference of the station <b>202</b> along a plane that is parallel to a plane in which a wafer lies in the station <b>202</b> during processing.

Such systems can comprise semiconductor processing equipment, including a processing tool or tools, chamber or chambers, a platform or platforms for processing, and/or specific processing components (a wafer pedestal, a gas flow system, etc.). These systems may be integrated with electronics for controlling their operation before, during, and after processing of a semiconductor wafer or substrate. The electronics may be referred to as the &#x201c;controller,&#x201d; which may control various components or subparts of the system or systems. The controller, depending on the processing requirements and/or the type of system, may be programmed to control any of the processes disclosed herein, including the delivery of processing gases, temperature settings (e.g., heating and/or cooling), pressure settings, vacuum settings, power settings, radio frequency (RF) generator settings, RF matching circuit settings, frequency settings, flow rate settings, fluid delivery settings, positional and operation settings, wafer transfers into and out of a tool and other transfer tools and/or load locks connected to or interfaced with a specific system.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Broadly speaking, the controller may be defined as electronics having various integrated circuits, logic, memory, and/or software that receive instructions, issue instructions, control operation, enable cleaning operations, enable endpoint measurements, and the like. The integrated circuits may include chips in the form of firmware that store program instructions, digital signal processors (DSPs), chips defined as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and/or one or more microprocessors, or microcontrollers that execute program instructions (e.g., software). Program instructions may be instructions communicated to the controller in the form of various individual settings (or program files), defining operational parameters for carrying out a particular process on or for a semiconductor wafer or to a system.

For example, the controller may be in the &#x201c;cloud&#x201d; or all or a part of a fab host computer system, which can allow for remote access of the wafer processing. The computer may enable remote access to the system to monitor current progress of fabrication operations, examine a history of past fabrication operations, examine trends or performance metrics from a plurality of fabrication operations, to change parameters of current processing, to set processing steps to follow a current processing, or to start a new process.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some examples, a remote computer (e.g. a server) can provide process recipes to a system over a network, which may include a local network or the Internet. The remote computer may include a user interface that enables entry or programming of parameters and/or settings, which are then communicated to the system from the remote computer. In some examples, the controller receives instructions in the form of data, which specify parameters for each of the processing steps to be performed during one or more operations. It should be understood that the parameters may be specific to the type of process to be performed and the type of tool that the controller is configured to interface with or control.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Thus, as described above, the controller may be distributed, such as by comprising one or more discrete controllers that are networked together and working towards a common purpose, such as the processes and controls described herein.
