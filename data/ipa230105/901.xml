APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Korean Patent Applications Nos. 10-2021-0082583, filed Jun. 24, 2021, and 10-2021-0179674, filed Dec. 15, 2021, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein for all purposes by this reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present specification discloses a nanoemulsion composition of oxygen gas sustained release and method for preparing the same, including a water phase part containing water; and an oil phase part dispersed in the water phase part and made of nanoparticle containing a perfluorocarbon compound, wherein the oil phase part contains oxygen gas and the oxygen gas is released in sustained release.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most animals shed and regrow hair seasonally, but humans shed about 100 strands of hair out of about 100,000 strands and about 100 strands regrow every day, thus always maintaining a similar number. Although hair is not an organ critical in sustaining life, it is an indicator of health state and an important part of the body in terms of appearance. Whereas hair loss is considered a normal physiological event for those with a lot of hair, those who suffer from severe hair loss can be badly affected in terms of mental well-being and quality of life due to depression, sense of shame, social isolation, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The hair growth cycle consists of anagen, catagen and telogen phases. During the anagen phase, hair growth is promoted as cell division occurs actively in the hair dermal papilla, and hair grows only in this stage. Considering that the anagen is about 3 to 5 years for men and about 4 to 6 years for women, about 80 to 85% of hair is in the anagen phase. In the catagen phase, which lasts about 3 to 4 weeks, the cell division declines gradually. Lastly, in the telogen phase, the hair dermal papilla is withdrawn and the hair separated from the capillary vessel and simply stuck in the scalp. This lasts about 3 months and the hair in the telogen phase is easily lost upon physical stimulation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 10-2010-0116882 discloses that a composition containing a natural extract can be applied to prevent hair loss or promote hair growth. However, according to the process (hair loss) of the scalp becoming bald, the microvessels connected to the hair roots are thinned, which results in insufficient oxygen supply through the microvessels. As the basis for hair loss scalp due to insufficient oxygen, there has been a report that lactate, which occurs when oxygen metabolism is insufficient, is accumulated. There has been a report that the activity of hair stem cells is increased again when an enzyme (lactate dehydrogenase) that degrades the lactate is treated. To summarize, oxygen is the most important element in promoting or maintaining the growth of dermal papilla cells, which are located in the center of the hair follicle and are the basis of new hair generation (Non-Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Oxygen for activating the metabolism of dermal papilla cells is a gas, so it cannot penetrate the skin in a general way. Accordingly, there is a need for research and development on a composition capable of preventing hair loss or promoting hair growth by increasing the amount of oxygen supplied to the hair bulb.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure has been devised to solve the above problems, and an object of the present disclosure is to provide a composition and method for preparing the same capable of preventing hair loss or promoting hair growth by increasing the amount of oxygen gas supplied to the hair bulb and the oxygen release time from the hair bulb.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve the object of the present disclosure described above, the present disclosure provides a nanoemulsion composition of oxygen gas sustained release and method for preparing the same, including a water phase part containing water, and an oil phase part dispersed in the water phase part and made of nanoparticle containing a perfluorocarbon compound, wherein the oil phase part contains oxygen gas, and the oxygen gas is released in sustained release.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present disclosure, there is an advantage of preventing hair loss or promoting hair growth by increasing the amount of oxygen gas supplied to the hair bulb and the oxygen release time from the hair bulb.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading

Every minimum numerical limitation given throughout this specification includes all higher numerical limitations as if the higher numerical limitation were expressly written. Any numerical limitation given throughout this specification shall include all numerical ranges within the broader numerical range, as if the narrower numerical limitation were expressly written.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, the words &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; &#x201c;containing,&#x201d; are inclusive or open-ended and do not exclude additional unrecited elements or method steps. As used herein, the term &#x201c;or combinations thereof&#x201d; refers to all permutations and combinations of items listed prior to the term. For example, &#x201c;A, B, C, or a combination thereof&#x201d; means A, B, C, AB, AC, BC or ABC, and it is intended to include at least one of BA, CA, CB, CBA, BCA, ACB, BAC or CAB where order is important in a particular context. With this example, combinations containing repetitions of one or more items or terms are expressly included, such as BB, AAA, MB, BBC, AAABCCCC, CBBAAA, CABABB, and the like. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that there is typically no limit to the number of items or terms in any combination, unless the context makes it clear otherwise.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to examples and drawings. However, it is obvious that the present invention is not limited by the following examples and drawings.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a nanoemulsion composition of oxygen gas sustained release including a water phase part containing water; and an oil phase part dispersed in the water phase part and made of nanoparticle containing a perfluorocarbon compound, wherein the oil phase part contains oxygen gas, and the oxygen gas is released in sustained release.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Unlike microemulsion, nanoemulsion is a kinetically stable emulsion, and since there is no aggregation or coalescence between particles, it is stable for a long period of time even under low viscosity conditions. The reason why the nanoemulsion is used as a useful formulation is that (1) the particles are very small, so they are not affected by gravity due to the Brownian motion of the particles, so they are free from precipitation or creaming, (2) that there is no aggregation phenomenon with small particles, so the possibility of emulsion separation is low, (3) that small particles can prevent coalescence due to less deformation of the particles, (4) that it can improve skin penetration of active ingredients by retaining a wide interfacial membrane with small particles, and (5) that it can be prepared with significantly less amount of surfactant compared to microemulsions. The nanoemulsion may be an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The &#x201c;oxygen gas&#x201d; may be naturally occurring oxygen or synthetically produced oxygen. In general, it is known that the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere is at a level of 20 to 22%, and an oxygen condition of about 20% is called a normoxia condition. An oxygen condition of 1 to 5% is called a hypoxia condition, and an oxygen condition of 1% or less is called an extreme hypoxia (or anoxia) condition. Since hair follicles can grow in an oxygen condition of 0.1 to 0.8%, it is necessary to maintain the oxygen condition in order to prevent hair loss or promote hair growth.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;immediate release&#x201d; refers to a drug in which active ingredients are released immediately, and is a formulation that releases most of the active ingredients within a few seconds. In contrast, the term &#x201c;sustained release&#x201d; refers to a formulation that releases active ingredients slowly for several tens of seconds to several hours, and is designed to maintain an effective amount of the active ingredients over a relatively long period of time. It refers to a formulation with fewer side effects because the number of administrations is less than that of a general drug and the bioreaction is uniform because of the characteristic of a &#x201c;sustained release&#x201d; formulation that lasts for a certain period of time after reaching a therapeutic blood concentration. The nanoemulsion composition of the present disclosure exhibits a &#x201c;oxygen gas sustained release&#x201d; profile, thereby releasing oxygen for a period of at least 10 seconds or maintaining an oxygen condition favorable for preventing hair loss or promoting hair growth.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, the average diameter of the nanoparticles may be 100 nm to 300 nm.
