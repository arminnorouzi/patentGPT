Viewed from the positive direction of the third direction Z, when a swinging angle of the movable reflector <b>120</b> is 0 degrees, the electromagnetic wave transmitted from the transmitting unit <b>110</b> and reflected by the movable reflector <b>120</b> passes through the center of the field of view F.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The movable reflector <b>120</b> is also capable of swinging around an axis (not shown) crossing both of the one direction (the positive direction of the first direction X) and a stretching direction (the third direction Z) of the axis <b>122</b>, specifically, stretching along a direction (the second direction Y) orthogonal to the both. Therefore, when viewed from the positive direction or the negative direction of the second direction Y, the field of view F extends as advancing toward the front (the positive direction of the first direction X) of the sensor device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present embodiment, the optical device <b>100</b> is a coaxial type LiDAR. That is, an axis passed through by the electromagnetic wave emitted by the optical device <b>100</b> (the electromagnetic wave emitted toward the outside of the optical device <b>100</b> by the movable reflector <b>120</b>) and axis passed through by the electromagnetic wave returning to the optical device <b>100</b> (the electromagnetic wave which is emitted from the optical device <b>100</b>, reflected or scattered by the target which exists in the outside of the optical device <b>100</b>, and becomes incident on the movable reflector <b>120</b>) match. However, the optical device <b>100</b> may be a biaxial type LiDAR. That is, the optical device <b>100</b> need not include the movable reflector <b>120</b>. In this case, the axis passed through by the electromagnetic wave emitted from the optical device <b>100</b> and the axis passed through by the electromagnetic wave returning to the optical device <b>100</b> (the electromagnetic wave which is emitted from the optical device <b>100</b>, reflected or scattered by the target which exists in the outside of the optical device <b>100</b>, and becomes incident on the movable reflector <b>120</b>) become shifted from each other.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Hitherto, the embodiment is described with reference to the drawings. However, these are just examples of the present invention, and various other configurations may be employed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, in the present embodiment, the field of view F of the optical device <b>100</b> is a field of view of a light scanning device such as a LiDAR or the like. However, the field of view F of the optical device <b>100</b> may be a field of view of an image pickup device such as a camera or the like.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">This application claims priority from Japanese Patent.
