In this connection, a glass film formed into a film-like thin sheet shape has been increasingly used as a glass substrate to be employed for each of those devices. While the glass film forms a substantially rectangular shape or the like at the stage of a final product, the glass film is handled so as to form a strip shape at the stages of previous manufacturing steps or various treatment steps.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The glass film of this kind has appropriate flexibility, and is hence sometimes formed into a glass roll in which the glass film is taken up into a roll shape around a winding core or the like in consideration of convenience at the time of storage, transportation, or the like. Accordingly, when the glass film is formed into a glass roll, not only excellent storability and the like are achieved, but also a number of glass films each having a substantially rectangular shape or the like can be easily cut out.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, the glass film of this kind has low mechanical strength and is liable to be damaged or broken, and hence it requires careful attention to handle the glass film as it is. That is, when the glass film is taken up into a roll shape to produce a glass roll, the glass films having been taken up are brought into contact with each other, and damage such as a flaw may occur. In view of this, there is widely performed that the glass film is taken up into a roll shape under the state in which a strip-shaped protective film formed of a resin or the like is stacked thereon to produce a glass roll.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, in Patent Literature 1, there is a disclosure of a method of manufacturing a glass roll, including: bonding a glass film and a protective film including an adhesive layer (pressure-sensitive adhesive surface) to form a laminate film; and taking up the laminate film into a roll shape.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In Patent Literature 1, there is a disclosure that the width of the protective film is set to be smaller than the width of the glass film, or the width of the protective film is set to be equal to or larger than the width of the glass film. The adhesive layer is formed on the entire one surface of the protective film. That is, the adhesive layer has the same size as the protective film.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 1: JP 2018-187797 A</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the width of the protective film is set to be smaller than the width of the glass film in the glass roll disclosed in Patent Literature 1, both end portions of the glass film in a width direction each protrude with respect to the protective film. In this case, the end portions of the glass film in the width direction cannot be protected with the protective film. As a result, for example, when the laminate film having been unwound from the glass roll is loaded into a conveyance facility such as a roll-to-roll device in order to subject the glass film to manufacture-related treatments, such as film formation, printing, and bonding with another member, there is a risk in that the end portions of the glass film in the width direction may be broken by being brought into contact with the conveyance facility (e.g., a guide roller or the like). Even when the width of the protective film is set to be equal to the width of the glass film, the end portions of the glass film in the width direction cannot be sufficiently protected with the protective film, and hence the problem of the breakage of the glass film may occur in the same manner.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, when the width of the protective film is set to be larger than the width of the glass film in the glass roll disclosed in Patent Literature <b>1</b>, both end portions of the protective film in the width direction each protrude with respect to the glass film. In this case, the end portions of the glass film in the width direction can be protected with the protective film, and hence the breakage of the glass film can be suppressed. However, the adhesive layer has the same size as the protective film, and hence the adhesive layer is exposed on the surface of the protective film that protrudes with respect to the end portions of the glass film. As a result, when the laminate film having been unwound from the glass roll is loaded into a conveyance facility, there is a risk in that an adhesive (pressure-sensitive adhesive) forming the adhesive layer may adhere to the conveyance facility to contaminate the conveyance facility. Even when the width of the protective film is set to be equal to the width of the glass film, the end surfaces of the glass film, the protective film, and the adhesive layer in the width direction are positioned on the same plane, and hence the problem of the contamination of the conveyance facility due to adhesion of the adhesive forming the adhesive layer may occur in the same manner.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide a glass roll capable of suppressing contamination of a surrounding environment with an adhesive while suppressing breakage of a glass film.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one embodiment of the present invention, which has been devised in order to solve the above-mentioned problems, there is provided a glass roll, comprising a laminate film taken up into a roll shape, the laminate film comprising a glass film, a protective film, and an adhesive layer, which is arranged between the glass film and the protective film, and is configured to bond the glass film to the protective film, wherein a width of the protective film is larger than a width of the glass film, and both end portions of the protective film in a width direction each protrude with respect to the glass film, and wherein the width of the glass film is larger than a width of the adhesive layer, and both end portions of the glass film in the width direction each protrude with respect to the adhesive layer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With this configuration, the width of the protective film is larger than the width of the glass film, and both the end portions of the protective film in the width direction each protrude with respect to the glass film, and hence both the end portions of the glass film in the width direction are reliably protected with the protective film. In addition, the width of the glass film, which is smaller than that of the protective film, is larger than the width of the adhesive layer, and both the end portions of the glass film in the width direction each protrude with respect to the adhesive layer, and hence the adhesive layer is completely hidden inside the respective end portions of the protective film and the glass film in the width direction. Accordingly, while the breakage of the glass film is suppressed with the protective film, the contamination of a surrounding environment due to adhesion of an adhesive forming the adhesive layer can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the above-mentioned configuration, it is preferred that a protrusion width of each of the end portions of the glass film in the width direction with respect to the adhesive layer be from 0.1 mm to 10 mm.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With this configuration, while a sufficient bonding area for reliably bonding the glass film and the protective film is ensured, the contamination of a conveyance facility with the adhesive layer can be suppressed more reliably.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the above-mentioned configuration, it is preferred that a protrusion width of each of the end portions of the protective film in the width direction with respect to the glass film be from 1 mm to 100 mm.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">With this configuration, while the end portions of the glass film in the width direction are reliably protected with the protective film, a situation in which the protective film becomes excessively larger than the glass film and becomes wasteful can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the above-mentioned configuration, the adhesive layer may be a light pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed on one surface of the protective film.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With this configuration, the glass film can be easily peeled off from the protective film as required.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the above-mentioned configuration, it is preferred that the adhesive layer have a thickness of 100 &#x3bc;m or less.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With this configuration, the adhesive layer becomes sufficiently thin, and hence the contamination of a conveyance facility due to adhesion of an adhesive forming the adhesive layer can be suppressed more reliably.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantageous Effects of Invention</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the present invention, while the breakage of the glass film is suppressed with the protective film, the contamination of a surrounding environment due to adhesion of an adhesive forming the adhesive layer can be suppressed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view for illustrating a glass roll according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along the line S-S of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view for illustrating a method of manufacturing a glass roll according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view for illustrating a method of manufacturing a glass roll according to a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side view for illustrating a method of manufacturing a glass roll according to a third embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Now, embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the attached drawings.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a glass roll <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment is a laminate film <b>5</b> taken up into a roll shape around a winding core <b>6</b>, the laminate film comprising a strip-shaped glass film <b>2</b> and a strip-shaped protective film <b>3</b> stacked on each other via an adhesive layer <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The glass film <b>2</b> has a first surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>and a second surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>in a front and back relationship. In this embodiment, when the glass roll <b>1</b> is used in an electronic part application, the first surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>serves as a guaranteed surface, and the second surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>serves as a non-guaranteed surface. The guaranteed surface is a surface on a product side on which a device or the like is formed, and in which surface properties thereof are guaranteed, and the non-guaranteed surface is a surface in which surface properties thereof are not required to be guaranteed to the degree of those of the guaranteed surface. The glass roll <b>1</b> is configured so that the first surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the second surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the glass film <b>2</b> are inside and outside, respectively. When the glass roll <b>1</b> is used in an application in which surface accuracy is not particularly required, distinction between the guaranteed surface and the non-guaranteed surface is not required.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The thickness of the glass film <b>2</b> is preferably 300 &#x3bc;m or less, more preferably 10 &#x3bc;m or more and 200 &#x3bc;m or less, most preferably 30 &#x3bc;m or more and 100 &#x3bc;m or less.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As a material for the glass film <b>2</b>, there are used silicate glass and silica glass, preferably borosilicate glass, soda lime glass, aluminosilicate glass, and chemical tempered glass, most preferably alkali-free glass. When the alkali-free glass is used as the glass film <b>2</b>, chemically stable glass can be obtained. Herein, the alkali-free glass refers to glass substantially free of an alkali component (alkali metal oxide), specifically glass having a weight ratio of the alkali component of 3,000 ppm or less.
