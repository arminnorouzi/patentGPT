In particular, such laminates are commercially used as packaging materials for food and medicines, for example. When the molded objects described above are manufactured using such laminates including a thermoplastic resin layer that does not contain a polar group and an EVOH layer, scraps such as chips, end portions or other unnecessary portions, defective products, and waste of the molded objects after used in various applications are generated. Such scraps amount to 30% to 50% (area ratio) of the original laminates. Therefore, there are cases where these scraps are collected, melt molded, and reused as a recycled layer (so-called regrind layer, in the present disclosure, such a recycled layer may be referred to as a &#x201c;regrind layer&#x201d;) that constitutes at least one layer of a laminate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, activities for reducing plastic waste are becoming active in recent years, and there are cases where household waste of used containers formed from the above-described molded objects are collected, melt molded, and reused as recycled molded objects such as films, sheets, cups, trays, and bottles. Such recycling techniques are industrially advantageous from the viewpoint of waste reduction and economic efficiency and are practically used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when collected laminates including a thermoplastic resin layer that does not contain a polar group and an EVOH layer are melted again to be reused as a regrind layer or a recycled molded object, the thermoplastic resin that does not contain a polar group and the EVOH cause a compatibility failure because compatibility between the thermoplastic resin that does not contain a polar group and the EVOH is poor, resulting in the generation of phase separation foreign matter (die drool), and such foreign matter or the like is often mixed in a molded object. Therefore, for example, a fish eye or a hole is formed in a molded object, and an appearance defect such as formation of a wave pattern on a surface occurs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Under the above circumstances, in order to improve the compatibility that causes die drool and an appearance defect described above, a technique of blending a saponified ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (hereinafter may be referred to as &#x201c;EVA&#x201d;) having a high ethylene content is known (see PTL 1 to PTL 3).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Specifically, the saponified EVA having a high ethylene content has an ethylene content of 70 mol % or more and is characterized in having high compatibility with polyolefin.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In contrast, the EVOH described above is also a saponified EVA, but has an ethylene content of 20 to 60 mol % and is characterized in having excellent gas barrier properties.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventor of the present disclosure tried methods described in PTL 1 to PTL 3, and found that relatively good results were obtained regarding problems caused by the low compatibility between the thermoplastic resin that does not contain a polar group and the EVOH, but these techniques had a problem in that obtained regrind layers were discolored to yellow or red. Therefore, in order to suppress such discoloration, the inventor of the present disclosure also tried a method of reducing the content of the saponified EVA having a high ethylene content, but the compatibilization effect was reduced and improvements in problems (die drool, an appearance defect, and a reduction in mechanical strength) due to the compatibility failure were insufficient, and therefore, further improvement is desired.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the other hand, a resin composition that contains, as a base resin, a resin obtained using an EVA and a saponified EVA having a high ethylene content in combination has been proposed as a modifier for modifying a compatibility failure of a regrind layer (see PTL 4). However, even if this resin composition was used, there was still room for improvement in the above-described problems of discoloration and a reduction in mechanical strength.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also, in order to improve the compatibility that causes die drool and an appearance defect described above, it is known to use a technique of blending a thermoplastic resin that contains a polar group, such as maleic anhydride-modified polyethylene or maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene (see PTL 5). However, even if this resin composition was used, there was still room for improvement in the above-described problems of discoloration and a reduction in mechanical strength.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0012">PTL 1: JP-A-HEI3(1991)-215032</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0013">PTL 2: JP-A-HEI3(1991)-72542</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0014">PTL 3: JP-A-HEI3(1991)-72539</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0015">PTL 4: JP-A-2002-234971</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0016">PTL 5: WO2012/060371</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0017">The present disclosure was made in view of the above circumstances and provides a resin composition that makes it possible to obtain a molded object having an excellent appearance while preventing a reduction in mechanical strength and discoloration and suppressing generation of die drool even when reusing, as a resin composition, collected chips, end portions or other unnecessary portions, or defective products, which are generated in the manufacture of a laminate containing a thermoplastic resin that does not contain a polar group, a thermoplastic resin that contains a polar group, and the EVOH, or collected waste of molded objects used in various applications.

However, the inventor of the present disclosure found that mechanical strength and the color tone were improved contrary to conventional expectations when a thermoplastic resin that does not contain a polar group, a thermoplastic resin that contains a polar group, an EVOH, an aliphatic carboxylic acid having 3 or more carbon atoms, and a specific metal salt of the aliphatic carboxylic acid were used in combination so as to satisfy a specific relationship.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">As described above, a first aspect of the present disclosure is a resin composition containing: a thermoplastic resin (A) that does not contain a polar group; a thermoplastic resin (B) that contains a polar group; an EVOH (C); an aliphatic carboxylic acid (D) having 3 or more carbon atoms; and an aliphatic carboxylic acid metal salt (E) that is a metal salt of the aliphatic carboxylic acid (D), wherein a metal species of the aliphatic carboxylic acid metal salt (E) is at least one selected from the group consisting of elements belonging to the fourth period d-block in the long periodic table, the thermoplastic resin (A) that does not contain a polar group is contained in an amount of 66 to 99 wt. % with respect to the total sum of contents of the resin composition, and the EVOH (C) is contained in an amount of 0.1 to 25 wt. % with respect to the total sum of the contents of the resin composition.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">A second aspect is a method for manufacturing a resin composition including melt-kneading and pelletizing the resin composition according to the first aspect.

It is also possible to use a stretching method of which the stretching ratio is high from among a roll stretching method, a tenter stretching method, a tubular stretching method, a stretch blow molding method, and vacuum compressed air forming, and the like. The stretching temperature is typically selected within a range of about 40&#xb0; C. to 170&#xb0; C., and preferably 60&#xb0; C. to 160&#xb0; C.
