Moreover, when the information indicating the connectible network is included in the device information, the device authentication processing unit <b>32</b> sends the connectibility/non-connectibility determination result to the access point device <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Besides, when the authentication of the device <b>10</b> based on the first-type authentication information is successful and when network connection by the device <b>10</b> is permitted, then the device authentication processing unit <b>32</b> sends the temporary-key information of the device <b>10</b> to the access point device <b>20</b> of the concerned network. More particularly, the generating unit <b>34</b> issues a temporary key as the second-type authentication information and generates temporary-key information containing information about the temporary key, the key identifier, and the validity period. The temporary-key information is sent to the device authentication processing unit <b>23</b> of the access point device <b>20</b> via the network <b>2</b>. Then, the device authentication processing unit <b>23</b> sends the temporary-key information to the device <b>10</b> via the first communication unit <b>21</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Meanwhile, the authentication result and the connectibility/non-connectibility determination result of the device <b>10</b> can be sent also to the device <b>10</b> in addition to sending the results to the access point device <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Example of Communication Method</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a sequence diagram illustrating an example of the communication method according to the first embodiment. Firstly, the device <b>10</b> sends a network access authentication request to the access point device <b>20</b> via the network <b>1</b> (Step S<b>1</b>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Upon receiving the network access authentication request issued at Step S<b>1</b>, the access point device <b>20</b> transfers the network access authentication request to the authentication server device <b>30</b> (Step S<b>2</b>).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Then, the device <b>10</b> and the authentication server device <b>30</b> perform the authentication operation according to a predetermined authentication protocol (Step S<b>3</b>). When the authentication is successful and when the connection to the network <b>1</b> by the device <b>10</b> is permitted, then the authentication server device <b>30</b> notifies temporary-key information (Step S<b>4</b>). In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the authentication server device <b>30</b> sends the temporary-key information to the access point device <b>20</b> and the device <b>10</b> (Steps S<b>4</b> and S<b>5</b>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the authentication operation performed at Step S<b>3</b>, as a result of receiving a connection permission notification from the authentication server device <b>30</b>, the device <b>10</b> that is permitted to be connected to the network <b>1</b> performs a connection operation with respect to the network <b>1</b> (Step S<b>6</b>).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Subsequently, the device <b>10</b> resends a network access authentication request to the access point device <b>20</b> via the network <b>1</b> (Step S<b>7</b>). For example, when the validity period of the authentication state of the device <b>10</b> expires or when the device <b>10</b> is rebooted, then a network access authentication request is resent.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the access point device <b>20</b> receives an authentication request at Step S<b>7</b>, and performs the authentication operation between the device <b>10</b> and the access point device <b>20</b> using the temporary key (Step S<b>8</b>). When the authentication is successful, then the device <b>10</b> re-performs the connection operation with respect to the network <b>1</b> (Step S<b>9</b>).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Meanwhile, as in the case of Step S<b>8</b>, regarding the method for controlling whether or not the authentication operation is to be performed in the access point device <b>20</b>, any arbitrary method can be implemented.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, based on control information included in the network access authentication request issued by the device <b>10</b>, it can be determined whether or not the authentication operation is to be performed in the access point device <b>20</b>. The control information contains, for example, information indicating the present or absence or the temporary key. Because of such control information, the access point device <b>20</b> determines whether or not to perform the authentication operation for the device <b>10</b> by itself without transferring the network access authentication request to the authentication server device <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, for example, in the case in which the access point device <b>20</b> constantly attempts to authenticate the device <b>10</b> by itself, when the access point device <b>20</b> is not able to authenticate the device <b>10</b> or when the authentication of the device <b>10</b> in the access point device <b>20</b> is not successful, then the access point device <b>20</b> can transfer the network access authentication request to the authentication server device <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, in the case in which the access point device <b>20</b> constantly attempts to transfer the network access authentication request to the authentication server device <b>30</b>, when the network access authentication request cannot be transferred, then the access point device <b>20</b> can authenticate the device <b>10</b> by itself.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As explained above, the communication system <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment includes the device <b>10</b>, the access point device <b>20</b>, and the authentication server device <b>30</b>. The device <b>10</b> is connected to the access point device <b>20</b> via the network <b>1</b> (a first network). The access point device <b>20</b> is connected to the authentication server device <b>30</b> via the network <b>2</b> (a second network). The device <b>10</b> sends, to the access point device <b>20</b>, a network access authentication request issued with respect to the first network. The authentication server device <b>30</b> includes the device authentication processing unit <b>32</b> (a first device-authentication processing unit) that, in response to the network access authentication request, performs an authentication operation based on the first-type authentication information. When the second-type authentication information is not included in the network access authentication request, the access point device <b>20</b> transfers the network access authentication request to the authentication server device <b>30</b>. On the other hand, when the network access authentication request contains the second-type authentication information and when the authentication operation in the access point device <b>20</b> is enabled, the device authentication processing unit <b>23</b> (a second device-authentication processing unit) performs the authentication operation based on the second-type authentication information.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thus, in the communication system <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment, even during the period of time in which the communication with the authentication server device <b>30</b> is interrupted, the connectibility/non-connectibility of the device <b>10</b> with respect to the network <b>1</b> can still be determined.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">More particularly, for example, in the infrastructure services, it is desirable that the authentication information of the device <b>10</b> is managed in an integrated manner in a cloud (in the first embodiment, the authentication server device <b>30</b>). In a system having such a configuration, when the device <b>10</b> is connected to the local network (in the first embodiment, the network <b>1</b>), the authentication operation is performed between the device <b>10</b> and the cloud, and the connectibility/non-connectibility of the device <b>10</b> with respect to the local network is determined.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Conventionally, the event of interrupted communication between the local network and the cloud due to a communication failure caused by such as disaster, results in an inability of authenticating the devices present in the local network (in the first embodiment, the devices <b>10</b>). For that reason, even if the devices in the local network are functioning normally, even the limited services cannot be provided using those devices.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the communication system <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment, while managing the authentication information of the device <b>10</b> in an integrated manner in the authentication server device <b>30</b>, the authentication operation can be performed between the device <b>10</b> and the access point device <b>20</b> without using the authentication server device <b>30</b> as needs dictate.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Given below is the explanation of a second embodiment. In the second embodiment, the identical part to the first embodiment is not explained again, and the explanation is given only about the differences with the first embodiment. In the second embodiment, the explanation is given for a case in which the device <b>10</b> receives, from the authentication server device <b>30</b>, a token indicating the permission for connection to the network <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the second embodiment, when the authentication of the device <b>10</b> is successful and the connection to the network <b>1</b> by the device <b>10</b> is permitted, then the authentication server device <b>30</b> issues a token instead of issuing a temporary key. The token either can be sent only to the device <b>10</b> or can be sent to the device <b>10</b> and the access point device <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the token, the fact that the device <b>10</b> is permitted to be connected to the network <b>1</b> is written along with the valid period for the connection; and a private-key-based signature of the authentication server device <b>30</b> is added. During the period of time in which the device <b>10</b> is holding a valid token, the token can be used when network access authentication with respect to the network <b>1</b> needs to be performed.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For example, regardless of whether or not the device <b>10</b> is holding a token, the access point device <b>20</b> can ensure that the authentication operation is always performed between the device <b>10</b> and the authentication server device <b>30</b>. Furthermore, token-based authentication of the device <b>10</b> can be performed only when unable to communicate between the access point device <b>20</b> and the authentication server device <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Moreover, for example, when not connectible to the network <b>2</b> due to the influence by such as a communication failure; even though the validity of the token expires, as long as token-utilizing authentication is successful within the valid period of the token, connection to the network <b>1</b> by the device <b>10</b> is permissible. In the case of performing such control, the memory unit <b>33</b> of the authentication server device <b>30</b> can retain records of the facts about the token-based authentication and the authentication result.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Modification Example of First and Second Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the first and second embodiments described above, a temporary key or a token (the second-type authentication information) can be generated by the device authentication processing unit <b>23</b> of the access point device <b>20</b>. That is, when the authentication operation based on the first-type authentication information performed by the authentication server device <b>30</b> is successful, the device authentication processing unit <b>23</b> can generate the second-type authentication information and send the second-type authentication information to the device <b>10</b>. In that case, for example, during the connection operation performed by the device <b>10</b> with respect to the network <b>1</b>, the temporary key or the token is provided to the device <b>10</b> from the access point device <b>20</b>.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Given below is the explanation of a third embodiment.

In the third embodiment, the explanation is given for an example in which an application server that performs application processing is connected to the network <b>2</b>. Herein, the application processing can be arbitrary. For example, the application processing includes analysis or processing of the application data obtained by the device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">When connectible to the application server, the second communication unit <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the access point device <b>20</b> sends the application data, which is received from the device <b>10</b> via the network <b>1</b>, to the application server via the network <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">When not connectible to the application server via the network <b>2</b>, then the application processing unit <b>25</b> enables the processing of the application data. On the other hand, when connectible to the application server via the network <b>2</b>, then the application processing unit <b>25</b> disables the processing of the application data.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, due to the influence by such as a communication failure, when the access point device <b>20</b> is not connectible to the network <b>2</b> or to an application server connected to the network <b>2</b>; then, instead of the application server processing the application data, the application processing unit <b>25</b> of the access point device <b>20</b> processes the application data received from the device <b>10</b> for which the authentication operation based on the second-type authentication information is successful. Then, the processed application data is stored in the memory unit <b>24</b> of the access point device <b>20</b>. Then, for example, in response to a request from another device connected to the network <b>1</b>, the processed application data that is stored in the memory unit <b>24</b> is provided to the other device.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Moreover, for example, by the restoration of communication from such as a communication failure, when the connection to the network <b>2</b> or to an application server connected to the network <b>2</b> is recovered, the application processing unit <b>25</b> sends the application data, which is processed during the interrupted period and which is stored in the memory unit <b>24</b>, to the application server via the network <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Lastly, the explanation is given about an exemplary hardware configuration of the device <b>10</b>, the access point device <b>20</b>, and the authentication server device <b>30</b> according to the first to third embodiments.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Exemplary Hardware Configuration</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary hardware configuration of the main parts of the device <b>10</b>, the access point device <b>20</b>, and the authentication server device <b>30</b> according to the first to third embodiments.
