While these operations may deplete the battery, the battery may be recharged and subsequently used to operate the components of the electric vehicle. Battery temperature may influence battery recharging. As one example, an elevated battery temperature may allow the battery to be recharged more quickly as compared with a lower battery temperature. Electric vehicles may include systems to modify battery temperature for recharging. Conventional systems may modify battery temperature based on a fixed time interval, e.g., twenty minutes before arrival, and/or other interval. There is a constant need for systems and techniques to improve electric vehicle charging and battery preconditioning.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Examples of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for controlling battery preconditioning in an electric vehicle based on a route or course of travel for the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one example, a method of preconditioning a battery of a vehicle is disclosed. The method includes determining a baseline preconditioning start time relative to an estimated time of arrival at a charging station. The method further includes analyzing a route of the vehicle to the charging station to determine a route characteristic. The method further includes modifying the baseline preconditioning start time based on the route characteristic to determine a route-based preconditioning start time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another example, the route characteristic may include one or more projected conditions of the route that, when present, modify a current temperature of the battery. The one or more projected conditions may include a route elevation, a change in the route elevation, a route speed, and/or a route acceleration profile, among other conditions. In some cases, the one or more projected conditions may define a collection of primary factors that, when present, modify the current temperature of the battery. Analyzing the route may thus further include determining a value for one or more primary factors of the collection of primary factors by analyzing a secondary factor that, when present, modifies the value of the one or of the primary factors. The secondary factors may include a user speed preference, a traffic condition metric, a traffic light metric, and/or a vehicle weight, among other possible factors.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example, analyzing the route may further include determining route segments, serially arranged along the route, between a present vehicle location and the charging station. In turn, analyzing the route may further include determining a route characteristic for each route segment. In some cases, the route characteristic for each route segment may correspond to a projected temperature change of the battery along the respective route segment. The method may further include projecting a route-based battery temperature of the battery along the route by calculating a change from a current battery temperature for each route segment based on the respective route characteristic.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example, determining the route-based preconditioning start time may include comparing the projected route-based battery temperature to a target preconditioning battery temperature. Determining the route-based preconditioning start time may further include determining a route time in which the projected route-based battery temperature has a value within a threshold range of the target preconditioning battery temperature. Determining the route-based preconditioning start time may further include selecting the route time as the route-based preconditioning start time.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some cases, determining the route-based preconditioning start time further includes determining a route time along the route in which the projected route-based battery temperature has a value in which initiating a preconditioning operation for the battery at the route time is configured to reduce a preconditioning intensity relative to a baseline preconditioning intensity associated with baseline preconditioning time. In other cases, determining the route-based preconditioning start time further includes determining a route time along the route in which the projected route-based battery temperature has a value in which initiating a preconditioning operation for the battery at the route time is configured to increase a preconditioning intensity relative to a baseline preconditioning intensity associated with baseline preconditioning time, such as may be the case where a baseline preconditioning intensity is a more moderate or low value. As described herein, the preconditioning intensity may be defined as a rate of preconditioning. While many metrics are contemplated herein, the rate of change of the battery temperature, the power draw associated with an electric-based heating/cooling system, an amount of heat supplied to or removed from the battery per unit of time, and so on may be used.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example, a method of developing a preconditioning plan is disclosed. The method includes determine a preconditioning start time according to any of the techniques disclosed herein. The method may further include generating a recommendation or guideline for preconditioning intensity of the vehicle during the anticipated preconditioning period. The preconditioning intensity may be calculated according to any of methods described herein. In some cases, the preconditioning intensity may be around a constant 40% intensity (which might equate to 1 degree Fahrenheit per minute) throughout the preconditioning period. This may be considered a baseline preconditioning intensity in some scenarios. In other cases, it may be advantageous to vary the preconditioning based on, as one example, the various route-based factors described herein. As one non-limiting example, using the systems and techniques described herein, during the preconditioning period, the vehicle battery may precondition at 50% intensity during a first portion of the preconditioning time period, then at 100% intensity during another portion of the preconditioning period, e.g., such as in a neighborhood area until the vehicle reaches the charger. As such, the method may further include updating the preconditioning plan periodically based on the real time battery temp and the predicted battery temp, among other factors, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another example, a method of preconditioning a battery of an electric vehicle is disclosed. The method includes projecting a battery temperature of the battery along a route of the vehicle between a present vehicle location and a charging station by modeling a relationship between the battery temperature and a characteristic of the route. The method further includes analyzing the projected battery temperature to determine a route-based preconditioning start time. The method further includes modifying the battery temperature to reach a target preconditioning battery temperature at the route-based preconditioning start time.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another example, modeling the relationship between the battery temperature and a characteristic of the route comprises estimating a temperature impact from one or more projected conditions of the route that, when present, modify a current temperature of the battery. Projecting the battery temperature may further include extrapolating a route-based battery temperature along the entire route from a current temperature of the battery based on the estimated temperature impact.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another example, the method may further include analyzing the route and determining a plurality of route segments between the present vehicle location and the charging station. Additionally, projecting the battery temperature may further include determining a temperature impact for segments of the plurality of segments. Projecting the battery temperature may further include modeling the relationship between the battery temperature and the temperature impact for the segments of the plurality of segments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another example, projecting the battery temperature may further include projecting a route-based battery temperature of the battery along the route by calculating a change from the current battery temperature for the route segments based on the determined temperature impact. Additionally, analyzing the projected battery temperature may further include comparing the projected route-based battery temperature to the target preconditioning battery temperature. Analyzing the projected battery temperature may further include determining a route time in which the projected route-based battery temperature has a value within a threshold range of the target preconditioning battery temperature. Further, analyzing the projected battery temperature may further include selecting the route time as the route-based preconditioning start time.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another example, modifying the battery temperature may include increasing or decreasing the battery temperature toward the target preconditioning battery temperature. The method may further include modifying a preconditioning intensity associated with the increasing or decreasing of the battery temperature based on a comparison between a current temperature of the battery and an estimated time of arrival to charging station. Further, modifying the preconditioning intensity may be based on one or more route-based conditions or factors, as described herein. As a non-limiting illustration, modifying preconditioning may include the operation of lowering or pausing preconditioning based on a characteristic of the route, such as lowering or pausing precondition intensity while accelerating onto the highway, which may help enhance efficiency of the system. In some cases, the method may further include minimizing the preconditioning intensity by determining the route-modified preconditioning start time as a time in which the current battery temperature is closest to the target preconditioning temperature.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another example, a vehicle is disclosed. The vehicle includes an electric motor. The vehicle further includes a battery electrically connected to the electric motor. The vehicle further includes a sensor configured to detect a battery temperature of the battery. The vehicle further includes a temperature control unit configured to alter the battery temperature. The vehicle further includes a non-transitory computer-readable media encoded with instructions which, when executed by one or more processing elements of the vehicle, cause the vehicle to analyze a route of the vehicle between a present vehicle location and a charging station to determine a route characteristic. In some cases, analyzing the route may include analyzing and/or procuring pre-stored information (e.g., topographical maps based on location, roadway layouts, and so on), as well as on-demand (e.g., Internet-available or streamable) information (e.g., real-time weather updates, traffic, and so on). The instructions further cause the vehicle to modify a baseline preconditioning start time based on the route characteristic to determine a route-based preconditioning start time.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another example, the instructions may further cause the vehicle to project a route-based battery temperature of the battery along the route of the vehicle by modeling a relationship between the battery temperature and the route characteristic. The instructions may further cause the vehicle to determine the route-based preconditioning start time by: (i) analyzing the projected route-based battery temperature along the entire route, and (ii) selecting a route time in which the projected route-based battery temperature has a value within a threshold range of a target preconditioning battery temperature. In some cases, the instructions further cause the vehicle to, using the sensor, detect the battery temperature along the route, and compare the battery temperature to projected route-based battery temperature.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another example, the instructions may further cause the vehicle to selectively update the route-based preconditioning start time by reassessing whether the value of the projected route-based battery temperature as the selected route time remains within the threshold range of the target preconditioning battery temperature.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition to the exemplary aspects and embodiments described above, further aspects and embodiments will become apparent by reference to the drawings and by study of the following description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The disclosure will be readily understood by the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like structural elements, and in which:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a schematic view of a system including vehicles traveling a route to a charging station;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts a sample chart representing a battery temperature of a vehicle battery of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> along the route of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a functional diagram of a vehicle including an electric motor and a battery;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a functional diagram of a route-based preconditioning system;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a block diagram of the route characteristic analysis module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a sample chart representing a battery temperature of a vehicle battery with respect to route segments of a route;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a block diagram of a route segment characteristic analysis module;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram for preconditioning a battery of a vehicle, according to implementations of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram for preconditioning a battery of a vehicle, according to implementations of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram for preconditioning a battery of a vehicle, according to implementations of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an example schematic diagram of a computer system for implementing various techniques in the examples described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The description that follows includes sample systems, methods, and apparatuses that embody various elements of the present disclosure. However, it should be understood that the described disclosure may be practiced in a variety of forms in addition to those described herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The following disclosure relates generally to systems and techniques for modifying the temperature of a battery in an electric vehicle. The battery may require recharging after a period of use in an electric vehicle, such as use of the battery to operate vehicle components including the electric motor. Battery temperature may influence recharging characteristics. For example, the recharging speed, recharging efficiency, and/or total accepted charge may be based, in part, on battery temperature upon arrival of the electric vehicle at a destination charging station and/or other system that is configured to recharge the battery.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the present disclosure, modifying the temperature of a battery of an electric vehicle in preparation of battery recharging is referred to as &#x201c;preconditioning.&#x201d; The battery temperature may be modified or preconditioned in order to cause the battery to exhibit or otherwise move toward a target preconditioning battery temperature. The target preconditioning battery temperature may be a predetermined temperature of the battery at which the battery exhibits (or is immediately capable of exhibiting) desired recharging performance, such as exhibiting a desired recharging speed and/or efficiency. However, preconditioning the battery toward the target preconditioning battery temperature may expend vehicle resources (e.g., operating a heater) and may occur over an extended period of time. Thus, preconditioning at a fixed interval (e.g., fixed time or distance) from a charging station (or precondition at a charging station itself) may produce suboptimal outcomes, including prolonged delays. Particularly where the electric vehicle is part of a fleet of coordinated or co-owned/co-operated electrical vehicles, such delays may multiply and cause substantial vehicle downtime that hinders the efficiency of the fleet.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The systems and techniques of the present disclosure may mitigate such hindrances, in part, by allowing for battery preconditioning based on the present, substantially real-time conditions of the battery and vehicle. Broadly, the present disclosure may allow for battery preconditioning based on a route or path or course of travel of the associated vehicle to a destination charging station. The route of the vehicle may include a variety of characteristics, as described herein, that may generally increase or decrease the battery temperature. The anticipated and/or actual increases and decreases in battery temperature influenced by the route may thus be analyzed in order predict battery temperature. Predicted battery temperature and associated time to a given charging station may be compared to a target preconditioning battery temperature in order to determine a preconditioning start time. Thus, rather than a fixed or standardized interval at which to initiate preconditioning, the disclosed systems and techniques may initiate preconditioning in a manner configured to minimize energy consumption, reduce vehicle downtime, and a variety of other considerations, based on the particular conditions of the route.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one example, a method is disclosed including analyzing a route of the vehicle to the charging station in order to determine a route characteristic. The route characteristic may include one or more projected conditions of the route that, when present, modify a current temperature of the battery. Sample conditions include, without limitation, a route elevation, a change in route elevation, a number of stops along the route, a route speed limit, an expected route velocity, a route speed, a route acceleration profile, similar conditions, and combinations thereof. Such conditions may define a collection of primary factors. Example methods may include further analyzing the route in order to determine a value for the one or more of the collection of primary factors by analyzing a secondary factor that, when present, influences or modifies the value of one or more primary factors. Sample secondary factors include, without limitation, a user speed preference, a traffic condition metric, a traffic light metric, and/or a vehicle weight metric, similar factors, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Example methods may further include modifying a baseline preconditioning start time based on the determined route characteristics in order to further determine a route-based preconditioning start time. The route-based preconditioning start time may be a time along the vehicle route at which the preconditioning performance of the battery is optimized or otherwise improved from a fixed standard interval preconditioning time. As one example, a vehicle may have or operate to determine a baseline preconditioning start time, which may be representative of a fixed time or fixed distance to a destination charging station. The route-based preconditioning start time may be a time at which preconditioning the battery may result in more efficient preconditioning (e.g., lower preconditioning intensity and/or thermal energy transfer/expenditure for preconditioning), faster preconditioning, and/or less downtime at a destination charging station, among other factors.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one example, the route-based preconditioning start time may be determined, in part, by analyzing the temperature impact of the route characteristic. For example, each of a collection of primary factors of the route characteristic, and corresponding secondary factors, may influence the temperature of the battery. The factors may be scored and weighted as appropriate. As an illustration, a first primary factor may be determined to contribute to an increase the battery temperature by 4 degrees over the route (e.g., an increase in elevation along the route), while a second primary factor may be determined to contribute to a decrease the battery temperature by 1 degree (e.g., lighter than usual anticipated traffic conditions along the route), resulting in a net expected battery temperature increase of 3 degrees due to these route conditions. The value of the temperature change may depend on the specific characteristics of the route, such as the magnitude of primary factors, as described herein. The route characteristic may in turn be associated with a temperature impact or projected battery change for the route based on the cumulative and combinative influence of the temperature impact of these and other factors.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this regard, the route-based preconditioning start time may be determined, in part, by projecting or predicting a route-based battery temperature along the route using the projected battery temperature change. The route-based battery temperature may be compared to the target preconditioning battery in order to determine the preconditioning start time based on a variety of parameters. As one example, the preconditioning start time may be a time at which the projected route-based battery temperature has a value within a threshold range of the target preconditioning battery temperature. The threshold range may indicate, for example, that the battery temperature is closer in value to the target preconditioning battery temperature than the battery will be later along the route, thus indicating that initiating preconditioning at such time may more efficient and/or less time consuming. In other cases, other parameters may be used to determine the preconditioning start time, including parameters related to preconditioning intensity, anticipated terrain, wait time or queue at the destination charging station, and/or other conditions or parameters.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one example, the temperature impact for the various primary and secondary factors described herein may be determined for one or more of all of a plurality of segments of a route. For example, a route may include a plurality of route segments, serially arranged along the route, between a present location of the vehicle and the charging station. A temperature impact for each segment may be determined by analyzing the impact of the primary and secondary factors for each segment. This segment-driven analysis may increase precision of the temperature impact on the battery, for example, such as where the route includes diverse conditions, including traffic congestion, steep grades, variable weather, and so on, which may be more or less controlling of the temperature impact for a given segment of the route.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described herein, a non-transitory computer-readable media may be encoded with instructions which, when executed by one or more processing elements, cause the vehicle or remote system to perform one or more or all of the techniques described herein. In one example, a vehicle is disclosed including processing elements to execute a route-based preconditioning system. The route-based preconditioning system may operate at least partially within the vehicle to analyze the conditions of the route of the vehicle to a charging station and determine a route-based preconditioning start time. In some cases, the route-based preconditioning system may operate at least partially remote from the vehicle, such as where the preconditioning of the vehicle is controlled or influenced by a third party, including an operator of the charging station at the destination, a fleet manager, a preconditioning management service operator, and so on. In each scenario, the vehicle disclosed herein may further include a sensor to detect a current battery temperature and a temperature control unit configured to alter the temperature of the battery at the route-based preconditioning start time.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, which assist in illustrating various features of the present disclosure.

Consequently, variations and modifications commensurate with the following teachings, and skill and knowledge of the relevant art, are within the scope of the present inventive aspects.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a schematic view of a system <b>100</b> including a vehicle <b>120</b> traveling a route r to a charging station <b>116</b>. The vehicle <b>120</b> may be an electric vehicle having a battery <b>124</b>, as described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The vehicle <b>120</b> may be configured to perform any of the preconditioning techniques described herein using an onboard computing device and/or with a controller in electronic communication with a remote server (i.e., a server or other computing device remotely connected to the vehicle for exchanging data and other signals). In that regard, the vehicle <b>120</b> may be configured to analyze characteristics of the route r and determine a route-based preconditioning start time based on one or more characteristics of the route that may influence a temperature of the battery <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For purposes of illustration, the vehicle <b>120</b> is shown in the system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> includes various elements, conditions, scenarios, and so on which the vehicle <b>120</b> may encounter while en route to the destination charging station <b>116</b>. For example, the system <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> as including a roadway network <b>102</b>. The roadway network <b>102</b> may include a first road <b>104</b><i>a </i>and second road <b>104</b><i>b. </i>The vehicle <b>120</b> may generally travel to the destination charging station <b>116</b> via the first road <b>104</b><i>a </i>of the roadway network <b>102</b>, as indicated by the route r (shown in broken line). The vehicle <b>120</b>, in cooperation with an onboard and/or remote computing device, may determine the route r to the destination charging station <b>116</b>. For example, a navigation system or other positioning device including, without limitation, digitized maps, a global positioning system (i.e., GPS), Wi-Fi circuitry, cellular communication circuitry, another wired or wireless connection to the Internet or to a network of route calculation or fleet management devices, or the like, may be used to define the first road <b>104</b><i>a </i>as an appropriate road or route of the roadway network <b>102</b> for the vehicle <b>120</b> to follow in order to reach the destination charging station <b>116</b>. Additionally or alternatively, components of the vehicle <b>120</b> may receive manual input that causes the vehicle <b>120</b> to define or confirm the first road <b>104</b><i>a </i>as the route r to the destination charging station <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the first road <b>104</b><i>a </i>can include multiple roads, multiple segments of interconnected roads, &#x201c;off-road&#x201d; trails (e.g., unpaved paths), passages across waterways via bridges, ferries, or other conveyances, or other related roadways and highways. For convenience, the &#x201c;first road&#x201d; as used herein refers to any number of these roads, paths, and conveyances that the vehicle <b>120</b> expects to use while traveling from an initial point to a final point (i.e., the location of the charging station <b>116</b>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The vehicle <b>120</b> may experience a variety of conditions or circumstances along the route r to the destination charging station <b>116</b> that may influence the temperature of the battery <b>124</b>. The example system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts example conditions and circumstances including a speed limit <b>105</b> (symbolized by a speed limit sign next to the first road <b>104</b><i>a</i>), a terrain <b>106</b> (e.g., mountains or other sources of elevation changes), a curved route portion <b>107</b>, traffic congestion <b>108</b> (symbolized by vehicles that are velocity-limited by the velocity, status, and course of a lead vehicle or road obstacle), an intersection <b>109</b>, and a traffic signal <b>110</b>. The speed limit <b>105</b> may correspond to a maximum allowable speed of the vehicle <b>120</b> along the route r. The terrain <b>106</b> may correspond to an elevation of the route r and/or a change in elevation of the route r. The traffic congestion <b>108</b> may correspond to a buildup of slow-moving vehicles along the route r. The intersection <b>109</b> may correspond to a crossing of the first and second roads <b>104</b><i>a, </i><b>104</b><i>b </i>in the roadway network <b>102</b>. The traffic signal <b>110</b> may correspond to a traffic light of the intersection and/or other traffic control device. It will be appreciated that the system <b>100</b> and roadway network <b>102</b> may include more or fewer conditions or circumstances and that the particular conditions or circumstances may depend, in part, on the determined route of the roadway network <b>102</b> to the destination charging station <b>116</b>, the time of day/month/year, population demographics, and other conditions.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each of the conditions or circumstances may influence a temperature of the battery. For example and with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the terrain <b>106</b> may cause an increase or decrease in elevation of the vehicle <b>124</b> between a first route position r<sub>a </sub>and a second route position r<sub>b</sub>. In one example, the vehicle <b>124</b> may use additional power during the elevation increase from r<sub>a </sub>to r<sub>b</sub>, which, in turn, may cause an increase in the temperature of the battery <b>124</b>. The ambient temperature may also be different at the first route position r<sub>a </sub>(e.g., a lower elevation) as compared with the second route position r<sub>b </sub>(e.g., a higher elevation), which may also influence the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> due to heat exchange between the vehicle and the environment, due to passenger usage of HVAC which draws additional power from the battery, etc. As another example, the speed limit <b>105</b> may cause the vehicle <b>124</b> to traverse the route r at a particular speed, or within a range of speeds thereof based on user driving preferences. As the vehicle <b>124</b> continues along the route r between the second route position r<sub>b </sub>and a third route position r<sub>c</sub>, the vehicle <b>124</b> may attempt to maintain or reach the speed of the speed limit <b>105</b>. This activity may be associated with a temperature increase or decrease on the battery <b>124</b>. The vehicle <b>124</b> may also encounter a curved route portion <b>107</b> between the second route position r<sub>b </sub>and the third route position r<sub>c</sub>. Performance of the vehicle <b>124</b> in handling the curved route portion may be associated with generation of thermal energy at the battery <b>124</b> (e.g., charging the battery due to braking regeneration).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the system <b>100</b> shows the traffic congestion <b>108</b> along the route r between the third route position r<sub>c </sub>and a fourth route position r<sub>d</sub>. The vehicle <b>120</b> may be caused to slow during the traversal of the route between the third route position r<sub>c </sub>and the fourth route position r<sub>d</sub>. In some cases, this can cause the battery to cool, such as where the vehicles <b>124</b> idles in traffic for a period of time. In some embodiments, this can cause the vehicle cabin temperature to raise, leading to greater usage of vehicle HVAC systems and a related increase in battery temperature due to that battery usage. Further, and potentially related to the traffic congestion <b>108</b>, the vehicle <b>120</b> may encounter the intersection <b>109</b> along the route r between the fourth route position r<sub>d </sub>and a fifth route position r<sub>e</sub>. The intersection <b>109</b> may further cause a temperature impact to the battery <b>124</b>, for example, as the vehicle <b>120</b> stops (on red) and accelerates at green or on a fading yellow light.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In view of the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> may vary along the route r. In some cases, the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> varies substantially, increasing and decreasing, based on the conditions of the route, such as those shown in the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The temperature of the battery <b>124</b> (and temperature history of the battery) upon arrival of the vehicle <b>120</b> to the charging station <b>116</b> may thus be based on the route r. The systems and techniques of the present disclosure thus operate to determine a preconditioning start time that is configured to account for the conditions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and any other conditions, such that preconditioning may commence along the route at a point in which the route-based (and route-predicted) battery temperature is within a target range for preconditioning so that the battery temperature is in an optimal temperature range when charging is expected to begin and so that a minimal amount of battery energy is used for preparing the battery for the charging event.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a chart <b>180</b> is depicted that represents, generally, a temperature of the battery <b>124</b> along the route r as a function of time. For example, the chart <b>180</b> includes a time axis <b>182</b> and a temperature axis <b>184</b> that generally defines an x-y coordinate system. A curve <b>186</b> is depicted that shows the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> plotted on the temperature axis <b>184</b> as a function of time of the time axis <b>182</b>. As is conceptually shown in the chart <b>180</b>, the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> may increase and decrease as the vehicle <b>120</b> traverses the route r. As one example, the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> may initially increase as the vehicle <b>120</b> gains elevation along the terrain <b>106</b> and then may decrease as the vehicle <b>120</b> descends in elevation, encounters slow traffic, and so on, as depicted by the curve <b>186</b>. It will be appreciated that the curve <b>186</b> is depicted for purposes of example, and that the actual temperature of the battery <b>124</b> may vary more or less, or in a different manner, than the curve <b>186</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the curve <b>186</b> is shown extending along the time axis <b>182</b> and ending generally at t<sub>n </sub>along the time axis <b>182</b>. The time axis value of t<sub>n </sub>may correspond to a time at which the vehicle <b>120</b> has reached the destination charging station <b>116</b>. The battery <b>124</b> may have a final temperature of <b>189</b> at t<sub>n</sub>, which may correspond to a predicted or actual temperature of the battery <b>124</b> at the end of traversing the route r in the case of no preconditioning action taking place along the route r. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a preconditioning temperature <b>188</b> may be higher that the final temperature <b>189</b>. In order to optimally recharge, the vehicle <b>120</b> may therefore be configured to increase the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> to reach the preconditioning temperature <b>188</b> before reaching the charging station <b>116</b>. Otherwise, the vehicle <b>120</b> would need to precondition starting at t<sub>n</sub>, thereby increasing downtime for the vehicle <b>120</b> as the vehicle <b>120</b> modifies the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> prior to recharging. The difference between the final temperature <b>189</b> and the preconditioning temperature <b>188</b> may also require system resources (e.g., usage of a battery heater/cooler system) that could otherwise be conserved using the systems and techniques described herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> and various examples described herein show the preconditioning temperature as being higher than the final temperature of the battery, this is for purposes of non-limiting illustration. More generally, the preconditioning temperature may be higher or lower than a final temperature of the battery. The systems and techniques described herein may be used to analyze the route and determine a time at which to modify the battery temperature to reach the target preconditioning temperature. In this regard, where the target preconditioning temperature is higher than an anticipated final temperature of the battery, the systems and techniques may operate to determine a time at which to initiating a cooling operation of the battery. For example, a particularly hot day may be anticipated to increase a temperature of the battery beyond or above the target preconditioning temperature <b>188</b>. The systems and techniques described herein may analyze the route-based factors to determine a start time at which the vehicle may begin cooling the battery to reach the lower target preconditioning temperature. In this regard, it will be appreciated that the examples described herein of increasing battery temperature are illustrations of modifying the battery temperature, and that modification of the battery temperature may include cooling the battery temperature, as contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, and as described herein, the route r may be analyzed to determine a route-based preconditioning start time t<sub>r</sub>. The vehicle <b>120</b> may therefore precondition the battery along the route r before reaching the destination charging station <b>116</b> and based on the present/real-time (or substantially real-time) conditions of the battery <b>124</b>. Preconditioning at the route-based preconditioning start time t<sub>r </sub>may allow for preconditioning the battery <b>124</b> when the battery <b>124</b> has a battery temperature that is closer in value to the preconditioning temperature <b>188</b>. This may also allow for preconditioning of the battery with a lesser intensity, e.g., consuming fewer system resources over time to change the battery temperature. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a route-based preconditioning time t<sub>r </sub>may be determined, according to any of the methods described herein. At the route-based preconditioning time t<sub>r</sub>, the vehicle <b>120</b> may begin to modify the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> to approach the preconditioning temperature <b>188</b>, which may be illustrated by route-based preconditioning temperature curve <b>187</b><i>a. </i>The temperature of the battery <b>124</b> at the route-based preconditioning start time t<sub>r </sub>is closer in value to the preconditioning temperature <b>188</b> than the temperature of the battery at t<sub>n</sub>. As such, as illustrated by the curve <b>187</b><i>a, </i>the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> may change by a lesser amount than the battery <b>124</b> would if preconditioning where to begin at t<sub>n</sub>. In other words, the battery temperature is kept more steady from time t<sub>r </sub>to time t<sub>n</sub>, so preconditioning is less resource-intensive than if preconditioning began at time t<sub>n </sub>or at a baseline preconditioning time t<sub>b</sub>, as explained in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, and as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> may change by a lesser amount than the battery would change if preconditioned from a fixed time interval from the destination charging station <b>116</b>. In this regard, the chart <b>180</b> shows a baseline preconditioning time t<sub>b</sub>, which indicates a fixed time interval from the destination charging station <b>116</b>. In other words, the vehicle <b>120</b> can have a default behavior of starting preconditioning at a fixed time interval before reaching a charging station <b>116</b>, such as the interval between time t<sub>b </sub>and time t<sub>n</sub>, irrespective of the battery temperature or how much energy is needed to raise the temperature from the temperature at time t<sub>b </sub>to the preconditioning temperature <b>188</b>. If the vehicle <b>120</b> initiates preconditioning at the baseline preconditioning time t<sub>b</sub>, the battery temperature may follow a baseline preconditioning temperature curve <b>187</b><i>b </i>in order to reach the preconditioning temperature <b>188</b>. In part because the temperature of the battery is lower at time t<sub>b </sub>as compared to time t<sub>r</sub>, the curve <b>187</b><i>b </i>is both steeper and taller than the curve <b>187</b><i>a, </i>which indicates that preconditioning starting at time t<sub>b </sub>(and at its associated temperature) requires both a greater temperature change and a higher preconditioning intensity (i.e., higher power/energy expenditure) as compared to preconditioning starting at time t<sub>r</sub>. Time t<sub>r</sub>, which is determined based on the characteristics of the route, may therefore conserve system resource by preconditioning the leveraging the temperature of the battery induced by the specific features of the route r. In an example embodiment, preconditioning starting at time t<sub>b </sub>can require the vehicle <b>120</b> to artificially generate heat in the battery that raises the temperature in a manner following curve <b>187</b><i>b. </i>By comparison, preconditioning starting at time t<sub>r </sub>can require the vehicle <b>120</b> to avoid generating that heat and to instead predictively use waste heat while traveling to cause the battery temperature to follow curve <b>187</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the vehicle <b>120</b> is shown schematically. The vehicle <b>120</b> includes the battery <b>124</b>, described above, which may be electrically connected to an electric motor <b>122</b>. The electric motor <b>122</b> and the battery <b>124</b> may operate, among other functions, to provide propulsion to the vehicle <b>120</b> such that the vehicle <b>120</b> is capable of traversing the route r.

In some embodiments, the heating module <b>130</b> can include a charging controller for the battery <b>124</b> configured to charge the battery (thereby increasing its temperature) using a regenerative braking system of the vehicle <b>120</b>. The heating module <b>130</b> can thereby control the provision of heat to the battery <b>124</b> (e.g., increasing heat provided while preconditioning) by providing more charge to the battery using the regenerative braking system than would normally be provided if the battery <b>124</b> was not being preconditioned.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The cooling module <b>132</b> may include various components configured to decrease a temperature of the battery <b>124</b>, including but not limited to certain fans, chillers, heat sinks, diffusers, heat exchangers, vents, heat pumps, radiators, coolant pumps and associated routing channels, and so on. The cooling module <b>132</b> components can be operated to lower the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> or to limit the rate at which the battery temperature rises in anticipation of keeping the battery temperature at the preconditioning temperature <b>188</b> upon arrival at the charging station <b>116</b> or at the time charging is expected to start.

Primary and secondary factors may be analyzed in order to determine an anticipated change in the temperature of the battery <b>124</b> over the course of the route r. Using the anticipated change in temperature of the battery <b>124</b> over the course of the route r, a battery temperature projection module <b>144</b> may operate to project a temperature of the battery <b>124</b> along the route r. In some cases, the route characteristic analysis module <b>143</b> and the battery temperature projection module <b>144</b> may cooperate to define an iterative process in which the anticipated change in temperature of the battery <b>124</b> is continually updated based on new information and insights pertaining to the route (e.g., a new development in traffic patterns, weather, vehicle resource usage, driving patterns, and so on).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> further shows the system <b>140</b> including a route-based preconditioning time determination module <b>145</b>. The route-based preconditioning time determination module <b>145</b> may operate to compare the projected battery temperature of a target preconditioning battery in order to determine the preconditioning start time based on a variety of parameters. As one example, the preconditioning start time may be a time at which the projected route-based battery temperature has a value within a threshold range of the target preconditioning battery temperature. The threshold range may indicate, for example, that the battery temperature is closer in value to the target preconditioning battery temperature than the battery will be later along the route, thus indicating that initiating preconditioning at such time may be more efficient and/or less time consuming. In other cases, other parameters may be used to determine the preconditioning start time, including parameters related to preconditioning intensity, anticipated terrain, wait time or queue at the destination charging station, and/or other conditions or parameters.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The system <b>140</b> may in turn monitor a current temperature of the battery <b>124</b>, for example, using a current battery temperature assessment module <b>146</b> as well as a time and place of the vehicle <b>120</b> along the route r. The current battery temperature assessment module <b>146</b> may provide information indicative of the state of the battery, including current temperature of one or more battery modules or cells of the battery. This may allow the predicted conditions of the battery to be updated periodically with actual battery performance data. In this regard, the route-based preconditioning time determination module <b>145</b> may update the determined route-based preconditioning time to reflect present conditions. At the appropriate battery temperature and/or time, a preconditioning initiation module <b>147</b> of the system <b>140</b> may initiate a process of changing a temperature of the battery <b>124</b> to reach the preconditioning temperature <b>188</b>. For example, the preconditioning initiating module <b>147</b> may cause, in cooperation with the processing element(s) <b>134</b>, the temperature control unit <b>128</b> to heat or cool the battery <b>124</b> as needed to reach a desired temperature starting at the preconditioning time determined by module <b>145</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the route characteristic analysis module <b>143</b> is presented in greater detail. As described herein, the system <b>140</b> may be operable to analyze the route r of the vehicle <b>124</b> to the charging station <b>116</b> in order to determine a route characteristic. The route characteristic may include one or more projected conditions of the route that, when present, modify a current temperature of the battery. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows some example projected conditions, including a route acceleration profile <b>148</b><i>a, </i>a route change in elevation <b>148</b><i>b, </i>a route speed <b>148</b><i>c, </i>a route elevation <b>148</b><i>d, </i>and an &#x201c;other&#x201d; condition <b>148</b><i>e. </i>The conditions <b>148</b><i>a</i>-<b>148</b><i>e </i>may define a collection of primary factors. A value for particular factors of the collection of primary factors may depend, in part, on one or more secondary factors. For purposes of illustration, the route acceleration profile <b>148</b><i>a </i>is shown as being influenced by secondary factor <b>149</b><i>a, </i>including vehicle weight and traffic lights (e.g., a weight of the vehicle <b>120</b> and/or the presence, density, and so on of traffic lights <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), among other possible secondary factors. Further, the route's change (or changes) in elevation <b>148</b><i>b </i>is shown as being influenced by secondary factors <b>149</b><i>b, </i>such as vehicle weight, an amount of anticipated regenerative braking (e.g., along downhill routes), weather patterns and temperature patterns influenced by elevation, and so on. Further, the route speed <b>148</b><i>c </i>is shown as being influenced by secondary factors <b>149</b><i>c, </i>including vehicle weight, user speed preferences (e.g., cruise control, other automatic driving control settings, historical speed and acceleration patterns for a particular driver), vehicle or other obstacle traffic, and traffic control conditions such as traffic lights, stop signs, speed bumps, etc.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The various primary factors and influencing secondary factors are presented in further detail below. It will be appreciated that the various factors are present for purposes of illustration. In other cases, more or fewer or different combinations of factors may be present and may influence the temperature of the battery in a variety of different ways.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference to route acceleration <b>148</b><i>a, </i>energy consumption may be related to vehicle speed. A vehicle that will be accelerating onto a highway two minutes before charging, for example, may warm up its battery, and therefore may require less preconditioning thereafter (e.g., as may be the case where the target battery temperature is higher than a current temperature of the battery). Deceleration, for regenerative braking-enabled vehicles, may also warm up the battery and can therefore require less expenditure of preconditioning energy thereafter. Predicted acceleration/deceleration zones (e.g. highway on ramps, highway exits) may also be taken into account to develop an expected battery temperature at each point along the route.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">With reference to route change in elevation <b>148</b><i>b, </i>change in elevation along the route may also influence battery temperature. Consider a situation in which a vehicle is driving down a mountain and the charging facility is at the base. The vehicle <b>120</b> may naturally coast and may not necessarily use its battery as much for acceleration or maintaining its speed. As a corollary, a vehicle that drives up a mountain to the charging facility may use the battery <b>124</b> more, warming up the battery <b>124</b> and affecting preconditioning timing. In this regard, the vehicle <b>124</b> may use the future, planned route's changes in elevation as a factor for preconditioning.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">With reference to route speed <b>148</b><i>c, </i>energy consumption may be exponentially related to vehicle speed. Where the vehicle <b>120</b> is driving on a highway, for example, the vehicle <b>120</b> may be consuming exponentially more energy (and thus warm its battery at a faster rate) than when the vehicle <b>120</b> relatively slowly drives through a neighborhood. In the event the vehicle <b>120</b> requires a warmer battery, the vehicle <b>120</b> on the highway therefore could begin preconditioning at a later time, or could precondition at a lesser intensity as compared to the vehicle <b>120</b> preconditioning starting from a neighborhood drive. The different miles-per-hour (MPH)/speed zones along the planned route may therefore be taken into account when determining when and how intensely to precondition the battery.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">With reference to route elevation <b>148</b><i>d, </i>consider a situation in which the vehicle <b>120</b> can take a high elevation mountainous route or a flat, sea-level route. If the vehicle <b>124</b> decides to take the high elevation route, the ambient temperature will likely be lower than for the flat route, therefore affecting the timing of preconditioning due to the battery likely dropping in temperature more quickly than a vehicle in an area with higher ambient air temperatures. This elevation factor <b>148</b><i>d </i>is different from taking a current ambient temperature reading (e.g., using an onboard sensor) as a factor for preconditioning because the vehicle <b>124</b> can use the future, planned route's elevation over time as a predictor of future ambient temperature (and thus the route's impact on battery temperature), even when the actual temperature of the route is unknown. Thus, the ambient temperature at points along the route can be estimated at least partially based on route elevation at those points.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">With reference to &#x201c;other&#x201d; factor <b>148</b><i>e, </i>various other conditions, circumstances, and conditions may be analyzed along the route r in that may influence the precondition of the battery <b>124</b>. As one example, the other factor <b>148</b><i>e </i>may include analyzed route characteristics based on a comparison of two or more route types. For example, two or more routes may each allow the vehicle <b>124</b> to arrive at the destination charging station <b>116</b>. The analysis module <b>143</b> may be configured to determine the route characteristics for each separate route and allow for a selection of a route based on the route having more desirable preconditioning timing or preconditioning energy efficiency.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As one example, a route choice based on routing-battery temperature may be modeled using the route characteristic analysis module <b>143</b>. For example, the vehicle <b>120</b> (having a battery temperature lower than an optimal charging temperature) can have two potential routes to the destination charging station <b>116</b>. Both routes may take a roughly equivalent amount of time to reach the station <b>116</b>; one, however, features a large hill while the other is relatively flat. A conventional system may randomly choose between the routes and/or choose the flat route to reduce battery consumption. However, using techniques and methods described herein, the vehicle <b>124</b> may analyze both routes and determine that the hilly route will automatically raise battery temperature to optimal levels for preconditioning in a manner that is more battery-energy-efficient than using normal preconditioning methods, so the unintuitive hilly route can be chosen instead.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As another example, a vehicle may have around 20 minutes to the charging station, at which time the battery of the vehicle is around 20 degrees below the target preconditioning temperature it will need to have when it reaches the charging station. A conventional system may identify the foregoing pieces of information and begin preconditioning the battery without specific reference to the route (or associated route-based factors) the vehicle anticipates traveling to reach the charging station. Using the systems and techniques described herein, however, the route is analyzed in order to determine the preconditioning start time based, in part, on the predicted impact of the upcoming route on the battery temperature. For example, the systems and techniques described herein may be used to predict a large mountain right before the charging station. Traveling over the large mountain may be understood to induce an increased temperature of the battery, and thus fairly little direct preconditioning may be required to reach the target preconditioning temperature. In this regard, the systems and techniques described herein may allow the battery to reach the target preconditioning temperature without overshooting the target temperature. In contrast, the conventional systems may heat the battery while the battery also is imparted with heat from traversing the mountain. The conventional systems may therefore be less efficient, and may in fact require the battery to be cooled after the uphill climb, wasting energy.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As another example, routing-time factors may be considered, such as the traversal time associated with the route, including time from traffic, stop signs, speed zones, and so on. For example, the same hilly route&#x2014;although consuming slightly more battery (e.g., consuming 1% state of charge)&#x2014;is 2 minutes faster than the flatter route, and while charging those 2 minutes at optimal battery temperature may bring the battery levels above (e.g. +3% state of charge) those of a car that lost the 2 minutes taking the flatter route at suboptimal battery temperature. The foregoing example, for purpose of non-limiting illustration, may apply to a particularly short trip of the vehicle. For example, the trip may be short such that the heating or cooling system of the vehicle may not necessarily optimize battery temperature using the system for the flatter route.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The route-based preconditioning system <b>140</b> may be configured to analyze the characteristics of the route with respect to particular segments of the route r. For example, the route characteristic analysis module <b>143</b> may determine a temperature impact for each of the factors <b>148</b><i>a</i>-<b>148</b><i>e </i>for a given segment of the route r. The temperature impact for each segment of the route may be combined in order to determine a total predicted temperature impact from the route characteristic. This in turn may be used to project a temperature of the battery <b>124</b> along the route r. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a geographic representation <b>150</b> of the route r is shown relative to the change <b>180</b>, described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>; redundant explanation of which is omitted here for clarity. The geographic representation <b>150</b> may be divided into zones in order to define route segments, serially along the route r. The geographical representation <b>150</b> is shown as including a first geographic zone <b>152</b><i>a </i>associated with a first route segment s<sub>1</sub>, a second graphic zone <b>152</b><i>b </i>associated with a second route segment s<sub>2</sub>, a third geographic zone <b>152</b><i>c </i>associated with a third route segment s<sub>3</sub>, and fourth geographic zone <b>152</b><i>d </i>associated with a fourth route segment s<sub>n</sub>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Each of the geographic zones <b>152</b><i>a</i>-<b>152</b><i>d </i>may be associated with one or more of primary factors and secondary factors, as described herein. A factor for a given zone may produce a different temperature impact as compared with another zone. As one example, route change in elevation may produce a negligible impact on temperature in a first zone, whereas in another zone the impact is significant. By analyzing the temperature impact for each factor for each zone, a more precise projection of the battery temperature may be produced. For example, the curve <b>186</b> may be produced by analyzing the temperature impact of the factors, as appropriate, and as present, for each of the zones <b>152</b><i>a</i>-<b>15</b><i>d </i>and corresponding segments s<sub>1</sub>-s<sub>n</sub>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">To illustrate the foregoing analysis, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a block diagram <b>160</b>. The block diagram <b>600</b> shows that a route segment characteristic analysis may be performed for each segment of the route r. For example, the analysis described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be performed for one or more or all of the segments shown in geographic representation. The cumulative temperature impact may then be determined across all segments in order to produce the projected temperature curve <b>186</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>5</b></figref>. To illustrate the foregoing, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the block diagram <b>600</b> include a first route segment characteristic analysis <b>162</b>. The first route segment characteristic analysis <b>162</b> may perform the analysis described with respect to the route characteristic analysis module <b>143</b> with respect to the first route segment s<sub>1</sub>; redundant explanation of which is omitted here for clarity. The result of this analysis may be a first segment temperature impact t<sub>is1 </sub><b>164</b>, which is indicative of the temperature impact on the battery <b>124</b> based on the characteristics of the first route segment. The block diagram <b>600</b> further include a second route segment characteristic analysis <b>163</b>. The second route segment characteristic analysis <b>163</b> also may perform the analysis described with respect to the route characteristic analysis module <b>143</b> with respect to the fourth route segment s<sub>n</sub>. The result of this analysis may be another segment temperature impact t<sub>isn </sub><b>166</b>, which is indicative of the temperature impact on the battery <b>124</b> based on the characteristics of the fourth route segment.

At operation <b>704</b>, a baseline preconditioning start time is determined. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>3</b></figref>, the baseline precondition time determination module <b>142</b> may determine the baseline preconditioning start time t<sub>b</sub>. The baseline preconditioning start time t<sub>b </sub>may correspond to a fixed interval for preconditioning prior to arrival at the destination charting station <b>116</b>. At operation <b>708</b>, a route of a vehicle to a charging station is analyzed to determine a route characteristic. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the route characteristic analysis module <b>143</b> may analyze the route r to determine the temperature impact from one or more conditions along the route. For example, and as described herein, the route characteristic analysis module <b>143</b> may determine a temperature impact from one or more of the primary factors <b>148</b><i>a</i>-<b>148</b><i>e </i>along the route r. At operation <b>712</b>, the baseline preconditioning start time is modified based on the route characteristic to determine a route-based preconditioning start time. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>3</b></figref>, the route-based preconditioning time determination module <b>145</b> may determine a preconditioning start time t<sub>r </sub>based on the characteristics of the route r. For example, the route-based preconditioning start determination module <b>145</b> may determine the preconditioning start time t<sub>r </sub>at the value shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> in order to define the preconditioning curve <b>187</b><i>a </i>indicative of a lesser change in temperature (and lesser preconditioning intensity) to reach the preconditioning temperature <b>188</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a method of analyzing a route of an electric vehicle is disclosed. At operation <b>804</b>, route segments are determined serially arranged along a route between a present vehicle location and a charging station. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the route r may be analyzed to determine the first route segment s<sub>1</sub>, the second route segment s<sub>2</sub>, the third route segment s<sub>3</sub>, and the fourth route segment s<sub>n </sub>(and more, if needed). The segments can be defined based on distance along the route (e.g., equal-distance segments), divisions based on the time needed to pass through each segment (e.g., equal-time segments), a predetermined number of segments (e.g., predetermined segment quantity, which, if set low, can accelerate or simplify calculation time and energy at the cost of precision, or, if set high, can increase precision at the cost of calculation time and energy), and so on. The route segments s<sub>1</sub>-s<sub>n </sub>may be serially arranged along the route r. In some cases, the route segments may additionally or alternatively be defined based on route characteristics, e.g., roadway-type-based segments (such as a highway segment, a neighborhood segment, a mountainous segment, a coastal sea-level segment, a circuitous segment, a straight segment, etc.), traffic-based segments, elevation-based segments, similar segments, and combinations thereof. At operation <b>808</b>, a route characteristic is determined for each route segment. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, a temperature impact for each segment may be determined by analyzing the characteristics of the route, for example, such as determining the first segment temperature impact t<sub>is1 </sub><b>164</b>, and so on to determine a cumulative temperature impact for each segment along the route r.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">At operation <b>812</b>, a route-based battery temperature is projected along the route. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the curve <b>186</b> may be indicative of a projected temperature of the battery <b>124</b> along the route r. In some embodiments, a single representative battery temperature (e.g., average temperature) can be assigned to each segment. The curve <b>186</b> may be generated, in part, by plotting the temperature impact for each of the segments s<sub>1</sub>-s<sub>n </sub>as a function of time. At operation <b>816</b>, the projected route-based battery temperature is compared to a target preconditioning battery temperature. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the curve <b>186</b> may be compared to the target preconditioning temperature <b>188</b>. The comparison of operation <b>816</b> may be used to determine a difference between the battery temperature represented by the curve <b>186</b> and the target preconditioning battery temperature <b>188</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this regard, at operations <b>820</b><i>a </i>and <b>820</b><i>b, </i>route times may be selected to optimize battery preconditioning. For example, method <b>800</b> may include the operation <b>820</b> in which a route time is determined in which the projected route-based battery temperature has a value within a threshold range of the target preconditioning battery temperature. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the route-based preconditioning start time t<sub>r </sub>may be determined based on the proximity of the projected battery temperature as represented by the curve <b>186</b> to the target precondition temperature <b>188</b>. With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the route-based preconditioning temperature start time t<sub>r </sub>may be determined based on the curve <b>186</b> being within a threshold defined by an upper bound <b>191</b><i>a </i>and a lower bound <b>191</b><i>b. </i>The upper bound <b>191</b><i>a </i>and the lower bound <b>191</b><i>b </i>may be defined, in some examples, as a predetermined deviation from the target preconditioning temperature <b>188</b>, such as where the upper bound <b>191</b><i>a </i>has a value of around 10% above the target preconditioning temperature <b>188</b> and the lower bound <b>191</b><i>b </i>has a value of around 10% below the target preconditioning temperature <b>188</b>. In other cases, other ranges may be defined. Selecting the route-based preconditioning temperature start time t<sub>r </sub>at a value for the temperature curve <b>186</b> being within the threshold range may help reduce preconditioning intensity or otherwise conserve energy. To illustrate, at operation <b>820</b><i>b, </i>a route time is determined in which the projected route-based battery temperature has a value configured to reduce preconditioning intensity. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the route-based preconditioning start time t<sub>r </sub>may be determined based on an intensity of resource usage to modify the battery temperature to the target precondition battery temperature <b>188</b>. At operation <b>824</b>, the route time is selected as the preconditioning start time. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the vehicle <b>120</b> may initiate a precondition operation for the vehicle <b>120</b> using the temperature control unit <b>128</b> at the indicated time. At operation <b>828</b>, the route time is reevaluated with respect to the preconditioning start time. As one example, as the vehicle traverses the route, the vehicle may periodically again perform any of the operations of method <b>800</b> described above. In this regard, the preconditioning start time may be updated as the vehicle traverses the route to account for new conditions, e.g., traffic, a change in temperature, a change in weather, a change in roadway traveled, a change in charging station availability, and so on.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, another method of preconditioning a battery is shown. At operation <b>904</b>, a battery temperature is projected by modeling a relationship between the battery temperature and a characteristic of the route. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the curve <b>186</b> may represent a model of the projected relationship between the battery temperature and one or more characteristics of the route r. The curve <b>186</b> may reflect the temperature impact of one or more factors for each of the route segments s<sub>1</sub>-s<sub>n</sub>. At operation <b>908</b>, the projected battery temperature is analyzed to determine a route-based precondition start time. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the route-based preconditioning time determination module <b>145</b> may determine the precondition start time t<sub>r </sub>based on the analyzed characteristics of the route r and the proximity of the projected battery temperature to the target preconditioning battery temperature <b>188</b>. At operation <b>912</b>, the battery temperature is modified starting at the route-based preconditioning start time to change (i.e., increase or decrease) toward the target preconditioning battery temperature.
