UC with the highest incidence is urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC). Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is relatively rare, but generally exhibits poor prognosis.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The first symptom in UC patients is typically macroscopic or microscopic hematuria. Patients with hematuria are normally subjected to voided urine cytology, and positive patients are further subjected to cystoscopy. If no tumor was found in the bladder, the patient is suspected to have UTUC.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional test methods for UTUC, ureteral catheterization has been performed for retrograde ureteropyelography, ureteroscopy, and selective urine cytology sampling. However, ureteral catheterization is highly invasive because a catheter is inserted into a narrow space, the bladder, and sometimes induces complications including urinary tract infections and ureteral injury or transection. The selective urine cytology does not necessarily provide sufficient sensitivity and specificity because of the break and denaturation of carcinoma cells detached off. Accordingly, ureteral catheterization tends to be avoided in recent years. MRI is non-invasive, but is incapable of depicting calyces and the like in a sufficient manner because of the low resolution. CT-urography is recently recommended as a test method for UTUC. However, the CT-urography disadvantageously causes higher exposure doses than retrograde ureteropyelography, being a contraindication to contrast media allergy and renal impairment cases. Moreover, diagnostic imaging through CT-urography, MRI, or the like is incapable of detecting flat intraepithelial carcinoma without urothelial hyperplasia. It is desired to develop a diagnostic method for UTUC with low invasiveness and high reliability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, it has become clear that abnormal methylation of DNA is deeply involved in canceration, and has been attracting attention. Abnormal DNA methylation of CpG islands in some gene promoter regions is known as a characteristic epigenetic abnormality in carcinoma cells. A CpG island is a region in which a dibasic sequence of cytosine (C)-guanine (G) via a phosphodiester bond (p) frequently appears. Abnormal DNA methylation of CpG islands is involved in carcinogenesis through inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regarding urothelial carcinoma, the group of the present inventors and other groups have conducted research to report that non-cancerous urothelium exhibits a DNA methylation profile different from that of UC (Non Patent Literatures 1 to 6), and it has been suggested that the change in DNA methylation is available for diagnosis of UC (Non Patent Literature 7). Although these previous reports suggest the possibility of risk determination for UC based on abnormal DNA methylation, however, they do not suggest that it is possible to establish a diagnostic method for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma as a substitute for the conventional ureteral catheterization and CT-urography on the basis of abnormal DNA methylation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, differences in DNA methylation profiles and gene mutation between UTUC and BUC have been recently reported (Non Patent Literatures 8 and 9). At least part of the difference in DNA methylation profiles between UTUC and BUC may be due to the difference in gene mutation therebetween.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a method for analyzing methylated DNA, a method utilizing a bisulfite method has already been established and is widely used. The Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) method, Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) method, and BAC array-based methylated CpG island amplification method (BAMCA method) are often used as methylated DNA analysis methods based upon the bisulfite method. Patent Literature 1 discloses a method for detecting the risk of poor prognosis for renal cell carcinoma by detecting the methylation level of the CpG sites of a specific gene by a bead array method, mass spectrometry (MassARRAY method), pyrosequencing, methylation-sensitive high resolution melting curve analysis, quantitative PCR, direct sequencing of bisulfite-treated products, COBRA method and the like. Patent Literatures 2 and 3 disclose methods for determining the prognosis of carcinoma by detecting the methylation level of the CpG sites of a specific gene based on the difference in retention time by ion exchange chromatography.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">Patent Literature 1: WO 2013/168644</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0010">Patent Literature 2: WO 2015/129916</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0011">Patent Literature 3: WO 2017/038983</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">Non Patent Literature 1: Carcinogenesis, 2011, 32:462-9</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">Non Patent Literature 2: Cancer Sci, 2010, 101:231-40</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">Non Patent Literature 3: J Urology, 2005, 173:243-6</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0015">Non Patent Literature 4: Curr Urol Rep, 2018, 19:102</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0016">Non Patent Literature 5: Epigenomics, 2016, 8:1415-1428</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0017">Non Patent Literature 6: Nature, 2014, 507:315-22</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0018">Non Patent Literature 7: Carcinogenesis, 2019, bgz112</li>    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0019">Non Patent Literature 8: Int J Mol Sci, 2019, 20:E2657</li>    <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0020">Non Patent Literature 9: Eur Urol, 2017, 72:641-649</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0021">Diagnostic methods for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) with low invasiveness and high reliability are desired.

In the present description, &#x201c;upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC)&#x201d; refers to a carcinoma that occurs in the epithelial cells of the upper urinary tract, without including carcinomas that occur in a part of the urinary tract distal from the ureter such as urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC). &#x201c;Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma&#x201d; in the present description includes primary carcinoma and carcinoma resulting from the metastasis of primary upper urinary tract carcinoma within the upper urinary tract.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">In the present description, the &#x201c;subject&#x201d; is a human, and examples thereof include a person who needs identification of UTUC, and more specific examples thereof include a medical check examinee and a patient suspected of being affected by UTUC.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">In the present description, the &#x201c;CpG site&#x201d; means a site where cytosine (C) and guanine (G) are bonded by a phosphodiester bond (p) in DNA. A region where CpG sites appear with high frequency is called a CpG island. CpG sites contained in CpG islands often involve abnormal DNA methylation in association with carcinoma. In the present description, the &#x201c;CpG site&#x201d;, unless otherwise defined, preferably means a CpG site contained in a CpG island, and more preferably means a CpG site located in the vicinity of the gene.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">In the present description, &#x201c;DNA methylation&#x201d; means a state in which the carbon at position 5 of cytosine is methylated in DNA. Moreover, in the present description, the &#x201c;DNA methylation level&#x201d; of a CpG site means the proportion of methylated DNA at the CpG site. In the present description, a high or low DNA methylation level means that the proportion of methylated DNA is high or low, respectively.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0050">In the present description, &#x201c;at least 90% identity&#x201d; with respect to an amino acid sequence and a nucleotide sequence refers to 90% or more identity, preferably 93% or more identity, more preferably 95% or more identity, further preferably 96% or more identity, furthermore preferably 97% or more identity, furthermore preferably 98% or more identity, furthermore preferably 99% or more identity.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0051">As demonstrated later in Examples, the present inventors revealed that the DNA methylation levels of CpG sites located at specific loci on the chromosome differ between tissue without UTUC derived from a non-UTUC or UTUC patient and tissue with UTUC derived from a UTUC patient.

Examples of the urothelial cells or tissues containing the same include fresh upper urinary tract urothelial tissue collected in surgery or biopsy, frozen upper urinary tract urothelial tissue frozen after collection, upper urinary tract urothelial tissue that has been fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin after collection, and upper urinary tract urothelial cells concentrated from urine. Among these, frozen upper urinary tract urothelial tissue is preferable from the viewpoint of suppressing the degradation of genomic DNA in the tissue and more efficiently detecting the DNA methylation level. From the viewpoints of non-invasiveness and easiness in collection, DNA derived from an upper urinary tract urothelial cell contained in voided urine is preferable.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0066">The method for preparing the sample DNA from the above-mentioned upper urinary tract urothelial cell or tissue containing an upper urinary tract urothelial cell is not particularly limited, and a known method can be appropriately selected and used. Known methods for preparing DNA include the phenol-chloroform method, or a DNA extraction method using a commercially available DNA extraction kit, for example, QIAamp DNA Mini kit (manufactured by Qiagen), Clean Columns (manufactured by NexTec), AquaPure (manufactured by Bio-Rad), ZR Plant/Seed DNA Kit (manufactured by Zymo Research), prepGEM (manufactured by ZyGEM), BuccalQuick (manufactured by TrimGen), and the like.

Examples of known methods for the bisulfite treatment include methods using a commercially available kit such as an EZ DNA Methylation-Gold&#x2122; Kit (manufactured by Zymo Research), an EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (manufactured by Qiagen), MethylEasy (manufactured by Human Genetics Signatures Pty), Cells-to-CpG Bisulfite Conversion Kit (manufactured by Applied Biosystems), and CpGenome Turbo Bisulfite Modification Kit (manufactured by MERCK MILLIPORE).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0068">Furthermore, the bisulfite-treated DNA may be amplified. The method of amplification is not particularly limited, but PCR is preferably used. As for the method and conditions of amplification, known methods and conditions can be appropriately selected and used according to the sequence, length, amount, and the like of the DNA to be amplified.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0069">If the bisulfite-treated DNA is amplified by PCR or the like, it is only required that DNA containing at least one of the CpG sites shown in Table 1 is amplified. Preferable examples of the region to be amplified include one or more selected from the group consisting of DNA regions including a nucleotide sequence set forth in any of SEQ ID NOs: 31 to 40. The chain length of the PCR amplification products can be appropriately selected while considering factors such as shortening the PCR amplification time, shortening the time for detecting methylation levels, and the precision of detection of methylation levels. For example, the chain length of the PCR amplification products is preferably 500 bp or less, more preferably 300 bp or less, and further preferably 100 bp or less; on the other hand, the lower limit of the chain length of the PCR amplification products is 30 to 40 bp, which is the chain length of the PCR amplification products when using a primer of around 15mer which can avoid non-specific hybridization in PCR. Otherwise, it is preferable to design the primer to have a rich content of CpG sites shown in Table 1 in the PCR amplification products. For example, it is preferable that the cytosine of the CpG site be contained in 2% or more, more preferably 5% or more, with respect to the chain length of the PCR amplification products.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0070">In the method of the present invention, the method for detecting the DNA methylation level of a CpG site should be a method that can quantify the DNA methylation level at a given CpG site, and a known method can be appropriately selected. Examples of such known methods include the first to eighth methods shown below.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0071">The first method is a method which utilizes a single-base extension reaction using a probe constructed so as to have a base complementary to methylated cytosine or unmethylated cytosine at the 3&#x2032;-terminus, to quantify the methylation of DNA at a CpG site. For example, the first method is a method based on the following principles. First, a bisulfite treatment is performed on the genomic DNA. As a result of this bisulfite treatment, unmethylated cytosine residues are converted to uracil, but methylated cytosine residues are not converted (see Clark S J et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 1994, 22, 2990-2997). Next, the whole genome is amplified using the genomic DNA thus treated with bisulfite as a template, and enzymatic fragmentation (usually, fragmentation into about 300 to 600 bp) is performed to dissociate it into a single strand.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072">In the first method, a probe, which hybridizes to genomic DNA converted by bisulfite treatment, and in which the base at the 3&#x2032;-terminus of the probe is a base complementary to cytosine at the CpG site, is prepared. That is, when the CpG site is methylated, the base at the 3&#x2032;-terminus of the probe is guanine, meanwhile when the CpG site is not methylated, the base at the 3&#x2032;-terminus of the probe is adenine.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073">Then, these two types of probes different only in the base at the 3&#x2032;-terminus complementary to the CpG site are hybridized with the single-stranded DNA fragment, and a single-base extension reaction is performed in the presence of a fluorescently labeled base. As a result, when the CpG site of the single-stranded fragment is methylated, a fluorescently labeled base is incorporated into the probe in which the 3&#x2032;-terminal base is guanine (probe for methylation detection) by a single-base extension reaction, but no fluorescently labeled base is incorporated into the probe in which the 3&#x2032;-terminal base is adenine (probe for unmethylation detection) as no single-base extension reaction occurs due to the mismatch of the 3&#x2032;-terminal base. On the other hand, when the CpG site of the single-stranded fragment is not methylated, a fluorescently labeled base is incorporated into the probe for unmethylation detection, but no fluorescently labeled base is incorporated into the probe for methylation detection. Therefore, the DNA methylation level can be calculated from the intensity of fluorescence emitted by the probe for methylation detection and/or the probe for unmethylation detection.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0074">In addition, in this first method, as another aspect, a probe, which hybridizes to genomic DNA converted by bisulfite treatment, and in which the 3&#x2032;-terminal base of the probe is a base complementary to guanine at the CpG site, may be used instead of the probe for methylation detection and the probe for unmethylation detection. Then, this probe is hybridized to the single-stranded DNA fragment, and a single-base extension reaction is performed in the presence of guanine labeled with a fluorescent substance and/or adenine labeled with a fluorescent dye different from the fluorescent substance. As a result, when the CpG site is methylated, fluorescently labeled guanine is incorporated into the probe, whereas when the CpG site is not methylated, fluorescently labeled adenine is incorporated into the probe. Therefore, the DNA methylation level can be calculated from the intensity of the fluorescence emitted by each fluorescent substance incorporated into the probe.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0075">A preferable example of this first method is, for example, a bead array method (for example, Infinium assay provided by Illumina, Inc.).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0076">The second method is a method for quantifying methylated DNA by mass spectrometry. For example, the second method is a method based on the following principles. First, a bisulfite treatment is performed on the genomic DNA. Next, using the bisulfite-treated genomic DNA as a template, DNA containing at least one of the CpG sites is amplified with a primer to which a T7 promoter is added. Next, the amplified DNA is transcribed into RNA, and a base-specific cleavage reaction is performed with RNase. Then, the product of this cleavage reaction is subjected to a mass spectrometer to measure the mass.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0077">Then, the mass derived from the methylated cytosine residue (mass of cytosine) obtained by mass measurement is compared to the mass derived from the unmethylated cytosine residue (mass of uracil) to calculate the DNA methylation level at the CpG site.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0078">A preferable example of this second method is, for example, a DNA methylation analysis method using a mass spectrometer (for example, MassARRAY&#xae;, see Jurinke C et al., Mutat Res, 2005, 573, 83-95).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0079">In MassARRAY (registered trademark), bisulfite-treated DNA containing the CpG sites is amplified, transcribed into RNA, and then specifically cleaved at the uracil site by RNAase. As a result, RNA fragments having different lengths are produced according to the presence or absence of methylation of DNA. The obtained RNA fragments are subjected to mass spectrometry, which allows to separate and detect the CpG-methylated fragments from the unmethylated fragments according to the difference in molecular weight. The primer for amplifying DNA containing the CpG sites can be designed using EpiDesigner (manufactured by SEQUENOM, primer design software for MassARRAY) and the like. For the mass spectrometry of the RNA fragments, MALDI-TOF MAS (for example, MassARRAY Analyzer 4 manufactured by SEQUENOM), which can detect the difference in mass of a single base, is used. The methylation level of DNA is calculated from the mass ratio between the RNA fragments derived from methylated DNA and the RNA fragments derived from unmethylated DNA.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0080">The third method is a method based on the following principles. First, a bisulfite treatment is performed on the genomic DNA. This bisulfite treatment converts unmethylated cytosine residues to uracil, but uracil is shown as thymine in the following extension reaction (sequence reaction). Next, using the genomic DNA thus treated with bisulfite as a template, DNA containing at least one of the CpG sites is amplified. Then, the amplified DNA is dissociated into single strands. Next, only one strand of the dissociated single-stranded DNA is separated. Then, an extension reaction is performed on each base from the vicinity of the base of the CpG site, pyrophosphoric acid generated at that time is enzymatically made luminescent, and the intensity of luminescence is measured. The intensity of luminescence derived from the methylated cytosine residues thus obtained (luminescence intensity of cytosine) is compared to the intensity of luminescence derived from the unmethylated cytosine residues (luminescence intensity of thymine), and the DNA methylation level (%) at the CpG site is calculated by, for example, the following expression:</p><p id="p-0077" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>DNA methylation level (%)=luminescence intensity of cytosine&#xd7;100/(luminescence intensity of cytosine+luminescence intensity of thymine).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0078" num="0081">Examples of the third method include the Pyrosequencing method (registered trademark) (see Anal. Biochem. (2000) 10: 103-110) and the like.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0082">The fourth method is a method based on the following principles. First, a bisulfite treatment is performed on the genomic DNA. Next, in a reaction system containing an intercalator which emits fluorescence when inserted between DNA duplexes, the nucleotides containing at least one of the CpG sites are amplified using the bisulfite-treated genomic DNA as a template. Then, the temperature of the reaction system is changed to detect the change in the intensity of the fluorescence emitted by the intercalator. The melting curve of the nucleotides containing at least one of the CpG sites is compared to the melting curve of the amplification product using the methylated/unmethylated control specimen as a template to calculate the DNA methylation level at the CpG site.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0083">An example of the fourth method is the methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM, see Wojdacz T K et al., Nat Protoc., 2008, 3, 1903-1908).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0084">The fifth method is a method based on the following principles. First, a bisulfite treatment is performed on the genomic DNA. Next, a primer set capable of amplifying when the CpG site is methylated and a primer set capable of amplifying when the CpG site is not methylated are prepared. Then, using the bisulfite-treated genomic DNA as a template, nucleotides containing at least one of the CpG sites are each amplified using these primer sets. Then, the DNA methylation level at the CpG site is calculated by comparing the amounts of the obtained amplification products, that is, the amount of methylated CpG site-specific amplification product with the amount of unmethylated CpG site-specific amplification product.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0085">Furthermore, as another aspect of this fifth method, first, a bisulfite treatment is performed on the genomic DNA. Next, an oligonucleotide probe having nucleotides capable of hybridizing when the CpG site is methylated, and labeled with a fluorescent reporter dye and a fluorescent quencher dye, is prepared. In addition, an oligonucleotide probe having a nucleotide capable of hybridizing when the CpG site is not methylated, and labeled with a fluorescent reporter dye different from the above fluorescent reporter dye and a fluorescent quencher dye, is prepared. Then, the oligonucleotide probe is hybridized to the bisulfite-treated genomic DNA, and the nucleotides containing the CpG site are amplified using the genomic DNA hybridized by the oligonucleotide probe as a template. Then, the fluorescence emitted by the fluorescent reporter dye is detected by the degradation of the oligonucleotide probe associated with the amplification. The DNA methylation level at the CpG site is calculated by comparing the intensity of the fluorescence emitted by the fluorescent reporter dye specific to the methylated cytosine CpG site thus detected with the intensity of the fluorescence emitted by the fluorescent reporter dye specific to the unmethylated cytosine CpG site.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0086">An example of the fifth method is the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) using real-time quantitative PCR such as the MethyLight method using a TaqMan probe (registered trademark).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0087">The sixth method is a method based on the following principles. First, a bisulfite treatment is performed on the genomic DNA. Next, a direct sequencing reaction is performed using the bisulfite-converted nucleotide containing the CpG site as a template. Then, the DNA methylation level at the CpG site is calculated by comparing the fluorescence intensity based on the determined base sequence, that is, the luminescence intensity derived from the methylated cytosine residues (luminescence intensity of cytosine) with the luminescence intensity derived from the unmethylated cytosine residues (luminescence intensity of thymine).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0088">Furthermore, as another aspect of this sixth method, first, a bisulfite treatment is performed on the genomic DNA. Next, the bisulfite-converted nucleotides containing the CpG site are cloned by PCR reaction or the like. Then, the base sequences of the obtained multiple cloning products are each determined, and the DNA methylation level at the CpG site is calculated by comparing the number of cloning products having the methylated cytosine CpG site-specific base sequence, with the number of cloning products having the unmethylated cytosine CpG site-specific base sequence.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0089">Examples of the sixth method include bisulfite direct sequencing and bisulfite cloning sequencing (see Kristensen L S et al., Clin Chem, 2009, 55, 1471-1483).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0090">The seventh method is a method based on the following principles. First, a bisulfite treatment is performed on the genomic DNA. Next, a region containing the CpG site is amplified by PCR using the nucleotide containing the bisulfite-converted CpG site as a template. Next, the amplified DNA fragment is treated with a restriction enzyme that recognizes the sites different in sequence between a case where the CpG site is methylated and a case where the CpG is not methylated. Then, the DNA methylation level of the CpG site can be calculated by quantitatively analyzing the band intensity of the restriction enzyme fragment derived from the methylated CpG site and the restriction enzyme fragment derived from the unmethylated CpG site, which have been fractionated by electrophoresis.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0091">An example of the seventh method is COBRA (analysis by the combined use of bisulfite and a restriction enzyme).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0092">The eighth method is a method using ion exchange chromatography. For example, the eighth method is a method based on the following principles. First, a bisulfite treatment is performed on the genomic DNA. Then, it is fragmented to obtain DNA fragments containing a CpG site. The regions containing the CpG sites are amplified by PCR or the like using the obtained DNA fragments as a template. Next, the amplified DNA fragments are subjected to ion exchange chromatography to separate the DNA in which the CpG sites are methylated from the DNA in which the CpG sites are not methylated.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0093">In the eighth method, the chain length of the PCR amplification products can be appropriately selected considering factors such as shortening the PCR amplification time, and shortening the analysis time and preserving the separation performance in the ion exchange chromatography. For example, the chain length of the PCR amplification products is preferably 500 bp or less, more preferably 300 bp or less, and further preferably 100 bp or less, on the other hand, the lower limit is 30 to 40 bp, which is the chain length of the PCR amplification products when using a primer of around 15mer which can avoid non-specific hybridization in PCR. Otherwise, it is preferable to design the primer to have a rich content of CpG sites in the PCR amplification products. For example, it is preferable that the cytosine of the CpG site be contained in 2% or more, more preferably 5% or more, with respect to the chain length of the PCR amplification products.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0094">In the eighth method, the unmethylated cytosine residues are converted to uracil by bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA and then further converted to thymine by PCR. On the other hand, the methylated cytosine residues remain as cytosine even after a bisulfite treatment and PCR. Due to this difference in base, the fragments containing methylated cytosine (methylated fragments) and the unmethylated fragments are detected as separate peaks with different retention times in ion exchange chromatography. That is, the methylated fragments are detected as peaks having a shorter retention time than the unmethylated fragments. Therefore, it is possible to determine whether the DNA at the CpG site is methylated or not based on the retention time of the peak in ion exchange chromatography. Furthermore, when the DNA fragments to be subjected to the ion exchange chromatography contains a plurality of CpG sites, the more CpG sites are methylated, the shorter the retention time of the peak is. Therefore, the DNA methylation level at the CpG site can be calculated based on the retention time of the peak. Alternatively, it is also possible to calculate the abundance and abundance ratio of each methylated fragment and unmethylated fragment based on the area or height of the peak.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0095">Preferably, whether the DNA of the CpG site is methylated or not, or the DNA methylation level of the CpG site is determined by comparing it with a sample (control) having a known DNA methylation level of the CpG site or by using a calibration curve prepared in advance using a sample having a known DNA methylation level. Alternatively, a retention time serving as a reference (also referred to as the reference retention time in this description) for separating the retention time of the peak of a methylated fragment having a highly methylated CpG site from the retention time of the peak of a fragment having a low methylation level using a sample having a known DNA methylation level, is determined in advance. For example, a fragment detected at a retention time earlier than the reference retention time is determined to be highly methylated DNA.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0096">The ion exchange chromatography performed in the eighth method is preferably an anion exchange chromatography. The packing material of the column is not particularly limited as long as it is made of base material particles having a strong cationic group on the surface, but base material particles having both a strong cationic group and a weak cationic group on the packing material surface, as shown in International Publication No. WO 2012/108516, are preferable. More preferably, the base material particles are base material particles containing coated polymer particles in which a layer of a hydrophilic polymer having a strong cationic group (preferably a quaternary ammonium salt) is copolymerized on the surface of hydrophobic crosslinked polymer particles, and a weak cationic group (preferably a tertiary amino group) introduced on the surface of the coated polymer particles. The column temperature in the chromatographic analysis is preferably 30&#xb0; C. or more and less than 90&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0097">The methods that can be suitably used as a &#x201c;method for detecting the DNA methylation level&#x201d; in the present invention have been exemplified above, but they are not limited thereto. In the first to eighth methods, as described above, the genomic DNA prepared from an upper urinary tract urothelial cell or a tissue is further subjected to a bisulfite treatment. Therefore, the genomic DNA used for detecting the DNA methylation level of a CpG site in the method of the present invention is preferably bisulfite-treated genomic DNA derived from an upper urinary tract urothelial cell or a tissue containing the upper urinary tract urothelial cell.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0098">In the method of the present invention, the presence or absence of UTUC in the tested upper urinary tract urothelial cell or tissue containing an upper urinary tract urothelial cell, or the presence or absence of UTUC in the subject is determined from the detected DNA methylation levels of CpG sites. A specific index for determination can be appropriately set by a person skilled in the art according to the method for detecting the DNA methylation level.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0099">An embodiment of the procedure for determination of the presence or absence of UTUC will be described below. In a first embodiment, first, for each DNA methylation level detection method, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is performed for each CpG site to obtain the sensitivity (positive rate) and specificity (negative rate), then the DNA methylation level at which the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is maximum is set as an index (cutoff value).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0100">In the first embodiment, for the CpG sites at which the methylation level is increased by the canceration of the upper urinary tract urothelial tissue (for example, the CpG sites included in the marker groups 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9 shown in Table 1), when the DNA methylation level detected in the method of the present invention is higher than the cutoff value, the DNA methylation level is considered to have exceeded the diagnostic threshold and the test cell or tissue, or subject is determined to have UTUC. But, when the detected methylation level is equal or below the cutoff value, the test cell or tissue, or subject is determined not to have UTUC. On the other hand, for the CpG sites at which the methylation level is reduced by the canceration of the upper urinary tract urothelial tissue (for example, the CpG sites included in the marker groups 3, 5, 6, and 7 shown in Table 1), when the DNA methylation level detected in the method of the present invention is lower than the cutoff value, the DNA methylation level is considered to have exceeded the diagnostic threshold, and the test cell or tissue, or subject is determined to have UTUC. But, when the detected methylation level is equal or above the cutoff value, the test cell or tissue, or subject is determined not to have UTUC.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0101">In the first embodiment, when the methylation levels of a plurality of CpG sites are detected, the number or ratio of CpG sites at which the DNA methylation level exceeds the diagnostic threshold can be used as an index for UTUC. For example, a test cell or tissue, or a subject can be determined to have UTUC when the methylation levels exceed the diagnostic threshold in all the investigated CpG sites. Alternatively, a test cell or tissue, or a subject can be determined to have UTUC when the methylation levels of a certain percentage or more of the investigated CpG sites exceed the diagnostic threshold. Alternatively, a test cell or tissue, or a subject can be determined to have UTUC when the methylation levels exceed the diagnostic threshold in a certain proportion or more of all the investigated CpG sites. On the other hand, the test cells or tissues, or subjects that do not meet these criteria can be determined not to have UTUC.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0102">In the second embodiment of the procedure for UTUC determination, the methylation level of a CpG site or the presence or absence of UTUC is determined by comparing the retention time of the peak obtained by the ion exchange chromatography analysis (the eighth method) on the DNA containing the target CpG site derived from the test cell or tissue, or the subject (sample), with the retention time for the DNA containing the non-methylated target CpG site (negative control) or the DNA containing the methylated target CpG site (positive control).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0103">In the second embodiment, when a peak with a shorter retention time than that of the negative control is detected from a sample for a CpG site at which the methylation level is increased by the canceration of upper urinary tract urothelial tissue (for example, the CpG sites included in the marker groups 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9 shown in Table 1), the sample is considered to be methylated, or the test cell or tissue, or subject is determined to have UTUC. Alternatively, when a peak with a retention time similar to that of the positive control is detected from a sample, the sample is considered to be methylated, or the test cell or tissue, or subject is determined to have UTUC. On the other hand, when a peak with a longer retention time than that of the positive control is detected from a sample for a CpG site at which the methylation level is reduced by the canceration of upper urinary tract urothelial tissue (for example, the CpG sites included in the marker groups 3, 5, 6, and 7 shown in Table 1), the sample is considered to be unmethylated, or the test cell or tissue, or subject is determined to have UTUC. Alternatively, when a peak with a retention time similar to that of the negative control is detected from a sample, the sample is determined to be unmethylated, or the test cell or tissue, or subject is determined to have UTUC.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0104">If the genomic DNA to be examined for the methylation levels of target CpG sites is DNA derived from urine, not only DNA derived from UTUC cells but also DNA derived from non-cancerous epithelial cells or cells of irrelevant lineage such as blood cells may coexist in the genomic DNA. Even in such cases, the presence or absence of DNA derived from UTUC cells can be detected by the eighth method.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0105">That is, if DNAs derived from a plurality of types of cells coexist in the sample DNA, a peak being bimodal, having shoulders, or being wide in shape is then exhibited in the chromatography analysis by the eighth method (for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shown later). Such an original peak can be separated into peaks derived from cells of different lineages, that is, peaks of different DNA methylation levels. For example, peaks included in an original peak can be estimated through fitting for the original peak on the assumption that a plurality of peaks in the shape of normal distribution are present. Subsequently, the methylation levels of the target CpG sites are calculated for the respective estimated peaks on the basis of the retention times. For example, the methylation level of each estimated peak can be calculated by using a calibration curve prepared on the basis of the retention times for DNAs with known methylation levels. Comparison between the methylation level of each estimated peak and the cutoff value with the same procedure as in the first embodiment described above allows determination whether the DNA derived from urine contains DNA derived from UTUC cells, or whether the subject has UTUC.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0106">Thus, according to the present invention, UTUC can be identified with a less invasive and simpler procedure than conventional UTUC test methods such as ureteral catheterization and CT-urography.

No difference was found between C and N for any of the methylation levels of the CpG sites, and UTUC exhibited statistically significant difference from C and N. Statistically significant correlation between DNA methylation level in Infinium assay and DNA methylation level in pyrosequencing was found for all of the 10 CpG sites (Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient r&#x3e;0.913, P&#x3c;7.02&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;35</sup>).

As predicted on the basis of the iMETHYL database, these adjacent CpG sites were predicted to be applicable as UTUC identification markers like the 10 CpG sites. Actually, CpG sites adjacent to each other were included in the 10 CpG sites detected in the Infinium assay (probe ID: cg10874111 and cg14302471).

upper urinary tract urothelial cells and can be collected in a non-invasive manner with ease, hence being useful as a sample for identification of UTUC. In the present Example, UTUC patients were detected on the basis of the methylation levels of UTUC identification markers contained in urine samples. The methylation levels of DNA were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A marker which undergoes an enhanced methylation level through UTUC (marker No. 37 in Table 4) was used as a UTUC identification marker.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="2">(Patients and Sample Treatment)</heading><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Catheter urine was collected for use as urine samples from 7 UTUC patients and 55 non-UTUC individuals (urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cases, and cases with urological consultation for a problem other than UTUC). In addition, UTUC tissues (n=10) obtained from UTUC cases, and non-UTUC tissues (n=20) consisting of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma tissues and non-cancerous tissues obtained from UTUC cases and urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cases were prepared as tissue samples. The urine samples and the tissue samples after collection were cryopreserved until DNA extraction.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">From each urine sample, a 4 mL to 55 mL portion was taken and left to thaw to normal temperature, and DNA was extracted by using a QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (manufactured by Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. DNA extraction from the tissue samples was performed with the same procedure as in Example 1. The whole volume of the extracted DNA was treated with bisulfite with the same procedure as in Example 1, and then subjected to PCR amplification using a set of the primers set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 19 and 20 under the same conditions as shown in Table 2. The PCR products obtained were purified, and subjected to HPLC.

The resultant was heated with stirring, and polymerized under a nitrogen atmosphere at 80&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. Subsequently, 100 g of trimethylammonium ethyl methacrylate chloride (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) as a hydrophilic monomer having strong cationic groups was dissolved in ion-exchanged water. The resultant was added to the reactor, and polymerized similarly with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere at 80&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. The resulting polymer composition was washed with water and acetone to afford coated polymer particles including a layer of a hydrophilic polymer having quaternary ammonium groups on their surfaces. The coated polymer particles obtained were subjected to measurement using a particle size distribution analyzer (AccuSizer780/manufactured by Particle Sizing Systems), and the average particle size was found to be 10 &#x3bc;m. In 100 mL of ion-exchanged water, 10 g of the coated polymer particles obtained was dispersed to prepare a pre-reaction slurry. Subsequently, 10 mL of N,N-dimethylaminopropylamine (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), which is a reagent having weak cationic groups, was added while the slurry was stirred, and the resultant was reacted at 70&#xb0; C. for 4 hours. After the completion of the reaction, the supernatant was removed by using a centrifuge (manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd., &#x201c;Himac CR20G&#x201d;), and washing was performed with ion-exchanged water. After the washing, the supernatant was removed by using a centrifuge. This washing with ion-exchanged water was further repeated four times to afford a packing material for ion exchange chromatography having quaternary ammonium groups and tertiary amino groups on the surface of base material particles.

Urine samples from UTUC patients can contain not only UTUC cells, but also non-cancerous epithelial cells, blood cells, and so on as contaminants. In analyzing DNA methylation levels through HPLC with use of a sample in which such cells of different lineages coexist, a bimodal peak, a shoulder peak as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, or a wide peak is often found in the chromatogram, and a peak derived from cells of irrelevant lineage is expected to be coexist therein. In view of this, in the present Example, an original peak in each of the chromatograms obtained through HPLC for the urine samples was separated into peaks derived from cells of different lineages, that is, peaks of different DNA methylation levels, and the methylation level of the UTUC identification marker was calculated. Specifically, peaks included in each of the original peaks derived from the urine samples were estimated through fitting on the assumption that a plurality of peaks in the shape of normal distribution was present. The retention times for the estimated peaks were detected, a calibration curve was prepared from the retention time for the unmethylation peak (methylation rate: 0%) and the retention time for the methylation peak (methylation rate: 100%) each determined in the same measurement, and the methylation levels of the estimated peaks were calculated with the calibration curve. If the methylation level of an estimated peak was higher than the cutoff value of the UTUC identification marker (the cutoff value of marker No. 37 in Table 4, 35.17%), the estimated peak was regarded as a peak for DNA derived from UTUC cells. A urine sample from which a peak for DNA derived from UTUC cells was detected was determined to be a urine sample derived from a UTUC patient.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="2">(Identification of UTUC)</heading><p id="p-0150" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the original peak of the chromatogram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, which was obtained from a urine sample from a UTUC patient, and peaks estimated as the constituent components.

From the presence of the peak derived from highly methylated DNA, the patient was confirmed to be UTUC-positive.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0146">With the same procedure, estimated peaks were detected from an original peak in each of the chromatograms for all the urine samples, and the methylation levels of the estimated peaks were calculated to determine whether the urine sample is a sample derived from a UTUC patient or not. For the tissue samples, methylation levels of DNA were calculated on the basis of original peaks. From the determination results, the sensitivity and specificity of the identification of UTUC were calculated for the urine samples, the tissue samples, and all the samples including the urine samples and tissue samples.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0147">Table 6 shows the results. For the urine samples, the sensitivity of detection of samples derived from UTUC patients was approximately 83%, and the specificity thereof was approximately 91% (Table 6(a)). For the tissue samples, on the other hand, the sensitivity and specificity were both 100% (Table 6(b)), and the sensitivity and specificity were both approximately 94% for all the samples (Table 6(c)). These results demonstrated that identification of UTUC can be performed with high accuracy not only for tissue samples, but even for urine samples, by detecting a UTUC identification marker and referring to the methylation level thereof.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Accuracy of identification of</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Number of samples</entry><entry>UTUC (%)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>UTUC</entry><entry>Non-UTUC</entry><entry>Sensitivity<sup>3</sup></entry><entry>Specificity<sup>4</sup></entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(a) Urine sample </entry><entry>&#x2002;7</entry><entry>55<sup>1</sup></entry><entry>83.3</entry><entry>91.3</entry></row><row><entry>(n = 62)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>(b) Tissue sample </entry><entry>10</entry><entry>20<sup>2</sup></entry><entry>100.0</entry><entry>100.0</entry></row><row><entry>(n = 30)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>(c) All samples </entry><entry>17</entry><entry>75</entry><entry>93.8</entry><entry>93.9</entry></row><row><entry>(n = 92)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00009"><sup>1</sup>Urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cases, and cases with urological consultation for a problem other than UTUC</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00010"><sup>2</sup>Urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma tissue, and non-cancerous tissue obtained from a surgical specimen from a UTUC case or a urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma case</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00011"><sup>3</sup>Proportion of UTUC samples determined to be positive</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00012"><sup>4</sup>Proportion of non-UTUC samples determined to be negative</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230002832A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
