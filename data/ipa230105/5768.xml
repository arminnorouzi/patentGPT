UHV characterization system is the general name of this kind of mainstream high-precision surface analysis instruments, which covers large platform instrumentations including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), scanning tunneling microscope (STM), mass spectrometer (MS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS), Low Energy Ion Scattering(LEIS), Angle Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARPES), Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), etc. The coupled interconnection of UHV characterization equipment with in-situ high-temperature and high-pressure preparation simulating industrial conditions or on-line characterization devices is widely applied in surface analysis science, material science, semiconductor devices, microelectronics, catalysis and other fields at present and in the future.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The traditional routine preparation method for analysis in UHV systems includes first preparing the sample on the standard sample stage, then transferring the sample to the sample preparation chamber for pre-vacuumization, and finally transferring the sample to the analysis chamber for measurement after the vacuum degree meets the requirements (usually 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>Pa). If the sample surface is not sensitive, the vacuum protection can ensure that during the measurement period, the number of surrounding gas molecules contacted/adsorbed on the sample surface is much less than the number of surface monolayer (ML) molecules, thus protecting the sample from being contaminated during the measurement process. However, before this process, the sample is generally exposed to the external environment, and the surface is easily contaminated due to oxidation and deliquescent, which may change the original properties of the sample, making the analysis results deviate from the characterization purpose. Even if a traditional commercial sample transfer device is used to protect the sample, damage to the sample surface is still inevitable, since the ultimate vacuum level can only be limited to several Pa, which is much higher than that of UHV. Therefore, some commercial photoelectron spectroscopy sample stage provides upgraded surface activation functions such as in-situ heating. However, samples that are sensitive to the preparation process, such as catalyst surface prepared under different reaction conditions, cannot be activated only by vacuum heating due to the experimental conditions requirements. Before XPS analysis, it is necessary to perform in-situ high-temperature and high-pressure pretreatment (such as heating, oxidation, reduction and in-situ chemical reaction) preparation and on-line characterization under simulated industrial conditions in a high-pressure reaction cell. After these pre-treatments or chemical reactions, the sample is then transferred through a vacuum interconnection (typically 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>pa) to an XPS analysis chamber for analysis. Such in-situ reaction setups require the sample to be loaded on an independent sample holder that can be separated from the photoelectron spectroscopy sample stage for vacuum coupled interconnect transfer operations. At present, however, there is no sample stage that can provide in-situ heat under vacuum analysis condition and is compatible with the aforementioned separable independent sample holder for vacuum interconnection work conditions. For the samples that need to be prepared in-situ, the function of secondary sample heating during UHV characterization analysis (such as TPD, TP-XPS, etc.) is completely limited. The lack of secondary sample heating function in analysis is one of the major shortcomings of coupling a UHV system and a high pressure reaction cell at present.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure provides an in-situ temperature control stage customized for coupled interconnection between an in-situ high pressure reaction cell and an ultrahigh vacuum characterization.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides an in-situ temperature control stage, including an independent sample holder, a sample holder fixing cartridge, a customized sample stage, and an anode contact pin.

The sample holder slot <b>22</b> and the heating element slot <b>23</b> are aligned with the sample loading spot <b>11</b>, which generally means that the independent sample holder <b>1</b> can be transferred right above the heating element slot <b>23</b>, as placed toward the sample holder slot <b>22</b> and located in the slot, and the independent sample holder <b>1</b> is positioned at the top notch of the heating element slot <b>23</b> (For example, the sample loading spot <b>11</b> may cover the notch of the heating element slot <b>23</b>), so that the sample on the independent sample holder <b>1</b> is located at the notch. With this arrangement, the sample can be heated by the heating element <b>43</b> in the heating element slot <b>23</b>. The contacting thermocouple <b>44</b> on the sample stage body <b>41</b> may be in contact with a thermocouple, so that the temperature of the in-situ temperature control stage can be obtained through the contacting thermocouple <b>44</b>.

The heating element <b>43</b> may be fixed on a sample stage body <b>41</b> through the heating element support <b>42</b>. The material of the sample stage body <b>41</b> may be stainless steel or metallic molybdenum.

The structure of the independent sample holder <b>1</b> in the present disclosure is completely consistent with the operation mode of the original independent sample holder <b>1</b> for vacuum interconnection transfer operation in the traditional equipments, and is compatible with the original vacuum transfer design. In a specific embodiment of the present disclosure, the independent sample holder <b>1</b> may be a sample holder suitable for various vacuum characterization sample heating stages, specifically, the independent sample holder <b>1</b> may be a flag-shaped sample holder commonly used in vacuum equipment transfer, and the supporting instrumentation platform is a ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250Xi XPS characterization apparatus.

The two fixing spring pieces may be parallel to each other, and one end of the fixed spring pieces may be spot-welded to the fixing cartridge body <b>21</b>, respectively, so as to form two parallel rails extending along the slot entry and having rail openings facing each other. The length of the rails may be 12 mm&#xb1;0.5 mm, and the width of the rails may be 18 mm&#xb1;0.2 mm, so that the independent sample holder <b>1</b> can be inserted into the rails. The free end of the fixed spring piece may gradually approach to the surface of the fixing cartridge body <b>21</b>, for example, the free end may gradually approach to the bottom surface of the sample holder slot <b>22</b> of the fixing cartridge body <b>21</b> at a distance of 5 mm from the fixed end, and the free end is in contact with the bottom surface of the sample holder slot <b>22</b> of the fixing element body <b>21</b>, so as to ensure that the independent sample holder <b>1</b> is subjected to uniform pressure and forms surface contact with the sample holder fixing cartridge <b>2</b> at the bottom of the sample holder slot <b>22</b>. In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, the pellet hole may be cylindrical, with a depth range of 0.5&#xb1;0.1 mm and a diameter of 6.0&#xb1;0.5 mm. The heating element slot <b>23</b> may be cylindrical, with a diameter of 10.6&#xb1;0.1 mm and a depth of 2.5&#xb1;0.1 mm. The heating element fixing pinhole <b>24</b> has a diameter of 1.6&#xb1;0.05 mm and is located at the center of the bottom surface of the heating element slot <b>23</b>.

The anode contact pin <b>3</b> may include an anode conductive pin <b>32</b> and an insulating O-ring <b>31</b> covering both ends of the anode conductive pin <b>32</b>, thereby ensuring that the anode contact pin <b>3</b> is completely insulated from the sample stage body <b>41</b>. The heating power can be introduced by aligning the inner diameter and positioning of the anode conductive pin <b>32</b> with the probe-type power output electrode provided inside the UHV equipment. The negative electrode is provided by the sample stage body <b>41</b> itself, which is installed in a grounded manner, so that the heating power output provided from the instrumentation can be streamed by connecting the first and second plug probes of the spectrometer analysis chamber through the above structure.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the in-situ temperature control stage provided by the disclosure, a K-type thermocouple may be used for temperature sampling, and the design of all types of thermocouples and thermal resistors is completely compatible. For example, the contacting thermocouple <b>44</b> may be a thermocouple clip made of stainless steel, and the thermocouple clip may include a first thermocouple contact spring <b>45</b> and a second thermocouple contact spring <b>45</b>, which may be fixed on and insulated from the customized sample stage <b>4</b> by a thermocouple fixing element (for example, a screw) and an insulating element (for example, an insulating ceramic O-ring). One end of the contacting thermocouple <b>44</b> is in contact with spot welding of the thermocouple wires to read the temperature data, and the other end of the contacting thermocouple <b>44</b> is pinned by the fixing elements on the thermocouple contact spring <b>45</b> which clamping the sample stage body <b>41</b>, so that the temperature data can be transferred to a temperature data input port of an ultrahigh vacuum instrument which is in contact with it.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the in-situ temperature control stage provided by the disclosure, the low temperature control can be carried out by liquid nitrogen (for example, the UHV liquid nitrogen cooling assembly in the traditional ultrahigh vacuum characterization system), specifically, liquid nitrogen is introduced into a cooling pipeline installed in an analysis chamber by using a cold trap, and the liquid nitrogen in the cooling pipeline reaches a copper cooling block in the analysis chamber. The customized sample stage <b>4</b> exchanges heat with the cooling block through contact to realize low-temperature cooling.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A second aspect of the present disclosure provides a UHV characterization system including an in-situ temperature control stage as provided in the first aspect of the present disclosure. The ultra-vacuum characterization system may be a system including, but not limited to, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), TEM (transmission electron microscopy), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), STM (scan tunneling microscope), MS (mass spectrometer), AES (Auger electron spectroscopy), LEED (low energy electron diffraction spectroscopy), HREELS (high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy), LEIS (Low Energy Ion Scattering), ARPES (Angle Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy), MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) and other instruments.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present disclosure overcomes the difficulty induced by the narrow operation and transfer space of the analysis chamber of the UHV characterization equipment, and designs an optimized scheme of an in-situ heating sample stage which is compatible with the vacuum transfer of a high-pressure reaction cell and the UHV characterization equipment. The main advantages of the present disclosure lie in:</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">1. The customized sample stage <b>4</b> is minimized in volume and thickness, and only the anode contact pin <b>3</b> which can be contacted with one end of the heating element <b>43</b> is placed inside, and the anode contact pin <b>3</b> is composed of coaxial parts including two insulating O-rings <b>31</b> and an anode conductive pin <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">2. By using an open filament structure (left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the entire integrated heating block floats above the upper surface of the customized sample stage <b>4</b>, and is embedded in the heating element slot <b>23</b>, directly heating the sample loading spot <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">3. Base on the minimization of the customized sample stage <b>4</b>, on the premise of not affecting the normal operation and transfer mode of the analysis chamber of the UHV characterization equipment, the method accurately measures, maximizes the volume and thickness of the fixing slot of the sample holder, and is 100% compatible with the transfer mode of universal independent sample holder <b>1</b> which is vacuum-connected with a high-pressure reaction cell.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">4. All heating circuits and insulators are arranged in the design structure of the floating embedded heating element, which is the core part of the present disclosure. By this design, the thickness of the metal bulk portion of the customized sample stage <b>4</b> is minimized. And therefore, enough space is saved for placing the fixing slot of the sample holder, and the standard sample transfer mode is ensured. At the same time, this design is structurally independent from the customized sample stage <b>4</b> and sample holder fixing cartridge <b>2</b>, which are made of good metal thermal conductors, reducing the heating level of other components on these two components. The heating is more concentrated at the sample location, thus the temperature control is more effective. Therefore, this design can also reduce the heating power to achieve the same temperature ramping effect. The advantages of this design for measurement and control are to increase the sensitivity of temperature control, especially in the low temperature range, and to reduce the adverse factors such as vacuum heating induced degas, which are harmful to vacuum measurement.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The in-situ temperature control sample stage of the UHV characterization equipment designed by the present disclosure can be compatible with the in-situ preparation and characterization functions of a high-pressure reaction cell and an analysis chamber of the UHV characterization equipment, can realize the in-situ pretreatment and online characterization of a sample in the high-pressure reaction cell, and is also suitable for secondary temperature control measurement in the analysis chamber of the ultrahigh vacuum characterization equipment, thereby realizing the maximum compatibility of the coupled interconnection system of the high-pressure reaction cell and the UHV characterization equipment. The present disclosure not only provides an in-situ analysis temperature control stage scheme for an independent sample holder <b>1</b> in a UHV analysis chamber aiming at a ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250 Xi and its matched vacuum interconnected high pressure reaction cell, but also a design idea that is applicable to the in-situ temperature control design of other similar independent sample holders which need coupled interconnection between compatible UHV characterization equipment and high-pressure reaction cell.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In summary, the present disclosure effectively overcomes various disadvantages in the prior art and has a high industrial utilization value.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The above embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and effects of the present disclosure, and are not intended to limit the present disclosure.
