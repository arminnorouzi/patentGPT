Accordingly, an epoxy resin has been used in various applications such as an adhesive, an encapsulant, a sealant, a potting agent, a coating agent, and an electrically conductive paste. However, the cured product of such an epoxy resin may have poor flexibility, though exhibiting tough mechanical strength. As a result, a cured product of epoxy resin may not follow the movement of an adherend so as to cause cracks, peeling and the like.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, in order to impart flexibility to an epoxy resin, a modified silicone resin has been added. As an example of such a technique, an adhesive including a liquid A with a composition of an epoxy resin, a curing catalyst for modified silicone-based polymers and a filler, and a liquid B with a composition of a modified silicone-based polymer having an alkoxysilyl group at an end and a curing agent for an epoxy resin is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2007-099806.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the curable resin composition disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2007-099806 uses an organic tin catalyst as curing catalyst for modified silicone-based polymers (curing agent for modified silicone resin). A tin catalyst is problematic because of the harmful effect on human body due to high toxicity, and therefore the use thereof tends to be restricted in many countries. Accordingly, a substitute catalyst for organic tin catalyst is strongly required.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of the substitute catalyst for organic tin include a titanium catalyst. However, as a result of investigation, the present inventors have found that a curable resin composition with use of a titanium catalyst has a problem of poor surface curability and poor internal curability in bonding adherend members as shown in Comparative Example 5 described later in the present specification. The problem of internal curability in bonding adherend members is as follows. In the case where substrates having a large area are bonded to each other with a moisture curable resin composition, the moisture curable resin composition in a circumferential portion in contact with moisture-containing air is cured in advance. Since the cured product blocks the moisture from penetrating into the central uncured portion, a lot of time is required to cure the moisture curable resin composition in the central portion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a curable resin composition excellent in surface curability and internal curability in bonding adherend members without use of an organic tin catalyst.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The gist of the present invention is described as follows.
