such as display of the product, representation of the product display space, or placement of an ornament, to produce sales promotion effects.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">However, when a real store sells, for example, clothing, it is difficult to determine to what degree &#x201c;displays,&#x201d; such as a mannequin, a hanger, decoration equipment, and display equipment, have contributed to sales promotion purposes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">This applies also to a digital store. For example, when a mannequin using a product is displayed, or an image obtained by replacing the face of the mannequin with a face image of the user is displayed on the screen of a user terminal, or a representation is made in the environment surrounding the mannequin, or a representation is made using display of the product, as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-183542, it is difficult to determine to what degree the representation or the like has contributed to sales as a &#x201c;display,&#x201d; compared to when the product alone is displayed on the screen of a user terminal. This difficulty in determining the degree of contribution makes it difficult for the manufacturer or supplier to actively make investment while objectively grasping cost-effectiveness.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">As used herein, the term &#x201c;display&#x201d; refers to any type of means that mediates supply and purchase of a product and/or service between the user who considers the purchase of the product and/or service and the supplier that supplies the product and/or service and is an entity like a communication medium that smooths the distribution of the product and/or service.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The &#x201c;display&#x201d; not only contributes to the user, but also contributes to the manufacturer that produces the product or supplier in that it also provides information to the manufacturer or supplier. For example, if the product is &#x201c;clothing,&#x201d; information indicating that the user wanted to buy a red M-size T-shirt but could not buy it due to it being out of stock and a red T-shirt of a size somewhat larger than M was present in the store is useful for the manufacturer or supplier that produces or supplies the product.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">It is assumed that the user has purchased a red T-shirt with a longing for a scene in which they walk around the sea of Okinawa or considered the purchase thereof. Information on such a user's action allows a company that can provide the scene (for example, a travel agency, a hotel, a traffic company, a food or restaurant company, etc.) to provide useful information to the user. For this reason, there is a need to calculate the degree of contribution of a &#x201c;display&#x201d; serving as the useful information. However, it is difficult to correctly determine the degree of contribution of the information.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">See Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-183542.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0009">The present invention has been made in view of the above problem, and an object thereof is to provide a contribution degree calculation system and computer program product for calculating the degree of contribution of &#x201c;displays&#x201d; serving as means for mediating supply and purchase of a product and/or service between a user who considers purchase of the product and/or service and a supplier that supplies the product and/or service.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">To accomplish the above object, a contribution degree calculation system according to the present invention is a contribution degree calculation system for calculating the degree of contribution of displays serving as means for mediating supply and purchase of a product and/or service between a user who considers purchase of the product and/or service and a supplier that supplies the product and/or service.

For example, the contribution degree calculator <b>114</b> may calculate the degree of contribution of the &#x201c;displays&#x201d; to the purchase of the product A by the user as 20% for the advertisement, 30% for the real store, and 50% for the EC site. The contribution degree calculator <b>114</b> may calculate the degree of contribution in a numerical value such as 100, 200, or 350 in place of %.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">When calculating the &#x201c;related contribution degree,&#x201d; an index such as a relation level 0, 1, or 2 may be used.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">For example, it is assumed that the user has purchased favorite fermented soybeans that they eat every day.
