Typically, the invention will have an application for satellites having a weight between 1 kg and 100 kg, optionally able to range up to 500 kg. A particularly interesting case of application relates to the &#x201c;CubeSat&#x201d; of which a base module (U) weighs up to 1.3 kg and has dimensions of 10 cm*10 cm*10 cm. The cold gas thruster according to the invention can in particular be integrated into a module 1U or a demi-module (&#xbd;U) and used in stacks of several modules by 2 (2U), 3 (3U), 6 (6U), 12 (12U) or more.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cold gas thrusters, or cold gas propulsion systems for spacecrafts, are rocket engines which use the expansion of a pressurized gas to generate thrust. Cold gas thrusters are simple systems classically comprising a fuel tank, a regulating valve and a propelling nozzle. By comparison with traditional thrusters, they do not house any combustion and therefore have lower thrust and efficiency. They can be used for instance for orbital maintenance, maneuvering or attitude control.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Gas and liquid propellants are classically used in cold gas based propulsion systems for spacecrafts. Nevertheless, the use of liquid propellants or gas propellants which can become liquid in certain conditions triggers different constraints and challenges. Among them, one can cite for instance the storage of the propellant in a gaseous or liquid form, which requires high pressure for a gas phase storage, and can trigger technical problems such as propellant sloshing in the case of the propellant being stored as a liquid. For example, patent documents U.S. Pat. No. 8,620,603 and US 2019/277224 disclose methods and systems to determine an amount of remaining fluid in the tank of a propulsion system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to overcome at least part of these storage issues, cold gas thrusters with a solid storage of the propellant have been envisioned.

In these thrusters, the propellant is stored in a solid form and is converted to gas by a chemical reaction, for instance by ignition of solid propellant pellets. A high pressure (few bars) of the gaseous propellant is obtained through this chemical reaction. Such systems are not compatible with all solid propellants; especially they are not compatible with the use of iodine propellant. In addition, these thrusters should be able to sustain a high pressure (few bars) of gaseous propellant, which impacts on their manufacturing and design. Finally, the gas pressure obtained by the chemical reaction cannot be finely controlled.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent documents U.S. Pat. No. 3,373,563, U.S. Ser.

To their knowledge, the present invention is the first disclosure of a cold gas thruster operating by sublimation of a solid propellant, such as iodine, to obtain thrust.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A first object of the invention is a cold gas thruster comprising a tank suitable for containing a solid propellant and a tank heating device suitable for sublimating said solid propellant and forming gaseous propellant, the tank having an aperture for transferring said gaseous propellant outside said tank, such as a nozzle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The solid propellant cold gas thruster of the invention presents a number of advantages towards existing systems. First, the solid form of the propellant allows a much higher storage density than for any gas, thus releasing volume constraints when manufacturing the thruster. In addition, as the solid propellant sublimation produces a relatively low pressure, such as a pressure lower than 0.1 bar, the tank design and requirements are simpler and the qualifications for the launch get easier. Finally, not requiring a tank sustaining high pressure also allows reducing the tank price by a factor above 10. In addition, this solution allows qualifying the system for using it in very restricted missions, such as missions deployed from the international space station (ISS) or on small satellites launched as a secondary payload.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to particular aspects, the cold gas thruster comprises means for measuring an amount of remaining solid propellant in the tank, said means comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">at least one tank temperature sensor or, respectively, a shock generator and a displacement or acoustic sensor in contact with the tank, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">an electronic control board adapted for measuring an enthalpy change of the tank depending on power provided to the tank heating device, or, respectively, for measuring a frequency response with the displacement or acoustic sensor.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">Other non-limitative and advantageous features of the thruster according to the invention, which may be considered alone or in any technically possible combination, are the following:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0017">The solid propellant is selected from the group consisting of iodine (I<sub>2</sub>), bismuth (Bi), cesium (Ce), cadmium (Cd), tin (Sn), indium (In), gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), lithium (Li), mercury (Hg), adamantane, ferrocene, arsenic, polyvinyl chloride, polyimide, and polytetrafluoroethylene, preferably the solid propellant is iodine (I<sub>2</sub>). Iodine (I<sub>2</sub>) is especially advantageous in that its sublimation happens with a modest heating, for instance heating at a temperature from 80&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. In addition, I<sub>2 </sub>stores as a low pressure solid, thus the tank may be irregular in shape, confirming to available space. Finally, I<sub>2 </sub>is relatively low-cost compared to some other propellants, such as the ones listed above.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0018">The tank comprises one or a plurality of divisions, in particular a plurality of divisions, each division being suitable for storing at least part of said solid propellant. The divisions in the tank afford simultaneous limitation of bouncing of the stored solid propellant and precise control of the heat transfer to the propellant. Indeed, the separate divisions allow increasing the surface to volume ratio for the thermally controlled surfaces, such that thermal flow towards the propellant blocks which may have lost contact with a wall is reinforced. Actually, one of the challenges of the solid propellant storage consists in the fact that, with time, the propellant block might become fractured, and various fractions of propellant can bounce between the tank walls in micro-gravity conditions, similarly to the sloshing effect when using liquid propellant. This process can significantly affect ability of the spacecraft for altitude control and precise positioning, especially in the case when high precision pointing is required. Another undesired effect of the propellant fracturing is the loss of thermal contact between the propellant and the walls of the tank, which is undesired because in this solid propellant cold gas thruster the propellant is sublimated by the heat transfer. This loss of thermal contact can trigger an increase in the time to reach the steady state, and it can even be impossible to transfer enough heat power to the propellant to ensure sublimation at the given rate. The design of the tank according to this embodiment solves these issues.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0019">At least one of the tank divisions is at least partially filled with a binder preventing separation of propellant fractions and/or their free motion in the tank, such as chemically inert fibers, preferably glass wool fibers.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0020">The divisions are delimited by the outer wall and/or inner walls of the tank.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0021">At least one of the walls&#x2014;outer wall and/or inner walls of the tank&#x2014;defining each division is in direct or indirect thermal contact with at least one tank heating device. &#x201c;Direct thermal contact&#x201d; is obtained when at least one tank heating device touches at least one of the walls defining the division. &#x201c;Indirect thermal contact&#x201d; is obtained when the tank heating device does not touch the walls defining the division, but a heat transfer is performed from the at least one tank heating device to the at least one wall defining the division through radiation.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0022">The total surface area of the tank inner walls and of the inner side of the outer wall which can be in contact with the propellant is calculated by matching the thermal transfer to the propellant with the required sublimation power for sublimating the solid propellant. The surface area of the tank walls may thus be calculated according to the following formula:</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>A</mi>   <mo>=</mo>   <mfrac>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>flow</mi>      <mo>&#xd7;</mo>      <msub>       <mi>H</mi>       <mi>S</mi>      </msub>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mrow>     <mi>&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</mi>     <mo>&#x2061;</mo>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <msubsup>       <mi>T</mi>       <mi>t</mi>       <mn>4</mn>      </msubsup>      <mo>-</mo>      <msubsup>       <mi>T</mi>       <mi>i</mi>       <mn>4</mn>      </msubsup>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mfrac>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0017" num="0000">wherein A is the surface area of the thank walls, flow is the desired propellant flow, Hs is the sublimation heat of the solid propellant, &#x3c3; is the Stephan-Boltzmann constant, &#x3b5; is the emissivity, T<sub>t </sub>is the tank temperature and T<sub>i </sub>is the propellant temperature.

The storage sealing system may be any system suitable for limiting or avoiding leakage of propellant vapors through the exhaust nozzle or other aperture prior to the thruster first use in space. Preferably, the storage sealing system comprises a protective film and an infrared emitter. The protective film is positioned in front of the aperture for transferring the gaseous propellant outside the tank, and the infrared emitter is suitable for sublimating at least part of the protective film. Actually, prior to its use in space, the propulsion system classically undergoes different stresses such as qualification campaign with thermal cycling including ambient pressure case, and/or storage in various environments and for unpredictable time. During these steps, leakage of the solid propellant vapors through the exhaust aperture, in particular the exhaust nozzle, may be observed. Leakage of the propellant may result in damages to the other systems, including spacecraft, ground and launch equipment, as well as personnel if the propellant is toxic and/or corrosive. The thruster according to this embodiment solves this issue.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0026">The cold gas thruster further comprises an on-off valve for controlling the transfer of gaseous propellant outside the thruster.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0027">The thruster further comprises an electronic control board, and the tank is fixed directly onto said electronic control board. Said direct fixation allows a high miniaturization of the cold gas thruster of the invention thanks to the weight and volume reduction of the tank due to the use of a solid propellant such as iodine, to be sublimated. High miniaturization of the thrusters is important especially for their use in miniaturized spacecrafts. Conversely, classical cold gas thrusters are based on relatively large spherical or similar shape high-pressure tanks, not allowing their direct fixation on the electronic board. If a heavy tank was fixed on a board it would probably break the board during vibrations and/or shock loads.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0006" num="0028">The tank has the shape of a column, wherein the area of the tank face on which the exhaust aperture is located is lower than the area of each orthogonal tank face. This feature contributes to increasing the compactness of the miniaturized thruster.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0007" num="0029">The tank does not comprise an outer mechanical frame. This feature also contributes to increasing the compactness of the miniaturized thruster.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0008" num="0030">The thruster comprises at least two tanks, which are preferably controlled independently from each other.

Then the tank <b>1</b> is heated at constant or variable power to temperature T2 higher than T1, and the change of enthalpy &#x394;H during the heating from T1 to T2 is calculated according to the following formula: &#x394;H=&#x3a3;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>N </sup>P<sub>T</sub><sub><sub2>i</sub2></sub>/&#x394;t<sub>i</sub>, wherein P<sub>T </sub>is instantaneous value of the power provided to the tank heaters <b>4</b>, &#x394;t<sub>i </sub>is current time interval, and N is the amount of measurement intervals. t<sub>m </sub>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> represents the total measurement time and is equal to t<sub>m</sub>=&#x3a3;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>N </sup>&#x394;t<sub>i</sub>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0087">In an embodiment, the process for measuring the amount of remaining propellant in the tank <b>1</b> comprises, after the tank has reached the temperature T<sub>2</sub>, a step of measuring cooling curves of the tank <b>1</b>, and assessing the variation of the heat transfer to the mechanical frame <b>3</b> and/or environment. The impact of the assessed variation of heat transfer to the mechanical frame <b>3</b> and/or environment onto the change of enthalpy can be obtained thanks to modelling. Alternatively, said impact can be obtained by referring to pre-established calibration tables obtained at different heat transfer rates.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0088">Measuring the amount of remaining solid propellant in the tank <b>1</b> may be alternatively implemented from oscillatory properties of the tank. The thruster of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> comprises a shock source or generator <b>19</b>, a displacement or acoustic sensor (frequency sensor) <b>20</b> and a frequency filter <b>21</b> in order to implement the process for measuring the amount of propellant in the tank <b>1</b> according to the invention. Actually, at given mass, mechanical properties and geometry, the propellant tank <b>1</b> inside the propulsion system has natural oscillation frequencies, which correspond to the whole tank oscillation on fixations <b>2</b> and also to longitudinal and transversal acoustic waves, which all depend on the tank <b>1</b> mass and filling media. In order to measure the oscillation frequency, a shock is generated by a shock generator <b>19</b> positioned preferably at one end of the tank <b>1</b>, and then measuring the frequency response by a frequency sensor <b>20</b>, which is preferably positioned at the opposite end of the tank <b>1</b>. The type of measured resonance is determined by the shock generator <b>19</b> properties and the frequency settings of the frequency filter <b>21</b>, preferably the frequency band filter <b>21</b>, which is preferably connected in series with the frequency sensor <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0089">In the present description, the numerical ranges must be interpreted as being inclusive, unless otherwise specified, which means that the range limits are comprised in said range.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230002085A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="6.69mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002085A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230002085A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="6.69mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002085A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
