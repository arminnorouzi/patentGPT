Currently, lithium is relied upon heavily as an energy source for such electronic devices. However, there is concern that increasing demands for such lithium-ion batteries may further deplete the limited supply of lithium in the Earth's crust.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various technologies have been researched and developed as alternatives to lithium ion batteries in recent years. Magnesium ion batteries have shown great potential as an alternative energy source due to its high natural abundance, high volumetric capacity, low reduction potential, and low cost. However, the development of such batteries has been hampered by poor performance of current electrolyte systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to the reactivity of magnesium-based electrodes, organic solvents are typically employed in electrolyte systems for magnesium ion batteries. While several magnesium salts have demonstrated good solubility in such organic solvents, electrolytes comprising these magnesium salts alone often result in poor Coulombic efficiency and poor reversibility of magnesium deposition. As such, the performance of magnesium-ion batteries has been regarded to be poorer than the current lithium-ion batteries</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need to provide an improvement for magnesium-ion batteries which are able to overcome or at least ameliorate the disadvantages discussed above. In particular, it is an object to provide an electrolyte system for magnesium ion batteries which allows efficient plating and stripping of magnesium and demonstrates improved Coulombic efficiency. Other desirable features and characteristics will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the drawings and this background of the disclosure</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an electrolyte comprising a) at least one magnesium salt; b) an aluminium halide salt; and c) a solvent comprising at least one ether group; wherein the electrolyte does not comprise magnesium chloride; and wherein said magnesium salt comprises a polyatomic anion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an electrolyte consisting essentially of a) a magnesium salt; b) an aluminium halide salt; and c) a solvent comprising at least one ether group; wherein said magnesium salt comprises a polyatomic anion.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Advantageously, it was found that the combination of an aluminium halide salt and a polyatomic magnesium salt results in in-situ formation of electroactive ionic magnesium species which are highly soluble in the solvent comprising at least one ether group. Without being bound by theory, it is postulated that the electroactive species formed from the aluminium halide salt and polyatomic magnesium salt facilitates efficient charge transfer in the electrolyte. This enables efficient plating and stripping of magnesium at the electrode to be achieved and leads to sustained and stable Coulombic efficiency of about 80-95%, even after 250 cycles. In embodiments of the present invention described below, it was observed that the Coulombic efficiency may remain substantially stable over the battery's life, wherein the variance between each cycle may be &#xb1;10% or less. This is a marked improvement over the performance of other conventional magnesium-based electrolytes which tend to show erratic and irregular Coulombic efficiencies as the number of cycles increases.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The sustained and stable cycling behavior of the electrolyte described herein also advantageously leads to an extended cycling life of an electrochemical cell prepared with the electrolytes described herein. Electrochemical cells prepared with electrolytes described herein may be used for more than 250 cycles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an electrochemical cell comprising a) a positive electrode; b) a magnesium negative electrode; c) the electrolyte as described herein; and wherein said positive electrode and said magnesium negative electrode are in fluid communication with said electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As will be demonstrated herein, electrochemical cells comprising the electrolytes as described herein exhibit a surprisingly long cycling life of at least 250 cycles. This is believed to be due to the formation of electroactive species such as Mg<sub>2</sub>(&#x3bc;-Cl)<sub>2</sub>(solvent)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, which are highly soluble in the solvent comprising at least one ether group. The formation of such species may allow the deposition of uniform and dendrite-free layers of magnesium on an electrode in an electrochemical cell. The dendrite-free deposition of magnesium may reduce the occurrence of short-circuits in an electrochemical cell, thereby improving its usability and safety. A combination of one or more of the aforementioned technical effects may lead to a longer lifetime of the electrochemical cells assembled with the electrolytes described herein.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;stable&#x201d;, &#x201c;stability&#x201d; and grammatical variants thereof, in the context of this specification, refers to an electrode that can be operated with no sign of short circuiting and/or without experiencing sudden fluctuations in voltage or current or capacity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;homogenous&#x201d; as used herein refers to substances which comprise components or elements which are the same.

Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background of the invention or the following detailed description. Exemplary, non-limiting embodiments of a carbonized composite for electrochemical cell electrodes, will now be disclosed</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a first aspect, the present disclosure relates to an electrolyte comprising a) at least one magnesium salt, b) an aluminium halide salt; and c) a solvent comprising at least one ether group, wherein the electrolyte does not comprise magnesium chloride and wherein said at least one magnesium salt comprises a polyatomic anion.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In embodiments, the electrolyte described herein consists essentially of a) a magnesium salt, b) an aluminium halide salt; and c) a solvent comprising at least one ether group, wherein said magnesium salt comprises a polyatomic anion.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other embodiments, the electrolyte described herein consists of a) a magnesium salt, b) an aluminium halide salt; and c) a solvent comprising at least one ether group, wherein the electrolyte does not include magnesium chloride and wherein said magnesium salt comprises a polyatomic anion.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the context of the present invention, the expression &#x201c;electrolytes which do not comprise magnesium chloride&#x201d; or variants thereof may be taken to mean that magnesium chloride is intentionally not added as a chemical constituent/ingredient during preparation of the electrolyte composition. Such electrolytes may, however, form electroactive or solvated species comprising magnesium and chloride ions in the solvent when the electrolyte is used in an electrochemical cell.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The aluminum halide salt used herein may be any aluminium halide salt which is soluble in the solvent comprising at least one ether group. The aluminum halide salt may be aluminium fluoride, aluminium chloride, aluminium bromide or aluminium iodide. In preferred embodiments, the aluminium halide salt used in the electrolyte is aluminium chloride.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, it was found that aluminium chloride demonstrates good solubility in the solvent comprising at least one ether group as compared to other chloride salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride and lithium chloride. The superior solubility of the aluminium chloride additive may, as a result, provide an increased concentration of chloride anions in the electrolyte. This enables the formation of electrochemically active species such as Mg<sub>2</sub>(&#x3bc;-Cl)<sub>2</sub>(solvent)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, which facilitates charge transfer and contributes to the efficient plating and stripping of magnesium at the working electrode of an electrochemical cell. The benefits of providing aluminium chloride in the solvent may be demonstrated by the Examples provided herein, which show that cells comprising such electrolytes are able to exhibit a Coulombic efficiency of up to 95%.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The concentration of the aluminium halide salt in the electrolyte may be between about 0.01 M to 20 M, or about 0.01 M to 18 M, or about 0.01 M to 16 M, or about 0.01 M to 14 M, or between about 0.01 M to 12 M, or between about 0.01 M to 10 M, or between about 0.01 M to 8 M, or between about 0.01 M to 6 M, or between about 0.01 M to 5 M, or between about 0.01 M to 4 M, or between about 0.01 M to 3 M, or between about 0.01 M to 2 M, or between about 0.01 M to 1 M, or between about 0.01 M to 0.8 M, or between about 0.01 M to 0.6 M, or between about 0.05 M to 0.6 M, or between about 0.1 M to 0.6 M, or between about 0.2 M to 0.6 M, or preferably between about 0.2 M to 0.4 M. In embodiments, the aluminium halide salt is provided at a concentration of about 0.33 M.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The electrolyte described herein may comprise at least one magnesium salt. The electrolyte may comprise up to 10 magnesium salts. The electrolyte may comprise 1 to 10 magnesium salts, or 1 to 10 magnesium salts, or 1 to 9 magnesium salts, or 1 to 8 magnesium salts, or 1 to 7 magnesium salts, or 1 to 6 magnesium salts, or 1 to 5 magnesium salts, or 1 to 4 magnesium salts, or 1 to 3 magnesium salts, preferably 1 to 2 magnesium salts.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The magnesium salt of the electrolyte may be any magnesium salt which may form an electroactive species which facilitates charge transfer between electrodes of an electrochemical cell. The magnesium salt may preferably be a magnesium salt which is soluble in the solvent comprising at least one ether group. Where more than one magnesium salt is used, at least one magnesium salt may comprise a polyatomic anion. The polyatomic anion may comprise 2-50 atoms, or 5-50 atoms, or 5-45 atoms, or 5-40 atoms, or 5-35 atoms, or 5-30 atoms, or 5-25 atoms, or 10-25 atoms, or preferably 10 to 20 atoms.

The polyatomic anion may preferably be trifluoromethanesulfonate (OTf), bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI), bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI), oligomeric fluorosulfonyl imide, nonafluorobutanesulfonyl imide, difluoro(oxalato)borate (DFOB), and tetrafluoroborate.
