When a detection biological signal to which such body motion noise has been added is subjected to signal processing by an analog front-end circuit (hereinafter, referred to as AFE circuit) and input to an analog-to-digital converter (hereinafter, referred to as ADC), the detection biological signal exceeds an input valid range (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as dynamic range (DR)) of the ADC and biological data cannot be acquired during the occurrence of the body motion in some cases.

Accordingly, the detection biological signal is offset-controlled using the changed offset control threshold or the detection biological signal is amplified with the changed gain.

Accordingly, the offset control threshold is changed only in a situation where body motion noise is added to the detection biological signal, and the offset control threshold is not changed in the period in which there is no body motion. Therefore, the number of times of offset control in the period in which there is no body motion is reduced, and the increase in the power consumption is suppressed.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Other Configuration Examples</heading><p id="p-0220" num="0217">Embodiments of the present technology are not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment, and various modifications can be made without departing from the gist of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0218">For example, in the above-mentioned embodiment, the example in which the EEG sensor that detects brainwave signals as the biological sensor has been described, though not limited thereto. For example, the present technology can be applied to a pulse wave sensor, a blood flow sensor, or a sweat sensor as the biological sensor. In these biological sensors, as in the above-mentioned embodiment, body motion noise due to body motion appears in a signal detected by the biological sensor, delayed from the time at which the body motion of the person to be measured, which is observed by the reference signal sensor, occurs. Therefore, it is possible to predict that the body motion noise is added to the detection biological signal on the basis of the detection result of the reference signal sensor, and it is possible to control the offset control threshold or the gain associated with the signal processing of the detection biological signal in advance. Accordingly, the detection biological signal containing the body motion noise is prevented from departing from the dynamic range of the ADC, and the accuracy of the acquired biological data can be improved.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0219">The pulse wave sensor detects pulse waves of a living body to be detected by irradiating the living body to be detected with light from a light source such as a light-emitting diode and obtaining a signal indicating the intensity of light reflected from the living body to be detected by a light-receiving elements such as a photodiode. Since hemoglobin in blood flowing in blood vessels of the living body to be detected has a light absorption property, pulse waves of a detection target are detected by observing light reflected by the photodiode.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0220">The blood flow sensor is an optical sensor that measures a blood flow rate. The blood flow sensor irradiates a body site of a person to be measured with light (e.g., laser light or infrared light) and measures a blood flow rate on the basis of the reflected light. For example, a forehead can be irradiated with light and the rate of cerebral blood flow can be measured on the basis of the reflected light. The blood flow sensor includes a light-emitting element (e.g., a laser diode) and a light-receiving element (e.g., a photodiode). The blood flow sensor may include a plurality of light-receiving elements. The blood flow sensor may include a plurality of light-emitting elements.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0221">The sweat sensor is a sensor that detects sweat secreted from sweat glands of the skin (e.g., eccrine sweat glands). Sweat makes the skin more electrically conductive. Thus, sweat can be detected by acquiring the electrodermal activity (EDA) of the skin. In the sweat sensor, a weak current is applied to the skin to measure an electrical resistance value, and skin conductance activity (SCA) can be calculated as an inverse of the electrical resistance value. The SCA is sweat data. It should be noted that the sweat data is not limited to one that calculates the SCA, and may be one that calculates a skin potential.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0222">Moreover, for example, in the biological data measurement system of the above-mentioned embodiment, the example in which the biological data is acquired by using biological sensors of a single type that detect brainwaves has been described, though a plurality of biological sensors of different types may be used. In this case, thresholds used for body motion noise level determination are set as appropriate for each of the different types of biological sensors.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0223">Moreover, for example, in the embodiment described above, the example in which the three-axis acceleration sensor is used as the reference signal sensor has been described, though a three-axis gyro sensor or a pressure sensor provided attached to the bioelectrode <b>5</b> (hereinafter, referred to as living body contact portion pressure sensor) may be used.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0224">The three-axis gyro sensor detects angular velocity (rotational speed). Even in a case of using the three-axis gyro sensor, the above-mentioned equation can be used for calculating a reference signal variation value. In this case, in the equation, N=3, r1 denotes X-axis angular velocity, r2 denotes Y-axis angular velocity, and r3 denotes Z-axis angular velocity.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0225">The living body contact portion pressure sensor detects a stress applied to the skin of the person to be measured. For example, a force sensor such as a piezoelectric sensor, a strain sensor such as a strain gauge, a sensor that detects deformation of a piezoelectric film, or the like can be used as the living body contact portion pressure sensor. Even in the case of using the living body contact portion pressure sensor, the above-mentioned equation can be used for calculating the reference signal variation value. In this case, in the equation, N represents the number of living body contact portion pressure sensors.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0226">Moreover, the body motion information may be obtained by using a plurality of reference signal sensors of different types. For example, two or all three selected from the three-axis acceleration sensor, the three-axis gyro sensor, and the living body contact portion pressure sensor may be used as the reference signal sensors. In a case of using the plurality of reference signal sensors of different types, a reference signal variation can be obtained for each of the different types of sensors, and body motion information such as a body motion noise level can be obtained on the basis of the result.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0227">Moreover, different types of reference signal sensors may be used for each of the plurality of biological sensors of different types. For example, in one biological data measurement system, a pulse wave sensor and an EEG sensor may be used as the biological sensors, a three-axis acceleration sensor may be used as the reference signal sensor for the EEG sensor, and a living body contact portion pressure sensor may be used for the pulse wave sensor.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0228">In a case where the living body contact portion pressure sensor is used as the reference signal sensor, the living body contact portion pressure sensor can be provided in each of a plurality of detection units (corresponding to bioelectrodes in the above embodiment) that is held in contact with different body sites of the person to be measured and acquires detected biological signals of the respective body sites. Accordingly, the prediction of the occurrence of the body motion noise can be determined for each biological sensor, and an instruction to change the offset control threshold or the gain can be given for each biological sensor.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0229">It should be noted that the plurality of detection units may correspond to biological sensors of the same type, or may correspond to a plurality of biological sensors of different types. For example, in one biological data measurement system, a pulse wave sensor and an EEG sensor may be used as a biological sensor, a detection unit corresponding to the pulse wave sensor may be provided to be held in contact with the wrist, a detection unit corresponding to the EEG sensor may be provided to be held in contact with the head, and a living body contact portion pressure sensor as the reference signal sensor may be provided in each of the detection units.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0230">Moreover, for example, in the above-mentioned embodiment, the example in which one of the offset control threshold change and the gain change is performed in accordance with the body motion noise level in the offset/gain control state has been described, though both the offset control threshold change and the gain change may be performed.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0231">Moreover, for example, in the offset/gain control state, the signal control may be performed in three divided stages of only the offset control threshold change, only the gain change, and the change of both the offset control threshold and the gain in a manner that depends on the body motion noise level.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0232">Moreover, for example, the change to lower the gain may be performed in the control state.
