Photofabrication is a generic term describing the technology used for manufacturing a wide variety of precision components such as semiconductor packages. The manufacturing is carried out by applying a photoresist composition to the surface of a processing target to form a photoresist layer, patterning this photoresist layer using photolithographic techniques, and then conducting chemical etching, electrolytic etching, or electroforming mainly based on electroplating, using the patterned photoresist layer (photoresist pattern) as a mask.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, high density packaging technologies have progressed in semiconductor packages along with downsizing electronics devices, and the increase in package density has been developed on the basis of mounting multi-pin thin film in packages, miniaturizing of package size, two-dimensional packaging technologies in flip-tip systems or three-dimensional packaging technologies. In these high density packaging techniques, connection terminals, such as protruding electrodes (mounting terminals), e.g., bumps protruding from the package, or metal posts to connect redistribution that extends from peripheral terminals on the wafer with the mounting terminals, are disposed on the surface of the substrate with high precision.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the photofabrication as described above, a photoresist composition is used, and chemically amplified photosensitive compositions containing an acid generating agent have been known as such a photoresist composition (see Patent Documents 1, 2 and the like). According to the chemically amplified photosensitive composition, an acid is generated from the acid generating agent upon irradiation with radiation (exposure) and diffusion of the acid is promoted through heat treatment, to cause an acid catalytic reaction with a base resin and the like in the composition, resulting in a change to the alkali-solubility of the same.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such chemically amplified photosensitive compositions are used, for example, in formation of plated articles such as bumps, metal posts, and Cu redistribution, for example, in plating steps, in addition to formation of patterned insulating films or etching masks. Specifically, a photoresist layer having a desired film thickness is formed on a support such as a metal substrate using a chemically amplified photosensitive composition, and the photoresist layer is exposed through a predetermined mask pattern and is developed. Thereby, a photoresist pattern used as a template in which portions for forming plated articles have been selectively removed (stripped) is formed. Then, bumps, metal posts, and Cu redistribution can be formed by embedding a conductor such as copper into the removed portions (nonresist portions) using plating, and then removing the surrounding photoresist pattern.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. H09-176112</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0007">Patent Document 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. H11-52562</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0008">Patent Document 3: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. 2015-87759</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0009">Patent Document 4: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. 2016-502142</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0010">Patent Document 5: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. 2019-514072</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0011">In general, when a resist pattern is formed, its cross-sectional shape is desirably rectangular in many cases. In particular, formation of connection terminals such as bumps and metal posts, or formation of Cu redistribution, by the plating as mentioned above, the cross-sectional shape of a nonresist section of the resist pattern as a template is strongly desired to be rectangular. In the formation process of a plated article, when the cross-sectional shape of a nonresist section of the resist pattern as a template is rectangular, a contact area between the connection terminals such as bumps, metal posts, and the like, or the bottom surface of the Cu redistribution and a support can be sufficiently secured. Thus, connection terminals or Cu redistribution having favorable adhesion to the support can be easily obtained.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0012">As a technique to improve a shape of a resist pattern, formulating a sulfur-containing compound has been disclosed (Patent Documents 3 to 5). However, when forming a resist pattern by using one of the chemically amplified resist compositions including a sulfur-containing compound, as disclosed in Patent Documents 3 to 5, etc., a foreign matter is often contained in the photosensitive composition or a foreign matter is often generated in the obtained resist pattern. This foreign matter is derived from the sulfur-containing compound included in the chemically amplified resist composition. When a resist pattern including a foreign matter is used as a template for forming a plated article or etching mask, it is difficult to form a plated article or etched product having a desired shape. In addition, while a chemically amplified resist composition is often used after filtration, when a foreign matter derived from the sulfur-containing compound is removed by this filtration, there is a risk that a desired effect of improving the shape of a resist pattern may be impaired due to a reduction in the content of the sulfur-containing compound in the chemically amplified resist composition. For this reason, a method for producing a chemically amplified resist composition capable of reducing an amount of foreign matter derived from a sulfur-containing compound, a chemically amplified resist composition produced by the method, and the like are desired.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0013">The present invention has been made in light of the above-described problem, and objects of the present invention are to provide: a method for manufacturing a chemically amplified photosensitive composition capable of reducing an amount of a foreign matter derived from a sulfur-containing compound, a premix solution for preparing a chemically amplified photosensitive composition, the premix solution being capable of being used in the method for manufacturing a chemically amplified photosensitive composition, a chemically amplified photosensitive composition capable of being manufactured by the method for manufacturing a chemically amplified photosensitive composition, a method for manufacturing a photosensitive dry film including a photosensitive layer including the chemically amplified photosensitive composition, and a method for manufacturing a patterned resist film by using the chemically amplified photosensitive composition.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0014">As a result of extensive studies in order to achieve the above-mentioned objects, the present inventors have found that the above-mentioned problem can be solved by the following method: when preparing a chemically amplified photosensitive composition including: an acid generating agent (A) to generate an acid by irradiation with an active ray or radiation and a sulfur-containing compound (C), the sulfur-containing compound (C) being solid at room temperature, the sulfur-containing compound (C) is dissolved, in advance, in a solvent (S1) having a Hansen solubility parameter in which a polar term &#x3b4;p is 10 (MPa<sup>0.5</sup>) or more to prepare a solution of the sulfur-containing compound (C), and this solution of the sulfur-containing compound (C) is blended with the acid generating agent (A) and a solvent (S2), the solvent (S2) being a different solvent from the solvent (S1), whereby the present invention has been completed.

The method described below for manufacturing the photosensitive composition includes preparing a solution of the sulfur-containing compound (C) by dissolving the sulfur-containing compound (C) in the solvent (S1), and blending the solution of the sulfur-containing compound (C), the acid generating agent (A), and the solvent (S2). Firstly, the chemically amplified photosensitive composition prepared by the manufacturing method of the chemically amplified photosensitive composition is described.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0038">The chemically amplified photosensitive composition is the same as conventionally known chemically amplified photosensitive compositions each including an acid generating agent (A), except that the acid generating agent (A), the sulfur-containing compound (C), the sulfur-containing compound (C) being solid at room temperature, the solvent (S1) having a Hansen solubility parameter in which a polar term &#x3b4;p is 10 (MPa<sup>0.5</sup>) or more, and the solvent (S2), the solvent (S2) being a different solvent from the solvent (S1), are included. The chemically amplified photosensitive composition may be a positive-type photosensitive composition having a developing solution-solubility that increases under action of an acid generated by exposure, or a negative-type photosensitive composition having a developing solution-solubility that decreases under action of an acid generated by exposure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0039">Examples of the positive-type chemically amplified photosensitive composition include a photosensitive composition including a resin (B) having an alkali solubility that increases under action of an acid in addition to the acid generating agent (A), the sulfur-containing compound (C), the solvent (S1), and the solvent (S2), the resin (B) including an alkali soluble group protected by a group to be deprotected by action of an acid, typified by a tert-butyl group, a tert-butoxy carbonyl group, a tetrahydropyranyl group, an acetal group, and a trimethylsilyl group.

The sulfur-containing compound (C) is a compound containing a sulfur atom to coordinate, for example, to a metal. When forming a resist pattern for use as a template for plating on a surface made of a metal such as Cu, a defect of the cross-sectional shape such as footing easily occurs. However, when the positive photosensitive composition contains the sulfur-containing compound (C), even when a resist pattern is formed on a surface made of metal in a substrate, it is easy to suppress occurrence of a defect in a cross-sectional shape such as footing. Note here that the &#x201c;footing&#x201d; is a phenomenon in which the width of the bottom is narrower than that of the top in a non-resist section, because a resist portion extends toward the non-resist portion in the vicinity of the contacting surface between the substrate surface and the resist pattern.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0218">However, when a photosensitive composition containing a sulfur-containing compound (C), the sulfur-containing compound (C) being solid at room temperature, is used, a foreign matter is often contained in the photosensitive composition or is often generated in the obtained resist pattern. This foreign matter is derived from the sulfur-containing compound included in the chemically amplified resist composition. When a resist pattern including a foreign matter is used as a template for forming a plated article or etching mask, it is difficult to form a plated article or etched product having the desired shape. In addition, when a foreign matter derived from a sulfur-containing compound is removed by filtration, there is a risk that a desired effect of improving the shape of a resist pattern may be impaired due to a reduction in the content of the sulfur-containing compound in the chemically amplified resist composition.

The content of the solvent (S1) in the solvent in which the sulfur-containing compound (C) is dissolved, that is, the content of the solvent (S1) in the solvent contained in the solution of the sulfur-containing compound (C), is preferably 50% by mass or more, more preferably 70% by mass or more, more preferably 85% by mass or more, and most preferably 100% by mass, with respect to the total of the solvent (S1) and the solvent (S2).

Further, since the sulfur-containing compound (C) dissolves in the specific solvent (S1), even when the sulfur-containing compound (C) is subsequently mixed with other components afterward, the sulfur-containing compound (C) hardly precipitates. Therefore, even though the sulfur-containing compound (C) is solid at room temperature, the photosensitive composition including a foreign matter derived from the sulfur-containing compound in a reduced amount can be obtained. By using the photosensitive composition including a foreign matter in a reduced amount, a resist pattern including a foreign matter in a reduced amount can be formed.

However, in the present invention, since the sulfur-containing compound (C) is dissolved in the specific solvent (S1), the sulfur-containing compound (C) is hardly removed by filtration.

When a substrate with a template for forming a plated article is manufactured, for the substrate, a substrate having a metal surface is used. As metal species constituting a metal surface, copper, gold and aluminum are preferred, and copper is more preferred. When a resist pattern is formed on a substrate having a metal surface, a defect in a cross-sectional shape such as footing tends to occur. However, since the above photosensitive composition contains the sulfur-containing compound (C), occurrence of the defect in a cross-sectional shape such as footing can be suppressed, and a resist pattern having a desired cross-sectional shape can be formed. Further, since the above-described photosensitive composition includes a decreased amount of a foreign matter derived from the sulfur-containing compound (C), a resist pattern having a desired shape can be formed. Further, in the above-described photosensitive composition, since the sulfur-containing compound (C) is hardly removed by filtration, the effect of the desired sulfur-containing compound (C) is obtained.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0294">The photosensitive layer is laminated on the substrate, for example, as follows. In other words, a liquid photosensitive composition is coated onto a substrate, and the coating is heated to remove the solvent and thus to form a photosensitive layer having a desired thickness. The thickness of the photosensitive layer is not particularly limited as long as it is possible to form a resist pattern which has a desired thickness. The thickness of the photosensitive layer is not particularly limited, and is preferably 0.5 &#x3bc;m or more, more preferably 0.5 &#x3bc;m or more and 300 &#x3bc;m or less, more preferably 0.5 &#x3bc;m or more and 150 &#x3bc;m or less, and most preferably 0.5 &#x3bc;m or more and 200 &#x3bc;m or less. The upper limit of the film thickness may be, for example, 100 &#x3bc;m or less. The lower limit of the film thickness may be, for example, 1 &#x3bc;m or more, and may be 3 &#x3bc;m or more.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0295">As a method of applying a photosensitive composition onto a substrate, methods such as the spin coating method, the slit coat method, the roll coat method, the screen printing method and the applicator method can be employed. Pre-baking is preferably performed on a photosensitive layer. The conditions of pre-baking may differ depending on the components in a photosensitive composition, the blending ratio, the thickness of a coating film and the like. They are usually about 2 minutes or more and 120 minutes or less at 70&#xb0; C. or more and 200&#xb0; C. or less, and preferably 80&#xb0; C. or more and 150&#xb0; C. or less.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0296">The photosensitive layer formed as described above is selectively irradiated (exposed) with an active ray or radiation, for example, an ultraviolet radiation or visible light with a wavelength of 300 nm or more and 500 nm or less through a mask having a predetermined pattern.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0297">Low pressure mercury lamps, high pressure mercury lamps, super high pressure mercury lamps, metal halide lamps, argon gas lasers, etc. can be used for the light source of the radiation. The radiation may include micro waves, infrared rays, visible lights, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, &#x3b3;-rays, electron beams, proton beams, neutron beams, ion beams, etc. The irradiation dose of the radiation may vary depending on the constituent of the photosensitive composition, the film thickness of the photosensitive layer, and the like. For example, when an ultra-high-pressure mercury lamp is used, the dose may be 100 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or more and 10,000 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less. The radiation includes a light ray to activate the acid generating agent (A) in order to generate an acid.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0298">After the exposure, the diffusion of acid is promoted by heating the photosensitive layer using a known method to change the alkali solubility of the photosensitive layer in developing solution such as an alkali developing solution at an exposed portion in the photosensitive resin film.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0299">Subsequently, the exposed photosensitive layer is developed in accordance with a conventionally known method, and an unnecessary portion is dissolved and removed to form a predetermined resist pattern or a template for forming plated articles. At this time, as the developing solution, an alkaline aqueous solution is used.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0300">As the developing solution, an aqueous solution of an alkali such as, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, sodium metasilicate, aqueous ammonia, ethylamine, n-propylamine, diethylamine, di-n-propylamine, triethylamine, methyldiethylamine, dimethylethanolamine, triethanolamine, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide, pyrrole, piperidine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-7-undecene or 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-5-nonane can be used. Also, an aqueous solution prepared by adding an adequate amount of a water-soluble organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol, or a surfactant to the above aqueous solution of the alkali can be used as the developing solution. Furthermore, depending on the composition of the photosensitive composition, developing by an organic solvent can be applied.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0301">The developing time may vary depending on the composition of the photosensitive composition, the film thickness of the photosensitive layer, and the like. Usually, the developing time is 1 minute or more and 30 minutes or less. The method of the development may be any one of a liquid-filling method, a dipping method, a paddle method, a spray developing method, and the like.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0302">After development, it is washed with running water for 30 seconds or more and 90 seconds or less, and then dried with an air gun, an oven, and the like. In this manner, it is possible to form a resist pattern, which has been patterned in a predetermined pattern on a metal surface of a substrate having a metal surface. Also, in this manner, it is possible to manufacture a substrate with a resist pattern on a metal surface of a substrate having a metal surface.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="2">&#x3c;&#x3c;Method of Manufacturing Plated Article&#x3e;&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0333" num="0303">A conductor such as a metal may be embedded, by plating, into a nonresist portion (a portion removed with a developing solution) in the template formed by the above method on the substrate to form a plated article, for example, like a contacting terminal such as a bump and a metal post, or Cu redistribution. Note here that there is no particular limitation on the method of plate processing, and various conventionally known methods can be used. As a plating liquid, in particular, a solder plating liquid, a copper plating liquid, a gold plating liquid, and a nickel plating liquid are suitably used. The remaining template is removed with a stripping liquid and the like in accordance with a conventional method.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0031" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0334" num="0304">The present invention will be described in more detail below by way of Examples, but the present invention is not limited to these Examples.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">Examples 1 to 29 and Comparative Examples 1 to 29</heading><p id="p-0335" num="0305">In Examples 1 to 29 and Comparative Examples 1 to 29, as the sulfur-containing compound (C), compounds C1 to C5 of the following formulae were used.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00082" num="00082"><img id="EMI-C00082" he="147.07mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230004085A1-20230105-C00082.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0337" num="0306">In Examples 1 to 29 and Comparative Examples 1 to 29, as the acid generating agent (A), PAG A1 and PAG A4 of the following formulae were used.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00083" num="00083"><img id="EMI-C00083" he="166.12mm" wi="75.78mm" file="US20230004085A1-20230105-C00083.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0339" num="0307">In Examples 1 to 29 and Comparative Examples 1 to 29, the following Resin A1 to Resin A5 were used as the resin having an alkali solubility that increases under action of an acid (resin (B)).

The chemically amplified photosensitive compositions of Examples and Comparative Examples were each applied on the copper layer of each of the substrates to form a photosensitive layer (coated film of the chemically amplified photosensitive composition) having a thickness of 55 &#x3bc;m. Then, the photosensitive layer was pre-baked at 130&#xb0; C. for 5 minutes. After the pre-baking, using a mask having a line-and-space pattern having a line width of 2.0 &#x3bc;m and a space width of 2.0 &#x3bc;m, and Canon PLA501F Hardcontact (manufactured by Canon Inc.), pattern exposure was performed with an ultraviolet ray having a wavelength of 365 nm at an exposure dose greater by 1.2 times than the minimum exposure dose capable of forming a pattern having a predetermined size. Subsequently, the substrate was mounted on a hot plate and post-exposure baking (PEB) was performed at 90&#xb0; C. for 1.5 minutes. Subsequently, an aqueous 2.38% by weight solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) (developing solution, NMD-3, manufactured by Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co., Ltd.) was added dropwise to the exposed photosensitive layer, and the photosensitive layer was allowed to stand at 23&#xb0; C. for 30 seconds. This operation was repeated three times in total. Subsequently, the surface of the resist pattern was washed (rinsed) with running water, and blown with nitrogen to obtain a resist pattern. For the obtained resist pattern (line and space pattern), 50 locations were randomly observed under an optical microscope (magnification: 10&#xd7;magnification) to confirm the presence or absence of a foreign matter (the sulfur-containing compound (C) remaining without being dissolved). The resist pattern in which 3 or less foreign matters were observed was evaluated as excellent (indicated by bullseye symbol (&#x2299;)), the resist pattern in which 4 or more and 9 or less foreign matters were observed was evaluated as good (indicated by circle symbol (&#x2218;)), and the resist pattern in which 10 or more and 19 or less foreign matters were observed was evaluated as poor (indicated by cross symbol (&#xd7;)), and the resist pattern in which 20 or more foreign matters were observed was evaluated as bad (indicated by double cross symbol (&#xd7;&#xd7;)). Note that the observed foreign matters had a size of 10 &#x3bc;m or more and 1 mm or less. Furthermore, since filtration was performed before addition of the sulfur-containing compound (C), the foreign matters observed are considered to be only those derived from the sulfur-containing compound (C).</p><p id="p-0353" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec
