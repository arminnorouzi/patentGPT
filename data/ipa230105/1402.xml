The displacement device and the pipette tip can together form a sealed air space.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The displacement device changes the volume of the air space, allowing liquid to be aspirated into and dispensed from the pipette tip. A pipetting device may have multiple displacement devices with respective pipette tips. The displacement device may be operated manually or by means of a motor. The pipetting device may also be hand-held or part of an automated laboratory apparatus.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The displacement device can be designed in particular as a piston-cylinder arrangement and then has a cylinder and a piston. The piston is movable in the cylinder by means of a drive device, wherein a movement of the piston is limited by an upper stop, a lower stop and at least one counter stop of the drive device and/or of the piston, so that a stroke of the piston is defined. The pipetting volume, i.e., the amount of liquid taken up or dispensed, depends on the stroke of the piston, but the stroke volume of the piston in the air space typically deviates from the pipetting volume. In pipetting devices with adjustable pipetting volume, the stroke of the piston, in particular the position of the upper stop, can be changed by means of an adjusting device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pipetting devices of the type in question have a volume indicator for indicating the pipetting volume. In one state of use, the adjusting device is coupled to the volume indicator, whereby an actuation of the adjusting device (and thus a change in the stroke of the piston) causes a change in the volume indicator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Now, the value displayed by the volume indicator may deviate from the actual pipetting volume. The deviation depends, for example, on the density and viscosity of the liquid, the temperature, the air pressure and wetting effects. Such deviations should always be avoided. There are two ways to eliminate or at least reduce the deviation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the one hand, the volume indicator can be changed without changing the stroke of the piston. For this purpose, the actual pipetting volume must be determined, which causes considerable effort. In most cases, the transferred pipetting volume is weighed, wherein a wide variety of environmental conditions must be considered. Often this type of adjustment of the volume indicator is carried out by the manufacturer under standard conditions following manufacture or repair (Factory calibration).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, the stroke of the piston can be changed without changing the volume indicator. Extensive documentation is available on the extent to which the stroke of the piston should be changed and under which conditions. This can be done quite easily by the user (user adjustment). However, this requires a well-defined starting point (initial stroke of the piston). Again, the factory calibration is used for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A piston-stroke pipette for exchangeable pipette tips of the type described above is known from European Patent Application EP 1 743 701 A1 and from corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 8,133,453 B2. This known piston-operated pipette has a holder holding the lower stop, an overtravel spring between the lower stop and the holder, an adjusting device for adjusting the position of the holder with respect to the cylinder, and an indicator device for indicating the position of the holder. If the known piston-stroke pipette is designed with adjustable pipetting volume, it has a separate volume adjusting device for changing the position of the upper stop. The volume setting device is coupled via a gear to a counter for indicating the volume setting.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An adjustment of the known piston-operated pipette by the user is carried out exclusively by adjusting the lower stop, namely by means of the adjusting device for setting the position of the holder. The positioning of the upper stop performed during factory calibration is therefore not changed. A disadvantage is that the adjustment is carried out by means of a further adjusting device which changes the piston stroke. The holder to be repositioned in this process is held in the housing of the known piston-stroke pipette by a threaded connection. This further threaded connection does not represent a rigid connection to the housing. Depending on the temperature and the forces that occur, this threaded connection is a source of error for the piston stroke and the volume accuracy. Furthermore, the user must operate an additional adjusting device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A check and correction of the factory calibration can be made by adjusting the position of the upper stop. To do this, insert a screwdriver blade into a notch on the outside of an adjustment block and, by moving a set of gears, uncouple the volume adjusting device from the counter for displaying the volume setting. In this unstable condition, the position of the upper stop can then be changed. This adjustment is not very convenient for the user and also requires a delicate procedure, thus increasing the likelihood of errors occurring or even damage to the piston-stroke pipette during this adjustment option. This adjustment option is also not intuitive for the user.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The task of the present invention is to improve the manageability, the precision, the procedure as well as the reliability when adjusting and/or calibrating a pipetting device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above task is solved by a pipetting device in accordance with the present invention as described below.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The pipetting device according to the present invention, for taking up and dispensing fluid volumes has a displacement device, a drive device, a volume indicator, an adjusting device, an adjustment indicator, and a coupling device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The displacement device has a displacement means, in particular a piston, and a displacement housing, in particular a cylinder. In particular, the displacement device is designed as a piston-cylinder arrangement.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, the drive device is designed to move the displacement means in the displacement housing, wherein a movement of the displacement means is limited by an upper stop, a lower stop and at least one counter stop of the drive device and/or of the displacement means, so that a stroke of the displacement means is defined.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The volume indicator is designed to display a pipetting volume associated with the stroke of the displacement means and/or correlating with the stroke of the displacement means. Ultimately, the stroke of the displacement means can specify the pipetting volume to be accommodated, so that the pipetting volume ultimately correlates to or is assigned to the stroke. The volume indicator thus enables the user to see the pipetting volume. The indication can be provided in different ways, for example by an analog or digital display.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The adjusting device, in turn, is designed to change the stroke of the displacement means, in particular to change the position of the upper stop.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The adjustment indicator is designed to indicate and/or preset and/or set an adjustment value of the stroke of the displacement means. Such an adjustment value results from the fact that the stroke and the pipetting volume are adjusted in such a way that the volume indicator can reference the actually and/or at least essentially actually dispensed pipetting volume. The adjustment value specifies the extent to which any deviations are to be considered.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The coupling device according to the invention is now designed in such a way that it can be transferred into a use state and into an adjustment state. Such a transfer can be affected by an actuation, in particular by an exerted force. In particular, the coupling device can be operated and/or actuated by the user of the pipetting device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the use state, the adjusting device is coupled to the volume indicator and decoupled from the adjustment indicator, whereby actuation of the adjusting device causes a change in the volume indicator but not in the adjustment indicator. Thus, in the use condition, the user can adjust and change the pipetting volume, and this change can be indicated by the volume indicator. Therefore, the adjusting device, which allows an adjustment of the stroke of the displacement means and thus in particular of the upper stop, is coupled to the volume indicator. The volume indicator shows the size of the pipetting volume correlating to the stroke of the displacement.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the adjustment state, the adjusting device is coupled to the adjustment indicator and decoupled from the volume indicator. Thus, an actuation of the adjusting device causes a change of the adjustment indicator but not of the volume indicator. Such an actuation can, for example, be caused by an applied force, in particular a force applied by the user. Therefore, in the adjustment state, a change in the upper stop and/or the stroke of the displacement means does not cause a change in the volume indicator. Such an adjustment in the adjustment state can therefore be made when an adaptation to the ambient conditions and/or to the actually dispensed pipetting volume is to be made. In the following, the adjustment and/or the adjustment state is understood to mean that the user, by setting or by changing the adjustment indicator, which can be achieved by actuating the adjusting device, can cause a change in the stroke of the displacement means, which in turn correlates to the pipetting volume. For this purpose, the user can, for example, change the adjustment value of the adjustment indicator, which in turn can lead to a change in the upper stop via the adjusting device and thus has an influence on the stroke of the displacement medium and also on the pipetting volume to be dispensed and aspirated.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In principle, it can be left to the user which degree of change of the adjustment indicator he uses. However, it is also possible to specify to the user which setting is required via the adjustment indicator for which ambient conditions and/or which fluid volumes.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Advantageously, the user can use the familiar volume adjustment mechanism with the adjusting device to change the stroke during user adjustment, which enables ergonomic and precisely metered adjustment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The invention enables convenient and safe switching from the use state to the adjustment state and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In particular, it is not necessary to change the lower stop for setting the volume indicator, so that the lower stop can be arranged in a proven and/or known manner In particular, the lower stop can be used stably in the proven direct interaction with the housing (without a threaded connection.).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In particular, the arrangement according to the invention now makes it possible in a comparatively simple manner for the user to adjust the pipetting device to the ambient conditions and/or the fluid to be pipetted before and/or after using the pipetting device, and/or to adjust and/or tune the pipetting device to this via the adjustment state.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the use state, the user can then use the pipetting device in a manner known to him, wherein the volume displayed via the volume indicator can then also correspond at least essentially to the volume actually dispensed and aspirated. A &#x201c;conversion&#x201d; of the pipetting volume displayed via the volume indicator is then not necessary. This is user-friendly and thus also reduces any sources of error that may arise and/or exist when operating the pipetting device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Ultimately, in the state of use, actuating the adjusting device causes a change in the stroke of the displacement means and a change in the volume indicator. The adjustment indicator is not changed. In the adjustment state, on the other hand, actuation, for example by an applied force, of the adjusting device causes a change in the stroke of the displacement means and a change in the adjustment indicator. However, the volume indicator is not changed in the adjustment state.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, in the use state and in the adjustment state, the adjusting device is coupled to the upper stop, whereby an actuation of the adjusting device, in particular by an applied force, causes a change in the position of the upper stop. In particular, a force exerted on the adjusting device to actuate the adjusting device is transmitted to the upper stop. The change in position of the upper stop causes a change in the stroke of the displacement means and thus in the fluid volume to be dispensed and received.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another particularly preferred embodiment of the idea of the invention, it is provided that in a calibration state the adjusting device is coupled to the volume indicator and decoupled from the upper stop and from the adjustment indicator, whereby an actuation of the adjusting device, in particular an applied force, causes a change in the volume indicator but not in the adjustment indicator and not in the position of the upper stop. Such a calibration condition can be performed at the manufacturing plant, for example, and thus can also be referred to as &#x201c;factory calibration.&#x201d; Thus, the volume indicator can be adjusted to the stroke of the displacement means. This adjustment or such possible adjustment can thus be used for &#x201c;original calibration&#x201d;. The calibration state is initially independent of the adjustment state and, in particular, is not used by the user. However, the pipetting device and/or the coupling device is designed to assume such a calibration state. Accordingly, the accuracy and the reliability of the operation of the pipetting device can be further improved and/or adapted.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, in another preferred embodiment, it is provided that the coupling device has at least one first coupling means coupled to the adjusting device, which is designed in particular as a first gear wheel. In addition, the coupling device can have a second coupling means that can be coupled to the volume indicator, which is designed in particular as a second gear wheel. Alternatively, or additionally, the coupling device can comprise a third coupling means which can be coupled to the adjustment indicator and which is preferably designed as a third gear wheel. The coupling means of the coupling device can be coupled to the respective volume indicator and adjustment indicator in the use state and in the adjustment state and thus enable an adjustment.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, the first coupling means, the second coupling means and the third coupling means are arranged to rotate about a common axis of the coupling device and to be along this common axis. Thus, the coupling means of the coupling device can be displaced, actuated and/or rotated together. In this context, it is understood that the coupling means may be formed differently with respect to each other - for example, may have a different diameter. Furthermore, the aforementioned coupling means can be arranged in such a way that, on the one hand, in the use state of the coupling device the second coupling means is coupled to the volume indicator and, on the other hand, in the adjustment state the second coupling means is decoupled from the volume indicator. On the other hand, in the adjustment state, the third coupling means may be coupled to the adjustment indicator, and in the use state, the third coupling means is not coupled to the adjustment indicator. In addition, the coupling means can be designed in such a way that the first coupling means can be coupled or is coupled to the adjustment means both in the use state and in the adjustment state.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, the coupling means may be such that in the calibration state the third coupling means is not coupled to the adjustment indicator.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, the adjustment indicator has at least one number wheel that can be rotated about a longitudinal axis of the pipetting device and displays a scale for an adjustment value of the stroke of the displacement means. The aforementioned longitudinal axis of the pipetting device, about which the number wheel is rotatable, forms in particular the axis of rotation of the number wheel. Furthermore, the aforementioned longitudinal axis of the pipetting device is arranged in particular parallel to the central axis of the pipetting device, which in particular forms an approximate axis of symmetry of the pipetting device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In particular, the number wheel of the adjustment indicator is accessible from the outside by a user and/or visible to a user. By actuating the adjusting device, in particular by turning an adjusting means of the adjusting device, the adjustment indicator and the displayed adjustment value can be adjusted in the adjustment state. Via the adjusting device, which interacts with the adjustment indicator, a change in the stroke of the displacement means, preferably by changing the position of the upper stop, can be made in the adjustment state. Furthermore, the number wheel can also have a scale so that a high degree of accuracy can be ensured when adjusting the adjustment indicator.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For adjusting the adjustment indicator, in particular rotating about the longitudinal axis of the pipetting device, by means of the adjusting device via the coupling device, the adjustment indicator can have an adjustment toothing which can be engaged and disengaged with a complementary adjustment toothing of the coupling device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, the pipetting device has an actuating element for adjusting the coupling device. Particularly preferably, the actuating element is accessible from the outside, in particular by a user of the pipetting device. For example, the actuating element can be arranged to be displaced longitudinally - i.e., in particular, to be displaced along a longitudinal axis of the pipetting device. The actuating element is designed in such a way that adjusting the coupling device by means of the actuating element enables a change between the use state and the adjustment state. Thus, the actuating element can enable a change between the use state and the adjustment state in a simple manner In particular, no further tools are required for operating the actuating element, so that in particular the actuating element can be operated without tools&#x2014;for example, by the hand of a user. Accordingly, a convenient and safe switching to the adjustment state is made possible.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the coupling device has an engagement means for changing the position of the coupling device. In particular, the engagement means is designed to allow axial displacement of the coupling device along the common axis of the coupling device. In particular, the engagement means may be movable along a longitudinal axis of the pipetting device - i.e., at least substantially in the longitudinal direction of the pipetting device. Preferably, the engagement means can be arranged in different end positions - driven by the actuating element. The engagement means can have different formations and can in particular cooperate with the second coupling means. For example, the engagement means can be designed in such a way that it engages around the second coupling means at least in certain areas.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In particular, a longitudinal displacement of the actuating element causes a longitudinal displacement of the engagement means. The actuating element can be displaced by a user from a first position, in which the coupling device causes the use state, along the longitudinal axis of the pipetting device into a second position, in which the coupling device causes the adjustment state.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The actuating element can be designed in one or more parts. It is preferred if the actuating element has a grip part that is accessible from the outside and can be gripped by a user of the pipetting device, in particular by means of at least one finger. When the user exerts a force on the grip part, the actuating element (including the grip part) can be moved, in particular shifted, so that the coupling device is adjusted. The grip part can be designed as an integral or separate part of the actuating element.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Preferably, the engagement means and the actuating element are connected to one another in a fixed manner, in particular in a rotationally fixed manner Ultimately, the engagement means enables the force applied when actuating the actuating element to be transmitted to the coupling device, in particular to the second coupling means.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a preferred embodiment, the actuating element is designed separately from the adjusting device. Provision can be made here for the engagement means and the actuating element to be designed in one piece with each other.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the actuating element is designed separately from the adjusting device and fixedly connected to the engagement means, it is preferably provided that a restoring force of a restoring means of the pipetting device, in particular the spring force of a spring, acts on the actuating element and/or the engagement means. The restoring force of the restoring means counteracts a displacement of the actuating element from the first position (use state) into the second position (adjustment state). If the user does not exert any force on the actuating element in the second position (e.g., if the user releases the actuating element), the restoring force of the restoring means causes a longitudinal displacement of the actuating means from the second position to the first position. In this case, the engagement means is displaced together and concurrently with the actuating element. In other words, the restoring means causes the coupling device to be automatically reset from the adjustment state to the use state when the actuating element is released in the adjustment state. The adjustment state is retained as long as the actuating element is held in the second position. This prevents accidental pipetting with the pipetting device in the adjustment state. This construction also enables simple, intuitive operation without tools. This saves time when using the pipetting device and improves the handling of the pipetting device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As an alternative to the previously explained embodiment, it can be provided that the spring force of a spring means of the pipetting device acts on the engagement means when moving between the first and the second position only along a section. In particular, the spring means can be arranged on the engagement means and/or on the actuating element. In particular, the spring means can enable improved force transmission from the actuating element to the engagement means. In particular, the spring means facilitates the operation of the actuating element, wherein, on the one hand, the interlocking of the corresponding coupling means is enabled and, on the other hand, the adjustment state can thus be assumed only temporarily. In this embodiment, too, the state of use is &#x201c;automatically&#x201d; assumed by the spring means after the load has ceased.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a further embodiment, the adjusting device comprises the actuating element, in particular an adjustment sleeve of the adjusting device can form the actuating element. This embodiment represents in particular an alternative to the previously described embodiment with an actuating element separate from the adjusting device. In this further embodiment, the adjustment sleeve (and thus the actuating element) is designed to change the stroke of the displacement means and to change the volume indicator and is designed to be rotatable about a longitudinal axis of the pipetting device for this purpose. As an actuating element, the adjustment sleeve is also designed for adjusting the coupling device to the use state and/or adjustment state and is movable along the longitudinal axis of the pipetting device for this purpose. The movement of the adjustment sleeve can be initiated in particular by an external intervention, preferably by a user of the pipetting device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably, the adjustment sleeve and the engagement means are rotatably mounted relative to each other and/or longitudinally displaceably connected.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a further preferred embodiment, it is provided that the adjustment sleeve can be releasably fixed in various positions by a holding device of the pipetting device, which can also facilitate operation. By fixing the adjustment sleeve by means of the holding device, an undesired release of the adjustment sleeve as an actuating element and thus an undesired switching into a possible state (either use or adjustment state) can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a particularly preferred embodiment, which is especially advantageous in the one-piece design of the externally accessible actuating element and the engagement means, it is provided that for coupling the engagement means to the adjusting device, the engagement means has a coupling element and the adjusting device has a counter-coupling element. In particular, the coupling element and the counter-coupling element are designed in such a way that, during the transition from the use state to the adjustment state and/or from the adjustment state to the use state, a rotational movement of the adjusting device, in particular of the adjustment sleeve of the adjusting device, can be blocked. In this context, it can be provided that a blocking of the rotary movement is provided in such a way that a rotation of the adjusting device, in particular of the adjustment sleeve, is only made possible again in the adjustment state. Thus, the adjusting device can be blocked during the transition and/or switching from the use state to the adjustment state and/or from the adjustment state to the use state. Thus, unintentional rotational movements, which in particular cause an undesired meshing of the gears forming in particular a transmission, can be avoided. For example, it can be prevented that&#x2014;undesirably&#x2014;a toothing of the adjusting device gets caught and/or jammed with the first coupling element.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the use state, the adjustment indicator is decoupled from the adjusting device and is not engaged with the coupling device. In this use state, adjustment of the adjustment indicator is to be avoided. According to a preferred embodiment, it is provided that the adjustment indicator is fixed in the use state, in particular secured against rotation about the longitudinal axis of the pipetting device. Preferably, the adjustment indicator is fixed in place by means of a locking toothing of the adjustment indicator and a complementary locking toothing on the actuating element. The actuating element is non-rotatable in relation to the longitudinal axis of the pipetting device and cannot be rotated in the circumferential direction. By actuating the actuating element, the locking toothing of the actuating element and the locking toothing of the adjustment indicator can be engaged and disengaged. In the use state, the locking toothing of the actuating element is in engagement with the locking toothing of the adjustment indicator. In this use state, this engagement prevents the adjustment indicator from being adjusted, in particular from being rotated. If the actuating element is switched from the use state to the adjustment state by actuating, in particular by moving it, the locking toothing of the actuating element and the locking toothing of the adjustment indicator are disengaged. In the adjustment state, the adjustment indicator is adjustable, in particular rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the pipetting device. Greater precision is advantageous here, since accidental adjustment of the adjustment indicator is not possible.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Another aspect that can also be implemented independently of the pipetting device explained above relates to a pipetting device for handling liquid involves the pipetting device having a displacement device, a drive device and an adjustment indicator.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The displacement device has a displacement means, in particular a piston, and a displacement housing, in particular a cylinder. In particular, the displacement device is designed as a piston-cylinder arrangement.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The drive device is designed to move the displacement means in the v housing, with a movement of the displacement means being limited by an upper stop, a lower stop and at least one counter-stop of the drive device and/or the displacement means, so that a stroke of the displacement means is defined.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The adjustment indicator is designed to display and/or specify or set an adjustment value for the stroke of the displacement means. Such an adjustment value results from the stroke and the pipetting volume being adjusted in such a way that the volume indicator can reference the pipetting volume that is actually or at least essentially actually dispensed. The adjustment value specifies the extent to which any deviations are to be taken into account.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an adjustment state of the pipetting device, the stroke of the displacement means is adjustable and the adjustment indicator is adjustable, in particular rotatable about a longitudinal axis of the pipetting device. In a use state of the pipetting device, the stroke of the displacement means is adjustable and the adjustment indicator is fixed, in particular secured against rotation about the longitudinal axis of the pipetting device.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The pipetting device preferably has an actuating element, which is preferably accessible from the outside, for transferring the pipetting device from the use state to the adjustment state and vice versa. The actuating element can be moved along the longitudinal axis of the pipetting device to transfer the pipetting device from the use state to the adjusting state and vice versa. In relation to the longitudinal axis of the pipetting device, the actuating element is designed to be non-rotatable. The adjustment indicator has a locking toothing and the actuating element has locking toothing complementary thereto. By moving the actuating element along the longitudinal axis of the pipetting device, the locking toothing of the actuating element and the locking toothing of the adjustment indicator can be engaged and disengaged. In the use state, the locking toothing of the actuating element is in engagement with the locking toothing of the adjustment indicator. In the adjustment state, the locking toothing of the actuating element is disengaged from the locking toothing of the adjustment indicator.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The aforementioned aspects and features of the present invention, as well as the aspects and features of the present invention resulting from the further description, can be realized independently of each other, but also in any

prior art pipetting device <b>1</b> for aspirating and dispensing fluid volumes. The pipetting device <b>1</b> is held and guided at its housing <b>1</b>A by hand or by a robot. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic section through the pipetting device <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with a pipette tip <b>1</b>B attached to it.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the following, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, features are explained which are designed in the same way in the pipetting device <b>1</b> of the prior art as in a pipetting device <b>1</b> according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A pipetting device <b>1</b> according to the invention (as well as the pipetting device <b>1</b> of the prior art) has a displacement device <b>2</b>. For the mode of operation of the displacement device <b>2</b>, reference may be made to the sectional view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the mode of operation of which can also be transferred to the embodiments according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">By means of the displacement device <b>2</b>, a fluid, in particular a liquid, can be taken up into the pipette tip <b>1</b>B and subsequently dispensed from it. The displacement device <b>2</b> has a displacement means <b>3</b> and a displacement housing <b>4</b>. In the illustrated and preferred embodiment example, the displacement device <b>2</b> is designed as a piston-cylinder arrangement, so that the displacement means <b>3</b> is designed as a piston and the displacement housing <b>4</b> is designed as a cylinder.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The pipetting device <b>1</b> and/or the displacement device <b>2</b> preferably has an elongated shape and/or has a longitudinal axis L. The longitudinal axis L preferably runs centrally through the displacement device <b>2</b>, in particular the displacement means <b>3</b> and the displacement housing <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">When terms such as &#x201c;axial&#x201d;, &#x201c;axial direction&#x201d; and the like are used in the following, this refers to the longitudinal axis L. Correspondingly, terms such as &#x201c;radial&#x201d;, &#x201c;radial direction&#x201d; and the like also refer to the longitudinal axis L and indicate a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis L. When terms such as &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and the like are used in the following, this refers to the extension of the longitudinal axis L.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The displacement housing <b>4</b> forms a cavity which is open towards the pipette tip <b>1</b>B and is otherwise gas-tight. The displacement means <b>3</b> is preferably movable axially and/or along the longitudinal axis L and with respect to the cavity. By means of the displacement means <b>3</b>, the volume of the cavity can be varied so that fluid, in particular air, can be drawn into the cavity when the cavity is enlarged due to the resulting negative pressure and can be dispensed again and/or displaced from the cavity when the volume is reduced. The displacement means <b>3</b> is preferably sealed against the displacement housing <b>4</b>, in particular by means of a seal.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The displacement device <b>2</b> preferably has a return means <b>32</b>, in particular a return spring. By means of the return means <b>32</b>, the displacement means <b>3</b> can be moved into an initial position, in particular into the position with maximum volume of the cavity, which corresponds to the suction direction of the fluid and/or the direction against the discharge direction of the fluid.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The displacement housing <b>4</b> preferably has and/or forms a shaft <b>30</b> of the pipetting device <b>1</b>. The shaft <b>30</b> is used for detachably attaching the pipette tip <b>1</b>B and has an opening <b>25</b> that connects the displacement housing <b>4</b> to the pipette tip <b>1</b>B, as explained above.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A pipette tip <b>1</b>B is a substantially conical tube with two opposing openings, each of which has a different cross-section. With the larger opening, the pipette tip <b>1</b>B can be fitted onto the shaft <b>30</b> and forms a gas-tight connection. Liquid can then be drawn into the pipette tip <b>1</b>B through the variable cavity and subsequently dispensed.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The pipetting device <b>1</b> has a drive device <b>5</b> for moving the displacement means <b>3</b> in the displacement housing <b>4</b>. The drive device <b>5</b> has a drive rod <b>31</b>. The drive rod <b>31</b> may extend axially and/or along the longitudinal axis L. The drive rod <b>31</b> is preferably movable in the axial direction and/or at least substantially parallel to the displacement means <b>3</b>. The drive device <b>5</b> preferably comprises an operating element <b>24</b>. In particular, the drive device <b>5</b> can be actuated via the operating element <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Actuating the operating element <b>24</b>, in particular pressing it down, causes the drive rod <b>31</b> to be pressed against the displacement means <b>3</b>, so that the displacement means <b>3</b> moves into the displacement housing <b>4</b> and reduces the volume of the cavity. Accordingly, fluid can be dispensed from the pipetting device <b>1</b>, in particular via the shaft <b>30</b> and the pipette tip <b>1</b>B, by actuating the drive device <b>5</b> and/or the operating element <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Unactuated, the displacement means <b>3</b> and the drive device <b>5</b> and/or the drive rod <b>31</b> and/or the operating element <b>24</b> automatically assume the initial position, in particular by means of the return by the return means <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Alternatively, or in addition to the operating element <b>24</b>, automated and/or motorized operation of the displacement device <b>2</b> is also possible.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Preferably, a movement of the displacement means <b>3</b> is limited by an upper stop <b>6</b>, a lower stop <b>7</b> and at least one counter stop <b>8</b> of the drive device <b>5</b> and/or the displacement means <b>3</b>, so that a stroke of the displacement means <b>3</b> is defined. Preferably, the stroke of the drive device <b>5</b> and/or the drive rod <b>31</b> and/or the displacement means <b>3</b> can be changed by the upper stop <b>6</b> and/or the lower stop <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The counter stop <b>8</b> can in particular be formed as a stop section of the drive rod <b>31</b>. In particular, the counter stop <b>8</b> is formed integrally with the drive rod <b>31</b> and/or extends from the drive rod <b>31</b> in the radial direction and/or is flange-like.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">When the pipetting device <b>1</b>, displacement device <b>2</b>, drive device <b>5</b> and/or operating element <b>24</b> is actuated, in particular when the drive rod <b>31</b> is moved in the axial direction, the counter stop <b>8</b> preferably strikes the lower stop <b>7</b>, which limits the axial movement and/or stroke movement.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">When resetting the displacement device <b>2</b> and/or the drive device <b>5</b>, in particular by means of the return means <b>32</b>, there is preferably a stop between the counter stop <b>8</b> and the upper stop <b>6</b> in the intake direction, which limits the axial movement or stroke movement.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">When the counter stop <b>8</b> stops against the upper stop <b>6</b>, the unactuated state is preferably reached and/or the volume in the cavity is at a maximum. In particular, the maximum fluid volume that can be accommodated is determined by the position of the upper stop <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Preferably, the axial position of the upper stop <b>6</b> is adjustable so that the maximum fluid volume that can be accommodated or the volume of the cavity can be adjusted. For this purpose, the pipetting device <b>1</b> and/or the drive device <b>5</b> has an adjusting device <b>10</b>. The adjusting device <b>10</b> can have an adjusting means <b>23</b>. Preferably, a threaded connection is formed between the adjusting means <b>23</b> and the upper stop <b>6</b> and/or the adjusting means <b>23</b> has an internal thread and the upper stop <b>6</b> has a corresponding external thread. The threaded connection can be used to adjust the axial position of the upper stop <b>6</b> and thus the maximum volume that can be accommodated.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In addition to the adjusting means <b>23</b>, the adjusting device <b>10</b> can have an adjustment sleeve <b>27</b> operatively connected to the adjusting means <b>23</b>. Thus, the axial position of the upper stop <b>6</b> can also be adjusted by means of the adjustment sleeve <b>27</b>, in particular by turning the adjustment sleeve <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The pipetting device <b>1</b> includes a volume indicator <b>9</b> disposed in the housing <b>1</b>A. The volume indicator <b>9</b> may include a plurality of volume indicator wheels <b>29</b> (number wheels) for indicating a volume value through an opening or window in the housing <b>1</b>A. The volume indicator <b>9</b> is driven by the adjusting device <b>10</b> and/or the adjusting means <b>23</b> and is configured to display a pipetting volume associated with and/or correlated to the stroke of the displacement means <b>3</b>.

The actuating element <b>16</b> is arranged to be longitudinally displaceable, that is to say displaceable along the longitudinal axis L of the pipetting device <b>1</b>. The actuating element <b>16</b> is designed in such a way that the adjustment of the coupling device <b>10</b> by means of the actuating element <b>16</b> enables a change between the use state and the adjustment state.

The pipetting device <b>1</b> is shown here in the use state. In this use state, the adjustment indicator <b>11</b> is decoupled from the adjusting device <b>10</b> and is not engaged with the coupling device <b>12</b>.
