No. 17/367,111 filed on Jul. 2, 2021, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to navigation and action systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Users of software interfaces are increasingly in need of a user experience framework that provides faster navigation and contextual tools.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates to navigation and action systems for flattening deep information hierarchies and contextualizing actions within a multi-product platform, where &#x201c;flattening&#x201d; may be defined as making multiple levels of information accessible in one layer and broadening a user's breadth of control.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The user experience framework (UX framework) disclosed may contain one or more of the swapper interface, the action bar, and the toolkit components. These components work in coordination to facilitate workflows across multiple contexts and levels of object hierarchy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure, the swapper interface may serve as an omnipresent waypoint that allows the user to select an option for one layer. The swapper interface then guides the user to the options they are most likely to choose for subsequent layers. Users may also swiftly swap between multiple layer contexts without having to re-traverse a navigation tree. The swapper interface takes two levels of object hierarchy and transforms them into a workflow context rather than a hierarchy, allowing a sequence of like-operations across multiple contexts to be done efficiently. In some embodiments, the swapper interface enables bypassing of object (e.g., communicator hub) and/or data (e.g., target communicator) hierarchies.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure, the action bar makes thousands of features easy to discover and use. The action bar floats above the pages, showcasing the buttons that trigger features the page supports. In this context, the term &#x201c;button&#x201d; may be used in reference to an option. The action bar may personalize the button layout for individual pages-grouping like-buttons together, sorting high usage and important features to the left, importing features from other platform pages when they support a broader workflow, and showing or hiding functionality as dictated by the user's roles and permissions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The action bar has access to features across an entire product suite and is populated by the user's context. The action bar acts like a complete content management system, polling the user's roles, the object hierarchy context, the page content, and complementary product features simultaneously to populate the action bar with features and buttons. The action bar shows the user what is important, rather than just what is in focus. The action bar buttons can change state depending on what is selected in the workspace, but each page's action bar may show the full set of features and their associated buttons visible to support the user's feature discovery experience. Whenever the user begins new workflows that require additional features, they may be redirected to new workspaces with their associated action bars in new core or contextual tabs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The action bar may also contain a navigation panel that allows users to switch between platform sections that support specific workflows. Each section may contain multiple pages in core tabs for secondary navigation. Each core tab may open child pages in contextual tabs. Each contextual tab may open its own child pages or sibling pages to support the user's workflow. Contextual tabs may be opened side-by-side with core tabs, resulting in the display of parent, child, sibling, and grandchild pages within one level of visual hierarchy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The toolkit is both the user's backpack, filled with useful multitools, and a second pair of hands that can wield said tools. The toolkit parses and displays insights, actions, and shortcuts based on the current page's content, the user's role, and the communicator hub or target communicator whom they are working for. The user may choose to change the toolkit's context to contrast, compare, and cross-reference either (1) the same objects, insights, and associated actions for a different target communicators, or (2) different objects, insights, and associated actions for the same target communicator.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some UX framework components may be hidden so that the user can focus on their content. The framework can be shifted between different modes: the standard execution mode, a presentation mode for collaboration and review, an education mode, and a recommendation mode to guide users through tactic optimizations.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The UX framework is scalable and consistent. It supports pages built in multiple disparate web technologies, where web technologies are defined as various tools and techniques that are used in the process of communication between different types of devices over the internet. The UX framework can accommodate a dramatic expansion of user types, permissions, and roles. It can also route users to the appropriate section of the platform on login based on their organizational responsibilities.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The disclosure is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements.

to navigation and action systems for flattening deep information hierarchies and contextualizing actions within a multi-product platform, where &#x201c;flattening&#x201d; may be defined as making multiple levels of information accessible in one layer and broadening a user's breadth of control.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The figures and descriptions provided herein may have been simplified to illustrate aspects that are relevant for a clear understanding of the herein described devices, systems, and methods, while eliminating, for the purpose of clarity, other aspects that may be found in typical similar devices, systems, and methods. Those of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that other elements and/or operations may be desirable and/or necessary to implement the devices, systems, and methods described herein. But because such elements and operations are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the present disclosure, a discussion of such elements and operations may not be provided herein. However, the present disclosure is deemed to inherently include all such elements, variations, and modifications to the described aspects that would be known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. For example, as used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having,&#x201d; are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although the terms first, second, third, etc., may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. That is, terms such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and other numerical terms, when used herein, do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The UX framework disclosed may be designed for use with desktop computers, laptop computers, mobile devices, or any other device capable of receiving and transmitting information through a user interface. The term &#x201c;button&#x201d; as used herein to refers to an option.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The UX framework may be used to optimize targeted communications, particularly by &#x201c;communicator hubs&#x201d; that are responsible for managing many streams of targeted communications. The term &#x201c;targeted communications&#x201d; may, in some embodiments, include bids, advertisements, or messages. Communicator hubs may be responsible for operating digital campaigns on behalf of multiple &#x201c;target communicators.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;campaign&#x201d; may refer to strategies for managing the dispersal of targeted communications to achieve a desired objective. Examples of target communicators may include advertisers, news agencies, or any person or entity that sends out targeted communications. In order to operate digital campaigns, communicator hubs may engage digital campaign experts or &#x201c;managing users&#x201d;. Target communicators share their objectives with communicator hubs. Managing users translate objectives into multiple, executable campaigns. Each campaign is composed of multiple strategies, or &#x201c;groups&#x201d;. Groups attempt to find, test, and scale ways to meet the objectives over a set period of time. Each group is composed of targeting rails and optimization rails. Targeting rails provide the target communicator with data concerning how, where, and to whom the targeted communications are being transmitted. Optimization rails allow the target communicator to establish parameters for making campaign management decisions and optimizing campaign success.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The contextual navigation and action UX framework achieves an efficient user experience that creates a dialog with the user in part by making deep information hierarchies accessible in one layer and personalizing each page in a multi-product platform based on the user's role, the user's workflows, the object, and target communicator context.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The UX framework takes an information hierarchy (IA) with multiple (e.g., seven) levels of navigation, which requires multiple screens and browser windows to use successfully, and transforms it into a flattened IA that is multiple (e.g., two) levels deep, can be used in a single browser window, and guides users to successfully complete their targeted communication workflows.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The UX framework acts as a personalized content management system, morphing the features and tools displayed to the user based on the user's roles, the objects they are working on, and the target communicators the user is working for.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the UX framework has a visible navigation system in which users do not need to lose their page and re-traverse a navigation tree to change their location in the hierarchy. In some embodiments, the UX framework makes the breadth of objects and features available and discoverable across multiple pages. In some embodiments, the UX framework is organized such that each product in the suite is a click away rather than hidden as a separate website or application.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Since managing users may work with multiple target communicators at a time, in some embodiments, the UX framework brings to attention insights, warnings, notifications, and status changes based on the target communicators' unique goals wherever the managing user is in the platform. For example, if a managing user is working on object B, under target communicator B, the UX framework will bring to attention insights about object A, under target communicator A when it is pertinent.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the UX framework may also load pages written in disparate web technologies within one unified framework, where web technologies are defined as various tools and techniques that are used in the process of communication between different types of devices over the internet and unified framework is defined as an integrated system of processing information derived from such disparate web technologies and presenting that information in a uniform format.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The UX framework may comprise one or more unique features, including the swapper interface, the action bar, and the toolkit.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">System Environment</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a high level system <b>100</b> for managing targeted communication campaigns using multiple user interfaces.

The swapper interface at once narrows the view to the specific communicator hub and/or target communicator(s) that the managing user wants to work with, but also broadens the view in that within that communicator hub/target communicator selection, a broad range of pages and analyses related to those communicator hub/target communicator designation are readily available.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the swapper interface may be composed of three panes: a list of communicator hubs, from which the managing user can choose to swap the page to filter on the communicator hub of interest; lists of target communicators in user-directed or situationally-dependent smart categories <b>111</b>, from which the managing user can choose to open a subset of a communicator hub's target communicators; and a list of target communicators, from which the managing user can choose to swap the page to filter on a specific communicator hub. When the managing user clicks on a communicator hub, a category may be auto-selected so that the managing user can immediately click on a target communicator. Managing user may select a communicator hub and target communicator to allow for seamless navigation through workflow.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the target communicator groups allow the managing user to see or select from subgroups of target communicators. These user-directed or situationally-dependent smart categories <b>111</b> direct managing user to pages of particular interest. Some smart categories <b>111</b> may be based on user-directed preferences, such as favorites <b>302</b> or recently visited <b>303</b>. Other categories may be based on situational grouping to help bring attention to pages of particular interest and to help manage and plan workflow. For example, one smart category <b>111</b> can provide a list of target communicators with campaigns that are forecasted to not meet their goals <b>301</b> or those with live campaigns <b>304</b>. This brings attention to pages that managing user may want to prioritize.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The swapper interface allows a managing user to navigate between multiple target communicators without backtracking. Rather than having a managing user view a particular page for a particular target communicator and then navigate a vertical tree in order to view the same page for a different target communicator, the swapper interface allows for one-click navigation that bypasses the need for vertical navigation so that a managing user can go directly from viewing a particular page for a particular target communicator to the same page for a different target communicator. In some embodiments, a communicator hub and a target communicator may continue to be selected so that the managing user is not interrupted with navigation hierarchy traversal while moving between different tasks and switching between sections and pages in the sitemap. In some embodiments, the selected target communicator is prominently displayed so that the managing user knows which target communicator is selected at any given time.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some embodiments and in some cases, some pages may not support the current managing user view selection. This may occur when the managing user opens a page and the swapper interface runs into a communicator hub or target communicator selection exception. For managing users with access to communicator hub- and target communicator-level views, switching from a page that shows target communicator-level details to a page that shows communicator hub-level details does not require extra navigation. The swapper interface may seamlessly and automatically swap from target communicator to communicator hub view to allow the managing user to view the desired page without consciously navigating away from the target communicator view. The automatic swapper interface function may also swap back from communicator hub view to target communicator view when managing user navigates to a page that is available for target communicator-level view.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the swapper interface may be part of the sticky page header and cannot be hidden. In this embodiment, unless an exception has been made, the swapper may appear at the top of every page and may be consistently visible regardless of how far down a page the managing user scrolls. In other embodiments, the swapper interface scrolls to the current selection when opened. In yet other embodiments, any change in the swapper interface is animated. In some embodiments, an opened swapper interface is closed by selecting a different area of the page or by selecting ESC. In other embodiments, the swapper communicator hub and target communicator list support pagination.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, unless an exception has been made, the pages can be filtered to a single target communicator, or multiple target communicators under a single communicator hub.

In this case, the communicator hub or target communicator may be injected to the top of the paginated list and scroll-to-position of the amended list. Note that the injected communicator hub or target communicator may also appear in the page of the communicator hub or target communicator list.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, the communicator hub list shows communicator hubs the managing user has access to, grouped by the communicator hub group. The communicator hub list may be shown if the managing user has access to more than one communicator hub. In some embodiments, pages that have the ability to show content for target communicators the managing user has access to under a specific communicator hub may include inventory pages, reports, location, templates, home, and target communicator groups.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in some embodiments, badges <b>112</b> route the managing user's attention to communicator hubs, target communicator groups, and ultimately target communicators that may need to be prioritized, for example, those with campaigns that are forecasted to not meet their goals. A target communicator's badge <b>112</b> may show a total count of campaigns that are forecasted to not meet their goals. The target communicator groups and communicator hubs may be badged to show they contain badged target communicators.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, a universal search can return communicator hubs and target communicators as search results. Clicking a communicator hub in a universal search may return the most recently viewed target communicator for that communicator hub.

Contextual tabs <b>702</b> may be offered upon selection of core tabs. Contextual tabs <b>702</b> obviate the need to engage in excessive navigation by providing relevant tabs based on user input and remembering those tabs for easier horizontal navigation and cross-referencing. These tabs may be present based on what has been selected, giving easy access to relevant pages. Choosing a particular page may automatically populate related tabs that may be of interest to User while viewing the chosen page. Having the contextual tabs <b>702</b> allows the managing user to easily navigate without having to backtrack, improving the cross reference interface. Rather than having to navigate vertically, contextual tabs <b>702</b> allow the managing user to come back to recently used pages without consciously creating new tabs. This is particularly useful for managing users who cross-reference frequently and need to cycle through several pages repeatedly.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> also shows that in some embodiments, core tabs <b>701</b> are used to house the first level of navigation within a platform section. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, core tabs <b>701</b> may include all &#x201c;All Campaigns,&#x201d; &#x201c;Creatives,&#x201d; &#x201c;Locations,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Groups.&#x201d; Unlike contextual tabs <b>702</b>, core tabs <b>701</b> may be consistently visible to the managing user. Core tabs <b>701</b> may be used to store the dashboards, list views, and information hubs that correspond to a starting point to discrete managing user workflows. Platform sections that have core tabs <b>701</b> may have a distinct set of core tabs <b>701</b>, but not every platform section may have core tabs <b>701</b>. A core tab <b>702</b> may appear in one section of the platform. Core tab titles may support localization. Core tabs <b>701</b> may be tied to roles and permissions. Some managing users may have a subset of core tabs <b>701</b> available to them. The set of core tabs <b>701</b> displayed within a platform section may not change. Navigating between a section's core <b>701</b> or contextual <b>702</b> tabs might not introduce or remove any core tabs <b>701</b>. When the managing user navigates to a platform section, the first core tab <b>701</b> may be automatically selected. Core tabs <b>701</b> can have the following states: Selected, on hover, or not selected.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> further illustrates, in some embodiments, contextual tabs <b>702</b> are used to house the detail pages for existing objects, enabling managing users to review an object's state and modify its configuration. Contextual tabs <b>702</b> reduce the friction of navigating the breadth of the platform by flattening an otherwise deeply nested page hierarchy. In some embodiments, contextual tabs <b>702</b> can open contextual tab siblings <b>703</b>. Contextual tab siblings <b>703</b> contain insights that can be easily cross-referenced by toggling between the object details and the object insights. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a contextual tab may be a &#x201c;Campaign&#x201d; tab, that could, in turn, open a related &#x201c;Campaign Insights&#x201d; contextual tab sibling. Contextual tab siblings <b>703</b> may be optional and may be used by a minority of contextual tabs <b>702</b>. In other embodiments, contextual tabs <b>702</b> may open child contextual tabs <b>704</b>. Detail pages that themselves include an object list, such as a campaign which lists groups, may open up a child contextual tab <b>704</b> to display the child object's details. In some embodiments, child contextual tabs <b>704</b> may not open their own child contextual tabs <b>704</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, contextual tabs <b>702</b> remain open in each section throughout a managing user's session so that the managing user can quickly get back to their most recently opened objects. Some embodiments keep scroll positions when the managing user switches back and forth between tabs in a contextual tab set. Some embodiments allow the managing user to switch between platform sections and pages in a contextual tab set without a refresh. Some embodiments return the managing user to their most recently opened tab instead of the section landing page tab when switching between platform sections. In some embodiments, only one set of contextual tabs <b>702</b> can be opened in each platform section at a time. A contextual tab set is the group of contextual tabs <b>702</b>, contextual tab siblings <b>703</b>, and child contextual tabs that are related to one object. If the managing user selects on an object that will open a contextual tab set, the action bar may close and replace any contextual tab set that is already opened in the platform section. When a contextual tab <b>702</b> is selected by selecting a button or object in a core tab <b>701</b>, the contextual tab <b>702</b> may be automatically selected and its parent core tab <b>701</b> deselected. A child contextual tab <b>704</b> may be opened by selecting a button or object in a contextual tab <b>702</b>. The child contextual tab <b>704</b> may be automatically selected and the parent contextual tab <b>702</b> deselected. If a contextual tab <b>702</b> is associated with a sibling insights tab, the contextual tab sibling <b>703</b> may be automatically opened when the contextual tab <b>702</b> is opened.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments, a contextual tab set may remain opened for the duration of a managing user's session so that the managing user can easily get back to their most recently viewed object, especially when their workflow takes them across multiple platform sections, contextual tabs <b>702</b> may remain open even when the managing user switches between core tabs <b>701</b> in the same platform section or switches between platform sections in the navigation panel <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some embodiments, contextual tabs <b>702</b> cannot be manually closed, but are automatically closed when a managing user opens a new contextual tab <b>702</b> at the same level in the hierarchy; opens a new contextual tab <b>702</b> within the one section, thereby closing and replacing the opened contextual tab <b>702</b>, its children <b>704</b>, and its siblings <b>703</b>; or opens up a new child contextual tab <b>704</b>, thereby closing and replacing the opened child contextual tab <b>704</b> and sibling <b>703</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some embodiments, the swapper interface <b>300</b> selection can be changed through manual managing user manipulation by going to a URL or opening up the swapper. Auto-swapping may not close contextual tabs <b>702</b>. If the swapper is automatically changed when navigating away to another section of the navigation panel <b>710</b>, the contextual tabs <b>702</b> for one section might not close when a second section is opened, even if there is a page exception and the swapper auto-swaps to the communicator hub. When the managing user returns to the first section and the swapper auto-swaps to the previously selected target communicator, the previous contextual tabs <b>702</b> may still be relevant.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">If the browser window is too small to show all core <b>701</b> and contextual <b>702</b> tabs in a section, the core tabs <b>701</b> may be collapsed into an overflow pattern, but in many embodiments, the contextual tabs <b>702</b> are not collapsed. In an extreme scenario, all core tabs <b>701</b> may be collapsed, and the contextual tabs <b>702</b> may force the page frame to scroll horizontally. In some embodiments, the action bar options associated with a contextual tab may be distinct from those of its parent, child, or sibling tabs. The contextual tab name may be a link. The managing user may be able to click the link to copy it or open it up in a new browser window or tab.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, navigation within tabs allows the managing user to cycle through pages without opening multiple tabs. Rather than opening multiple tabs, the managing user may use horizontal navigation buttons <b>801</b> such as &#x201c;Next&#x201d; and &#x201c;Prev.&#x201d; within the tabs to navigate horizontally through relevant pages.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some embodiments, badges <b>112</b> may appear on buttons. Badges <b>112</b> may be added to the buttons to alert the managing user of tabs or actions that need attention based on situational parameters. These badges may include &#x201c;New&#x201d; for a new feature, &#x201c;Beta&#x201d; for a beta feature, and &#x201c;AI&#x201d; for a button associated with an Artificial Intelligence-based &#x201c;AI&#x201d; recommendation. This AI recommendation is based on data analysis of audience activity as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and uses data fluctuations and user-directed campaign adjustments over time to provide recommendations intended to optimize campaigns and improve performance.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the action bar may be expanded and collapsed through the use of a minimization chevron <b>901</b>. The action bar may be collapsed when not needed so the managing user can view expand the field of view of the page and not be distracted. In some embodiments, if the managing user collapses the action bar, the action bar may remain collapsed as the managing user switches pages for the duration of the managing user's session. When the managing user starts a new session, the action bar may return to its expanded default state. In some embodiments, pinned buttons are never collapsed. If, even after button groups are collapsed, there is not enough space to display all the buttons, button groups and stand-alone buttons may be collapsed into an overflow &#x201c;More&#x201d; drop down button in reverse rank order. Stand-alone buttons may be collapsed into menu items. Button groups may be flattened into menu items with a button group label identifying the group.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, every feature and system action that the page supports has a corresponding button within the action bar. For example, action bar buttons may initiate edits, launch campaigns, open modes, and navigate to new pages. Buttons may also favorite or unfavorite a target communicator selected in the swapper interface. The interface may show visual feedback on whether the target communicator is a favorite.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, actions may launch discrete, focused experiences. Instead of launching a sequence of dialog boxes that lead the user through a series of well-defined steps or &#x201c;wizard,&#x201d; they may launch an experience that could be a small part of a wizard, comprising limited steps. In some edge case scenarios, some modes and features may be initiated with inline page elements. Examples may include doing an inline search on a table, changing table filters, or opening a visualization's detail mode where a forecast may be modified.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, the order, grouping and sizing of the action bar buttons are intentional. Buttons that work together may be grouped together. Buttons that are more important may be larger. Buttons that are more important (by frequency of usage or how much adoption should be driven) may be closer to the one side of the action bar.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In various possible embodiments, button states may be active, on hover, on press, or disabled. Disabled buttons may look active, but show a disabled message on click that shows what the managing user has to do to make the button active. Button types may include simple button, toggle, and drop down. Button sizes may include large and small. In some embodiments, buttons may be pinned to the right-hand side of the action bar. These buttons may include status toggles, activity log, inventory pins, and plan pins. A button may consist of an image, label, tooltip, and action.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In some embodiments, no more than one action bar may appear per page. In other embodiments, action bars may be consistently visible as part of a sticky platform header. In some embodiments, unless it is specified otherwise, actions that initiate edits, open contextual tabs, or open modals are initiated through the action bar.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, each page declares all its available buttons to the action bar on page load. In this embodiment, the list of buttons should not expand or decrease based on the managing user's interaction with the pages content. All features may be discoverable through the action bar. Moving between pages refreshes the action bar with buttons relevant to that page.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In other embodiments, the action bar only displays the buttons associated with features the managing user has permission to use while the other buttons are hidden. Action bar buttons may also obey the managing user's roles and permissions. Read only pages may not have an action bar. Inactive buttons may remain inactive until content is selected.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In yet another embodiment, if all action bar buttons and groups are hidden, the action bar is completely hidden from the managing user. This can occur in some scenarios where the managing user only has read-only permissions. If all buttons in a button group are hidden, the button group is hidden as well.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some embodiments, if a simple button or toggle is associated with an AI-based recommendation, it may be transformed into a drop-down button. The drop down lists menu items describing the AI recommendations followed by a menu item to initiate the button's original functionality. Menu buttons with AI recommendations may have items added to the top of the menu describing the AI recommendations. Clicking the AI recommendation menu item opens the AI modal where the recommendation can be understood and applied.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Toolkit</heading><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The toolkit allows a managing user to seamlessly navigate horizontally and perform the same tasks for different clients. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>20</b></figref> depict the toolkit on the right side of the interface, but this in no way limits the location of the toolkit.
