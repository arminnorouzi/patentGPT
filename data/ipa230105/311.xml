More particularly, in some embodiments, the disclosure relates to using one or more actuators to control an articulation of an endoscope and/or medical instruments independent of, or associated with, the endoscope.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Scopes may be used for accessing target sites within a body, and one or more medical tools may be advanced through one or more lumens of a scope, and the scope and/or the medical tools may be articulated to gain access to, diagnose, or treat the target site. Handles may include one or more articulation mechanisms, e.g., knobs or the like, which may be connected to actuation wires. Actuation of the articulation mechanisms by a user may cause articulation of a portion of the scope and/or the medical tools. Drawbacks of these endoscopic systems include, for example, increased tension felt by the user as an articulation mechanism is rotated to cause a maximum bend in the articulation member. For example, as the articulation mechanism is rotated, an actuation wire connected to the articulation member winds around the articulation mechanism and/or a member attached to the articulation mechanism (e.g., a cam), increasing the tension felt by the user. This increased tension may cause hand fatigue, which may create difficulties in performing therapies. Furthermore, the design of conventional articulation mechanisms may change articulation response of the scope and/or the medical tools as the articulation mechanism is rotated. This may decrease responsiveness of the articulation joint as an angle of the articulation joint relative to a longitudinal axis of the scope increases. This disclosure may solve one or more of these problems or other problems in the art. The scope of the disclosure, however, is defined by the attached claims and not the ability to solve a specific problem.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p

rotatably connected to the handle, wherein the cam includes a first section and a second section defining a path of travel for an actuation wire, and wherein a radially outer surface of the first section has a first radius of curvature, and a radially outer surface of the second section has a second radius of curvature different from the first radius of curvature, and wherein actuation of the actuating device causes the actuation wire to wrap around the radially outer surfaces of the first and second sections, causing the shaft to bend.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The path may further include a third section extending from the second section, and wherein the first section, the second section, and the third section may form a continuous path.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The cam may

Additionally, terms that indicate the geometric shape of a component/surface refer to exact and approximate shapes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a medical system <b>10</b> according to an embodiment is shown. Medical system <b>10</b> may include a handle <b>20</b>, a shaft <b>30</b> (e.g., a catheter, a sheath, etc.) extending from a distal end of handle <b>20</b>, and a distal tip <b>40</b> at a distal end of shaft <b>30</b>. Handle <b>20</b> may include a plurality of ports <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> which may be fluidly connected to one or more lumens (not shown) extending from a proximal end of shaft <b>30</b> and which may terminate at one or more openings (not shown) in distal tip <b>40</b>. Medical tools may be introduced through one or more ports <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and may be exposed from an opening (not shown) in shaft <b>30</b> and/or distal tip <b>40</b> to perform one or more therapies on a target tissue. Alternatively, or additionally, a suction and/or a fluid source may be attached to one or more ports <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to remove tissue or other objects via suction and/or to introduce a fluid to the target site. Alternatively, or additionally, one or more ports <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may be attached to a display or control device via an umbilicus (not shown). The umbilicus may include one or more wires which may connect to wires of an imaging device and/or an illumination device (not shown) provided at distal tip <b>40</b>. Control signals and/or power may be supplied to the imaging device or the illumination device to control operation thereof.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Handle <b>20</b> may further include actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> (e.g., knobs) which may be pivotally connected to handle <b>20</b> via an axis A. A locking mechanism <b>56</b> may also be rotatably connected to handle <b>20</b> along axis A and may rotate about axis A from a first position to a second position. In a first position, locking mechanism <b>56</b> may prevent rotation of actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. When locking mechanism <b>56</b> is in the second position, actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may rotate freely about axis A. It will be understood that more than one locking mechanism <b>56</b> may be connected to handle <b>20</b>, such that each of actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> includes locking mechanism <b>56</b>. Locking mechanism <b>56</b> may be any known locking mechanism for preventing rotation of actuating devices (e.g., actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and may include a rotatable lever, a twist device, or the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are aligned along axis A. A cam <b>70</b> may be keyed to each of actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, i.e., each actuating device <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> couples to a corresponding cam <b>70</b> (for ease of understanding, a single cam <b>70</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Cam <b>70</b> may be located within a housing <b>20</b><i>a </i>of handle <b>20</b>. As will be explained herein, a first actuating wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>and a second actuating wire <b>100</b><i>b </i>may be attached to cam <b>70</b>. First and second actuating wires <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b </i>extend distally through handle <b>20</b>, into shaft <b>30</b>, and may be connected at a distal end thereof to one or more locations of shaft <b>30</b> and/or distal tip <b>40</b>, e.g., an articulation joint. As will be described in greater detail herein, rotation of one of actuating device <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> about axis A, e.g., in a clockwise or a counterclockwise direction, may cause cam <b>70</b> to rotate in a same direction. As cam <b>70</b> is rotated, the slack of either first actuating wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>(e.g., when cam <b>70</b> is rotated in a clockwise direction) or second actuating wire <b>100</b><i>b </i>(e.g., when cam <b>70</b> is rotated in a counter-clockwise direction) may be taken up and may begin to wind around cam <b>70</b>, which may cause distal tip <b>40</b> and/or a portion of shaft <b>30</b> to bend relative to longitudinal axis B.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to an example, each actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may be coupled to a cam <b>70</b> via a shaft. For example, a first shaft (not shown) may connect actuating device <b>52</b> to a first cam <b>70</b> and a second shaft (not shown) may connect actuating device <b>54</b> to a second cam <b>70</b>. As described herein, cam <b>70</b> and actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may share a rotation axis. In some instances, one or both of the first shaft and the second shaft may include a lumen such that one of the first shaft or the second shaft may be disposed within the lumen of the respective shaft. In other words, the first shaft may surround the second shaft, or the second shaft may surround the first shaft. In this manner, the first shaft and the second shaft may be coaxial. This may allow actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> and respective cams <b>70</b> to also be coaxial.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Cam <b>70</b> may include a first side <b>70</b><i>a </i>and a second side <b>70</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>.

The ferrule may have a diameter greater than a diameter of a distal portion of first actuating wire <b>100</b><i>a</i>. The ferrule may be seated in a slot <b>80</b> (e.g., a recess or opening) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) formed in an outer surface of first side <b>70</b><i>a</i>. Seating the ferrule in slot <b>80</b> may fix first actuating wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>relative to cam <b>70</b>. A portion of first actuating wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>may be received by a recess <b>82</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) to allow first actuating wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>to extend from slot <b>80</b>, into recess <b>82</b>, and wrap around all or a portion of a circumference of cam <b>70</b>. Second side <b>70</b><i>b </i>of cam <b>70</b> may have a similar configuration. For example, a slot <b>80</b>&#x2032; may be formed in an outer surface of second side <b>70</b><i>b </i>of cam <b>70</b>, and a ferrule (not shown) of second actuating wire <b>100</b><i>b </i>may be received in slot <b>80</b>&#x2032;.

First wire path <b>76</b> may include one or more sections, such as a first section <b>84</b>, a second section <b>86</b>, a third section <b>88</b>, and a fourth section <b>90</b>. First section <b>84</b> may include a curved radially-outermost surface extending from recess <b>82</b> to second section <b>86</b>. Second section <b>86</b> may include a curved radially-outermost surface extending from first section <b>84</b> to third section <b>88</b>. Third surface <b>88</b> may include a linear radially-outermost surface extending from second section <b>86</b> and terminating at an end opposite second section <b>86</b>. Fourth section <b>90</b> may include a curved radially-outermost surface extending from third section <b>88</b> and terminating at recess <b>82</b>. In other embodiments, each of first section <b>84</b>, second section <b>86</b>, third section <b>88</b>, and fourth section <b>90</b> may include curved and/or linear portions. First wire path <b>76</b> may include less than four sections or may include more than four sections, e.g., one, two, three, five, six, or more sections, and the shape of these sections may be curved and/or linear. It will be understood that first section <b>84</b>, second section <b>86</b>, third section <b>88</b>, and fourth section <b>90</b> may form a single continuous path along first wire path <b>76</b>. Alternatively, openings or breaks along first wire path <b>76</b> may be formed to reduce material without taking away from the ability of an actuation wire from wrapping onto or off of first path <b>76</b> as described herein. It will also be understood that any of sections <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, or <b>90</b> may be formed of a plurality of linear sections, which may form a generally circular surface.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As will be described in more detail, a distance from a center C of cam <b>70</b> to each point along the radially outermost surfaces of each of first section <b>84</b>, second section <b>86</b>, third section <b>88</b>, and fourth section <b>90</b> may be fixed or may vary. For example, the distance between center C of cam <b>70</b> to points on one or more of first section <b>84</b>, second section <b>86</b>, third section <b>88</b>, and/or fourth section <b>90</b> may change over one or more portions of each section. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a distance between a surface of second section <b>86</b> to center C may decrease from first section <b>84</b> to third section <b>88</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to an example, first section <b>84</b> may extend approximately fifty percent around a circumference of cam <b>70</b> from recess <b>82</b>. A distance between center C and points along a radially-outermost surface of first section <b>84</b> may be constant along an entirety of first section <b>84</b>. This constant distance may cause increased torque felt by a user as an actuation mechanism connected to cam <b>70</b> is rotated to cause an actuation wire (e.g., actuation wire <b>100</b><i>a</i>) to wind onto first section <b>84</b>. This constant distance may provide increased control of an articulation joint as compared to when the actuation wire is wound onto second section <b>86</b> and third section <b>88</b>. For example, a minor rotation of cam <b>70</b> when the articulation wire is wrapping onto, or off of, first section <b>84</b> may provide improved steering control of the articulation joint than a same amount of rotation of cam <b>70</b> when the articulation wire is wrapping onto, or off of, second section <b>86</b> or third section <b>88</b>, as will be explained herein. In some instances, the distance between points along a radially-outermost surface of first section <b>84</b> and center C of cam <b>70</b> may be greater than in conventional cam devices, which may improve steering control of the actuation joint at low rotation angles. A distance between a surface of each of sections <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, and <b>90</b> and center C may be between approximately 0.100 inches and approximately 0.500 inches. An angular distance, e.g., a circumferential distance about cam <b>70</b>, of first section <b>84</b> may be approximately 90&#xb0; to approximately 150&#xb0;, of second section <b>86</b> may be approximately 70&#xb0; to approximately 130&#xb0;, of third section <b>88</b> may be approximate 10&#xb0; to approximately 70&#xb0;, and of fourth section <b>90</b> may be approximately 50&#xb0; to approximately 110&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, second section <b>86</b> may be curved. A distance between points along a radially outermost surface of second section <b>86</b> and center C of cam <b>70</b> may decrease from the end of first section <b>84</b> to the beginning of third section <b>88</b>. This decreasing distance may decrease an amount of tension felt by the user as the user rotates the corresponding actuating device <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. As described above, responsiveness of the articulation joint may also decrease based on this decreased distance.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Third section <b>88</b> may include a linear radially-outermost surface, such that a distance between third section <b>88</b> and center C may decrease from the intersection of second section <b>86</b> and third section <b>88</b> to a center of third section <b>88</b>, and then may increase from the center of third section <b>88</b> to an end of third section <b>88</b>. This decreased distance relative to the distance between center C and first section <b>84</b> may decrease an amount of tension felt by the user as cam <b>70</b> and an associated actuation mechanism are rotated about axis A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Fourth section <b>90</b> may include a curved radially-outermost surface. In some instances, a distance from all points along fourth section <b>90</b> may be a same distance from center C of cam <b>70</b> as the points along first section <b>84</b>, but is not limited thereto. In some embodiments, rotation of cam <b>70</b> may be terminated such that the actuation wire does not wrap onto fourth section <b>90</b>. In other embodiments, the actuation wire is wrapped onto fourth section <b>90</b>. As described above, responsiveness of the articulation joint when the actuation wire is located along third section <b>88</b> may be decreased relative to the responsiveness of the articulation joint when the actuation wire is wrapping onto or off of first section <b>84</b>. For example, first section <b>82</b> may extend approximately halfway (e.g., 180 degrees) about a circumference of cam <b>70</b>. In this instance, rotation of cam <b>70</b> from zero degrees to 180 degrees may deflect shaft <b>30</b> at a smaller angle relative to longitudinal axis A than when cam <b>70</b> is rotated between 180 degrees and 360 degrees.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A cross-section of second side <b>70</b><i>b </i>along line <b>6</b>-<b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Second wire path <b>78</b> of second side <b>70</b><i>b </i>may include similar sections as first wire path <b>76</b>, e.g., a first section <b>84</b>&#x2032; which may include a curve having a constant radius, a second section <b>86</b>&#x2032; which may have a curve having a decreasing radius, a third section <b>88</b>&#x2032; which may be linear, and a fourth section <b>90</b>&#x2032; which may include a curve having a same or a different radius as the radius of the curve of first section <b>84</b>&#x2032;.

In other words, first wire path <b>76</b> and second wire path <b>78</b> may not be mirror images about a plane between and parallel to first wire path <b>76</b> and second wire path <b>78</b>. First wire path <b>76</b> and second wire path <b>78</b> may be offset about 20 degrees as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In this instance, cam <b>70</b> may control deflection of shaft <b>30</b> and/or distal tip <b>40</b> in right/left directions. The offset of first wire path <b>76</b> and second wire path <b>78</b> may allow an actuation wire connected to one wire path, e.g., first wire path <b>76</b>, to be in slack while an actuation wire connected to the other wire path, e.g., second wire path <b>78</b>, is in tension. The offset of first wire path <b>76</b> and second wire path <b>78</b> may enable the machining of cam <b>70</b> and/or may prevent actuation wires from moving from one path to another during use. In another example, first wire path <b>76</b> and second wire path <b>78</b> are not offset radially from each other. According to an example, first wire path <b>76</b> may extend in a first direction around cam <b>70</b>, e.g., in a clockwise direction, while second wire path <b>78</b> may extend in an opposite direction about cam <b>70</b>, e.g., a counterclockwise direction. Rotation of cam <b>70</b> in a first direction (e.g., a clockwise direction) may cause a first actuation wire to wrap onto first wire path <b>76</b> and/or may cause a second actuation wire to wrap off of second wire path <b>78</b>. Rotation of cam <b>70</b> in a second direction, opposite of the first direction (e.g., a counterclockwise direction) may cause the first actuation wire to wrap off of first wire path <b>76</b> and/or may cause the second actuation wire to wrap onto second wire path <b>78</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A method of operation of medical system <b>10</b> may be described. Medical system <b>10</b> may be inserted into a body via an opening, e.g., an incision or via a natural orifice. Distal tip <b>40</b> may be advanced to a target site by pushing shaft <b>30</b> in a distal direction. As shaft <b>30</b> is pushed distally, one or more tortuous paths may be navigated by medical system <b>10</b>. A user may rotate actuating device <b>52</b> in a clockwise or a counter-clockwise direction, which may deflect distal tip <b>40</b> in a first plane, e.g., up-down relative to longitudinal axis B, and may rotate actuating device <b>54</b> in a clockwise or a counter-clockwise direction, which may deflect distal tip <b>40</b> in a second plane, e.g., right-left relative to longitudinal axis B. As actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are rotated, the articulation mechanism (e.g., a wire) may be taken up by a corresponding cam <b>70</b> in the direction in which actuating devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are turned. For example, rotating actuating device which is keyed or connected to cam <b>70</b> may cause actuation wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>to begin to be taken up and wrap onto first section <b>84</b>. The user may have improved control over the articulation of shaft <b>30</b> and/or distal tip <b>40</b> at this stage, but the torque felt by the user may increase as articulation wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>continues to wrap onto first section <b>84</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Continued rotation of actuating device <b>52</b> may cause actuation wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>to wrap onto second section <b>86</b>. As actuation wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>is wrapped onto second section <b>86</b>, control over the actuation of shaft <b>30</b> and/or distal tip <b>40</b> may be diminished, but torque felt by the user may also be reduced. Continued rotation of actuating device <b>52</b> may cause actuation wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>to wrap onto third section <b>88</b>. As actuation wire <b>100</b><i>a </i>is wrapped onto third section <b>88</b>, control over the actuation of shaft <b>30</b> and/or distal tip <b>40</b> may be increased, but torque felt by the user may increase. It will be understood that actuating device <b>52</b> and/or actuating device <b>54</b> may be rotated both clockwise and/or counter-clockwise multiple times during a procedure. Thus, the torque felt by the user and the control over shaft <b>30</b> and/or distal tip <b>40</b> may continue to change during rotation based on the position of an actuation wire on a respective cam <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">While embodiments have been described relevant to actuation mechanisms attached to handle <b>20</b> for deflecting shaft <b>30</b> and /or distal tip <b>40</b>, it will be understood that any medical device used with medical system <b>10</b>, or separately from medical system <b>10</b>, may include cam <b>70</b> described herein, which may be used to deflect a portion of the medical device and which may be used to reduce torque associated with rotation of an actuation device.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed device without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
