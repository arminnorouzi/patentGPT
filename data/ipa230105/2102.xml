The product may be solid at refrigeration temperature, semiliquid, liquid or in a viscous state, possibly in a form which makes retrieval/distribution thereof easy, where the product could optionally be consumed by means of a spoon, for example.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Containers having an integrated closure system, of the kind not separated from the lateral wall, are known. For example the document U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,488 describes a cup of paper or similar material which includes a flexible panel formed in the lateral wall thereof. The flexible panel is folded back for closing on top of the cup, leaving a narrow opening passage for drinking. However, for avoiding spells, these designs rely on the creation of a joint between the flexible panel and the inner wall against which it is butted. Because of this, the geometry and manufacturing of these types of cups prove complex, which limits the application thereof. The document GB 2,269,811 provides a similar arrangement for closing a container with a closure part integrated on one side of the lateral wall. A hinge effect allows the closure part (thinner than the facing butted region) to pass from an outwardly convex conformation, corresponding to the open state of the container, to an externally concave conformation corresponding to a state joined against a complementarity inner surface of the lateral wall. This type of container must however be plastic and also turns out to be relatively complex, in particular for getting a bistable property of the closure part, which limits the interest in this solution.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The document WO 01/26980 describes another configuration in which a plurality of tabs are fixed in a hinged way to the upper edge of the lateral wall of the container/cup. The tabs each have a generally trapezoidal shape with respective hook extensions which engage with each other around a straw when the tabs are folded even with the upper edge of the cup. The document DE1,052,305 B describes a container also provided with a closure that is complex to make; this container serves to contain a liquid such as milk.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, closing this type of cup may prove problematic, for example, in the fast-food field where a large number of drinks are served in a relatively short time or even in the field of high-speed packaging of products requiring an easy closure operation. This is for example the case for containers that are filled and need to be refrigerated and transported to sales locations right away. It would also be desirable to improve the reliability of the sealing (hermetic) in order to assure that the content of the container remains intact, where the sealing needs to resist transportation stresses (in particular vibrations).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In that way, there is still a need for containers which, at least in the preferred embodiments, have integrally formed closure parts, but which remain relatively simple to produce and use.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In light of one or more of the observations laid out above, a container, intended for packaging a product is proposed comprising: a bottom, a lateral wall delimiting an interior volume, where the lateral wall extends upward (vertically, rising) from the bottom up to an annular end delimiting an opening for access to the interior volume;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000">where the container has a closed configuration and further comprises two distinct protrusions (or two ears) in order to get the closed configuration, in which the two protrusions are (in particular simultaneously):<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">projecting opposite the bottom, from the annular end of the lateral wall; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">sealed to each other so as to form a sealing zone in order to hermetically close the opening;<br/>where the container has two gripping portions, distributed on the two protrusions, where each of the gripping portions is arranged outside of the sealing zone.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">Because of this construction, it is sufficient to separate the two protrusions from each other, by gripping the gripping portions. The use of the container remains simple. The manufacturing of the container may be simple and the sealing robust. In some embodiments, a spoon, a fork, a straw (if the product is sufficiently liquid), chopsticks, or picks may be used to retrieve the product through the opening. This design is further well suited to the use of paper or cardboard or laminates comprising a paper or cardboard layer, easy to recycle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">The protrusions result for example from a cutout and project upward before and after a tubular shaping of the lateral wall, where the lateral wall and protrusions are formed from a material in sheet form, preferably a single piece. The material in sheet form may be a paper or cardboard-based material, for example a laminate comprising at least one paper or cardboard layer and possibly one or more layers of metal and/or plastic and/or other materials improving the barrier properties. The material in sheet form may have the form of coils or precut units. The material for making the bottom may be identical to that for making the lateral wall and the protrusions. More generally, it is understood that the two protrusions that cannot be lost. After having emptied the container, the consumer may discard it as a single piece. This type of container is thus well suited for use on the move, since it can be transported in a backpack or various containers, which could be thermally insulated in case of a fresh product contained in the container, while limiting the risk of losing the cover or another part that could be lost.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">In an embodiment, the container has an opening configuration (in an upright state), in which a first protrusion of the two protrusions remains projecting upward, opposite from the bottom, whereas all or part of the other or second protrusion is turned back or turned down on an exterior surface of the lateral wall. The container may therefore be placed on the base thereof on store shelves. As a variant, one of the protrusions may serve to form displays of containers supported by a support rod passing through an opening included in the protrusion, or again to assemble the containers in a group held together by a hoop, string or shared attachment element passing through this type of opening.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">The bottom and the opening may each extend along a respective transverse plane preferably perpendicular to the lateral wall. The opening thus forms an access to the interior volume from the top, which for example allows holding the container vertically in the hand while consuming the product (while using as needed a spoon or other utensil for gathering up the product). It is understood that the container may minimize the parts to be discarded and keep the handling areas far away from the inner surfaces in contact with the product (surfaces located under the sealing zone, below the level of opening in practice).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0013">Of course, the expression &#x201c;the lateral wall extends upward (vertically) from the bottom&#x201d; must be understood broadly, meaning that it is not necessary that the lateral wall be cylindrical: more generally it must be understood that the lateral wall has an overall vertical extension (where the wall could be flared upward by having a geometry which varies with the height of the wall).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">The term &#x201c;tubular&#x201d; must be understood broadly when it describes the lateral wall, meaning that it is not necessary that the lateral wall have a symmetry of revolution: instead, here a tubular wall may designate a wall which extends from one narrower annular end and/or having one first fixed shape to another annular end, larger and/or having a second different geometric shape than the first geometric shape.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">Typically, the two gripping portions are offset from each other. It is understood that the container is a quick open type. Advantageously, a simple action is sufficient to open it without tools. In variants, the performance of the action of separating the gripping portions may be conditional on unscrewing or withdrawing a safety element (removable and/or peelable).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">It is for example intended that at least one of the two protrusions be a protrusion having or consisting of a flap towards the outside. Preferably, it involves a protrusion which can be turned down (completely turned) towards the outside.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017">One single part may include the lateral wall and each of the protrusions. Optionally the protrusion that can be turned down is of the type foldable between a position projecting upward relative to the level of the opening at a position turned down below the level of the opening. The protrusion that can be turned down may include a region forming a peelable attachment layer with which to form the sealing zone. Such region may extend for example midway between the upper end of the lateral wall and the gripping portion provided in the protrusion that can be turned down.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0018">In various embodiments of the container according to the invention, one and/or another of the following provisions could further be used:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0019">The bottom, the lateral walls and the protrusions are paper or cardboard based sheet materials, for example laminates comprising at least one paper or cardboard layer and possibly one or more layers of metal and/or plastic and/or other materials improving the barrier properties. The material in sheet form may have the form of coils or precut units.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0020">The lateral wall is sleeved shape, such that the default positions of the two protrusions are positions of upward extension with a horizontal distance between them.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0021">Each of the two protrusions has a base connected to the lateral wall, where the two bases form two halves of a periphery surrounding the opening of the container.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0022">One of the two protrusions, preferably only one of the two protrusions, is connected to the lateral wall by a predetermined fold line, where a striation in the part (part forming the lateral wall and the two protrusions) serves to define a predetermined fold line.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0023">The container is paper or cardboard based, preferably cardboard laminated and/or coated with a protective layer, for example hydrophobic, for a liquid barrier effect.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0024">An overlapping zone (edge on edge) of the lateral wall is meant to be covered with a protective covering strap, preventing the liquid or aqueous substance from migrating towards an inner porous layer (fibrous layer, typically paper or cardboard) constituting the lateral wall.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0025">The perimeter of the lateral wall increases with the distance relative to the bottom. (This arrangement serves to improve the accessibility of the product after opening the container.)</li>        <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0026">The two protrusions are a single unit with the lateral wall.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0009" num="0027">The lateral wall and the two protrusions are made in one piece, preferably a piece having the shape of a cutout of laminated or sheet material.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0010" num="0028">The part for forming the lateral wall and the protrusions is based on a deformable material including a cellulose material and conformed as a sleeve by overlapping two band portions.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0011" num="0029">The two band portions each include one lateral edge of the lateral wall, and are fixed to each other so as to form a liquid-tight barrier.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0012" num="0030">A gas-tight barrier effect may be achieved, in a junction zone/line for keeping an annular/tubular shape of the lateral wall), in particular by means of an outer coating over an overlapping zone of the two band portions.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0013" num="0031">At least one of the two protrusions is a protrusion that can be turned down towards the outside.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0014" num="0032">The opening is in part delimited by a fold line with which to turn down the foldable protrusion, preferably such that the foldable protrusion extends downward from the fold line.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0015" num="0033">The foldable protrusion is movable between a first position for closing the container and a second position; this second position is typically joined against the inner surface of the other of the two protrusions in the first position (where the foldable protrusion extends upward from a fold line parallel to the bottom), whereas in a second position, the container is open because of the folding of the foldable protrusion where this folding is done towards the outside opposite the other protrusion (which preferably continues to project upward).</li>        <li id="ul0004-0016" num="0034">The foldable protrusion includes an actuating part formed by one of the two gripping portions.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0017" num="0035">In the closed configuration, the actuating part of the foldable protrusion projects upward from/relative to an upper edge of the other protrusion, such that the actuating part is a free end part of the foldable protrusion.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0018" num="0036">The other protrusion comprises one of the gripping portions, which is offset relative to the actuating part, and axially projecting upward relative to an upper edge of the foldable protrusion, so as to form a free end part of the other protrusion.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0019" num="0037">Two actuating regions are typically formed in two offset gripping portions which are freely accessible by the top of the container (top of the container which may constitute means of closure/opening, in particular means of opening by pulling in order to open the container).</li>        <li id="ul0004-0020" num="0038">The means of opening the container may be flat in the flat closed configuration of the two protrusions.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0021" num="0039">In order to seal, an adhesive material may be added on at least one of the protrusions (on the inner zone), preferably on both protrusions, or an adhesive material can be incorporated for sealing at least one part of at least one of the protrusions.

Further, significant flexibility in the geometry of the protrusions, which allow hermetically sealing, is permitted.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0077">In one option, all or part of the sealing zone is part of a folded end of the container in a modified closed configuration. It can be provided that the two protrusions are in a folded state of a single lateral side of the container in the modified closed configuration. It is understood that this modification may consist in a simple folding with which to limit the vertical dimension of the container, which is advantageous for example during transportation or during presentation of the container on store racks or shelves.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0078">An attachment element could be provided, for example an adhesive sticker serving to keep the modified configuration closed.

Optionally, the attachment between the two protrusions is done by forming the sealing zone transversely to a central axis of the lateral wall. Such a sealing zone may for example extend between two opposite ends which, in the closed configuration of the container and in an upright state of the lateral wall, are spaced horizontally from each other by a set distance greater than the largest characteristic dimension of the bottom (which extends horizontally).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0088">The use of the container according to the invention is also proposed, in which, in order to open the container, the two protrusions are successively:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0089">brought upright opposite the bottom in a closed configuration (closed configuration compatible with opening);</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0090">separated from each other by separating the two gripping portions until selectively lowering one of the two protrusions towards the outside;<br/>in that way, the container is opened by breaking a sealing junction made between the respective inner surfaces of the two protrusions without separating one or the other of the two protrusions from the lateral wall.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0027" num="0091">In that way a simple opening action results which may be compatible with a container of simple design, which could be compact to the extent where the sealing zone may be movable with the protrusions, which can for example be turned down. No breakage or tearing of wall material constituting the wall enveloping the product is required, nor is any breakage or tearing of any other end part covering all or part of the opening.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0092">Other features and advantages of the invention will emerge from the description given below with reference to the attached drawings which show, as nonlimiting examples, embodiments and practicing of the subject matter of the invention.

The container has an opening O, here a single opening which may be substantially as large as the bottom <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the container <b>10</b> (at least as large as a smaller dimension D<b>2</b> of the bottom <b>1</b><i>a</i>, as applicable). The product P, for example a food product, may be poured into the inner volume V through such an opening O, before the sealing step which is done by bringing together two protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>which are typically formed as an integral part with the lateral wall <b>2</b>. The sealing, obtained by an attachment of the two protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>against each other, serves to get the closed state of the container <b>10</b>. The summit or top of this container <b>10</b> is thus of the type blocked without a separate cover, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0105">The container <b>10</b> may be made from two parts each constituted of a material in sheet form: one for constituting the bottom wall <b>1</b>, and the other for constituting the sidewall <b>2</b>. In the implementation variants, the walls <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> may be made from a single part obtained by cutting of the material in sheet form. In other options, a larger number of parts may be used in order to get the recipient <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0106">The bottom wall <b>1</b> is shaped so as to be undeformable and provide stability to the container <b>10</b> when it is in an upright state. As a nonlimiting example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the part forming the bottom wall <b>1</b> may have a peripheral fold LP, corresponding to a junction line between:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0107">a bottom <b>1</b><i>a </i>substantially flat and tended to be in contact with the product P; and</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0108">a tubular border <b>1</b><i>b </i>extending downward from the fold LP (annular fold line).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0043" num="0109">The fold LP is continuously curved and the bottom <b>1</b><i>a </i>may have a non-round section for example oval with a major diameter D<b>1</b> larger than the minor diameter D<b>2</b>. The ratio D<b>2</b>:D<b>1</b> may be less than or equal to 0.9. The outer surface of the tubular edge <b>1</b><i>b </i>may be fixed against an annular lower attachment zone of the lateral wall <b>2</b>, called in the following first attachment part FP<b>1</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it can be seen that the lower end <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the container <b>10</b> may optionally extend lower than the bottom <b>1</b><i>a</i>. The top or upper end <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the container <b>10</b> may, in the closed configuration, include in the ends two protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>. In the open configuration, on the other hand, only one of the protrusions, here the protrusion <b>2</b><i>a </i>in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, remains upright projecting upward in order to form what remains of the upper end <b>10</b><i>b</i>. In other options, the upper end <b>10</b><i>b </i>may include just one of the protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, with, in this case for example, a lateral arrangement of the projecting portion associated with the lower protrusion.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0110">The lateral wall <b>2</b> is shaped like a tube, around a central axis X, and the two protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>consist of two ears projecting axially from the tube, therefore projecting relative to one annular end <b>20</b> of the lateral wall <b>2</b>. The lateral wall <b>2</b> and the two protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>may be implemented here by one single piece <b>200</b> of the kind shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> or the like. A laminated or sheet material may for example be cut in order to get a part <b>200</b> which is initially planar or flat before being shaped.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0111">In the example shown, the part <b>200</b> is flexible, based on a deformable material and for example a cellulose type material. This cellulose material may optionally form over 90 or 95% of the average thickness of the container <b>10</b> (thickness which may correspond to the thickness of the lateral wall <b>2</b>). The part <b>200</b> is cut laterally so as to include two lateral edges B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>. In the example shown, the two lateral edges B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b> diverge from each other as they get closer to a folding zone or fold line for the foldable protrusion <b>2</b><i>b</i>. This way the opening O can be enlarged for better accessibility to the product P.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0112">In the option from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a fold line is provided which is obtained by the addition of two deformation lines or initial striations S<b>14</b><i>a </i>and S<b>14</b><i>b </i>serving to obtain a fold line <b>14</b> of the kind shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. More generally, it can be provided that the lateral cut of the part <b>200</b> results in a profile of the perimeter of the lateral walls <b>2</b> (formed by this part <b>200</b>), that increases going away from the bottom <b>1</b><i>a</i>. In other words, while getting closer to the annular end <b>20</b> of the annular wall <b>2</b>, and thus to a fold line <b>14</b> serving to fold down at least one of the protrusions for the open configuration of the container <b>10</b>, the section of the container <b>10</b> gets progressively larger.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0113">This is advantageous for the actions for retrieving the product P by spoon, and also for reducing the height of the filling volume. In fact, such a height can be lowered compared to a lateral wall <b>2</b> having a constant perimeter, also making handling of the side of the bottom of the lateral wall <b>2</b> easier, where the perimeter is smaller and/or the stiffness is greater because of the connection to the wall element <b>1</b>. Further, a shape flared downward is simpler to hold in just one hand for morphological reasons.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0114">The first attachment part FP<b>1</b> serves to stiffen a first end (lower) of the lateral wall <b>2</b>, by attachment thereof against the folded or edged outer annular surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the bottom wall <b>1</b>. In this way, the first end of the lateral wall <b>2</b> is stabilized and remains substantially constant/undeformed in section, without variation of geometry while changing from the closed configuration to the open configuration of the container <b>10</b>. Conversely, the second end (upper) of the lateral wall <b>2</b> constitutes an annular end <b>20</b> of deformable section.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0115">The second attachment part FP<b>2</b>, which may be extended along a longitudinal extension as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, serves to keep the tubular conformation of the lateral wall <b>2</b> while allowing a separation between the two protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>which is accompanied by a rounding of the top of the lateral wall <b>2</b> as seen from above. The attachment/overlap width corresponding to the second attachment part FP<b>2</b> may be less than or equal to 10 mm, for example included between 3 and 8 mm. The second attachment part FP<b>2</b> defines an outer attachment surface which is covered by a corresponding inner zone (from the rear side of the part <b>200</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> such that the lateral edge B<b>1</b> and the associated lateral margin forming the attachment part FP<b>2</b> will be hidden by the other lateral margin including the lateral edge B<b>2</b>. These lateral margins may be fixed to each other forming a liquid-tight barrier, for example by depositing an additional coating layer, after the attachment with the edge B<b>2</b> covering over the edge B<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0116">To change from the flat conformation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, to the tubular conformation, the cut sheet or part <b>200</b> thus has a covered-over region, with an overlap of the opposite edges B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b> of the part <b>200</b>. In that way a junction or junction line J results allowing the lateral wall <b>2</b> to form a tubular wall for delimiting the inner volume V.

In the closed configuration of the container <b>10</b>, these panels <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> are connected between them via narrow subparts each folded or curved inwards and extending vertically between the bottom wall <b>1</b> and the level of the opening O. Inside view of the container <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it can be seen that each narrow subpart (narrow compared to the width of the panels <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>) has a geometric shape which is substantially triangular or conic frustum broadening towards the bottom <b>1</b><i>a</i>.

In fact, the sealing zone Z may be substantially flat (with an ascending/vertical component), by defining a sealing plane SP, which typically involves, in this example, a coplanar extension of the protrusions <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, at least in part. This has the effect of making the two main panels <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> converge towards each other in the closed configuration of the container <b>10</b>, such that the fold line <b>14</b> separating the foldable protrusion <b>2</b><i>b </i>from the first panel <b>24</b> may be adjacent to the second panel <b>25</b> in the connection zone thereof with the protrusion <b>2</b><i>a </i>which extends towards the top of this panel <b>25</b>.

An asymmetric property of the container <b>10</b> may also be obtained by placing horizontal striations exclusively on the panel <b>24</b> connected to the protrusion <b>2</b><i>b </i>to be turned down in order to free and expand the opening O. The striation S<b>14</b> placed in the plane of the opening O thus forms the fold line <b>14</b>. (This striation can result from the combination of several striations, for example the two striations S<b>14</b><i>a</i>, S<b>14</b><i>b </i>shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.) The striation S<b>14</b> may have a length substantially equal to a semi-perimeter of the annular end <b>20</b> bordering the opening O.

By decomposing the movement of the protrusion <b>2</b><i>b</i>, which may be done in one second for example, inverting the orientation of the gripping portion <b>4</b> may be done before the protrusion <b>2</b><i>b </i>is turned down to over 45&#xb0; around the fold line <b>14</b>, which is possible with the help of the small fold lines FL<b>1</b>.

In that way, assuming that the consumer uses their right hand for pulling the gripping portion <b>4</b>, they may in a single gesture turn down the protrusion <b>2</b><i>b</i>. Next, by using their left-hand for gripping the recipient <b>10</b> by the periphery of the lateral wall <b>2</b> an additional action of pressure on the sides by their left-hand, exerting a pressure as shown on the right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> by the two arrows in opposing directions, is sufficient for enlarging the opening O by further separating the respective bases of the protrusions <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0074" num="0142">More generally, it is understood that the set of these striations <b>14</b>, FL<b>1</b>, which are parallel, assists and guides the folding outward and downward of the protrusion <b>2</b><i>b</i>. In that way the protrusion <b>2</b><i>b </i>can be turned down quickly in a first step, without expanding the opening O too much. And then in the second step, in the state with the foldable protrusion lowered, it is easy to expand the opening O without unfolding the protrusion <b>2</b><i>b </i>which thus remains turned down. in other words, the presence of a series of striations FL<b>1</b>, for example at least three parallel striations, serves to promote the action of folding down instead of the action of expanding the opening O, when the protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>are separated from each other by traction in opposite directions near the gripping portions <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0143">In some options, forming striations FL<b>2</b> or similar reliefs with vertical extension, as seen in particular in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, is provided, for example asymmetrically and only on the panel <b>24</b>, from the same side as the foldable protrusion <b>2</b><i>b</i>. The striations FL<b>2</b> may extend vertically on either side of the fold line <b>14</b> and contribute to assisting/helping the end of range in the folding movement of the protrusion <b>2</b><i>b</i>, for example by avoiding the formation of angle(s) blocking the movement of the flap.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0144">In practice, these striations FL<b>2</b> (here at least five or six) may provide a guiding effect, in order to more easily around the lateral wall <b>2</b> and by avoiding the formation of a pronounced angle or V-shaped profile which would be visible in top view. The rounding of fold line <b>14</b> may then be close or identical to the illustration from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> while avoiding forming a pronounced angle near the junction line J.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0145">In some embodiments of the side of the panel <b>25</b> where no fold, start of fold or striation is provided (with the protrusion <b>2</b><i>a </i>not being turned down), a smooth surface results on which printing can be done. More generally, any type of marking (possibly embossing) can be done on the surface that has no fold line, since such a surface is favorable to the visibility of information, for example information about the product P contained in the inner volume V. The flattened appearance of the panel <b>25</b> further makes reading such information easy for consumers looking at the container <b>10</b> in a stored condition on a shelf in a store or an analogous display situation.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref> show the way in which the container <b>10</b> may be handled, while changing from a compact configuration to a deployed configuration, and then to an open configuration that allows consumption of the product P contained in the inner volume V of the lateral wall <b>2</b>.

Each baseline of the gripping portion <b>4</b> or <b>5</b> is then aligned with an edge for delimiting the other protrusion, delimitation edge beyond which the gripping portion <b>4</b> or <b>5</b> considered extends. Typically this base line is lengthened and extends 25 or 30 mm past for each of the protrusions <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> which makes these protrusions robust and easy to grip. They are optionally made from laminated cardboard or analogous cellulose material that is sufficiently compressed and/or protected by a coating in order to resist tearing such that they are in practice impossible to tear accidentally.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0155">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>may each&#x2014;or at least one of them&#x2014;narrow towards the top in the closed configuration by being delimited by two delimiting edges <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> or <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>. It is understood that this gripping portion <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> may correspond to a region of the protrusion towards which the two delimitation edges <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>, or respectively <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, converge.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Example of Manufacturing Process</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0156">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, a nonlimiting example of manufacturing a container <b>10</b> by using material in sheets such as laminated cardboard is described.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0157">The part <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may be obtained after several steps including one or more steps of cutting and processing steps with which to define the fold line <b>14</b> for folding the second foldable protrusion <b>2</b><i>b </i>and also other fold lines and/or weakening of material.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0158">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a roll R<b>1</b> made up of the material in sheet form having a suitable multilayer structure (such as described above, for example PE/cardboard/PE) may be unwound. A cutting step <b>51</b> is done, optionally at high speed, by a cutting tool UC in order to get pieces of sheet, here with trapezoidal shape. It is understood that the part <b>200</b> may result from the cutting done just once or possibly broken down into an initial cut and a secondary cut of a piece from a material in sheet form MF. In the example shown, for simplification, the protrusions have been omitted in the cutting step <b>51</b>. However, it may be preferred to make the contour of the two protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>once this initial cut is done at step <b>51</b>. In other words, this cut serves to define the final lower edge <b>25</b>, the two sides or lateral edges B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b> (in a general shape which is then close to a trapeze) and also the two protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>. The part <b>200</b> thus results. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, two lateral edges B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b> are provided which separate from each other going away from the lower edge <b>25</b> and approaching near the opening O. This type of geometry of the lateral edges B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b> is advantageous for providing an increased deformation effect near the opening O.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0159">Each part <b>200</b> then undergoes a series of treatments for shaping. For example, the band portions formed in the lateral margins of each piece (margins including the edges B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>) can be directly heated and then the part <b>200</b> conformed as a sleeve. A turning mold with conic frustum geometry may form a support so that the part <b>200</b> can be wound around this mold, such that they form a sleeve because of the overlap of the lateral margins or band portions. This shaping step <b>52</b> may optionally combine heating and winding of the part <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0160">Typically, an edge protection step <b>53</b> is implemented in order to cover up the edge(s) B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b> which are involved in forming the junction part J, with a coating which improves the tightness against liquids. In this way, the junction part J of the lateral wall <b>2</b> is durably sealed (considering the length of transportation/storage in the store and at the consumer, especially if it involves a product to be stored fresh in a refrigerator). At the outcome of step <b>52</b> of shaping and this optional step <b>53</b>, the part <b>200</b> is in its final conformation and already forms the lateral wall <b>2</b> provided with protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, without however being connected to the wall of the bottom <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0161">Then, a striation S<b>41</b> or similar weakening may be implemented in order to form the fold line <b>14</b> before the shaping step <b>52</b>. In the same way, the groups of horizontal striations FL<b>1</b> in the protrusion <b>2</b><i>b </i>and/or striations FL<b>2</b> with vertical component on either side of the striation S<b>14</b> may be made before the step <b>52</b>, respectively by pressure from at least one molding/relief member.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0162">The opening <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>&#x2032;, shown as formed in one of the protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, here in the gripping part <b>5</b> of the protrusions <b>2</b><i>a </i>in the nonlimiting example from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, may also be pierced by a hole before the shaping step <b>52</b>. This type of orifice <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>&#x2032; may make it easier to display and/or gather (for example in a row) a set of containers connected by a string, hoop, carabiner or similar connecting element passing through each opening of the containers from the same set. Possibly, a bag of a content which can be associated with the product P in the container may accompany the container <b>10</b> by being attached to the string, hoop, carabiner or similar connecting element.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0163">In parallel with the production of the parts <b>200</b> forming the lateral walls <b>2</b>, bottom walls <b>1</b> are also designed from a laminated material coil, preferably comprising a paper or cardboard layer, for example the same material as the lateral wall <b>2</b>. After cutting step <b>54</b>, which may use similar equipment to that of step <b>51</b>, apart from the type of contour cut (which may be an oval cut), a step <b>55</b> of shaping is implemented in order to fold the peripheral annular region of the corresponding part, so as to get the peripheral fold LP and create the border <b>1</b><i>b</i>, here surrounding an assembly member <b>18</b> with conic frustum mold.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0164">The connection between the wall elements <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> is implemented for example by step <b>61</b> of positioning with overlap of the attachment part FP<b>1</b> on the border <b>1</b><i>b</i>, at the outcome of which the lateral wall <b>2</b> is held in a set position fixed relative to the bottom wall <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the last step <b>62</b> consisting of a hot attachment of the bottom wall <b>1</b>. The container <b>10</b>, ready to be filled, may then be obtained by heating and possibly by a pressure treatment, serving to attach and seal the outer surface of the border <b>1</b><i>b </i>to the inside of the attachment part FP<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0165">In some options, one or more treatments for sealing may be implemented during the step <b>62</b> or after the step <b>62</b>. For example, the junction J may be sealed in an assembled state of the walls <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0166">The filling, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, using any type of system for pouring doses of product P, may be done next, before the final step of closure by implementing the sealing zone Z or Z<b>1</b>, Z<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0167">It must be obvious for the people skilled in the art that the present invention allows embodiments under many other specific forms without going outside the scope of application of the invention as claimed.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0168">Thus, although the figures show a container <b>10</b> whose lateral wall <b>2</b> is made in a single piece, a lateral wall including two related parts may be provided. All sorts of elements making holding easier, in particular one or more textured surfaces, ribs or other comparable surface features may also be inserted in the lateral wall <b>2</b>, only on the side of the protrusion <b>2</b><i>b</i>, or elsewhere. For some uses, a ring (possibly with elastic restoring force) or a sleeve may be provided, for example configured for surrounding an upper part of the outer surface of the lateral wall <b>2</b>. A stiff cup with section comparable to the section of the opening O of the container <b>10</b> and an open state may also form a support for the container <b>10</b>. Such a ring or cup, reusable, serves for example to more easily shift the transverse section of the upper end of the lateral wall <b>2</b> from an elongated oval shape (elongated in the direction of the respective interstices N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b> formed between the two protrusions <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>) to a substantially circular shape which can make the consumption of the product P easier, as applicable with a spoon.
