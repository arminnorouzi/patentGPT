This can be a challenge when a zoom relay is needed, as zoom groups must have large enough room for their axial movements (which are required for changing magnification). The bigger the magnification range, the more room may be needed, and the longer is the relay. For example, in a typical zoom riflescope, the zoom relay significantly contributes to the length of the entire instrument, necessitating innovation as shorter riflescopes are often highly in demand.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It should be noted that it is physically impossible to construct a conventional zoom system by moving a single group of lenses along optical axis. This applies to any type of zoom made of conventional lenses, including zoom relays. Adding a second group of lenses which moves axially at a different rate than the first one solves this problem, but additional room is needed for moving the second group. The present disclosure shows how to use only single axial movement in the zoom relay of the variator group together with a tunable compensator attached to the variator group.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a schematic diagram of a zoom relay system <b>100</b>, according to some exemplary embodiments. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, system <b>100</b> includes a single thin lens <b>110</b> having a focal length f. Lens <b>110</b> forms an image of object <b>112</b> at image plane <b>114</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the shortest possible length of zoom relay system <b>100</b> is four times the focal length f of lens <b>110</b>, i.e., 4f. This shortest length occurs when lens <b>110</b> is located at the midpoint along the optical axis <b>116</b> of system <b>100</b> between object <b>112</b> and image plane <b>114</b>. However, in this particular configuration, transverse magnification is &#x2212;1, meaning that the image at image plane <b>114</b> is the same size as the object, but is inverted.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the exemplary embodiments, a zoom relay is provided in which lens <b>110</b> can be located anywhere between object <b>112</b> and image plane <b>114</b>, such that the overall magnifications other than &#x2212;1 are possible, but the shortest distance between object <b>110</b> and image plane <b>114</b> remains 4f. This is realized by slight adjustment of the refractive power of lens <b>110</b> by using a varifocal solid-state compensator attached adjacent to lens <b>110</b>. In some exemplary embodiments, the compensator is a fairly weak Alvarez-Lohmann (AL) lens (i.e. absolute value of its refractive power can be small), of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,305,294 (the '294 patent).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The '294 patent provides a two-element, variable-power, i.e., varifocal lens, which can be and has been successfully designed and constructed for substantial variations in power with small movements of the lens elements relative to their size, and which is substantially free of distortion over the whole field of view. This result is obtained by forming the lens elements substantially in accordance with a thickness equation herein disclosed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In brief, the variable-power lens includes two piano-freeform lens elements arranged in tandem, one behind the other along the optical axis of the lens system, the optical axis being substantially normal to the element surfaces and passing substantially through their centers. At least one of these lens elements is movable in a direction transverse to the optical axis, and preferably both lens elements are moved by equal amounts in opposite directions along the same transverse axis. In order to precisely define the lens parameters it is convenient to employ a rectangular coordinate system of mutually perpendicular axes x, y and z. The optical axis of the lens system is taken to be the z axis and the freeform sag profile Z(x,y) is measured parallel to this axis in the following notations.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a refractive free-form AL-type doublet view <b>150</b> (AL sandwich) with a general freeform surface profile Z(x,y) and a very small axial air gap, g. According to the exemplary embodiments, view <b>150</b> includes zero refractive power doublet view <b>152</b>, (afocal state, i.e., focal length is infinite), negative power doublet view <b>154</b>, and positive power doublet view <b>156</b>. For each, both plano-freeform elements of the doublet can have in fact the same freeform profile, except that the second element is inverted with respect to the first one. According to the exemplary embodiments, if both elements are laterally aligned with respect to the optical axis, the action of AL doublet can essentially be the same as that of a plane-parallel plate (provided that the air gap g is very small). According to some embodiments, assume that one element of the doublet can be slightly displaced vertically with respect to the other one so the total vertical shift is symmetrical about optical axis and equals 2p. If the refractive index of each doublet element is n, and the vertical shift is sufficiently small, the flat incoming wavefront propagating along optical axis will be transformed by the doublet into:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>W</i>(<i>x,y</i>)=2<i>p</i>(<i>n&#x2212;</i>1)<i>Z</i>&#x2032;(<i>x,y</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0030" num="0000">where W(x,y) stands for the transformed wavefront emerging from the doublet, and Z&#x2032; denotes first derivative of the freeform sag profile Z taken over direction of vertical shift, y. Therefore, if the present disclosure integrates over y a required wavefront shape W(x,y), a corresponding surface profile Z can be found, which will generate this wavefront.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">In particular, one can require that a planar incoming flat wavefront is transformed by AL doublet into a spherical one. In paraxial approximation, the requested emerging spherical wavefront can be then expressed as:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>W</i>(<i>x,y</i>)&#x2dc;<i>D</i>(<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>+y</i><sup>2</sup>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0033" num="0000">where D=1/(2R) and R is radius of curvature of the requested spherical wavefront.

According to the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, it is clear from the above equation that the refractive power of the AL doublet tunes from the afocal state (p=0) to either positive or negative refractive power, depending on the sign and the amount of the vertical shift, p.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0029">In deriving the lens equations set forth herein, the usual paraxial approximations that are valid for thin lenses were made. Specifically, it was assumed that the transverse displacement of a light ray as it passes through the lens is negligible; that the sines of all deflection angles are numerically equal to the angles themselves, measured in radians; and that the deflection angle is independent of the slope of a lens element with respect to the incoming or outgoing light rays.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0030">However, this disclosure is not limited to such thin lenses; it may also be used in relatively thick lens systems, such as fast camera lenses, and in other cases where the thin lens assumptions are not valid. In such cases, the basic lens equations hereinbefore set forth may be used to obtain a first tentative design. Then, the aberrations of the lens may be investigated, using graphical ray-tracing and other advanced computer-aided design techniques known to those skilled in the art, to revise the lens design for minimizing the aberrations.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes a schematic diagram of a zoom relay system <b>200</b>, including a varifocal freeform lens, according to some exemplary embodiments.

The technology adds a varifocality feature to symmetric 4f relay setup in which only a single lens group moves axially. The object-to-image distance is approximately equal to 4f, where f is the focal length of the varifocal lens group in the middle position between object and image. As described above in detail, the varifocal lens group can be split into at least one conventional lens subgroup and a single varifocal lens, which in some embodiments is a tunable solid-state freeform lens. In some exemplary embodiments, two approximately symmetrical stationary lens subgroups <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> are used, with the single varifocal lens group <b>226</b> disposed between them and with aperture stop (or pupil) in proximity to the varifocal lens group <b>226</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0040">The zoom relay system with varifocal freeform lens can be implemented in optical systems such as a telescopic sight in a firearm (rifle scope), telescope, a microscope, a cell phone, medical imaging device, and other similar systems</p><p id="p-0050" num="0041">Whereas many alterations and modifications of the disclosure will become apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art after having read the foregoing description, it is to be understood that the particular embodiments shown and described by way of illustration are in no way intended to be considered limiting.
