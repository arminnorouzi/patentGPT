Provisional Application Ser. No. 62/942,582 filed on Dec. 2, 2019, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate to fibers and composites or yarns thereof that can produce functional effects. Additionally, embodiments relate to fabrics and garments produced from such materials, and methods of making such materials, fabrics, and garments. Some embodiments described herein relate to bundles, composites, or yarns that provide novel tension profiles across or within fabrics or garments made thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Textiles are age-old hierarchical assemblies that exploit the mechanical characteristics of a single fiber through 1D yarn construction and 2D textile geometry to produce highly tunable surface properties. The use of knitted and netted materials to dissipate, absorb, and generate force is used across a variety of industries, including aerospace, sports, law enforcement, military, construction, automotive, medical device, and medical prosthesis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Textile assembles have traditionally been used to distribute a material across a surface for functions such as thermal insulation and moisture protection. In one example, compression garments can provide effective medical treatment for disorders ranging from varicose veins and lymphedema to orthostatic intolerance and deep vein thrombosis. Some characteristics of knitted materials can improve impact tolerance and provide drape properties to devices used in aerospace, professional sports, law enforcement and military, construction and automotive industries, as well as medical devices to facilitate physical therapy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Rather than extending the physical properties of the material continuously in sheet formation, textile assemblies leverage a hierarchy of structures designed to modify the flexibility, conformability, and breathability of the base material. This assembly of mechanical structures has recently inspired innovation in the field of smart materials. Functional fibers, yarns, and textiles that exhibit actuation, sensing, color change, and energy harvesting capabilities can enable a new classes of lightweight, compact, and flexible technologies for applications such as wearable electronics, dynamic camouflage, and soft robotics.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first type of conventional use for knitted materials is in garments, such as compression garments used for medical therapies. Conventional compression garments for medical applications, relying upon the use of under-sized garment technologies, may aid in relief of medical conditions, but also exhibit limited usability. Fixed levels of compression in elastic materials may induce challenges in donning/doffing, complicating patient compliance. The cross-section of the garment, when the elastic garment is in a relaxed state, is smaller than a particular cross section of the body. When applied, the garment stretches and exerts force as the elastic contracts back toward its relaxed state. Other types of non-elastic, undersized compression technologies include oversized garments that can be made undersized by reducing the garment circumference after the garment has been donned by adjustable mechanisms, such as lacing, buckles, hook and loop tape, or straps.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Under-sized garments apply a substantially constant pressure on the portion of the user's body at each particular point. Depending on the user's anatomy, however, the amount of pressure can vary along the length of the garment. Although under-sized garments can be designed to provide substantially uniform pressure (or a desired pressure gradient) to a typical person, variations in user anatomy can result in variation from the intended pressure profile for that garment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another type of compression garment relies on inflation of a garment. In aerospace medicine, for example, orthostatic intolerance garments (OIG) are a type of compression garment that acts as a countermeasure to, and treatment for, the high gravitational load experienced during astronaut reentry and landing on earth that otherwise can disrupt the body's mean arterial pressure, cause blood to pool in the lower limbs, and make cerebral perfusion difficult to maintain without external assistance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to medical context, garments with compression features have been used for aesthetic reasons. Aesthetics can be a key factor in adoption of a garment by consumers or by a patient who would benefit from wearing a compression garment, as poor design leads to dissatisfaction and noncompliance. Even where no therapeutic level of compression is needed, &#x201c;athleisure&#x201d; clothing has become popular, including which garments that exhibit some compressive force and are made to be stylish, form fitting, or shaping, as well as comfortable. Examples include leggings or active footwear, for example.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The pressure profile created by a garment (whether used for a medical or aesthetic purpose) can vary based upon the way in which it is used. The cross-sections of various body parts change depending upon whether the person is seated, standing, or lying down. Therefore, an under-sized garment, which typically cannot be resized or reshaped depending on the user's activity level or body position, may apply different levels of compression for users with different levels or types of activity.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Each of these types of compression garments presents different technical challenges. Undersized compression garments do not provide tailored compression and can be too tight or too loose (or both, depending on the area), while inflated compression garments and knitted shape-memory garments require a supply of power to actuate the compression system and also typically a feedback system to monitor pressure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Pneumatic and undersized compression garments are currently available to the consumer population for treatment of conditions such as postural orthosatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Compression can also be an effective medical treatment for disorders ranging from varicose veins and lymphedema to orthostatic intolerance and deep vein thrombosis. Inflatable garments provide effective, medically therapeutic pressures to the body. These inflatable garments such as leg sleeves are bulky, tethered to an inflation source, and inhibit joint mobility. Undersized CGs are a more practical solution for POTS patients, who are predominately symptomatic during periods of activity. Elastic knit stockings are low-profile and do not inhibit mobility, but they can exert unpredictable pressures and physicians report a high level of non-compliance amongst patients due to donning difficulties and reported discomfort.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In sum, conventional compression garments such as elastic compression sleeves and inflatable compression systems may aid in relief of these conditions but are also limited in usability. Fixed levels of compression in elastic materials may induce challenges in donning/doffing, complicating patient compliance. Conventional compression garments rely upon either under-sized or inflatable compression technologies. Under-sized elastic garments are typically associated with a particular portion of a user's body, such as a calf or forearm. The cross-section of the garment when relaxed is smaller than the cross-section of the portion of the body. When applied, the garment stretches and exerts force as the elastic contracts back towards its relaxed size. Other types of non-elastic, undersized compression technologies include oversized garments that can be made undersized by reducing the garment circumference after the garment has been donned by adjustable mechanisms, such as lacing, buckles, hook and loop tape, or straps.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, while compression garments are relatively inexpensive and effective at providing static medical compression, they suffer from problems with ease of use. Furthermore, they are typically limited to use for one particular body part (e.g., an ankle or wrist) and suffer from decreasing elasticity over time and are unable to accommodate changes in patient needs over time, such as those caused by weight gain or loss or, in the context of a physical therapy support, change in patient strength.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Knitted and netted materials have unique properties, compared to woven or two-dimensional laminate materials, for example. Knitted fabrics are generally made from a single fiber or yarn, shaped into a network of interconnected loops or stitches. Whereas woven materials exhibit minimal deformation when a stress is applied, knitted materials can deform in three dimensions, and as a function of the specific properties of the yarn used, the techniques applied to construct the yarn, and the combination of knit stitches throughout the knitted material.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Fabric construction has a large influence on function, specifically through the density of the knitted material. Loose knit materials allow more air circulation and thermal regulation than dense knit materials. Dense knit materials provide protection against climatic influences, and provide greater mechanical strength. Density of a knitted material is highly influenced by the elastic properties and thickness of the yarn, gauge of the knit stitches, and knitting technique used.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The use of weft and warp knitting techniques influence the stretch and bi-stretch of resulting knitted materials. When weft knitting is used, stretch occurs along a horizontal plane (i.e. course) of the knitted material, whereas warp knitting confers stretch along a vertical plane (i.e. wale) of the knitted material. Weft knitting is typically characterized as very elastic with high shrinkage, with comparatively low tensile strength and a resulting thin knitted material. In comparison, warp knitting is typically characterized as having lower elasticity and shrinkage, with comparatively higher tensile strength, and a resulting course knitted material. Weft knitting is accomplished by combining knit and purl stitches, either through the back of loop or front of loop, in a pattern to achieve a final material with desired elastic and stretch properties. Common weft knit stitch patterns include rib stitch, garter stitch, stockinet stitch, linen stitch, reverse ridge stitch, and cables.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Similar to the use of knitting techniques, netting results in a material that has elasticity, ability to deform along three dimensions, and are influenced based on the specific properties of the yarn used, the techniques applied to construct the yarn, and the combination of knit stitches throughout the knitted material. Conventional netted materials are produced by a Ceylon stitch, nalbinding stitches (e.g. York, Oslo, Mammen, Finnish stitches), Diamond Loop stitch, or other stitch patterns.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For both knitted materials and netted materials, the use of yarn ply, including ply technique, influences the properties of the final material. Materials constructed from single ply (e.g., monofilament) yarns have different properties than materials constructed from two- or three-ply yarns, and so on. The number of twists per inch when plying filaments together also influences the properties of a finished knitted material or netted material in ways that are not easily quantifiable or predictable.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For both knitted materials and netted materials, the choice of yarn material will influence elasticity, stretch, drape, and strength. It is possible to combine one or more types of material in a single ply or, alternatively, combine one or more different plies together in a single yarn. In doing so, the end knitted material or netted material takes on the combined properties of the individual ply materials, which can be enhanced or reduced by the use of different knitting and netting techniques and stitch combinations. This combination of knitting and netting techniques, yarn ply techniques, and yarn material can all be combined to produce a functional fabric that can provide benefits to an end user. Woven and laminated materials do not, however, solve the problems with compression garments or other functional fabrics described previously, because they are largely static structures that exhibit limited compression, and still must be significantly deformed from their state at rest before they can be donned or doffed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Active textiles, or textiles that exhibit mechanical actuation, have been proposed to advance multifunctional textile applications. On-demand tunability of a textile's mechanical properties, dynamic variation in surface topography, as well as macroscopic shape change can enable a wide range of innovations across industrial, biomedical, consumer, and aerospace domains, including variable-stiffness human-system interfaces, morphing compression garments, lunar activity space suits, self-fitting clothing, compact and conforming haptic interfaces, and mobility assistance devices.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Functional fabrics can provide visual or auditory output, or they can be used for energy storage and conversion, or to monitor health or activity of a wearer. Functional fabrics can also include components of heated garments that convert some type of energy, such as electrical energy stored in a battery, into thermal energy. Conventionally, wires, leads, or sensors can be inserted into fabrics, or fabrics can be formed around such objects, to provide the ancillary benefit of the functional fabric.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Shape memory alloys and other &#x201c;smart&#x201d; or superelastic materials can be electrically controlled as a means to induce thermo-mechanical transformation which transforms a less-stiff material to an activated, higher-stiffness material in a functional fabric. These states are referred to as martensite and austenite, respectively. For example, knitted garments or netted garments of shape memory material can provide compression in a desired area, dissipate or absorb or generate force, or facilitate movement in a specific direction. Known functional fabrics based on shape memory effect transitions, but the use of a particular active material filament in a knitted pattern results in a corresponding, single function so that such functional fabrics are tuned for a specific purpose. Functional fabrics incorporating shape memory materials and can require carrying a power source, and operate in a known way at a specific activation temperature. These materials are therefore inappropriate for garments that must perform more complex tasks, such as responding to impact, or exerting or absorbing forces that vary in location, intensity, and timing.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Active materials are increasingly capable of providing sufficient output of desired properties or output capacities (e.g., force, work, or displacement) that they are considered for applications other than in garments, as well. In general, it would be desirable to be able to selectively enhance these output capacities, or multiple ones of these output capacities. While some of these output capacities can be increased by using materials that exhibit higher stresses and larger actuation performance, or by increasing either the number or the cross-sectional size of the active material itself, these solutions have limited potential or practicality.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As described above, fabricating knitted materials can create effects that are different from those of the bulk material, but these higher-level effects are not easily predictable. It is thought that features such as the size of fibers, knitting/braiding/stitching pattern, overall garment shape, level of friction between fibers, material makeup of fibers, forces on the fibers during fabrication, and forces on the fibers during activation could all affect behavior of the material in some way, but no overarching model describes this behavior.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described herein, active garments or fabrics can include &#x201c;yarns&#x201d; or multi-filament bundles of active materials to produce a variety of effects. The materials within the yarns described herein can have different transition temperatures, different shape memory effects, different thicknesses, and different individualized twists. Additionally, the superstructure of the yarn itself can be tuned to accomplish a desired effect, such as by modifying the number of plies in the yarn, the number of twists per unit length of the yarn, and the pattern into which the yarn is knitted, for example.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">By varying aspects of both the individual plies and also the yarn structure, as well as the knitting, netting, or weaving pattern in which the yarn is used, a variety of new and useful properties can be generated.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The above summary is not intended to describe each illustrated embodiment or every implementation of the subject matter hereof.

various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the claimed inventions to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the subject matter as defined by the claims.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The problems described above related, including ease of use, maintaining desired compression levels over time, and generating complex and tunable effects, are solved by the use of garments that are capable of absorbing force, releasing force, and producing desired displacement anisotropically. Several of the concepts required for a full understanding of the instant application are described in detail in the commonly-assigned PCT application published as WO 2019/108794, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The following terms are used throughout this application to refer to specific properties that are generated by the yarns and structures described herein.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Filament/Fiber. The terms &#x201c;filament&#x201d; and &#x201c;fiber&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to describe a single, continuous strand of material. In embodiments, filaments or fibers may be made of either an active material or a passive material and may be continuous fiber filaments or shorter staple fibers.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Yarn. Yarns are structures made of multiple filaments or fibers. The number of filaments or fibers in the yarn is referred to as the &#x201c;ply&#x201d; of the yarn.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Fabric/Garment. Fabrics are structures made of multiple yarns, filaments, or both. A fabric described herein may be a knitted structure of several yarns that, in combination, are designed to produce a desired effect when a transition occurs among some or all of the functional materials therein. Functional fabrics may be part or all of a functional garment, in embodiments.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Force, Displacement, Pressure, and Work. The terms &#x201c;force,&#x201d; &#x201c;displacement,&#x201d; and &#x201c;work&#x201d; are used in their conventional meaning to a person having skill in the art of materials science or kinematics.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Force is a fundamental physical concept referring to an interaction that promotes acceleration on a mass. Force is typically expressed in SI units of Newtons (N).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Displacement refers to a distance traveled. Application of force can cause a corresponding displacement (e.g., the distance that a spring is compressed when a force is applied is referred to as the displacement of the spring).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Pressure is related to force, in that pressure is an application of force across an area. Pressure has SI units of Newtons per square meter. In the context of garments, pressure can be thought of as the tightness of the garment. Depending on the intended use for a particular garment, it may be desirable to have medical/therapeutic levels of pressure, or it may be desirable to minimize pressure while ensuring a high level of fit (i.e., high displacement, low pressure).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Work is used herein in its kinematic sense: the integral of force over displacement. Work can therefore be increased by increasing the level of displacement, for example. On the other hand, a higher applied force can do more physical work even while moving along the same displacement.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Blocked force is defined as the forces that are produced when displacements are inhibited. In the context of garments, blocked force is produced when an active material is wrapped around the body such that displacements are inhibited by the body circumference. When the active material is actuated (and undergoes a phase or volume change that otherwise would produce displacement), inhibited displacements translate to a change in force around that body cross-section.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Actuation contraction (&#x3b6;) can be calculated from a force-control procedure and defined as the engineering strain between the actuator length in an active material state and the actuator length in an inactive material state:</p><p id="p-0077" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b6;=<i>l</i><sub>l</sub><i>&#x2212;l</i><sub>a</sub><i>/l</i><sub>l</sub>&#xd7;100<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">Mechanical work can be calculated from a force-control procedure according to actuator displacement (l<sub>l</sub>&#x2212;l<sub>a</sub>) in meters and applied load (F).

Within a yarn or a garment (or even on a fiber or filament within these structures), there may be forces that are present. When the materials of a fabric or garment are in an inactive state, these forces are referred to as &#x201c;inactive forces.&#x201d; Inactive forces are found in nearly all conventional, knitted materials. &#x201c;Active&#x201d; forces, on the other hand, occur as a result of a shape memory or superelastic transition. Such active forces can be generated, for example, by a change in temperature, electrical charge, current, light, pH or other chemical contact, or applied force. &#x201c;Active&#x201d; forces are generally reversible at will by removing the stimulus that created them, subject to hysteresis effects, which makes them quick to actuate or deactivate. As an active material within a garment transitions, additional forces may be applied both to that material and to others within the fabric or garment.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0078">Total active force gathered from a displacement-control procedure is the force-observed while the actuator was in an active material state (T=120&#xb0; C.). Generated force (&#x394;f) is calculated as the difference between the actuator force in inactive and active material states (f<sub>a</sub>,f<sub>i</sub>).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;<i>F=f</i><sub>a</sub><i>&#x2212;f</i><sub>i </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0083" num="0079">A more complete understanding of the transitions possible via active materials, and resultant phenomena, can be found in the previously-filed PCT application PCT/US2018/063066 (published as WO 2019/108794 on Jun. 6, 2019), the contents of which are incorporated in their entirety. For example, the force/length diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> of the incorporated reference is representative of first-order effects in an active material, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>8</b></figref> show second and third-order effects, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>12</b> and <b>23</b>A-<b>28</b>C</figref> show third-level (or system-level) effects.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0080">Auxetic. The term &#x201c;auxetic&#x201d; refers to a structure or material that expands in directions perpendicular to an applied tensile force or contracts in directions perpendicular to a compressive force (i.e., has a negative Poisson's ratio). Auxetic materials described herein are referred to as &#x2018;active auxetic&#x2019;, meaning that a non-contact stimulus (i.e., no applied forces) can be used to cause a structure or material to contract bi-axially or expand biaxially. Active auxetic structures and materials herein may include filaments, yarns, or entire fabrics or garments.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0081">Compression Garment. A garment that exhibits sufficient compression (i.e., force per unit area) to accomplish medical, therapeutic treatments such as treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) or treatment of circulatory or lymph conditions, for example.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0082">Self-fitting. A garment herein is referred to as &#x201c;self-fitting&#x201d; garment if it is designed to contract to an accurate fit for the wearer. Self-fitting garments may be compression garments, but need not provide medical or therapeutic levels of compression in all instances. The level of force applied by a self-fitting garment should, in many cases, be smaller than that of a therapeutic compression garment, while the total displacement should be larger. Other garments, fabrics, or portions thereof can be made of &#x201c;passive&#x201d; material, which refers to materials that do not exhibit a shape-memory transition.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0083">First-Order Effects. As used herein, a first-order effect is one that affects a single fiber or filament. For example, a single filament or fiber may be designed to perform a particular effect upon transition from martensite to austenite or vice versa. A single fiber or filament may also be twisted or coiled to exhibit a first-order effect. The material filament composition&#x2014;the foundation of the hierarchy&#x2014;can determine the base mechanical properties of an entire textile. Active properties, such as variable stiffness and shape recovery, can be embedded within the textile hierarchy through the inclusion of an active filament, such as a hydrogel or shape memory polymer (SMP) filament, or active bimorph/composite filament.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0084">Second-Order Effects. A second-order effect is an effect caused by the interaction between multiple filaments arranged in a yarn. Yarns that include multiple plies, twist styles or tightness, and materials can exhibit second-order effects that occur upon activation of any functional elements therein. Traditional material filaments, such as silk, cotton, polyethylene, and nylon, have also been shown to accomplish linear and torsional actuation in yarn constructions through thermally- or hygroscopically-induced fiber volume increase. This approach is highly adaptable and illustrative of the functional flexibility of textile hierarchies.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0085">Yarn spinning alters the mechanical properties of the original material filament by pre-stressing and constraining the materials in a helical geometry. The design parameters for a continuous filament yarn, including the number of bundled filaments and the applied twist per unit length, tune the flexural rigidity, breaking strength, and strain elongation of the yarn. When active filaments, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), shape memory alloys (SMA), and polymers, are reconfigured into yarn constructions, often called artificial muscles, the properties of the active filament are modified and even imbued with new capabilities, such as torsional actuation.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0086">In embodiments the filament can be incorporated into a yarn, which is a combination of filaments. Alternatively, in embodiments the filament can be incorporated into a thread, which comprises multiple yarns or filaments bound in a braid pattern. Each of the filaments that make up a yarn or a thread can be a functional filament, or in embodiments functional threads can be interspersed among non-functional filaments.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0087">Third-Order Effects. Third-order effects are the cumulative effects of first- and second-order effects when filaments and/or yarns are combined into a fabric or garment. The multi-level hierarchy of textiles including first, second, and third-order effects can be thought of as material filament composition, yarn construction, and textile geometry, for example. Complex third-order effects can be system architecture level effects, generating active textile structures with enhanced programmability and scalability, using ubiquitous manufacturing techniques and infrastructure.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0088">The mechanical characteristics of active filaments and yarns can be further tuned by reconfiguring these 1D elements into 2D textile geometries, such as weaves, knits, or braids, to produce lightweight, compact, and conformal actuation across a scalable and distributed surface. Woven and braided textile geometries, which are opposing rows of interlocked filaments or yarns, aggregate active 1D elements to produce a scalable and distributed surface that closely resembles the mechanical characteristics of the single active 1D element. Alternatively, knitted textile geometries, which are loop-based structures, have been shown to behave like origami tessellation patterns, embedding variable surface topography and shapes into the textile geometry. Active filaments reconfigured into weft knit geometries can accomplish complex actuation motions, include folding, curling, contraction, and corrugation. When wrapped around volumetric forms, 2D active textiles can be reconfigured into 3D system architectures with complex and dynamic behaviors.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0089">Use of a variety of fabric components of patterns can create garments that improve upon existing compression garments by providing features such as a passive tension-feedback system incorporated in series with embedded shape memory alloy filaments, or filaments made of other smart materials that can transform between an active, constrictive state and a passive, loose state upon a controlled change in stimulus (e.g., temperature, magnetic field). The resulting smart fabric will undergo shape memory change to provide compression only when the tension in the active component is below a threshold. In the event that the level of compression in a portion of the garment exceeds the threshold, &#x201c;circuit breaker&#x201d; switch elements in the garment disconnect the electrical power from that portion of the garment, which stalls resistive heating until the portion of the garment has cooled and relaxed sufficiently to reduce the tension to a desired level.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0090">In some embodiments, the shape memory alloy elements are configured to change between martensite and austenite forms upon donning the garment, based on ambient conditions. For example, in some embodiments exposure to room temperature causes the garment to change from martensite to austenite. Alternatively, in other embodiments exposure to skin temperature is sufficient to cause the garment to change from martensite to austenite. The shape memory transition causes compression of the garment, such that an initially loose-fitting garment will become a compression garment that is tight fitting up to, and including, tight enough to act as a clinical compression garment.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0091">Materials are described herein that can be used to generate active fabrics, including fabrics that include active components in specific locations. Filaments are described herein that include multiple heterogeneous portions, at least some of which are made of active materials. Active materials are those that have some active or functional properties, such as actuatable mechanical components (e.g., piezoelectrics, electro-mechanical components, thermo-mechanical components, and shape memory materials), electrically functional components (e.g., conductive, semiconductive, or photoelectric materials), or actuatable thermal components (e.g., materials that undergo exothermic or endothermic reactions upon exposure to stimulus, or electrically resistive materials that produce heat upon exposure to an electrical potential).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0092">In embodiments, functional fabrics can be manufactured from multi-material or heterogeneous filaments. The multi-material filaments can be additively manufactured to create transitions between materials within a short distance relative to the loops of the knitted structure. Thus fabrics can be created from filament such that the fabric has precisely placed features. The precisely placed features can include electrically conductive or insulative portions, shape-memory portions, piezoelectric portions, elastic or inelastic portions, and any other mechanical, electrical, or thermal features.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0093">By additively manufacturing the filament, functional features can be integrated into the fabric that have different physical characteristics compared to a functional fabric that is additively manufactured in situ. For example, each of the yarns, threads, or filaments of a knitted material that is additively manufactured in situ will be unstressed in the absence of some outside force acting upon the fabric. In contrast, when a yarn, thread, or filament is integrated into a knitted structure, the yarn, thread, or filament is deformed into loops to fit into the structure of the rest of the fabric. This deformation results in tension on each individual yarn, thread, or filament, even when the overall fabric is not being acted upon by any external force. Therefore, a knitted active fabric behaves differently from one that is built in place by an additive manufacturing machine, which cannot form objects that are under tension in their resting state.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0094">By incorporating yarns in functional fabrics, force, displacement, and third-order effects can be tuned for desired first-order functional effects.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third-Order Effects Using Filaments and Fibers</heading><p id="p-0099" num="0095">Functional textiles with programmable, multi-axial, distributed, and scalable actuation are highly desirable and presently unrealized. As noted above, third-order effects can be generated by varying the size of fibers used, knitting/braiding/stitching pattern, overall garment shape, level of friction between fibers, material makeup of fibers, forces on the fibers during fabrication, and forces on the fibers during activation, but no overarching model describes this behavior. As described herein, however, use of 1D torque-unbalanced active yarns within 2D textile structures can produce desired materials such as soft and scalable active textiles that exhibit tunable displacements, forces, stiffnesses, and kinematic deformations.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0096">While recent advances in active textiles have focused on active yarns (e.g., artificial muscles), investigations into multi-level textile hierarchies are rare. Prior work examining active yarn constructions reconfigured into textile geometries have been limited to work with torque-balanced active microfilament bundles, which accomplish axial actuation only and contain thousands of active filaments (nf&#x3e;1000). Until now, no multi-scale, mechanics-based investigation of textile geometries and system architectures has been performed that exploits unique and unpredictable characteristics of torque-unbalanced 1D active yarns composed of few filaments (nf&#x3c;7) that accomplish axial and torsional actuation as described herein. These structures are shown to accomplish new, multi-scale kinematic motions by exploiting the structural elastic instability of active filaments in pure torsion.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0097">This new kinematic motion is shown to enhance the performance of active textiles, amplifying actuation contraction, specific work, and blocked force compared to active textiles composed of untwisted filaments. Additionally, these active textiles accomplish new modes of multifunctional and spatial actuation, including variable recruitment actuation, functionally graded kinematic actuation, and active auxetic effects.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0098">Variable recruitment actuation is the result of second-order effects in yarn constructions containing a mix of active filaments (each having its own first-order effect) to enable multi-step actuation regimes. Functionally graded kinematic actuation (a third-order effect) is accomplished by strategically selecting/deselecting different yarn constructions within a single textile to produce tuned and localized mechanical properties throughout a continuous textile surface. Active auxetic effects are accomplished through the addition of filament torsion, which produces controllable structural buckling and introduces axial actuation in both axes of a 2D structure.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0099">Active auxetic effects can produce structural anisotropy, enabling unique actuation performance across both perpendicular axes. Through a textile hierarchical spanning active material composition, yarn construction, textile geometry, and system architecture, these active textiles accomplish kinetic tunability, variable recruitment behaviors, and auxetic effects without mechanical contact, called active auxetic effects. These new modes of pre-programmed multi-axial performance are enabled by geometrically manipulating&#x2014;specifically pre-stressing and constraining&#x2014;active filaments in torsion and leveraging their structural elastic instability within a textile geometry. Experimental data illustrates that the new kinematic motion afforded by torque-unbalanced active yarns enhances the performance of active textiles, which accomplish tensile strokes over 40%, generated blocked forces up to 308 N/m, and specific work over 0.4. kJ/kg.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> depict the contraction of a series of shape memory filaments in a needle lace pattern <b>100</b>A with buttonhole stitches, according to an embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an un-tensioned, unactivated needlelace pattern, with the material in the martensitic state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a detailed view of one loop of the overall pattern depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.

Common auxetic structures include re-entrant, rotating polygon, chiral, crumpled sheet, and perforated sheet models, such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>F</figref>. Traditional textile structures have utilized auxetic models to induce auxetic textile behavior, specifically weft and warp knitted fabrics. Alternatively, auxetic warp knit structures have utilized manufacturing guide bars to inlay limiting yarns into open chain or pillar stitches. Few auxetic structures, however, whether textile or non-textile, have been made from or incorporated active materials. As disclosed herein, the use of active materials in textiles presents new ways of leveraging bending and torsion inherent to traditional textiles structures to design actuating auxetic textile structures with active material filaments. Likewise, novel applications of shape memory materials result in unique forms of anisotropy or shear in the design and performance of active textiles. In addition to smart wearable garments, the creation of active auxetic, anisotropic, and shearing textiles enables advancements for soft robots, reconfigurable aerospace structures, and medical devices.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0118">Such applications can incorporate the knitting patterns previously described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>P</figref>.

The SME, or the ability to recover large mechanical deformations, is demonstrated when SMA is deformed in a lower-temperature, less stiff martensite state and recovers that deformation through a thermally-induced transition to a higher-temperature, higher-force austenite state. SE behavior enables SMA to maintain constant forces/stresses over large plateau strains, making the material an excellent mechanical damper.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0119">The characteristics of the fabrics made in this way showed that these knitting patterns, when combined with smart materials, produce complex actuation behaviors. Prior work on SMA knitted actuators has explored axial contraction, curling, or corrugation, as described in co-pending application 62/831,276, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Each of the five textiles depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>P</figref> exhibited shape memory recovery of mechanical deformations imposed in the manufacturing process to produced novel actuation behaviors, such as biaxial contraction (v=&#x2212;0.3 to &#x2212;1.5) and shear (&#x394;&#x3b8;=7&#xb0;. Force-displacement testing suggests that these active structures have the potential to be powerful actuators with unique, anisotropic behaviors that could be tailored for a given application.

Likewise, the cross-section of a passive material may be modified to adjust the overall second-order effects exhibited by the yarn.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> depict another variable that can be controlled in designing a yarn for a particular second-order effect: twisting. Spun yarns can be designed with a set number of twists per inch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> shows a yarn <b>500</b> with a relatively higher number of twists per inch, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> shows a yarn <b>502</b> with a relatively lower number of twists per inch. The number of twists per inch can also be described in terms of the helix angle during the yarn formation process, shown in dashed lines. To set a desired number of twists per inch, the yarn axis can be set by modifying the ratio of transverse stress to cord stress (i.e., the yarn stress vector angle) as the yarn is being formed. During manufacture, level of twist is accomplished through a ratio of rotational speed N and yarn delivery speed V. The yarn stress, including both transverse and cord components, is typically a level of stress present in the un-activated, martensite state of the fibers, and remains in the yarn as an inactive force. In some circumstances, however, the yarn can also be formed with the fibers in the activated, austenite state (such as by twisting the fibers at a high temperature).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0129">In alternative embodiments, spinning the material in the martensite state can be used to detwin the material. As long as spinning stresses are below a threshold, detwinning the material during spinning can give the yarns formed by this process more actuation potential. Above that threshold, the materials could experience some plasticity.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0130">Spinning the material above the austenite finish temperature could still result in yarn detwinning if the tensile force from spinning is large enough to stress the material into a martensite state. Otherwise, the material is spun in an austenite state and needs higher applied loads post-spinning to detwin and observe actuation.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0131">Spinning in the austenite state can produce unique spun yarn architecture when used with SMA materials with different transition temperatures. Material state during spinning can be used to generate different actuation performance. It may be beneficial to change the ambient temperature during the spinning process to ensure a material is in a specific material state during spinning. For example, spinning variable recruitment yarns in room temp with different transition temperatures (2 yarns austenite and 1 yarn martensite at spin) produces incompatible yarns that have elements that buckle outward upon actuation. If such individual filament buckling is not desirable, then heating the room above the highest austenite finish temperature or cooling the room below the lowest martensite finish temperature will ensure that all filaments are spun either in an austenite or martensite state, respectively. This improves yarn compatibility, or specifically mitigates individual filament buckling, for embodiments in which such phenomena are not desired. In other embodiments, individual filament buckling may be desirable either alone or in combination with knit loop buckling, and conditions can be set during spinning accordingly.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Active and Inactive Forces in Yarns to Create Second-Order Effects</heading><p id="p-0136" num="0132">A mechanics-based investigation of active textiles composed of torque-unbalanced active yarns (here, called torque-unbalanced active textiles) starts with an understanding of the design variables that tune the properties of torque-unbalanced active filaments and yarns. In solid mechanics, a filament in torsion experiences shear strains and stresses that start at the outer surface of the filament and migrate towards filament center upon an increase in the torsional moment. Because SMA material phases (i.e., austenite, martensite) are stress and temperature dependent (see FIG. 3 of WO 2019/108794 A1), shear stresses and strains produced by yarn spinning influence the stress distribution and, consequently, phase transformation capabilities of active filaments and yarns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> shows a yarn made up of three fibers (1, 2, and 3) having a set number of twists per centimeter (tpcm) and with a given surface filament helical bias angle (&#x3b1;sf).

Maximum actuation contraction of the torque-balanced active textile occurred under minimum loading conditions. Conversely, the actuation contraction of the torque-unbalanced textile (t=1.8 tpcm) peaked at about 4.1 N. Under low applied loads (F&#x3c;1.8 N), maximum actuation contraction for the torque-unbalanced active textile did not occur because the applied loads (F) were not sufficient to overcome either the martensitic or austenitic critical buckling force for the textile (P<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00010" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230002937A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, P<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00011" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230002937A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>). Consequently, only partial loop rotation occurred upon actuation. Under large applied loads (F&#x3e;4.5 N), snarl formation (i.e., rotation) in the knitted loop was inhibited because the applied loads (F) were greater than both the austenitic and martensitic critical buckling tensile forces (P<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00012" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230002937A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, P<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00013" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230002937A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>). Maximum actuation contraction occurred at an applied load (F) of 4.5 N, which was approximately equivalent to the austenitic critical buckling tensile force.

Because filament twist increases material stresses without increasing material mass, this increase in actuation displacement translated to a large increase in an active textile's specific work.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0179">The geometry of knitted loop buckle and snarl also enhances actuation performance in the x-axis of the torque-unbalanced active textile. The torque-balanced active textile shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> exhibited slight expansion (rather than contraction) under low load (F=0.25 N) as the knitted loop head apexes stiffened and broadened across a 2D plane, a behavior that is consistent with a positive Poisson's Ratio textile. For a torque-unbalanced active textile (t=1.8 tpcm), actuation contraction in the x-axis was enabled by the introduction of filament torsion, which causes the knitted loop head to reverse about the y-axis and shorten the spacing between loops in the x-axis. As applied loads increased for both textiles, x-axis actuation contraction settled at 5%&#x2014; the maximum actuation contraction for a SMA yarn. This comparative analysis of torque-balanced and torque-unbalanced active textiles illustrates that both textiles exhibit structurally anisotropic performance&#x2014;accomplishing different actuation contraction and specific work in perpendicular axes&#x2014;with instances of identical (overlapping) performance. The analysis also suggests that torque-unbalanced active textiles can accomplish a larger performance range than torque-balanced active textiles, which can be tuned by strategically modifying design variables within the textile hierarchy.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0180">It should be understood that tension and torque can also be applied due to the overall geometry of the garment. For example, a knitted garment in a twisted loop (e.g., a M&#xf6;bius loop) can maintain a level of tension on the yarns or fibers that make up the garment. More complex garment shapes or arrangements of knit patterns within a larger structure can result in a variety of tensions throughout that structure, which can be selectively arranged to create desired buckling behavior (or lack thereof) as different active materials within the garment are actuated or deactivated.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0181">The actuation properties of active textiles can be further tuned by manipulating yarn construction, which modifies the critical buckling forces of the filament, yarn, and textile (P<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00015" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230002937A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>) as well as the material stress state. Physics-based relationships for filaments in torsion indicate that increasing the number of active filaments will increase the critical austenitic buckling force in a textile.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0182">To investigate this relationship, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, two torque-unbalanced active yarns were made with either two or four SMA filaments and otherwise equivalent yarn constructions (i.e., d=0.076 mm, t=1.8 tpcm). Both active yarns 2/1.8 and 4/1.8 had approximately equivalent yarn diameters (D<sub>2/1.8</sub>=0.15 mm; D<sub>4/1.8</sub>=0.18 mm) and were reconfigured into active textiles with approximately equivalent loop lengths (L<sub>2/1.8</sub>=8.3 mm; L<sub>4/1.8</sub>=8.8 mm). Doubling active filaments slightly increased actuation contraction at double the applied load, which corresponded with the increased critical austenitic buckling force (P<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00016" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230002937A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>=0.2 N; P<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00017" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230002937A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>=0.4 N). In untwisted constructions, increasing the number of filaments included in a textile decreases actuation contraction by half in response to a reduced ratio of loop enclosed area and active cross-sectional area. In twisted constructions, actuation kinematics are governed by loop buckle and flip (as opposed to bending only), enabling an increase in yarn stiffness without inhibiting actuation motion. This enhanced macroscopic actuation translated to an increase in specific work over 60% (0.16 kJ/kg for two filaments and 0.26 kJ/kg for four filaments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0183">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, kinematic tunability is enabled by modifications to yarn construction. Active textiles composed of torque-unbalanced active yarns can be kinematically tuned by modifying the number of filaments included in a yarn bundle and the amount of twist inserted into that yarn bundle. Actuation contraction and maximum specific work is increased by increasing yarn filament count. Above the critical stress state, actuation contraction is reduced by increasing twist per unit length while specific work is unaffected by yarn twist. As shown in pane B, total active force per meter width is approximately doubled by increasing the number of filaments in a yarn bundle while actuation force, or the difference between the active and inactive forces, per meter width is unchanged. Active force per meter width is unaffected by increased twist per unit length; however, above the critical stress state, actuation force per meter width is reduced as twist increases.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0184">Increasing the number of active filaments in a yarn bundle can also increase the total active force (f<sub>a</sub>) (here, equivalent to an austenite material state force) of an active textile in a structural strain controlled configuration; however, increasing filaments does not affect the active textile's generated force (&#x394;f). Three active yarns (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, 2/3.5, 3/3.5, and 4/3.5) were made with either two, three, or four SMA filaments and otherwise equivalent yarn constructions (i.e., d=0.127 mm, t=3.5 tpcm). Yarns 2/3.5, 3/3.5, and 4/3.5 were reconfigured into active textiles with similar average loop lengths of 8.4 mm, 8.3 mm, and 8.2 mm, respectively. Increasing filaments from two to three produced a 40% increase in total active force per meter width (&#x3b5;=60%; f<sub>a,2/3.5</sub>=278 N/m, f<sub>a,3/3.5</sub>=378 N/m, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>). Increasing further from two to four filaments produced an over 80% increase in active force per meter width (&#x3b5;=60%; f<sub>a,2/3.5</sub>=278 N/m, f<sub>a,4/3.5</sub>=500 N/m). The generated force (&#x394;f), however, was approximately equivalent for all three textiles. This stabilization of generated force occurred because active force (f<sub>a</sub>) and inactive force (f<sub>l </sub>increase linearly with added active material, eliminating gains in generated force (&#x394;f=f<sub>a</sub>&#x2212;f<sub>l </sub>as described above).</p><p id="p-0203" num="0185">While the addition of filament torsion has been shown to enhance actuation properties in an active textile, the behavior of active filaments and yarns in torsion suggests that actuation performance in a textile should decrease when filaments are stressed beyond a critical stress state. To investigate this relationship in a textile, two active yarns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> were made with either 1.8 or 4.7 tpcm to produce different stress states (&#x3c3;<sub>eq,4/1.8</sub>=658 MPa; &#x3c3;<sub>eq,4/4.7</sub>=680 MPa, Table S5). Otherwise, both yarns 4/1.8 and 4/4.7 had equivalent yarn constructions (i.e., d=0.076 mm, four filaments) and textile geometries (L<sub>4/1.8</sub>=8.8 mm; L<sub>4/4.7</sub>=9.3 mm). Increasing yarn twist from 1.8 tpcm to 4.7 tpcm decreased maximum actuation contraction from 40% (4/1.8) to 28% (4/4.7), indicating reduced phase transformation at the outer filament radius. The increase in twist had little effect on specific work, which was approximately equivalent for active textiles 4/1.8 and 4/4.7 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, ii). Here, equivalent specific work can be attributed to a decrease in sample mass (m) between samples 4/1.8 and 4/4.7 (m<sub>4/1.8</sub>=264 mg, m<sub>4/4.7</sub>=170 mg), which occurred in response to filament packing and elongation produced during high-twist yarn spinning.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0186">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, surpassing the critical stress state of active yarns also produces textiles that exhibit reduced blocked force in structural strain-controlled conditions. To demonstrate, three active yarns (i.e., d=0.127 mm, three filaments) were constructed with 1.8 tpcm, 3.5 tpcm, and 4.7 tpcm and equivalent textile geometries. Increasing twist from 1.8 to 3.5 to 4.7 did not affect total active force (&#x3b5;=60%; f<sub>a,3/1.8</sub>=395 N/m, f<sub>a,3/3.5</sub>=379 N/m, f<sub>a,3/4.7</sub>=388 N/m). Generated force (&#x394;f), however, declined with increased yarn twist. Increasing twist from 1.8 tpcm to 3.5 tpcm produced a 60% drop in generated force (E=60%; &#x394;f<sub>3/1.8</sub>=308 N/m, &#x394;f<sub>3/3.5</sub>=126 N/m). Further increasing twist to 4.7 tpcm produced a 90% drop in generated force (&#x3b5;=60%; &#x394;f<sub>3/1.8</sub>=308 N/m, &#x394;f<sub>3/4.7</sub>=29 N/m). This decrease in generated force can be directly attributed to increased manufacturing stresses (&#x3c3;<sub>eq,3/1.8</sub>=620 MPa; &#x3c3;<sub>eq,3/3.5</sub>=820 MPA, &#x3c3;<sub>eq,4/0.7</sub>=1180 MPa, Table S5) that reduce material phase change potential at the outer filament radius when above 663 MPa. The total active force did not decrease because the structures were dominated by a stiff, detwinned martensite material state. These results demonstrate that manipulating filament stresses through yarn spinning and modifying yarn-level geometric design parameters to manipulate the critical buckling forces are effective design tools to tune the mechanical performance of active textiles for applications with specific actuation contraction, work, or generated force requirements.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Multifunctional Applications</heading><p id="p-0205" num="0187">As described above, materials can be used to form compression garments that begin looser (inactive) and become tighter upon actuation. Haptic feedback garments can be created using these materials that have larger range of shape change potential. On-body compression garments can be generated that start out with low, inactive forces, and reach higher force applied compared to monofilaments of the same SMA materials. Other applications can include suturing or fabric-like systems, which are analogous to shape-change fabrics but can be deployed within the body. Energy absorption is also contemplated, as described above, such as fabrics or pads that are arranged in a shoe for force absorption, or in a vest or sporting apparel like a football helmet or ski suit to prevent injury from impacts.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0188">By scaling the dimensions of a 2D active textile sample, the multifunctional properties of a textile sample can be translated to a 3D system architecture. When composed of variable recruitment <b>1</b>D active yarns, 2D active textiles and 3D system architectures exhibit sequential, temperature-dependent actuation. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, a variable recruitment active textile sleeve can be wrapped around a fluid-filled silicone cylinder (V=115 cm<sup>3</sup>) to demonstrate variable constriction capabilities. In a fully inactive material state (T&#x3c;Mf), the circumferential force produced by the sleeve did not affect the initial fluid height, which was 12 cm. Upon increasing the thermal load above the active temperature for one active material element (e.g., T=68&#xb0; C.), the active textile sleeve contracted, producing a force greater than the critical buckling force of the elastic tube. Tube buckling was accompanied by a reduction in cross-sectional area, which produced a 5 mm increase in water height and a corresponding 4.8 cm<sup>3 </sup>fluid volume displacement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). Further increase in temperature (T=138&#xb0; C.) recruited the second active filament, which increased the water height an additional 3 mm and displaced an additional fluid volume of 2.9 cm<sup>3</sup>. Characterization was conducted with an infrared camera to correlate applied temperature to changing fluid column height. The variable constriction pump is an example of one of many applications that benefits from variable recruitment actuation behavior embedded within distributed and scalable active textiles. Aggregating multiple variable constriction pump units would enable peristaltic motions and/or localized flow control.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0189">Novel modes of textile-based actuation are demonstrated here through three prototypes, including (a) a variable constriction pump that utilizes variable recruitment yarn compositions to perform sequential actuation, (b) an active auxetic shoe that conforms multi-axially around the complex contours of the foot, and (c) an assistive wrist sleeve that simultaneously anchors itself around the wrist and provides motion assistance, leveraging the actuation contraction and work capabilities of active textiles across multiple axes. These advances in active textiles, enabled by exploiting the structural elastic instability of torque-unbalanced active filaments and yarns within traditional textile geometries, demonstrate new modes of actuation, scaled across 1D, 2D, and 3D spheres, that diversify the types of approaches available for a wide range of multifunctional applications. Advances in 2D programmable surfaces can be implemented in multifunctional 3D applications, such as a variable constriction pump that exhibits sequential actuation, a wearable that conforms multi-axially around the body, or a soft exoskeleton that performs assistive motions and on-body anchoring simultaneously. By harnessing the capabilities of active materials within a textile hierarchy, the potentiality of functional textiles in enhanced.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0190">Active textiles can contract in multiple orientations, enabling a 3D system architecture to accomplish active auxetic behaviors and conform around complex 3D volumes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B</figref> depict a shoe according an embodiment, similar to the one described in copending application PCT/US2020/050495 and commonly assigned to the instant application, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0191">Auxetic behavior can be leveraged in applications such as contractile wearables that provide dynamic fit adjustments in product lengths and widths, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B</figref>. Here, auxetic capabilities provide enhanced shoe fit accuracy and stiffness, features desirable in footwear and many wearable robotic applications. In an inactive material state (T&#x3c;Mf), a multi-axially conforming shoe has a compliant and oversized knitted upper composed of active textiles and can be pulled easily over the foot. Upon thermal stimulation (T&#x3e;Af), the shoe upper contracts and stiffens in length and width to provide a supportive and contoured hold around the foot. While the auxetic system architecture is demonstrated with a common, high-temperature SMA material (i.e., 90&#xb0; C. FLEXINOL&#xae;), the design methods can be replicated using alternative SMA composition, such as low-temperature, nickel-rich SMA, or an alternative active material, such as a shape memory polymer, to enable self-fitting with body heat or active fitting with low applied heat. For dynamically conforming wearables that do not apply significant compression force to the body, system patterns, which are composed of 2D active textiles and wrapped around a volume to form a 3D system architecture, were designed to match the body dimensions in an active material state. Inactive system dimensions were consequently larger than the body dimensions.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0192">Evaluation of the system body interface through a contact measurement method demonstrates little contact between the active textile upper and the foot before actuation and nearly 100% contact upon actuation. The slight contact measurement in an inactive material state (17%) in the upper right portion of the shoe upper occurred from the active textile falling under its own weight and resting on the foot during some test trials. While good contact (100%) was achieved throughout the center part of the active textile upper upon actuation, the sides of the upper accomplished unstable contact (50%). These side regions, which interface with the foot arch, could accomplish improved contact by changing the shape of the rubber shoe sole, which was wide for the foot cast. The results demonstrate that active textiles that exhibit active auxetic effects can enable multi-directional contraction and stiffening around complex volumes, capabilities that could improve the system-body interface of wearable robotics, wearable haptic systems, and a vast number of consumer products.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0193">According to another embodiment and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, multifunctional system architectures are demonstrated in an assistive wrist sleeve. As shown in panel (A), the assistive wrist sleeve design with anatomical and dynamic anchors. As shown in panel (B), the inactive assistive wrist sleeve allows the wrist to assume a natural flexion, with angle, &#x3b1;i. Upon thermal loading, the sleeve contracts to lift the hand and simultaneously anchor around the wrist to produce an extended position, represented by a reduced angle, &#x3b1;a. As shown in panel (C), actuation was observed with an infrared camera. As shown in panel (D), image tracking was conducted to track hand motion and characterize wrist angle change upon actuation.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0194">Active textiles can perform structurally anisotropic actuation contraction in two different orientations, enabling 3D systems to accomplish discrete tasks in perpendicular axes. Here, an assistive wrist sleeve is designed to provide motion assistance to the wrist joint by lifting the hand from a natural, flexed position to a neutral position upon actuation. Extension of the wrist is primarily driven by actuation contraction along the dorsal length of the hand and wrist, which lifts the hand from a flexed position (associated with a longer dorsal length) to a neutral position (associated with a shortened dorsal length). To translate dorsal length actuation contraction of the active textile glove to a change in wrist angle, the glove must be anchored, proximally and distally, to the body. In prior wearable robotic demonstrations, anchoring around the body has been accomplished with passive, adjustable straps and braces that increase device complexity and discomfort. Dynamic anchoring around the body with a multifunctional and structurally anisotropic active textile that can contract circumferentially around the conical volume of the low wrist and, at the same time, lift the weight of the hand. While the finger gussets of a glove provide simple mechanical anchoring distally, shifting proximal anchoring to a dynamic and impermanent mechanism improves device wear comfort and usability. For contractile systems that generate forces around the body and/or lift loads (e.g., the hand), system patterns are developed around active textile dimensions under a fixed actuator strain and/or an applied load. Active material state system dimensions are consequently smaller than the body dimensions.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0195">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>, panel (A), active textile dimensions are arranged in an inactive and active material state. As shown in panel (B) (<b>1</b>), a drape pattern making method was used to develop the initial 2D pattern shape, while in panel (B)(<b>2</b>) the 2D fabric was removed from the 3D shape and laid flat to reveal the flat pattern. As shown in panel (C), the fabric pattern was traced and subdivided into pattern segments corresponding to the function of the wrist sleeve. Finally, as shown in panel (D), dimensional specifications for the active textile assistive wrist sleeve in inactive and active material states.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0196">The assistive wrist sleeve was characterized through a standard motion tracking analysis. In an inactive material state (T&#x3c;Mf), the wrist fell under the weight of the hand, producing an inactive angle, &#x3b1;i, between marker points M<b>0</b>, M<b>1</b>, and M<b>2</b>. Upon actuation of the topmost region of the wrist sleeve (T&#x3e;Af), the sleeve contracted to anchor around the wrist and simultaneously lifted the hand, producing an active angle, &#x3b1;a. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref> depicts the results of infrared imaging analysis used to characterize thermal loading, which was accomplished with a standard heat gun. The assistive wrist sleeve was found to produce a wrist angle change of 12. The flexed angle of the wrist while the device was in an inactive material state (&#x3b1;i) was 163&#xb0;. Device actuation produced a maximum angle extension (&#x3b1;a) of 175&#xb0;. The results demonstrate successful use of structurally anisotropic actuation within a system, as the change in wrist angle could only be accomplished with both longitudinal contraction and distal dynamic anchoring to translate contraction to hand lift. Future work will investigate the design of wearable devices using alternative active material compositions, such as SMA materials that can be actuated at lower temperatures, and heating and cooling regimes designed to improve thermal comfort.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0197">According to one embodiment, consumer shapewear begins in a looser (inactive) state and becomes tight upon actuation. In another embodiment, a dynamic wearable bracing (e.g. ankle brace, knee brace) is contemplated that can be turned on or off or tuned in stiffness. Self-fitting garments can be designed using the tunable variables described above such that the garments are pulled towards the body with a superelastic or SMA element in a yarn bundle, which is actuated with body heat to self-fit once the fabric is in contact with the body.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0198">Self-fitting shoe uppers and clothing with auxetic capabilities are contemplated that enable the shoe upper or garment to expand and contract bi-directionally in response to changing foot/body volume between users. Robotic garments with actuator fabrics integrated in locations can be designed that facilitate movement (e.g., plantar flexion, elbow abduction) or assist lifting external loads (e.g., assembly line worker exoskeletons). Wearable mechanical damping fabrics can be designed for any other purpose that impacts the body, like backpack straps, hardhats or helmets, shin guards and elbow pads, shoe soles, or body armor, for example.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0199">Various embodiments of systems, devices, and methods have been described herein.
