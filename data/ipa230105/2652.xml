Both systems have advantages and disadvantages. Free-radical-hardening systems are distinguished by rapid low-temperature hardening (for example: &#x2212;10&#xb0; C.), but exhibit relatively high shrinkage and not very high pull-out values. On the other hand, epoxy/amine-based systems have a significantly slower hardening speed at low temperatures (for example: &#x3c;+5&#xb0; C.), but they exhibit considerably less shrinkage and significantly higher pull-out values.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Efforts have long been made to combine the advantages of both systems in the field of chemical fixing technology. For that purpose, dual-hardening binders have been proposed in the past which cure both by free-radical polymerisation and by polyaddition (epoxy+amine). This means that such hybrid systems are based on resin compositions that contain compounds which are hardenable by two different types of reaction. For example, EP 2 357 162 A1 describes a hybrid resin system which contains a free-radical-hardenable resin and an epoxy resin. The hardeners contain an aliphatic amine and a peroxide, especially a perester. A disadvantage of such a hybrid system is that it cannot be provided in a storage-stable form, especially as a two-component system. This is because the peresters, on account of their reactive carbonyl group, rapidly react with amines.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The problem of the present invention is to provide a hybrid system that combines rapid low-temperature hardening, as in the case of free-radical-polymerisable systems, with significantly higher pull-out values, as in the case of polyaddition-hardening systems (epoxy/amine).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A further problem for preferred aspects of the present invention is the provision of a fixing composition in the form of a hybrid system which avoids ingredients posing a high risk to health and which is preferably non-hazard classified.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Surprisingly it has been found that it is possible to achieve the advantages of previous systems if&#x2014;departing from the conventional types of polymerisation&#x2014;use is made of a hybrid system which includes the starting materials for a Michael addition (N- and/or C-Michael addition) and for an enamine reaction and thus makes available the possible range of reactions mentioned below.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Michael-addition-hardening systems are known from the field of floor coatings. For example, US 2018/0134913 A1 describes a coating that includes a CH-acidic compound as component A and an activated &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-unsaturated compound as component B. Both components cure in the presence of a strong base.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">DE 40 34 279 A1 describes an enamine reaction for the production of crosslinked products for use as coating. The enamine reaction takes place spontaneously between polyacetoacetates (reaction resin having CH-acidic methylene groups) and polyamines. Since, however, the corresponding systems have gel times that are much too short for practical use, DE 40 34 279 A1 proposes the use of primary aminosilanes. As a result, the crosslinking reaction is no longer part of the enamine reaction but is dependent upon the hydrolysis and condensation reaction of the silane.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A composition based on vinyl polymers and amines which is hardenable by aza-Michael addition (N-Michael addition) is described in EP 1 970 480 A1. Epoxy resins which are also able to react with the amines are advantageously additionally present in the hardenable composition.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Disadvantages of the above-mentioned disclosures are inter alia the considerably too short gel times of the enamine reaction between polyacetoacetates and polyamines and the unsatisfactory performance of the aza-Michael addition systems in the drilled hole.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The subject matter of the invention in a first embodiment of the invention is a hybrid system which comprises the following constituents:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">a) reaction resin based on &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-unsaturated compounds,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">b) reaction resin which includes compounds carrying CH-acidic methylene groups, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">c) primary amine.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">In addition, the hybrid system advantageously includes a catalyst.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">The hybrid system is preferably implemented in multi-component form, especially two-component form, preferably in the form of a multi-component kit, such as a two-component kit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">In a further embodiment, the invention relates also to the use of a multi-component hybrid system, especially a two-component hybrid system, composed as just described, as an adhesive, especially for fixing anchoring means in substrates, such as masonry or concrete, or, furthermore, for fixing fibres, laid fabrics, woven fabrics or composites for reinforcement of built structures.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">Corresponding processes and methods for mortar-bonded fixing of anchoring elements in holes or crevices, wherein a multi-component hybrid system, especially a two-component hybrid system, according to the invention (especially a multi-component or, preferably, two-component kit) is used for mortar-bonded fixing (adhesively bonded fixing) of anchoring means, the hybrid system and an anchoring means being introduced one after the other, especially first the hybrid system and then the anchoring means, or (at least substantially) simultaneously into a hole or crevice in a substrate (including in a cracked substrate, such as in cracked concrete), or mixed forms with partial introduction in each case, also form an embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">Embodiments of the invention will also be found in the claims which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">The inventors have surprisingly discovered that a hybrid system based on constituents a), b) and c) combines the advantages that are to be found, on the one hand, in free-radical-hardening chemical fixing systems and, on the other hand, in chemical fixing systems that harden by polyaddition, although no free-radical hardening is involved. This is surprising insofar as the reactions, which here take place in parallel, have never hitherto been combined in a hybrid system for chemical fixing technology.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">The following reactions can take place between constituents a), b) and c):<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0022">i.

Enamine reaction (CH-acidic compound+amine).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0020" num="0025">Without wishing to be bound by these explanations, depending upon the chosen molar ratios between constituents a), b) and c), it is possible for two of the said reactions to take place preferentially, but it cannot be ruled out that all three types of reaction will take place in parallel&#x2014;albeit in some cases possibly only to a very small extent.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0026">Reaction types i. to iii. are, each individually, known from the field of coatings, especially as floor coatings (see the corresponding patent specifications mentioned above). Since the forces arising in the drilled hole are entirely different from those of a (floor) coating, it was not obvious for the skilled person in the field of fixing technology for anchoring means to consider the use of the individually known reaction types i. to iii. on their own, or especially in the form of a hybrid system, for chemical fixing systems. For example, in the drilled hole&#x2014;considered macroscopically&#x2014;axial loading gives rise to enormous shear stresses which the system has to withstand, whereas a (floor) coating should rather withstand high compressive strengths and abrasion resistances.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0027">Furthermore, it has been found that a hybrid system based on constituents a), b) and c) meets the criteria applicable for usability under building site conditions. Those criteria are inter alia, on the one hand, sufficient stability at high temperatures (&#x3c;45&#xb0; C.) in order to prevent dripping and/or running out of the drilled hole, and, on the other hand, sufficiently low viscosity at low temperatures (&#x3e;&#x2212;25&#xb0; C.) in order to ensure it can be squeezed out of cartridges or the like by hand.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0028">Hereinabove and hereinbelow, one, some or all relatively general terms or features can be replaced in each case by more specifically mentioned definitions (especially those mentioned hereinbelow), resulting in specific, especially preferred, embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0029">Where &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; is used, this is to be primarily understood (unless otherwise apparent, for example by being preceded by &#x201c;at least&#x201d;) as the indefinite article and includes &#x201c;one (in figures: 1) or more&#x201d; and also just one (in figures: <b>1</b>).

Together with the Michael addition (real Michael addition/C-Michael addition) between the &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-unsaturated compound and the compound carrying CH-acidic methylene groups there is thus formed a strongly crosslinked and close-knit network, which would explain the very high bond stresses.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 5: Reference Tests</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0089">In order once again to underline the tremendous performance of the hybrid systems according to the invention, reference tests were carried out and the following bond stresses determined.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Reference tests in comparison with hybrid</entry></row><row><entry>systems according to the invention</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Item</entry><entry>Ref1</entry><entry>Ref2</entry><entry>B2.4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>TMPTAcAc</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>5.51</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>TMPTA [g]</entry><entry>9.96</entry><entry/><entry>10.06</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>RD20 [g]</entry><entry/><entry>10.57</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>TETA [g]</entry><entry>2.46</entry><entry>1.84</entry><entry>0.50</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>TMG [g]</entry><entry>0.10</entry><entry>0.10</entry><entry>0.10</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Minex-10 [g]</entry><entry>12.50</entry><entry>12.50</entry><entry>16.17</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Bond stress</entry><entry>21.0</entry><entry>16.2</entry><entry>30.2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>[N/mm<sup>2</sup>]</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">It will be apparent from Table 6 that neither reference test Ref1 (acrylate&#x2014;amine/N-Michael addition) nor reference test Ref2 (classic epoxide&#x2014;amine reaction) achieves the high bond stresses of the hybrid systems according to the invention, despite a similar chemical structure of the starting materials.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 6: Composition and Determination of the Onset and Glass Transition Temperatures of Hybrid Systems According to the Invention</heading><p id="p-0092" num="0091">On exceeding the glass transition temperature, a solid polymer enters into a rubber-like to viscous state.
