</sup>generation mobile network (5G) standard, referred to as 5G New Radio (NR), is being developed to provide higher capacity, higher reliability, and lower latency communications than the 4G long term evolution (LTE) standard. Under the current 5G standard, a network service provider, such as a cellular telephony provider, deploys a single network repository function (NRF) device to service a single mobile country code (MCC)-mobile network code (MNC) of a public land mobile network (PLMN). The NRF maintains priority, capacity and/or availability information related to network functions (NFs), e.g., network services, network service functions, core network service functions, etc., available on the core network (e.g., a 5G network, etc.), as well as the services supported by the NFs.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, the current 5G standard does not provide support for multiple and/or redundant NRF devices to operate on the same MCC-MNC of a PLMN. Consequently, the 5G standard does not provide support for load-balancing NF queries and/or write requests among a plurality of NRF devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, an approach is desired that provides a fault-tolerant multi-NRF network topology for a wireless communication network, including providing redundancy and/or failover support for NRF device(s) and/or NF device(s), as well as load-balancing functionality for NF requests, on the wireless communication network.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one example embodiment relates to a network repository function (NRF) device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In at least one example embodiment, the NRF device may include a memory storing computer readable instructions, and at least one processor configured to execute the computer readable instructions.

For example, when an NF device, such as NF device <b>310</b> transmits a NF query request to the NRF cluster <b>200</b>, any one of the NRF devices of the NRF cluster <b>200</b> may service and/or respond to the NF query request, including the primary NRF device <b>210</b>, or any one of the secondary NRF devices <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>, etc. Moreover, if the primary NRF device <b>210</b> goes offline and/or is otherwise unavailable, either of the secondary NRF devices <b>220</b> or <b>230</b> may be automatically promoted to act as the primary NRF device of the NRF cluster <b>200</b>, thereby providing automatic fail-over capabilities to the PLMN <b>100</b> and/or the region <b>200</b>, etc.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The election of the primary NRF device of the NRF cluster <b>200</b> may automatically occur after the primary NRF device goes offline, after a new NRF device joins the NRF cluster <b>200</b> (e.g., a new NRF device is initialized, etc.), after a previously offline NRF device comes back online (e.g., the offline NRF device recovers, etc.), and/or the election of the primary NRF device may occur due to an network administer command, and/or may occur at desired frequencies (e.g., periodically), etc., thereby adding, improving, and/or increasing the redundancy of the NRF cluster. Further, the election of the primary NRF device may not occur when one or more of the secondary NRF devices goes offline, thereby increasing &#x201c;uptime&#x201d; of the NRF cluster itself and decreasing the network resource usage and/or amount of network traffic between any registered NF device and the NRF cluster <b>200</b>, by allowing NF requests to be handled by any NRF device of the NRF cluster <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">One or more of the NRF devices of the NRF cluster <b>200</b> may transmit a &#x201c;heartbeat&#x201d; message to the other NRF devices of the NRF cluster <b>200</b> to determine the online/offline status of the NRF devices of the NRF cluster <b>200</b>. For example, the heartbeat message may be a &#x201c;ping&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;arp&#x201d; command periodically executed by one or more of the NRF devices. If one or more of the NRF devices fails to respond to a desired number of heartbeat messages (e.g., 1 heartbeat message, 2 heartbeat messages, etc.), the other NRF devices may update their records to indicate that the non-responsive NRF device is offline. For example, secondary NRF devices <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> may each periodically transmit heartbeat messages to the entire subnet, and if the primary NRF device <b>210</b> fails to respond to, for example, two heartbeat messages, the secondary NRF devices <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> may determine that the primary NRF device <b>210</b> is offline and then proceed to perform an election for a new primary NRF device based on the remaining NRF devices of the NRF cluster <b>200</b> that are online, etc.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, according to some example embodiments, a NRF cluster <b>200</b> may include a plurality of NRF devices <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and/or <b>230</b>, etc. Additionally, there may be at least one NF device which communicates with at least one NRF device of the NRF cluster <b>200</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, according to at least one example embodiment, there may be a plurality of NF devices <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, and/or <b>340</b>, etc., communicating with at least one NRF device of the NRF cluster <b>200</b>, but the example embodiments are not limited thereto. Each of the NF devices may be either a consumer NF device (e.g., NF device <b>310</b>, etc.), a producer NF device (e.g., NF devices <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, and <b>340</b>, etc.), or may be both a consumer NF device and a producer NF device. A producer NF device, e.g., a producer NF service, etc., may provide a network service to other NFs, e.g., consumer NFs and/or consumer NF devices, and/or UE devices. For example, policy control function (PCF), access and mobility management function (AMF), and session management function (SMF), may be examples of producer NFs, but the example embodiments are not limited thereto. Further, consumer NFs may subscribe to producer NFs and receive services and/or information from the producer NFs. Examples of consumer NFs include AMF, SMF, PCF, CHF, etc., but the example embodiments are not limited thereto.

For example, a PCF may act as a producer NF for an AMF and SMF on the same PLMN, and the AMF and SMF will act as consumer NFs in this scenario, but the PCF may be a consumer NF of services from a CHF on the same PLMN, etc., but the example embodiments are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A plurality of NF devices <b>300</b> of the PLMN, e.g., individual NF devices <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, and/or <b>340</b>, etc., may be assigned to a particular region of the PLMN, such as the first region <b>200</b>, by a DHCP server <b>700</b> and/or a network administrator, etc. The plurality of NF devices <b>300</b> may communicate with the NRF cluster <b>200</b> by first messaging a DNS server <b>600</b> over the core network <b>100</b> using the FQDN associated with the NRF cluster <b>200</b>. The DNS server <b>600</b> may provide each of the plurality of NF devices <b>300</b> with a network configuration list (e.g., a network address list, an IP address list, etc.) associated with the NRF cluster <b>200</b>, the network configuration list including the network configuration information of each of the NRF devices of the NRF cluster <b>200</b>, such as the network addresses, IP addresses, etc., of each of the NRF devices.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to at least one example embodiment, the network configuration list may be an ordered list that implements a load-balancing policy for the NRF cluster <b>200</b>.

For example, the load-balancing policy may be a round-robin policy (e.g., the sequence of network configuration information included in the ordered list is rotated by one position for each NF device, etc.), a randomized policy (e.g., the sequence of network configuration information included in the ordered list is randomly generated for each NF device), and/or may be generated based on the individual characteristic(s) of the NF device and/or the NRF device(s) (e.g., NF devices located in a certain geographic region may be assigned to NRF devices in the same geographic region, producer NF devices may be assigned to certain NRF devices, consumer NF devices may be assigned to certain NRF devices, etc.), etc., however the example embodiments are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Each individual NF device may then communicate with the NRF cluster <b>200</b> by transmitting messages to the first NRF device included in the ordered list obtained from the DNS server <b>600</b>.
