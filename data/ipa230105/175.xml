The reinforcing strip suture <b>16</b> is arranged above the opening of the garment seam <b>14</b>, and is used to reinforce the sewing reinforcing strip <b>15</b>, the front garment piece <b>11</b> and the connecting garment piece <b>13</b>. As the reinforcing strip <b>15</b> only uses one garment piece, it is stronger than the existing scheme that two reinforcing strips are respectively arranged at two edges of the garment seam, at the same time, the reinforcing strip <b>15</b>, the front garment piece <b>11</b> and the back garment piece <b>12</b> are reinforced again through the reinforcing strip suture <b>16</b>, so that the opening of the garment seam <b>14</b> is less likely to crack and deform.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the sleeve <b>2</b> is arranged on both sides of the upper part of the garment body <b>1</b>, connected to the front garment piece <b>11</b> and the back garment piece <b>12</b>, and the length is in a range of 12 cm to 20 cm. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>,<b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, the sleeve <b>2</b> include a sleeve body <b>21</b>, a cuff <b>22</b> connected with the outer edge of the sleeve body <b>21</b>, a first suture <b>23</b> and a second suture <b>24</b>. The cuff <b>22</b> is an annular structure formed by a rectangular piece of clothing connected end to end, and the cuff <b>22</b> includes a head part <b>221</b>, a tail part <b>223</b> and a middle part <b>222</b>, and the head part <b>221</b> and the tail part <b>223</b> overlap on the inner side of the cuff <b>22</b>, and are stitched by a first seam <b>23</b> to form an overlap part. The overlap part is attached to the middle part <b>222</b> of the rectangular panel inside the cuff <b>22</b> by a second stitch line <b>24</b>. By attaching and fixing the overlap part, it is possible to prevent the overlap part from rubbing against the skin and to prevent the cuff <b>22</b> from cracking.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The collar <b>3</b> is arranged at the top of the garment body <b>1</b>, connected with the front garment piece <b>11</b> and the back garment piece <b>12</b>, and includes a collar face <b>31</b>, an elastic support strip <b>34</b>, a collar seat <b>32</b> and a collar face connecting part <b>33</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the collar face <b>31</b> includes a collar face body <b>311</b>, a first outer edge <b>312</b> and a second outer edge <b>313</b>. The first outer edge <b>312</b> and the second outer edge <b>313</b> are arranged at the edge of the collar body <b>1</b> and intersect at the collar tip, the first outer edge <b>312</b> is arranged at the front side of the collar <b>3</b>, and the second outer edge <b>313</b> is arranged at both sides and the back side of the collar <b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the first outer edge <b>312</b> has a double-layer structure including an upper layer <b>312</b>A and a lower layer <b>312</b>B. The elastic support strip <b>34</b> is arranged between the upper layer <b>312</b>A and the lower layer <b>312</b>B. Since the upper layer <b>312</b>A and the lower layer <b>312</b>B are covered with the elastic support strips <b>34</b>, it is not apparent that the support structures made of different materials are used in appearance. The elastic support strip <b>34</b> is made of plastic, preferably polyurethane. Soft polyurethane mainly has thermoplastic linear structure, which has better stability, chemical resistance, resilience and mechanical properties than PVC foaming material, and less compression deformation. In order to prevent the POLO shirts from affecting the support of the elastic support strip <b>34</b> during cleaning, the lower side of the first outer edge <b>312</b> further includes an opening <b>312</b>C at one end of the elastic support bar <b>34</b> for insertion and removal of the elastic support strip <b>34</b>, and the opening can also be hidden due to the fact that the opening <b>312</b>C is on the lower side of the first outer edge <b>312</b>. The thickness of the second outer edge <b>313</b> is 2-4 times the thickness of the collar body <b>311</b>, and the width of the collar body <b>311</b> is 10-20 times the width of the second outer edge <b>313</b>, which makes the second outer edge <b>313</b> appear more solid and textured as an edge decoration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the collar seat <b>32</b> is arranged at the back of the neck, and the collar <b>3</b> is more three-dimensional due to the support of the collar seat <b>32</b>. Therefore, the width of the collar seat <b>32</b> is preferably 2.2 cm-2.8 cm. The collar seat <b>32</b> is a two-layer structure, the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a first layer, the right side is a second layer, the bottom of the collar base <b>32</b> is connected to the back garment piece <b>12</b> of the garment body <b>1</b>, and the back garment piece <b>12</b> is sewed between the first layer and the collar seat <b>31</b> of the second layer to realize the fixed connection of the back garment piece <b>12</b> and the collar seat <b>32</b>. The connecting part <b>33</b> connects the top of the collar seat <b>32</b> and the top of the collar face <b>31</b>. The connecting part <b>33</b> is sewed between the collar seat <b>32</b> of the first layer and the second layer to realize the fixed connection between the connecting part <b>33</b> and the collar seat <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the collar seat <b>32</b>, the connecting part <b>33</b> and the collar face <b>31</b> are paved on the same plane, the connecting part <b>33</b> is in a grid shape, and the gaps between the grids are provided with vent holes, so that the vent holes on the connecting part <b>33</b> volatilize the sweat on the back neck and prevent the sweat from accumulating and forming stains. The area of each vent hole is greater than or equal to 0.25 mm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to 4 mm<sup>2</sup>. Under the condition that the shape of the connecting part <b>33</b> is relatively difficult to deform, in order to volatilize sweat to a greater extent and not affect the beauty, it is most appropriate to set the area of the vent hole between 0.25 mm<sup>2 </sup>and 4 mm<sup>2</sup>, because the area is too small to volatilize and too large to be molded. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the connecting part <b>33</b> is arc-shaped, with one end of the arc connected to the top of the collar seat <b>32</b> and the other end connected to the top of the collar face <b>31</b>. Because the connecting part <b>33</b> has a curved shape, the shape of the connecting part <b>33</b> will not be affected by properly sized vent holes. Since the joint between the connecting part <b>33</b> and the collar face <b>31</b> is a visible part after dressing, the connecting part <b>33</b> and the collar face <b>31</b> are connected by textile technology, so that the connecting part <b>33</b> and the collar face <b>31</b> are integrally formed, and the joint between the connecting part <b>33</b> and the collar face <b>31</b> is not easy to be seen, thus improving the temperament of the wearer. The width of the collar face <b>31</b> is larger than that of the collar seat <b>32</b>, so that the collar face <b>31</b> covers the collar seat <b>32</b>, and the beauty of POLO shirt is improved. If vent holes are arranged on the collar seat <b>32</b>, it is easy to cause the collar seat <b>32</b> to loose and collapse downward, which can not play a supporting role. The collar face <b>31</b> is a plane structure, which must be woven tightly to make the collar face <b>31</b> smooth and improve the temperament of dressing. If vent holes are provided in the collar face <b>31</b>, it is not easy to fix the collar face <b>31</b> into a plane, which will easily lead to curling and non-three-dimensional phenomenon, and on the contrary, reduce the impression of people wearing clothes.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>12</b></figref>, the front flap <b>4</b> is arranged at the front side of the upper portion of the garment body <b>1</b>, and is connected to the front garment piece <b>11</b> by sewing.
