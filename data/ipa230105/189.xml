Wigs generally include multiple strands of hair attached to a cap to form a unit that can be secured to a user's scalp. Hair weaves and hair extensions are also used by people to either conceal or supplement their natural hair. In some cases, people use wigs when they are experiencing baldness or thinning of their natural hair. For those experiencing baldness or thinning of natural hair, use of wigs provides an alternative to use of potentially dangerous hair growth drugs or chemicals, or uncomfortable hair plugs. In other cases, people use wigs for temporary purposes when they are undergoing medical treatments that result in loss of their hair, such as chemotherapy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hair extensions and wigs are also used to provide a user with an alternative hair color in order to improve their appearance. Furthermore, hair extensions and wigs can be used by people to present an alternative texture to their own hair, such as changing their hair from straight to curly. Just as many people enjoy accessorizing their wardrobe, people who wear hair extensions and wigs enjoy changing and enhancing their appearance.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the invention described herein provide a wig apparatus.
