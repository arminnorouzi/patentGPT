The circuit-based components include a plurality of discrete electrical or electronic components which are structurally and electrically supported by a circuit board, such as printed circuit boards. Such circuit-based components may also include interfaces that allow the circuit-based component to be electrically coupled with other components of the electronic device. An example of an electronic device includes, but is not limited to, a processor-based computing device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The circuit-based component may further include through-holes of standard size, and at predefined position and location which may aid in mounting of the circuit-based component onto the chassis of the electronic device. For mounting, the holes provided on the circuit-based component may be aligned with corresponding apertures provided on the chassis. Thereafter screws or other coupling mechanisms may be used for mounting the installable component onto the chassis of the electronic device. Once the circuit-based component is mounted, it may be electrically coupled to a main circuitry of the electronic device through interfaces.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such additional components may be installed onto the chassis of the electronic device as described above. As would be understood, the installation of such additional components may involve using tools and in other cases may also involve some level of skill. Furthermore, installation of such additional components may have to be performed with care to ensure that neither the additional component, the previously existing components, nor the circuitry of the electronic device gets damaged. In addition to being prone to physical damage, the circuit-based component may also be prone to damage owing to static electricity. Such challenges would also be present when the installed components are to be removed or replaced. The removal of such components may also necessitate use of tools or may involve some level of skill on the part of personnel tasked with the removal of such components.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Examples of an installation module for installing a circuit-based component are described. The circuit-based component may include a variety of electrical components, electronic components, or a combination of such different types of components. For installation, the circuit-based component may be initially fitted into the installation module. Once the circuit-based component is fitted, the assembled installation module may be mounted onto a chassis of an electronic device into which the circuit-based component were to be installed. The assembled installation module may further include a plurality of mounting elements which enable the engagement between the assembled installation module and the chassis. Since the assembled installation module (and in turn the circuit-based component) engages with the chassis through the mounting elements no other tools or external coupling mechanism (for example, screws) may be required.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an example, the installation module includes a planar base plate (referred to as the &#x2018;base plate&#x2019;) onto which the circuit-based component, when fitted into the installation module, is placed. In an example, the base plate includes a supporting element, which is to support the circuit-based component when fitted into the installation module. The base plate of the installation module further includes a pair of longitudinal edges and lateral edges. The installation module may further include a first wall and a second wall. The first wall and the second wall may be substantially orthogonal with respect to the base plate and extend from a first lateral edge and a second lateral edge of the base plate, respectively.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first wall and the second wall may be further provided with retaining elements. The retaining elements retain the circuit-based component when it is installed or fitted within the installation module. In addition to the first wall and the second wall, the installation module may further include a back wall. The back wall, in an example, may also be substantially orthogonal to the base plate and extends from one of the longitudinal edges of the base plate. As would be noted, the base plate along with the first wall, the second wall and the back wall provide an enclosing space within which the circuit-based component is accommodated when installed within the installation module. In another example, the installation module may be further provided with a plurality of engaging elements through which the installation module is attached to the chassis of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an example, the installation module may include a tab that extends from a longitudinal edge of the back wall. The tab, when pulled, results in the separation of the engaging elements from the chassis and enables the disengagement the installation module. As a result, the installation module may be detached from the chassis without any risks of damage to the circuit-based component or the chassis of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It may be noted that the example installation module as described reduces the number of additional parts, such as screws, nut, and bolts, for performing the installation of the circuit-based component within an electronic device. The installation of the circuit-based components is also easier and quicker and may not involve skilled supervision or personnel. Furthermore, the tab permits users to detach the installation module from the chassis without any risks of damage to the circuit-based component or the chassis of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As is described in the following paragraphs, the installation module provides for an efficient mechanism for mounting or fixing of the circuit-based components with minimal efforts. Furthermore, the installation modules as described are also less complex, and hence, would be cost effective and economical. In an example, the assembling of the circuit-based components onto the installation module is further described in conjunction with the accompanying figures. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar parts.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of an installation module <b>100</b>, as per an example of the present subject matter. A circuit-based component may be installed within an electronic device (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) by installing the circuit- based component within the installation module <b>100</b>, and then subsequently mounting the resulting assembled installation module <b>100</b> onto the chassis of an electronic device. It may be noted that the installation module <b>100</b> as illustrated depicts only one example. Other examples may also be possible without deviating from the scope of the subject matter of the claims.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the installation module <b>100</b> includes a planar base plate <b>102</b>.

Continuing with the present example, the base plate <b>102</b> has a pair of longitudinal edges <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B (collectively referred to as longitudinal edges <b>106</b>) and lateral edges <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B (collectively referred to as the lateral edges <b>108</b>). The longitudinal edges <b>106</b> and lateral edges <b>108</b> are such that they form the opposite edges of the base plate <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The installation module <b>100</b> may further include a first wall <b>110</b> and a second wall <b>112</b>. The first wall <b>110</b> and the second wall <b>112</b> extend from the lateral edges <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B, respectively. The orientation of the first wall <b>110</b> and the second wall <b>112</b> is such that the first wall <b>110</b> and the second wall <b>112</b> are substantially orthogonal with respect to the base plate <b>102</b>. Both the first wall <b>110</b> and the second wall <b>112</b> extend in a manner such that they form an interior portion within which the circuit-based component may be installed. It may be understood, that the term substantially orthogonal may refer to instances wherein the first wall <b>110</b> and the second wall <b>112</b> at an angle of about <b>90</b> degrees with respect to the base plate <b>102</b>, within acceptable tolerance limits. In an example, the first wall <b>110</b> and the second wall <b>112</b> may be further provided with a retaining element <b>114</b>. The retaining element <b>114</b>, when the circuit-based component is installed, is to retain the circuit-based component within the installation module <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The installation module <b>100</b> may further include a back wall <b>116</b>. The back wall <b>116</b>, in an example, is also substantially orthogonal to the base plate <b>102</b> and extends from a longitudinal edge, e.g., longitudinal edge <b>106</b>A of the base plate <b>102</b>. The back wall <b>116</b> is such that it emanates from the longitudinal edge <b>106</b> A. Continuing with the present example, the installation module <b>100</b> may be further provided with a tab <b>118</b>. The tab <b>118</b> extends from a longitudinal edge of the back wall <b>116</b>. In an example, the tab <b>118</b> extends away from the back wall <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As mentioned previously, the circuit-based component may be installed by initially installing the circuit-based component into the installation module <b>100</b>, which may then be mounted onto a chassis of an electronic device. In an example, the tab <b>118</b> is to permit manually disengaging the installation module <b>100</b> from the chassis onto which it may be fitted. To disengage, the tab <b>118</b> may be manually pulled in a direction that extends away from the back wall <b>116</b>. Owing to the tab <b>118</b>, the installation module <b>100</b> may be disengaged manually with minimal efforts. Furthermore, removing the installation module <b>100</b> from the chassis may be performed without any tools with the tab <b>118</b> providing a mechanism for enabling removal of the installation module <b>100</b> from even restricted spaces. It may be noted that the above-mentioned examples are only indicative. Other examples of the installation module <b>100</b> are also possible which would also fall within the scope of the present subject matter. Such other examples are described in further detail in conjunction with the other figures.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of an assembled installation module <b>200</b>, as per an example of the present subject matter. The assembled installation module <b>200</b> includes a planar base plate <b>202</b>. The planar base plate <b>202</b> (referred to as the base plate <b>202</b>) is to support a circuit-based component <b>204</b> installed within the assembled component module <b>200</b>. The circuit-based component <b>204</b> may include electronic circuitry that may be implemented on a circuit board. The electronic circuitry, in an example, may either include a plurality of electrical or electronic components, or may include an integrated circuit-based component. In an example, the circuit-based component <b>204</b> may include components such as an input/output hub (I/O hub), connectors, and ports. It may be noted that the examples of such components is only indicative and should be not be construed as a limitation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The base plate <b>202</b> may include a longitudinal edge <b>206</b> and a pair lateral edges <b>208</b>A, <b>208</b>B. The lateral edges <b>208</b>A, <b>208</b>B (collectively referred to as the lateral edges <b>208</b>) are such that they form opposite edges of the base plate <b>202</b>. Similar to the installation module <b>100</b>, the assembled installation module <b>200</b> may further include a first wall <b>210</b> and a second wall <b>212</b>. The first wall <b>210</b> and the second wall <b>212</b> extend from a lateral edge <b>208</b>A, <b>208</b>B, respectively. The orientation of the first wall <b>210</b> and the second wall <b>212</b> is such that the first wall <b>210</b> and the second wall <b>212</b> are substantially orthogonal with respect to the base plate <b>202</b> so as to define an interior portion of the installation module <b>200</b> within which the circuit-based component <b>204</b> is to be received and installed. In an example, the first wall <b>210</b> and the second wall <b>212</b> may be further provided with retaining element <b>214</b>. As will be explained subsequently, the retaining element <b>214</b> is to retain the circuit-based component <b>204</b> installed within the installation module <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The assembled installation module <b>200</b> also includes a back wall <b>216</b>.

In an example, the other longitudinal edge of the installation module <b>200</b> may be an edge which lies opposite to the longitudinal edge <b>206</b>. The assembled installation module <b>200</b> may be further provided with a tab <b>218</b>, which in turn extends from a longitudinally extending edge of the back wall <b>216</b>. In an example, the tab <b>218</b> extends away from the back wall <b>216</b> and may be inclined with respect to the base plate <b>202</b>.

The electronic device <b>300</b> may be any device which operates based on electrical signals for performing certain functions. Examples of electronic device <b>300</b> include, but is not limited to, a computing device such as a desktop personal computer (PC), notebook PC, workstation or mobile workstation, imaging device, or another type of computing device. It may be understood that electronic device <b>300</b> may be any other type of electronic device without deviating from the scope of the present subject matter. Returning to the present example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> provides a magnified view of a portion of the electronic device <b>300</b>. As illustrated, the electronic device <b>300</b> may include a chassis <b>302</b>. The chassis <b>302</b> may be considered as a portion of a housing of the electronic device <b>300</b>. In an example, the chassis <b>302</b> may be a structural frame onto which the components may be mounted.

The supporting elements <b>404</b>A, <b>404</b>B (collectively referred to as supporting elements <b>404</b>) are to support the circuit-based component when it is installed within the installation module <b>400</b>. It may be noted that even though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref> depict a pair of supporting elements <b>404</b>, the installation module <b>400</b> may include an additional number of supporting elements <b>404</b> without deviating from the scope of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Returning to the present example, the base plate <b>402</b> of the installation module <b>400</b> further includes a pair of longitudinal edges <b>406</b>A, <b>406</b>B (collectively referred to as longitudinal edges <b>406</b>) and lateral edges <b>408</b>A, <b>408</b>B (collectively referred to as lateral edges <b>408</b>). The installation module <b>400</b> further includes a first wall <b>410</b> and a second wall <b>412</b>. The first wall <b>410</b> and the second wall <b>412</b> are such that they extend from the lateral edges <b>408</b>A, <b>408</b>B. In an example, the first wall <b>410</b> and the second wall <b>412</b> are substantially orthogonal to the base plate <b>402</b>, as they extend from the respective the lateral edges <b>408</b>A, <b>408</b>B.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The installation module <b>400</b> may further include a back wall <b>414</b> which extends from one of the longitudinal edges <b>406</b>, e.g., longitudinal edge <b>406</b>A. The back wall <b>414</b>, similar to the first wall <b>410</b> and the second wall <b>412</b>, is also substantially orthogonal to the base plate <b>402</b>. In an example, the installation module <b>400</b> may further be provided with a retaining tab <b>416</b>. In the example as illustrated, the retaining tab <b>416</b> is provided on the longitudinal edge <b>406</b>B. The retaining tab <b>416</b> is also such that it is substantially orthogonally with respect to the base plate <b>402</b>. In an example, the retaining tab <b>416</b> is of a resilient material such that the retaining tab <b>416</b> is biased in a direction towards the back wall <b>414</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As depicted in the present example, the first wall <b>410</b>, the second wall <b>412</b> and the back wall <b>414</b> form a perimeter which extends along the lateral edges <b>408</b> and one of the longitudinal edges <b>406</b>, i.e., the longitudinal edge <b>406</b>A. It may be noted that the first wall <b>410</b>, the second wall <b>412</b>, and the back wall <b>414</b>, along with the retaining tab <b>416</b> provide an enclosing space within which a circuit-based component may be installed. In an example, the retaining tab <b>416</b> is located on a longitudinal edge <b>406</b>B which is opposite to the back wall <b>414</b>, with the retaining tab <b>416</b> is substantially orthogonal with respect to the base plate <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an example, the first wall <b>410</b> and the second wall <b>412</b> may be provided with a plurality of retaining elements <b>418</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>418</b>-<b>2</b>, with an additional retaining element <b>418</b>-<b>3</b> being provided on an inner surface of the retaining tab <b>416</b>. The retaining elements <b>418</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>418</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>418</b>-<b>3</b> (collectively referred to as the retaining elements <b>418</b>) are to retain a circuit-based component when it is installed within the installation module <b>400</b>. In an example, the retaining elements <b>418</b> may be in the form of protrusions which may be provided on the respective inner surfaces of the first wall <b>410</b>, the second wall <b>412</b>, back wall <b>414</b>, and the retaining tab <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The installation module <b>400</b> may further include a disengaging tab <b>420</b> which extends from a longitudinal edge of the back wall <b>420</b>. In an example, the disengaging tab <b>420</b> is such that it extends over the base plate <b>402</b> of the installation module <b>400</b>. In an example, the disengaging tab <b>420</b> may be inclined to the base plate <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The disengaging tab <b>420</b> may further include an opening <b>422</b> provided through the disengaging tab <b>420</b>. In an example, the opening <b>422</b> permits the disengaging tab <b>420</b> to be manually held and pulled in order to disengage the installation module <b>400</b> from a chassis of an electronic device. In an example, the installation module <b>400</b> is to be fitted onto chassis of an electronic device. To this end, the installation module <b>400</b> may further include a pair of front engaging members <b>424</b>A and a pair of rear engaging members <b>424</b>B. In the present example, the front engaging members <b>424</b>A may be provided on longitudinal edge <b>406</b>B of the base plate <b>402</b>. In another example, the installation module <b>400</b> may further include rear engaging members <b>424</b>B provided on an outer surface of the back wall <b>414</b>. The front engaging members <b>424</b>A and a pair of rear engaging members <b>424</b>B (collectively referred to as engaging members <b>424</b>) enable the engagement of the installation module <b>400</b> to a chassis of the electronic device, when the installation module <b>400</b> is fitted thereto.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In yet another example, the back wall <b>414</b> may further include a longitudinally extending vent <b>426</b> or an opening <b>426</b>. In an example, the opening <b>426</b> or vent <b>426</b> extends across a length of the back wall <b>414</b>. The vent <b>426</b>, in an example, enables ventilation for dissipation of heat and may also enable reduction in weight of the installation module <b>400</b> at the time of manufacturing the installation module <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described, the retaining elements <b>418</b> retain and hold a circuit- based component in position when the same is installed within the installation module <b>400</b>. Additionally, the engaging members <b>424</b> permit the installation module <b>400</b> (when fitted with the circuit-based component) to be fitted onto a chassis of an electronic device. The manner in which the installation of the circuit- based component may be performed, is further explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts the installation, within an example electronic device <b>600</b>, of a circuit-based component <b>602</b> within the installation module <b>400</b> (as was described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). For installation, the circuit-based component <b>602</b> may be manually positioned within the space defined by the first wall <b>410</b>, the second wall <b>412</b>, and the back wall <b>414</b>. As the circuit-based component <b>602</b> is being laid within the installation module <b>400</b>, the edges of the circuit-based component <b>602</b> may encounter the retaining elements <b>418</b> (although not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) which are provided on the inner surface of first wall <b>410</b>, the second wall <b>412</b>, the back wall <b>414</b> and the retaining tab <b>416</b>. In an example, the obstruction caused by the retaining elements <b>418</b> may be overcome by applying an insertion force. Under the effect of the insertion force, the edges of the circuit-based component <b>602</b> may abut against and urge the retaining elements <b>418</b> in an outward direction. As the retaining elements <b>418</b> move outward, an appropriate passage is provided to the circuit-based component <b>602</b> which may move further inwards towards the base plate <b>402</b> into the installation module <b>400</b>. As the edges of the circuit-based component <b>602</b> cross the retaining elements <b>418</b>, the retaining elements <b>418</b> assume their original position, thereby removably securing the circuit-based component <b>602</b> within the installation module <b>400</b>. In an example, the circuit-based component <b>602</b>, when inserted into the installation module <b>400</b>, is supported by the supporting elements <b>404</b>. The resulting assembled installation module <b>400</b> (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) may then be fitted onto the chassis of an electronic device as is described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts installation, within an example electronic device <b>700</b>, of assembled installation module <b>702</b> onto a chassis <b>704</b> of an electronic device. It may be noted the present description is provided in conjunction with the installation module <b>400</b> described in the preceding figures. The chassis <b>704</b> of the electronic device <b>300</b> is depicted as including a base surface <b>706</b> and a chassis wall <b>708</b>. The base surface <b>706</b> and the chassis wall <b>708</b> may further include a plurality of chassis slots <b>710</b>. In an example, the engaging members <b>424</b> provided onto the installation module <b>400</b> engages with the corresponding chassis slots <b>710</b> provided on the chassis <b>704</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For fitting the assembled installation module <b>702</b> onto the chassis <b>704</b> of the electronic device <b>700</b>, an installation positioned may be initially identified. Once the installation position is identified, the assembled installation module <b>702</b> may be manually positioned. In an example, a user may align the engaging members <b>424</b> of the assembled installation module <b>702</b> with the corresponding chassis slots <b>710</b> provided on the chassis <b>704</b>. Once the assembled installation module <b>702</b> is suitably positioned, the assembled installation module <b>702</b> may be eased towards the base surface <b>706</b> such that the engaging members <b>424</b> engage and lock into the chassis slots <b>710</b> provided on the base surface <b>706</b> of the chassis <b>704</b>. In a similar manner, the assembled installation module <b>702</b> may be urged towards the chassis wall <b>708</b> so as to enable engagement between them.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an example, the disengaging tab <b>420</b> is to permit manually disengaging the installation module <b>400</b> from the chassis <b>704</b>. To this end, the disengaging tab <b>420</b> may be manually pulled in a direction away from the back wall <b>414</b>. In response to the pulling of the disengaging tab <b>420</b>, the engaging members <b>424</b> disengage from the corresponding chassis slots <b>710</b> thereby enabling the separation of the assembled installation module <b>702</b> from the chassis <b>704</b> of the electronic device <b>700</b>. In an example, the back wall <b>414</b> may be of a resilient member which allows the engaging members <b>424</b> to be pulled away from the chassis slots <b>710</b> to remove the installation module <b>400</b> from the chassis <b>704</b>. The removal of the installation module <b>400</b> from the chassis <b>704</b> may be performed manually with minimal efforts, without any tools and may be used for removing or replacing the circuit-based component <b>602</b> from a restricted space of the electronic device <b>700</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although implementations of present subject matter have been described in language specific to structural features and/or methods, it is to be noted that the present subject matter is not necessarily limited to the specific features or methods described.
