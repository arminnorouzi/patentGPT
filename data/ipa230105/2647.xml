For example, these binder compositions may be employed to product fiber products which may be made from woven and non-woven fibers. In some embodiments, the binder compositions disclosed herein are used to bind glass fibers to produce fiberglass. In further embodiments, the disclosed binder compositions are used to bind mineral wool fibers, such as glass wool or stone wool, to form a matted layer for the production of an insulating product. In still further embodiments, the binder compositions disclosed herein are used to produce wood fiber boards, particle boards and oriented strand boards (OSBs) characterized by improved physical properties (e.g., enhanced mechanical strength). Further, the binders may be used to assemble sheets of cellulosic material, such as sheets of wood, to manufacture plywood. Additionally, processes for binding loosely assembled matter and producing articles from loosely assembled matter bound using the binder compositions are provided.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Formaldehyde-free binder compositions have previously been reported, including curable, formaldehyde-free binder compositions comprising one or more of sustainable materials, polyacids, anhydrides, polyhydroxyl components, polyamines, carbohydrates, derivatives thereof, and additional components such as silicon comprising compounds. However, formaldehyde-free binders and resins may be characterized by a disadvantageous coloration, e.g. upon curing, which may not be commercially desirable. In addition, previously disclosed formaldehyde-free binders may lack sufficient bond strength while disadvantageously increasing binder production costs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides for an assembly of matter comprising one or more of mineral fibers, synthetic fibers, natural fibers, cellulosic particle materials, and sheet materials, characterized by improved properties including but not limited to the reduction or elimination of undesirable coloration and improved mechanical properties.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In further embodiments, a process for the preparation of an assembly of matter as described herein is provided.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In still further embodiments, a cost-effective process for the commercial production of the disclosed formaldehyde-free binder compositions, which are alternatively referred to herein as &#x201c;binders&#x201d; and &#x201c;binder compositions,&#x201d; is provided.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In additional embodiments, an improved, formaldehyde-free binder composition produced using renewable and/or sustainable feedstocks and components is provided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, formaldehyde-free binder compositions capable of rapidly curing and providing sufficient commercial strength are provided.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, commercial products and articles comprising the disclosed formaldehyde-free binders are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain embodiments, the commercial articles and products of the present disclosure may comprise an assembly of matter comprising one or more of mineral fibers, synthetic fibers, natural fibers, cellulosic particle materials and sheet materials bonded together by a binder composition disclosed herein, including an aqueous curable binder composition comprising a monosaccharide or polysaccharide and an azetidinium crosslinker. In additional embodiments, a binder composition as disclosed herein may comprise one or more reaction products resulting from one or more crosslinking reactions between a monosaccharide and/or a polysaccharide and an azetidinium crosslinker.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, a monosaccharide for use in the disclosed technology may comprise a 5-carbon monosaccharide or a 6-carbon monosaccharide such as dextrose. In further embodiments, a polysaccharide of the present disclosure may comprise at least two saccharide units, including at least four saccharide units and up to 10<sup>6 </sup>saccharide units, such as up to 3000 saccharide units, 5000 saccharide units and 10000 saccharide units, such as native starch and starch derivatives. Starch generally comprises two different polymers of D-glucopyranose, amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is a linear polysaccharide, while amylopectin is a highly branched polysaccharide. Amylose has a relatively low molecular weight with a degree of polymerization ranging from 1000 to 10000 glucose units and a molecular weight (MW) of greater than 10<sup>6 </sup>g/mol, while amylopectin is a larger branched polysaccharide with a degree of polymerization of greater than 10<sup>5 </sup>and a molecular weight (MW) of greater than 10<sup>7 </sup>g/mol. In additional embodiments, starch derivatives for use in the disclosed technology may comprise one or more of starch ethers such as carboxymethyl starches, hydroxyalkyl starches, cationic starches, amphoteric starches, starch esters such as starch acetates, starch phosphates, starch octenyl succinate, acid modified starch, oxide modified starch, and partially hydrolysed starches such as dextrins. In certain embodiments, polysaccharides for use in the present disclosure may be derived from cellulose and other natural or synthetic sources, including chitin. Starch derivatives such as dextrins and maltodextrins comprise D-glucose units linked in chains of variable lengths, for instance from 2 to 20 glucose units.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, azetidinium crosslinkers may be utilized. As would be known to those of skill in relevant arts, multifunctional azetidinium crosslinker may be prepared using different coupling agents and amine functional monomers with different ratios, including the use of at least one substituted or unsubstituted, four-membered nitrogen comprising heterocycle. In further embodiments, an azetidinium group may be chemically bonded to a homopolymer or a copolymer chain comprising one or more nonazetidinium monomer units incorporated into the polymer structure. In still further embodiments, an azetidinium crosslinker for use in the instant disclosure may comprise at least two azetidinium groups. An azetidinium polymer for use in the present disclosure may comprise the general structure below:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="23.03mm" wi="40.05mm" file="US20230002648A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">wherein 1) n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, 2) R<sub>1 </sub>comprises an C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>25 </sub>alkanediyl group, such as a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkanediyl group or a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>5 </sub>alkanediyl group that may be optionally substituted with a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group or an amine group, 3) R<sub>2 </sub>may be independently R1 or &#x2014;R<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;NH&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;R<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;, with R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>independently comprising a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>25 </sub>alkanediyl group, such as a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkanediyl group or a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>5 </sub>alkanediyl group, 4) Y<sub>1 </sub>and Y<sub>3 </sub>comprise a hydrogen (H) group or a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>5 </sub>alkyl group that may be optionally substituted with a hydroxyl group, an amine or a carboxyl group, 5) Y2 comprises a hydroxyl (OH&#x2014;) group or a chemical group as defined by Y1, and 6) X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> comprises a halogen ion.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">As would be appreciated by those of skill in the relevant arts, azetidinium functionalized polymers comprise highly reactive quaternary ammonium groups, which in certain embodiments may improve embodiments and properties of products and articles comprising the binders disclosed herein, including but not limited to antimicrobial activity. While in no way limiting the scope of the present disclosure, it is believed that the reactivity of azetidinium functional groups may be due to in part to angle strain, which may beneficially increase its reactivity with nucleophiles. In additional embodiments, azetidinium crosslinkers for use in the instant disclosure may polymerize at elevated temperatures and/or by radical initiation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">In some embodiments, the dry weight ratio of monosaccharide and/or polysaccharide to azetidinium crosslinker comprises a range of 99:1 to 60:40, such as a range of 98:2 to 70:30 and a range of 95:5 to 75:25.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">In additional embodiments, the aqueous binder compositions disclosed herein exhibit unexpectedly high bond strength upon curing. The loss of bond strength after weathering may be significantly reduced as compared to prior art thermoset binders.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">The bond strength of a veil product bonded with invention binder compositions may be slightly affected by the pH of the composition, notably at lower relative azetidinium content. More particularly, alkaline pH of the binder composition has a tendency to slightly reduce the bond strength (dry and wet) while acidic pH pushes the bond strength up, at higher starch/azetidinium ratios.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">In some embodiments, an aqueous binder composition as disclosed herein comprises one or more mono- and/or polysaccharide(s) crosslinked by an azetidinium crosslinker and further comprises a crosslinker capable of undergoing free radical polymerization selected from the group consisting of polycarboxylic acids, acrylamides, methacrylamides, acrylates, acrylic acids, acrylonitrile, bisphenol acrylics, carbohydrate monomers, fluorinated acrylics, maleimide, polyfunctional acrylics, salts thereof and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments where free radical polymerization is initiated by a free radical initiator, the aqueous binder composition may further comprise one or more free radical initiator(s) for the initiation of an increased number of crosslinking reactions between the saccharide residues and the crosslinker. Such crosslinking reactions may be initiated by introducing a sufficient amount of energy, including heat and/or radiation, into the aqueous binder composition to generate a highly crosslinked resin which confers improved bond strength upon curing to an assembly of matter, composition or article in accordance with the present disclosure. In accordance with the present disclosure, a two-stage polymerization process comprising a second step of free radical polymerization provides a highly polymerized resin characterized by an advantageously increased polymerization density in articles and materials comprising fibers, cellulosic particulates and/or sheet materials.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">In some embodiments, the binder compositions disclosed herein may advantageously reduce the energy cost and/or production time associated with bonding and subsequently curing of articles and products comprising fibers and cellulosic particulate or sheet materials.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">In certain embodiments, a polycarboxylic acid for use in the disclosed technology may be selected from monomeric and polymeric polycarboxylic acids, unsaturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, aromatic dicarboxylic acids, unsaturated cyclic dicarboxylic acids and saturated cyclic dicarboxylic acids, any of which may be optionally substituted with hydroxy, halo, amino, alkyl, carboxy, alkoxy, and anhydride groups, as well as salts, esters and mixtures thereof.
