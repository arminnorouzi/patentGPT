The system comprising a processing unit that is configured to perform the method according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention also relates to a 3D printed object that is fabricated using an extrusion-based additive manufacturing process.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In 3D printing using an extrusion-based additive manufacturing process, 3D objects are formed by layering extruded feedstock material in a controlled manner such that a desired 3D object can be created. Commonly a 3D printing system is used that comprises a printhead that is moveable in a 3D space with respect to a build plate while dispensing feedstock material on at least one of the build plate and on previously deposited tracks of the feedstock material that are supported by the build plate. However, various options are available for moving the printhead and the build plate on which the 3D object is printed relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The 3D printing system comprises a control system that is configured to control a controllable positioning system to which the printhead is attached for controlling movements of the printhead. By means of software a pattern of toolpaths can be generated, which pattern is used for moving the printhead and for depositing the tracks of extruded feedstock material.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The 3D object is created on a build plate in a reference location relative to the movable printhead. The feedstock material can be fused with previously deposited tracks. The modeling material can be fed in the printhead in the form of for example filament, granulate, rod, liquid, resin or a suspension.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The feedstock material is dispensed from the printhead through a feedstock liquefying unit and is deposited on the build plate in the form of tracks forming a layer of tracks, or when a previous layer of the 3D object to be created has been deposited, on previously deposited tracks where it is allowed to solidify. The feedstock material can be thermally or chemically or otherwise fused with the previously deposited tracks. The modeling material can be dispensed from the printhead and deposited on the previously deposited tracks and cured to solidify after the deposition.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The relative motion of the build plate and the 3D object supported by it with respect to the printhead along tracks and simultaneous deposition of feedstock material from the printhead allow the 3D object to be built up and to gradually attain its desired shape with each consecutively deposited track of feedstock material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Depending on the application of the 3D printed object obtained by extrusion-based additive manufacturing, smoothness of especially an outer surface of the 3D printed object is an important property. A desired smoothness of an outer surface of the 3D printed object can be achieved by choosing an appropriate thickness as seen in a direction perpendicular to the build plate for the tracks of feedstock material constituting the outer surface. The person skilled in the art will appreciate that by reducing the thickness for the tracks of feedstock material the smoothness of the outer surface of parts of the 3D printed object having a non-zero angle with respect to the build plate can be improved.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, this comes at the expense of an increased printing time of the 3D printed objects. As a result of the increased printing time, the 3D printing system used has a lower throughput. Consequently, the costs of the 3D printed objects increase.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">US 2017/0151714 A1 discloses a 3D printing apparatus, wherein the apparatus is configured to use a build material to form a peripheral wall in a plurality of layers, the combined plurality of layers having a first height, and to form an infill section within the peripheral wall, wherein said infill section is formed comprising a single layer and having a second height equal to the first height of the peripheral wall.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">CN 106 915 076 A discloses a layering thickness design method suitable for fused deposition modeling. The method specifically comprises the following steps of 1) setting design parameters; 2) determining a height range of each plane; 3) determining a length value lj and a minimal inclination angle thetaj of a height interval; 4) solving a layering thickness hj in a j-th height interval; 5) solving a layering range of the j-th height interval; 6) solving a minimal week number zmin.j of the j-th height interval; 7) solving a layering thickness calculation interval coefficient kj of the j-th height interval; 8) modifying the minimal week number zmin.j and the interval coefficient kj of the j-th height interval; 9) solving a layer number Y of which the inner ring is to be filled, a filling week number Z and a layer week number Z&#x2032; of which the inner ring is unnecessarily filled in the j-th height interval. The method disclosed by the invention has the advantages that the printing time can be relatively reduced, and the modeling efficiency is improved.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Based on the above, there is a need to provide a method that allows providing a 3D object with an outer wall that has an outer surface with an enhanced smoothness, and wherein the additional printing time related to printing of said outer wall can be reduced. Preferably, the additional printing time related to printing said outer wall can be limited as much as possible.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for reducing an additional printing time of a 3D object related to printing of an outer wall of the 3D object, the outer wall having an outer surface with an enhanced smoothness, said method pre-empting or at least reducing at least one of the abovementioned and/or other disadvantages associated with methods known in the art that are used for printing a 3D object comprising an outer wall that has an outer surface with an enhanced smoothness.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is another object of the present invention to provide a 3D printing system comprising a processing unit that is configured to perform the method according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a 3D printed object having an outer surface with an enhanced smoothness, the 3D printed object being fabricated using an extrusion-based added manufacturing process of which the additional printing time that is related to printing of the outer surface with the enhanced smoothness can be reduced using the method according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Aspects of the present invention are set out in the accompanying independent and dependent claims.

In order to be able to divide the outer wall in said first outer wall part and said second outer wall part, for each slice of the number of slices it is determined whether or not an internal boundary can be defined in the outer wall. An internal boundary can be defined in a respective slice of the number of slices if the predetermined slice height allows accommodation of a main layer, i.e. if the predetermined slice height is at least as high as the predetermined main layer height. In practice, the predetermined main layer height is chosen to be equal to the predetermined slice height of the slices of the number of slices that have been determined based on the 3D model of the 3D object. The person skilled in the art will appreciate that a respective internal boundary of a respective slice of the number of slices can be oriented at any suitable non-zero angle with respect to the respective slice of the number of slices as seen in a direction parallel to the respective slice. Therefore, it will be clear that the internal boundaries of different slices of the number of slices can have different orientations.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0031">If the internal boundary can be defined in a respective slice of the number of slices, the outer wall can be divided into said first outer wall part and said second outer wall part. The first outer wall part of said respective slice can be filled with a complete stack of sublayers, i.e. a stack of sublayers having a total height that can be equal to the predetermined slice height. Each sublayer of the stack of sublayers in the first outer wall part has a predetermined sublayer height that is a fraction of the predetermined slice height. The second outer wall part of said respective slice can be filled with a main layer having a predetermined main layer height that is equal to the predetermined slice height of said respective slice.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0032">In this way, the outer wall of the 3D object can at least partially be provided with a second outer wall part that has a lower smoothness and therefore a higher surface roughness than the enhanced smoothness of the outer surface of the 3D object. Preferably, an internal boundary can be defined in all slices of the number of slices in order to divide the outer wall of each slice into said first outer wall part and said second outer wall part. The person skilled in the art will appreciate that by dividing the outer wall of at least one slice of the number of slices into said first outer wall part and said second outer wall part, it is not necessary to print the entire outer wall of the 3D object with the same enhanced smoothness of the outer surface of the 3D object. Hence, the printing time of the 3D object can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0033">If a slice of the number of slices has a slice height that is smaller than the predetermined main layer height, i.e. the respective slice cannot accommodate a main layer, the internal boundary cannot be defined in said respective slice. Instead, the respective slice can be filled with a plurality of sublayers, wherein each sublayer of the plurality of sublayers has a predetermined sublayer height that is a fraction of the predetermined slice height. The person skilled in the art will appreciate that each sublayer of the plurality of sublayers and each sublayer of the stack of sublayers in the first outer wall part usually have a predetermined sublayer height that is a same fraction of the predetermined slice height. In this way, the enhanced smoothness of the outer surface of the 3D object as a whole can still be achieved.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0034">The person skilled in the art will appreciate that instead of being used to enable reducing an additional printing time of a 3D object related to printing of an outer surface having an enhanced smoothness, the method according to the present invention can also be used to reduce the total printing time of a 3D object that has an outer surface with a predetermined smoothness that already meets the requirements of a particular application. The latter is enabled by providing at least one slice of the number of slices that can be determined for the 3D model of the 3D object with a first outer wall part and a second outer wall part, wherein the first outer wall part has an enhanced smoothness compared to the second outer wall part. Hence, the method according to the present invention can reduce an additional printing time of a 3D object related to printing of an outer surface of the 3D object, wherein the outer surface has an enhanced smoothness. Alternatively, the method according to the present invention can reduce the printing time of the 3D object if the outer surface already has an appropriate smoothness.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0035">The person skilled in the art will appreciate that it is also possible that each sublayer of the plurality of sublayers has a predetermined sublayer height that is a first fraction of the predetermined slice height and that each sublayer of the stack of sublayers in the first outer wall part has a predetermined sublayer height that is a second fraction of the predetermined slice height, wherein the first fraction and the second fraction are not the same. In that case, a difference in enhanced smoothness of parts of the outer surface of the 3D object could be achieved.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0036">In the context of the present invention a fraction is to be construed as a part of the total.

However, the additional printing time related to printing of the first outer wall part with the enhanced smoothness, i.e. enhanced resolution or reduced roughness, would be sub-optimal as more high-resolution tracks in the first outer wall part than at least one of desired and necessary would have to be printed.

The second outer wall part <b>2</b><i>b </i>that is filled with tracks of a second type of tracks <b>7</b> having a predetermined second track height <b>23</b> provides a low-resolution part of the outer wall having a less smooth outer surface than the first outer wall part.

The person skilled in the art will appreciate that the minimum percentage of the nominal track width of the track of the first type of tracks that can be achieved depends among others on the extrusion-based additive manufacturing process used, the geometry of the nozzle of the printhead used and on the type of feedstock material used. The same holds for the maximum percentage of the nominal track width of the track of the first type of tracks that can be achieved. The track width of the single track can be adjusted between the minimum percentage of the nominal track width of the track of the first type of tracks and the maximum percentage of the nominal track width of the track of the first type of tracks.

If this is not the case, a second decision step <b>208</b> instructs to check if the track width can be increased such that the track can touch the internal boundary. If this is possible, a seventh step <b>209</b> in the flow diagram <b>200</b> instructs to balance, i.e. adjust, the track width to touch the internal boundary. As mentioned above, the track width can be adjusted between the minimum percentage of the nominal track width of the track of the first type of tracks and the maximum percentage of the nominal track width of the track of the first type of tracks. If the width of the track cannot be adjusted such that the track can touch the boundary, i.e. when the required track width to touch the boundary is larger than the maximum track width, then an eight step <b>210</b> in the flow diagram <b>200</b> instructs to add an additional track inside the other track.

However, the total printing time of the different hemispheres only increases with a factor between 1.1 and 1.6. The observed spread for the factor is mostly caused by the thickness of the outer wall. The person skilled in the art will appreciate that by using the method according to the present invention, the additional printing time of a 3D object related to printing an outer wall having an outer surface with an enhanced smoothness can be reduced. Consequently, the total printing time of the 3D object having an outer surface with an enhanced smoothness can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows a first version of another exemplary, non-limiting 3D printed object <b>1</b> obtained with a method known in the art for printing with a coarse or low resolution. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows a second version of the exemplary, non-limiting 3D printed object <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> obtained with the method according to the present invention.
