It should be noted that these descriptions are illustrative purposes only and shall not be construed as limiting the present disclosure. Two or more embodiments may be arbitrarily combined in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">&#x3c;Rubber Composition&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The rubber composition of the present disclosure is a rubber composition containing a rubber component, a rubber-metal adhesion promoter containing Bi, and an organic acid salt of metal other than Bi.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the rubber composition of the present disclosure, a content of metal element other than Bi with respect to a content of Bi element (content of metal element other than Bi/content of Bi element) is more than 14 and 100 or less in terms of molar ratio, a content of the rubber-metal adhesion promoter is more than 1.5 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the rubber component, and the amount of substance of metal element other than Bi contained in the organic acid salt of metal other than Bi in the rubber composition is 0.01 mol or more.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">We have conducted extensive research on technologies that can realize excellent adhesiveness without containing cobalt salts in a rubber composition adhering to a metal member such as a steel cord. As a result, it is possible to obtain extremely excellent adhesiveness to a metal member in the present disclosure by, in addition to a rubber-metal adhesion promoter containing bismuth, containing a specific amount of an organic acid salt of metal other than bismuth and optimizing the content of the organic acid salt of metal other than Bi with respect to the content of Bi element and by a combined effect of the rubber-metal adhesion promoter and the organic acid salt of metal other than Bi including zinc organic acid.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the rubber composition, the content of metal element other than Bi with respect to the content of Bi element is more than 14 and 100 or less in terms of molar ratio. The reason is as follows. When the content of metal element other than Bi/the content of Bi element is 14 or less, the content of the metal other than Bi is smaller than the content of Bi, so that the combined effect cannot be sufficiently obtained. On the other hand, when the content of metal element other than Bi/the content of Bi element exceeds 100, the content of Bi is small, so that the effect of promoting adhesiveness to a metal member cannot be obtained. Therefore, sufficient adhesiveness to metal cannot be obtained in either case.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">From the same viewpoint, the content of metal element other than Bi with respect to the content of Bi element in the rubber composition is preferably 27 to 38 in terms of molar ratio.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Note that the content of Bi element and the content of metal element other than Bi in the rubber composition are a total content of Bi element and a total content of metal element other than Bi obtained from all the components contained in the rubber composition. Therefore, when Bi and a metal other than Bi are contained in the components other than the rubber-metal adhesion promoter and the compound of metal other than Bi, they are total contents including the contents of these Bi and metal other than Bi.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The following exemplifies and describes the components of the rubber composition of the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">(Rubber Component)</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The rubber composition of the present disclosure contains a rubber component.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The rubber component is not particularly limited, and a rubber component conventionally used in a rubber composition can be used.
