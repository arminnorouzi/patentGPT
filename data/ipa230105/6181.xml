The cover film <b>03</b> is laminated with the polarizer through a second optical clear adhesive (OCA<b>2</b>) <b>042</b>, the cooling fin <b>05</b> is laminated with the display module <b>01</b> through a first optical clear adhesive (OCA<b>1</b>) <b>041</b>, and the display module <b>01</b> may include the back film <b>011</b> and a panel film layer <b>012</b> located on the back film <b>011</b>. The display module <b>01</b> and the polarizer <b>02</b> are laminated with each other and then subjected to shape cutting and then laminated to the cover film <b>03</b>. As there are a lamination tolerance during laminating, a tolerance of laser cutting during cutting and a tolerance of cover film processing, an outline dimension of the cover film <b>03</b> needs unilateral expanding relative to the display module <b>01</b>. Specific tolerances and their calculations are as follows:</p><p id="p-0063" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D</i>=&#xb1;&#x221a;{square root over (<i>A</i><sup>2</sup><i>+B</i><sup>2</sup><i>+C</i><sup>2</sup>)}+=&#xb1;0.16.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">Wherein A represents the tolerance of cover film laminating, especially, is &#xb1;0.1 mm, B represents the tolerance of laser cutting during shape cutting, especially, is &#xb1;0.075 mm, C represents the tolerance of cover film processing, especially, is &#xb1;0.1 mm, so unilateral expanding D of the cover film <b>03</b> relative to the display module meets: D=0.2 mm (values calculated by the above formulas are theoretical values, a certain allowance is usually maintained for the sake of a yield and lowering process difficulty, and 0.16 is rounded up to be 0.2), which can guarantee that an edge of the display module <b>01</b> does not exceed an edge of the cover film <b>03</b> during laminating. Therefore, this manufacturing mode will lead to a large bezel of a finally formed display module.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061">Based on this, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for manufacturing a display panel, including the following.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">Step S<b>101</b>, a polarizer is laminated to a light exit surface of a display module. Specifically, the display module may be a display module in an Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED), and may include a back film and a panel film layer fabricated on the back film. The panel film layer may include a substrate film layer, and a display film layer and a touch film layer sequentially located on the substrate film layer.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0063">Step S<b>102</b>, a cover film is laminated to one surface of the polarizer away from the display module.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0064">Step S<b>103</b>, integrated shape cutting is performed on an outer edge of the display module with the polarizer and the cover film laminated thereto except an outer edge of the display module at a bonding side. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the display panel <b>100</b> has an upper edge, a lower edge, a left edge and a right edge. The lower edge is configured to be bonded to a chip on film <b>200</b>, that is, the lower edge serves as the bonding side. Shape cutting is mainly specific to non-bonding sides of the display panel <b>100</b> during cutting, that is, the upper edge, the left edge and the right edge are cut, as shown by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">The method for manufacturing the display panel provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure, includes: the polarizer is laminated to the light exit surface of the display module; and the cover film is laminated to the surface of the polarizer away from the display module. Integrated shape cutting is performed on the display module with the polarizer and the cover film laminated thereto, that is, laminating of the polarizer and the cover film to the surface of the display module is completed, and then integrated shape cutting is performed on the display module with the polarizer and the cover film laminated thereto. Compared with the prior art that in general, the display module with the polarizer laminated thereto is cut soon after the polarizer is laminated, and then the cover film is laminated, which may need the cover film to have a reserved expanding size relative to the display module due to estimation of process errors, and consequently, the finally formed display panel has a large bezel. By means of the method for manufacturing the display panel provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure, cutting is performed after the cover film is laminated, so the problem that the cover film needs to have the reserved expanding size and consequently the bezel of the display panel is wide can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">During specific implementation, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, after step S<b>103</b>, that is, after integrated shape cutting is performed on the display module with the polarizer and the cover film laminated thereto, the method further includes: step S<b>104</b>, a cooling fin is laminated to one surface of the display module away from the polarizer. Specifically, a size of the laminated cooling fin may be smaller than a size of the display module. That is, the laminating the cooling fin to the surface of the display module away from the polarizer includes: the cooling fin the size of which is smaller than the size of the display module is laminated to the surface of the display module away from the polarizer. In the embodiment of the present disclosure, the cooling fin is laminated to the surface of the display module away from the polarizer so as to dissipate heat generated by the display module during displaying. The size of the cooling fin is smaller than the size of the display module, so that the large bezel of the display panel due to a too large cooling fin can be avoided. It can be understood that the size of the cooling fin is smaller than the size of the display module, which is size comparison between laminated surfaces of them when the both are laminated. In other words, for example, if the cooling fin is laminated to the back film of the display module, a region occupied by the back film covers an orthographic projection of the cooling fin on the back film. Specifically, a material of the cooling fin may be metal, especially, stainless steel (SUS).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067">During specific implementation, the laminating the cooling fin to the surface of the display module away from the polarizer includes: the cooling fin is laminated on the surface of the display module away from the polarizer through a first optical clear adhesive.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068">During specific implementation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, after performing integrated shape cutting on the display module with the polarizer and the cover film laminated thereto and before laminating the cooling fin to the surface of the display module away from the polarizer, the method further includes: step S<b>105</b>, a protective film is laminated to one surface of the cover film away from the polarizer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the protective film <b>6</b> is laminated to the surface of the cover film <b>3</b> away from the polarizer <b>2</b>. A size of the protective film <b>6</b> may be smaller than a size of the cover film, that is, an orthographic projection of the protective film <b>6</b> on the cover film <b>3</b> is covered by a region occupied by the cover film <b>3</b> so as to avoid influence on a size of a bezel of the display module. In the embodiment of the present disclosure, before laminating the cooling fin, the method further includes: the protective film is laminated to the surface of the cover film away from the polarizer so that a situation that after the cover film is laminated, it needs turning over to laminate the cooling fin to the other surface of the display module, and consequently, a surface of the cover film may be abraded.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0069">During specific implementation, in step S<b>103</b>, that is, integrated shape cutting is performed on the display module with the polarizer and the cover film laminated thereto, includes: integrated shape cutting is performed on the display module with the polarizer and the cover film laminated thereto through a laser cutting process.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">During specific implementation, in step S<b>102</b>, that is, the cover film is laminated to the surface of the polarizer away from the display module, includes: the cover film is laminated to the surface of the polarizer away from the display module through a second optical clear adhesive.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0071">Based on the same disclosed concept, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>O</figref>, an embodiment of the present disclosure further provides a display panel, including: a display module <b>1</b>; a polarizer <b>2</b>, located on a light exit surface of the display module <b>1</b> (for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, an upper surface of the display module <b>1</b> is the light exit surface), wherein at least one outer edge of the polarizer <b>2</b> is flush with an outer edge of the display module <b>1</b>; and a cover film <b>3</b>, located on one surface of the polarizer <b>2</b> away from the display module <b>1</b>, wherein an outer edge of the cover film <b>3</b> except an outer edge of the cover film <b>3</b> at a bonding side is flush with an outer edge of the display module <b>1</b> except an outer edge of the display module <b>1</b> at the bonding side.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">The display panel provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure, includes: the display module <b>1</b>; the polarizer <b>2</b>, located on the light exit surface of the display module <b>1</b>, wherein the at least one outer edge of the polarizer <b>2</b> is flush with the outer edge of the display module <b>1</b>; and the cover film <b>3</b>, located on the surface of the polarizer <b>2</b> away from the display module <b>1</b>, wherein the outer edge of the cover film <b>3</b> except the outer edge of the cover film <b>3</b> at the bonding side is flush with the outer edge of the display module <b>1</b> except the outer edge of the display module <b>1</b> at the bonding side. That is, during manufacturing, laminating of the polarizer and the cover film to the surface of the display module can be completely, and then integrated shape cutting is performed on the display module with the polarizer and the cover film laminated thereto.
