Meanwhile, the Internet is replete with sources of information relevant to specific geographic locations, from websites for travelers to online encyclopedias.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Individuals interested in travel, educational organizations, and organizations performing business intelligence functions would benefit from a software program with GIS functionality as well as information from online sources that is relevant to specific geographic locations. However, most users do not have access to GIS data, let alone multiple GIS data sets regarding multiple topics that may be of interest to the user. Furthermore, finding information regarding location-specific topics requires independent research from a multitude of sources on the Internet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for a graphical user interface that provides functionality for users to view GIS data regarding topics of interest and identify locations of interest. Furthermore, there is a need for a graphical user interface that organizes and presents the disparate information available via the Internet regarding those topics and locations of interest and provides functionality for users to identify and learn about objects of interest in those locations. Finally, having identified locations and objects of interest, there is a need for a graphical user interface that identifies transportation and accommodation to travel to those locations and objects of interest, preferably within the user's time frame and budget (and, ideally, optimized to minimize travel time, avoid times when attractions are closed or crowded, etc.).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to overcome those and other disadvantages in the prior art, a mapping system that stores user profile data and geographic information system (GIS) map data is provided.

The boundaries of the geographic locations may be adjusted to conform to subnational boundaries. The composite maps provide functionality for users to identify locations of interest.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The mapping system may also receive third-party geographic data regarding each location of interest to the user. The third-party geographic data may be organized into a hierarchical taxonomy.

The database <b>112</b> may be any repository of data accessible by the map program <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the map program <b>110</b> may be realized by software instructions stored and executed by the server computer <b>102</b> (e.g., a web application) and available to the user device <b>104</b> (e.g., via a web browser).

The mapping system <b>200</b> may also include digital footprint data <b>230</b> and third-party geographic data <b>270</b>. As described in detail below, the mapping program <b>110</b> uses the user profile data <b>220</b> and the GIS map data <b>240</b> to generate component maps <b>250</b> and composite maps <b>260</b> of interest to the user. Also, the mapping program <b>110</b> uses the user profile data <b>220</b>, the composite maps <b>260</b>, and the third-party geographic data <b>270</b> to generate thematic threads <b>280</b>, which are visual depictions of information relevant to the locations of interest to the user.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The user profile data <b>220</b> may include any information used by the mapping program <b>110</b> to identify topics of interest to the user. The user profile data <b>220</b> may be stored by the server computer <b>102</b> in any non-transitory computer-readable storage medium (for example, the database <b>112</b>).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The user profile data <b>220</b> may include information input by the user (via the graphical user interface <b>290</b>) and information determined by the mapping program <b>110</b> (e.g., using the digital footprint data <b>230</b> of the user as described below). For example, the mapping program <b>110</b> may solicit the user to identify demographic information of the user and topics of interest to the user via the graphical user interface <b>290</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, the mapping program <b>110</b> may identify topics of interest to the user by developing a psychometric profile of the user (for example, by asking the user to make a series of pairwise comparisons). If a set of users of the mapping program <b>110</b> have identified topics of interest and the mapping program <b>110</b> has developed psychometric profiles of those users, the mapping program <b>110</b> may compare the psychometric profile of the user to the psychometric profiles of the users and infer that the user has similar topics of interest as other users with similar psychometric profiles, demographics, locations of interest, other topics of interest, etc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, the mapping program <b>110</b> may use the digital footprint data <b>230</b> of the user to infer topics of interest to that user. The analysis of the digital footprint data <b>230</b> may also be used to generate the psychometric profile of the user, which may then be used to identify users with similar psychometric profiles, demographics, and/or other user profile data <b>220</b> as described above. The digital footprint data <b>230</b> of the user may be received by the server computer <b>102</b> from third-party sources (not shown) via the network <b>108</b>. The digital footprint data <b>230</b> and/or the analysis of the digital footprint data <b>230</b> may be stored (temporarily or permanently) by the server computer <b>102</b> in any non-transitory computer-readable storage medium (for example, the database <b>112</b>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The digital footprint data <b>230</b> of the user may include any data created by the user while using the internet. For example, the digital footprint data <b>230</b> of the user may include the user's internet search history, social media posts and photographs, location data identifying the location of a mobile device of the user, etc. The mapping program <b>110</b> may analyze the social media posts of the user (for example, using natural language processing) to identify locations and topics of interest of the user.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The mapping program <b>110</b> may analyze photographs in the digital footprint data <b>230</b> of the user (e.g., photographs taken by or shared by the user) to identify locations and topics of interest to the user. For example, the mapping program <b>110</b> may identify the location of the photograph by reading the metadata included in the photograph. In those instances, the mapping program <b>110</b> may infer the geographic coordinates of the photograph (i.e., the country, the city, etc.) and potential topics of interest in the immediate vicinity of those coordinates (e.g., specific buildings, festivals that occurred at that location during that time, etc.). In another example, the mapping program <b>110</b> may analyze the content of those photographs (e.g., using object recognition algorithms) to identify the subject matter of the photographs (e.g., the topology and flora of landscape photographs, specific historical objects, specific buildings, architectural styles, etc.) and infer that the user has an interest in that identified subject matter.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The GIS map data <b>240</b> includes maps, in the GIS format, that each depict the geographic distribution of information. The information depicted in each map is relevant to one or more topics. For example, each map in the GIS map data <b>240</b> may include one or more keywords identifying the relevant topics of the information depicted in the map. In most instances, the information depicted in each map will be relevant to a specific date or time period identified in the GIS map data <b>240</b>.
