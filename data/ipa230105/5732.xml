One such technique is called electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), where an electron beam emerging from a sample is dispersed into an energy spectrum and one or more bands of energy are individually imaged. In the current iteration of EELS, however, there is a loss of energy resolution due to a variety of issues, such as microscope misalignments, chromatic aberrations, and unintended lensing effects. All of these issues add up and result in a loss of energy resolution on the EELS detector. This loss of resolution may be at least partially due to a desired portion of an electron beam not being focused on a spectrum plane of the EELS system due to these issues. For example, the electron beam transmitted through a sample may have a different focal point exiting an objective lens due to chromatic aberrations of the objective lens. This change in focal point along the optical axis will translate into a change in location of a crossover plane in the electron energy loss spectrometer (or simply &#x2018;energy spectrometer&#x2019;) with respect to a spectrum plane. This change in location with respect to the spectrum plane may lead to a defocus of the electron beam at the EELS detector, and by that, may affect the energy resolution on the EELS detector. These effects of spectrum defocus may be compensated (partially) by proper (re-)focusing of the energy spectrometer. However, as the microscope's and energy spectrometer's operating parameters are varied, such as needed to change magnification or to select different energy bands of the electron beam, this defocus at the detector may change, and by that, loss of resolution at the EELS detector may change and the previously obtained focus-setting of the spectrometer may no longer be optimal. Accordingly, the degree of energy resolution loss is dependent on the operating parameters, and a solution may be needed for each permutation of operating parameters.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An energy spectrometer with dynamic focus for a transmission electron microscope (TEM) is disclosed herein.

EELS is conventionally performed using an energy spectrometer mounted at the end of the microscope's column. Such energy spectrometer may also be referred to as a post column filter (PCF). Energy spectrometers are used to obtain energy spectra of transmission data. For example, a sample in a TEM is interrogated with an electron beam of a desired energy and some of the electrons exiting from the sample have reduced energy characteristic of various properties of the sample. These properties may be chemical or crystalline, for example. The energy spectrometer may then be used to view the energy distribution of the emerging electron beam to look for peaks at various energy levels that provide data on the sample material. Given current TEM and detector technology, the peaks can be highly resolved to millielectronvolt levels, for example. However, imperfections in the microscopes may blur the data such that the desired resolution is reduced or lost. The loss of resolution may be due to the electron beam being defocused as it propagates through portions of the microscope and the energy spectrometer. This loss of focus may not be static and may change depending on the microscope settings. As higher resolution energy spectra are desired, the defocusing becomes a larger problem. As such, a solution to the problem is highly desirable.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example illustration of a portion of a microscope system <b>100</b> as currently known in the art. The microscope system <b>100</b> includes a portion of a TEM <b>102</b> and an energy spectrometer <b>104</b>. The microscope system <b>100</b> may be used to obtain energy spectra of a sample <b>106</b>, but may suffer from defocusing of the electron beam <b>124</b> on detector <b>122</b> due to operating parameters of microscope <b>102</b> and energy filter <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">To illustrate, as electron beam <b>124</b> emerges from sample <b>106</b> the electron beam <b>124</b> takes a trajectory along the optical axis of the microscope <b>102</b>. This trajectory is dependent upon the energy of the electrons in the electron beam and further dependent upon the operating parameters of the microscope <b>102</b>. The operating parameters include operating parameters of the projection system <b>108</b>, for example, such as an adjustment of the magnification setting of the microscope for the magnification from the sample <b>106</b> towards the cross-over point at the end of the microscope <b>102</b>. Freedom of variation of this magnification is desirable for the user of the microscope system, because this magnification determines how much the cone of electron beam <b>124</b> exiting the sample is compressed towards the energy spectrometer. More compression results in a larger part of the cone of electron beam <b>124</b> being accepted by the spectrometer's entrance aperture. Operating parameters determine excitation settings of optical elements, such as lenses, multipole and quadrupole elements of the projection system <b>108</b>. It should be noted that the operating parameters are changed depending on the energy of the primary electron beam, e.g., the energy of the electron beam used to interrogate the sample. However, due to sample-electron interaction, the electron beam emerging from the sample will include some energy loss. The energy loss is desirable, however, since measuring the loss at a range of energies is what will be measured by the energy spectrometer <b>104</b>. Yet, the energy loss also affects the crossover locations of the electron beam in the microscope <b>102</b> and the energy spectrometer <b>104</b>. This change in crossover results in a defocus of the electron beam spectrum on the detector <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, an electron beam propagating through microscope <b>102</b> without any energy loss may have a crossover location, e.g., focal point, as indicated. However, an electron beam having some energy loss will have a different crossover location, AZ offset as indicated, which will propagate through the microscope <b>102</b> and the energy spectrometer <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The energy spectrometer <b>104</b> includes a lens <b>110</b>, a dispersive element <b>112</b>, which includes a bias tube <b>114</b>, lenses <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, a plurality of optical elements (lenses, quadrupoles, and multipoles) <b>120</b> and the detector <b>122</b>. The dispersive element <b>112</b> is energized to disperse or &#x2018;fan out&#x2019; the beam in a band of different energies. The plurality of optics <b>120</b> is for focusing and magnifying this band on the detector <b>122</b>. Typically, this band of energies is smaller (does not cover) the complete range of the EELS spectrum which the operator is interested in and wants to record. Therefore, bias tube <b>114</b> is provided that can be electrically biased to add various amounts, up to 2 keV for example, of energy to the electron beam <b>124</b>. This can be used to shift the band of energies recorded by the detector <b>122</b> (such shift of the energy band can, of course, also be accomplished by adjusting the excitation of the dispersive element or by adjusting the operating potential of the electron microscope; such methods, however, have the drawback of having relatively long settling times and/or of suffering from magnetic hysteresis). Because of its electrostatic nature, the liner tube can establish shifts from one energy band to another energy band in just fractions of a millisecond, thus allowing near-simultaneous recording of multiple energy bands (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,832,901B2, incorporated herein for all purposes). The detector <b>122</b> may be arranged at a conjugate of a spectrum plane of the spectrometer so that the electron beam is focused on the detector <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The various components <b>110</b> through <b>120</b>, like in the microscope <b>102</b>, may be configured with operating parameters based on the primary electron beam energy, not the energy beam with energy loss. It should also be noted that the ends <b>114</b>A and <b>114</b>B of the liner tube <b>114</b> may form unintended lenses due to electrical bias differences between the bias tube <b>114</b> and the grounded elements that are coupled thereto, such as a liner tube encompassing the optical axis. Since the energy spectrometer <b>104</b> is configured to operate based on the energy of the primary electron beam, any defocus of the energy loss beam occurring in the microscope <b>102</b> will propagate into the energy spectrometer <b>104</b> resulting in a proportional defocus amount of AZ. The change in focus will move the crossover point from the spectrum plane to a location before or after the spectrum plane. Such change in crossover point will result in the energy spectra being defocused at the detector <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">One solution to the above discussed problem includes the addition of an extra optical element into the path of the electron beam to refocus the electron beam onto the spectrum plane, and ultimately the detector. The extra optical component may be inserted anywhere after the sample to just before the detector of an energy spectrometer. The optical element may be energized, e.g., electrically biased, depending on the operating parameters of the microscope and/or the energy spectrometer, and a change in operating parameters results in a change to the electrical bias level of the optical element. As such, as EELS experiments are conducted at different spectrum bands centered at different energy losses, the overall system can be dynamically focused to account for the differing operating parameters while maintaining a desired focus.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The optical element may be any form of charged particle optics, such as a lens or a multipole element. In some examples, the optical element may take the form of two opposing plates, similar to an electrostatic shutter. The two opposing plates may be contained within a circular envelope, where the opposing plates are biased as needed and the envelope is grounded. An example multipole device is a quadrupole, where two opposing members are biased while the others are grounded. However, as one skilled in the art understands, the multipole device provides greater degrees of freedom for beam manipulation, and, as such, can be biased to not only refocus the electron beam but also biased to partly stigmate the electron beam (that is, to a apply a small amount of a cylinder-like lens), as may be needed, e.g., to compensate for small unroundness of the unintended lenses <b>114</b>A and <b>114</b>B. Other higher order multipoles are also contemplated herein and would provide greater degrees of freedom for beam manipulation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a charged particle microscope <b>200</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. CPM <b>200</b> may be a TEM <b>202</b> in some examples and includes an energy spectrometer <b>204</b>. The energy spectrometer may be used to obtain EEL spectra, for example. The CPM <b>200</b> may include an optical element to reduce or negate any defocusing problems that occur during acquisition of spectra. In some examples, the optical element can be biased to a level based on the operating parameters of the microscope and/or energy spectrometer so that the refocusing is dynamic.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">TEM <b>202</b> includes source <b>228</b>, illumination system <b>230</b>, projection system <b>208</b>, various detectors <b>232</b>, all of which can be controlled by controller <b>226</b>. Source <b>228</b> may be an electron source, such as a Schottky source or a (cold) field emission gun (CFEG) and provides a beam of electrons that propagate along the optical axis of TEM <b>202</b> to interact with sample <b>206</b>. Illumination system <b>230</b> includes a plurality of electron optic components to condition the electron beam for delivery to the sample <b>206</b>. Conditioning the electron beam may include collimation, astigmatism correction and focusing the electron beam at the sample plane. Projection system <b>208</b>, as discussed above, may include a variety of electrostatic/magnetic lenses, deflectors, correctors (such as stigmators), etc., that are used to focus the electron beam emerging from sample <b>206</b> onto one of the various detectors <b>232</b>. In some examples, projection system <b>208</b> focuses and conditions the electron beam for delivery to energy spectrometer <b>204</b>. The various detectors <b>232</b> may individually be moved in and out of the optical path to provide different detection schemes for TEM <b>202</b>. The detectors <b>232</b> may include an imaging screen, a TEM camera and a STEM camera.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Energy spectrometer <b>204</b> includes dispersive element <b>212</b> (with bias tube <b>214</b>), optical element <b>234</b>, a plurality of optics <b>220</b>, and detector <b>222</b>. Many of the components of energy spectrometer <b>204</b> were discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and will not be revisited for sake of brevity. It will be noted that the other components of energy spectrometer <b>104</b> that are not specifically shown in energy spectrometer <b>204</b> are included, but left out of the drawing. The additional component, namely optical element <b>234</b>, is included in energy spectrometer <b>204</b> to refocus the electron beam as discussed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, optical component <b>234</b> is shown downstream from dispersive element <b>212</b>, but this is not the only location to arrange the optical element. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> for alternative locations. In general, optical element <b>234</b> can be arranged upstream from dispersive element <b>212</b> (but downstream from the sample <b>206</b>), or it can be arranged downstream of dispersive element <b>212</b>, such as before, within or after the plurality of optics <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Controller <b>226</b> may include one or more processing cores and memory storing executable code. In addition, controller <b>226</b> may provide operating voltages to some of the components of system <b>200</b>, or be coupled to voltage supplies (not shown) that provide operating voltages in response to control signals provided by controller <b>226</b>. For example, controller <b>226</b> may provide control and/or voltages to illumination system <b>230</b>, projection system <b>208</b>, and optical element <b>234</b>. Further, controller <b>226</b> may control operation of detector <b>222</b> and/or receive data from detector <b>222</b>. In general, controller <b>226</b> sets the operating parameters of system <b>200</b> and adjusts the electrical bias of optical element <b>234</b> to dynamically focus the electron beam onto detector <b>222</b> in response to changes in operating conditions of the system <b>200</b>, such as the magnification.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Optical element <b>234</b> may be formed from a multipole element containing two or more electrically conductive elements. In some examples, optical element <b>234</b> is formed from two opposing conductive elements, similar to a deflector- or shutter-type arrangement, housed in a conductive body. In other examples, the optical element <b>234</b> is formed from a quadrupole or higher order multipole element. Regardless of the physical example, the optical element may be electrically biased to a level based on operating parameters of TEM <b>202</b> and/or energy filter <b>204</b>. For example, a desired minimum or maximum collection angle for the cone of electrons exiting the sample will determine a desired magnification from sample to cross-over and thus will result in excitation energies of the projection optics <b>208</b> in the TEM <b>202</b>; desired bands of EELS spectra (depending on the chemical composition of the sample and the resulting features in the EELS spectra that the operator desires to record) will determine the electrical biases applied to a bias tube <b>214</b> included in dispersive element <b>212</b> and thus will result in unintended lenses (not shown) at the entrance and exit locations of bias tube <b>214</b>, similar to unintended lenses <b>114</b>A and <b>114</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Such operating parameters may determine what bias level to provide to optical element <b>234</b>, which may be provided by or controlled by controller <b>226</b>. For example, the higher the bias to bias tube <b>214</b>, the higher the bias level provided to optical element <b>234</b>. In the shutter-type optical element configuration, the two opposing conductive elements may be provided the same electrical bias, which may be from 10 Volts to +10 Volts. Again, the level depends on the operating parameters of CPM <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In operation, an electron beam generated by source <b>228</b> at a primary energy is projected toward sample <b>206</b>, where the electron beam interacts with the sample. The interaction may result in some of the electrons losing energy by an amount associated with various material characteristics of sample <b>206</b>. The electron beam emerging from sample <b>206</b> may then include electrons of different energies across a range of energies. The emerging electron beam may then propagate at different trajectories than the electrons of the primary energy, which affects their focal point, e.g., crossover locations, along the rest of the optical path including the energy filter <b>204</b> and the TEM <b>202</b>. As the emerging electron beam passes through the dispersive element <b>212</b>, the emerging electron beam is (consecutively) steered into different bands of energy by the dispersive element <b>212</b> and the bias tube <b>214</b> and recorded by the detector <b>222</b>. However, due to the change in focal point of the different energies, the one or more bands may not be focused on the spectrum plane to which the detector is arranged in conjugate thereof. The defocused problem will result in a loss of resolution. To refocus the electron beam, the optical element <b>234</b> is biased based on the current operating parameters. Biasing the optical element <b>234</b> will adjust the trajectory of the bands to align their cross-over location with the spectrum plane, and thus the detector <b>222</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an illustrative energy spectrometer <b>304</b> including a refocusing optical element in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The energy spectrometer <b>304</b> can be included as an analytical add-on to a TEM, similar to system <b>200</b> for example, and is used to obtain energy spectra of a sample. As such, energy spectrometer <b>304</b> may receive an electron beam from a TEM <b>302</b>, and steer the electron beam (consecutively) into a plurality of bands based on the respective energies of the bands. Subsequently, these bands may be directed toward a detector.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Energy spectrometer <b>304</b> includes many of the elements disclosed with regards to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which will not be discussed again for sake of brevity. However, energy spectrometer <b>304</b> further includes the additional optical element <b>334</b> for refocusing electron beam <b>324</b> and/or the various energy bands onto the detector <b>322</b>. The optical element <b>334</b> may be a multipole element including 2 or more conductive elements for manipulating the trajectory of the electron beam <b>324</b>. While now shown, optical element <b>334</b> also includes electrical contacts so that the optical element <b>334</b> may be electrically biased. For a two conductive element example of the optical element <b>334</b>, both conductive elements may be biased with the same voltage, which may be in the range from &#x2212;10V to +10V for example. For optical elements with a higher number of conductive elements, various biasing schemes as known in the art may be employed so that the electron beam <b>324</b> is refocused and possibly stigmated.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although optical element <b>334</b> is shown at location A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, other locations are also possible. For example, optical element <b>334</b> may alternatively be arranged at locations B, C, D, E and F. Arranging optical element <b>334</b> at any of locations A through F is possible, but location A may be the most straightforward in terms of design and fabrication. Some locations other than A, however, may affect the electrical bias requirements. Regardless of location, electrically biasing the optical element <b>334</b> based on the operating parameters of TEM <b>302</b> and/or energy spectrometer <b>304</b> will reduce or eliminate any defocusing of electron beam <b>324</b>, e.g., refocus electron beam <b>324</b>, so that the electron beam <b>324</b> is focused on the spectrum plane and, ultimately, the detector <b>322</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> are an end view and a side view, respectively, of an optical element <b>434</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.
