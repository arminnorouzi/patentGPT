accompanying drawings, which will be easily implemented by those skilled in the art. However, the present disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and is not limited to the embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the following description of the embodiments of the present disclosure, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the present disclosure rather unclear. Parts not related to the description of the present disclosure in the drawings are omitted, and like parts are denoted by similar reference numerals.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the present disclosure, when a component is referred to as being &#x201c;linked&#x201d;, &#x201c;coupled&#x201d;, or &#x201c;connected&#x201d; to another component, it is understood that not only a direct connection relationship but also an indirect connection relationship through an intermediate component may also be included. Also, when a component is referred to as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; or &#x201c;having&#x201d; another component, it may mean further inclusion of another component not the exclusion thereof, unless explicitly described to the contrary.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the present disclosure, the terms first, second, etc. are used only for the purpose of distinguishing one component from another, and do not limit the order or importance of components, etc. unless specifically stated otherwise. Thus, within the scope of this disclosure, a first component in one exemplary embodiment may be referred to as a second component in another embodiment, and similarly a second component in one exemplary embodiment may be referred to as a first component.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the present disclosure, components that are distinguished from each other are intended to clearly illustrate each feature. However, it does not necessarily mean that the components are separate. That is, a plurality of components may be integrated into one hardware or software unit, or a single component may be distributed into a plurality of hardware or software units. Thus, unless otherwise noted, such integrated or distributed embodiments are also included within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the present disclosure, components described in the various exemplary embodiments are not necessarily essential components, and some may be optional components.

Also, exemplary embodiments that include other components in addition to the components described in the various embodiments are also included in the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Advantages and features of the present disclosure, and methods for achieving them will be apparent with reference to the exemplary embodiments described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein but may be embodied in many different forms. The present exemplary embodiments are provided to make disclosed contents of the present disclosure thorough and complete and to completely convey the scope of the disclosure to those with ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although exemplary embodiment is described as using a plurality of units to perform the exemplary process, it is understood that the exemplary processes may also be performed by one or plurality of modules. Additionally, it is understood that the term controller/control unit refers to a hardware device that includes a memory and a processor and is specifically programmed to execute the processes described herein. The memory is configured to store the modules and the processor is specifically configured to execute said modules to perform one or more processes which are described further below.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">An aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a system for controlling next-generation aerial mobilities such as urban air mobility (UAM) and personal air vehicle (PAV). When a configuration or operation of an aerial vehicle control system is described according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a personal aerial vehicle is used, but the present disclosure does not limit next-generation aerial mobilities to personal aerial vehicles, and various next-generation mobilities may be used.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>C</figref> are views illustrating operation zones for an aerial vehicle used in an aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, an aerial vehicle control system may control movement of an aerial vehicle, particularly to enable the aerial vehicle to move in an aerial vehicle operation zone.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set based on a road zone in which a moving object is operated. Herein, the road zone may be a zone on the ground in which a road is set. Herein, the road may include a driveway, in which a moving object is moved, and a sidewalk zone in which people move. As another example, a road zone may include a road zone and a roadside clear zone, which are set according to a road act.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As an example, an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set as a zone at a predetermined height or higher above a road zone. Furthermore, in case a personal aerial vehicle has an abnormality and lands or crashes while operating in an aerial vehicle operation zone set above a road zone, a moving object (or a person) moving in the road zone may be affected. Accordingly, it is desirable that an aerial vehicle operation zone is set vertically above a neighboring zone of a road zone (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;roadside zone&#x201d;), instead of vertically above the road zone. For example, it is desirable that a preset distance range from a road zone is set as a roadside zone and an aerial vehicle operation zone is set above the roadside zone. Furthermore, a predetermined buffer zone may be set between the road zone and the roadside zone.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, an aerial vehicle operation zone may include a multiplicity of operation zones that are distinguished in vertical direction. For example, an aerial vehicle operation zone may include a first operation zone and a second operation zone, and the first operation zone may be managed as a higher course than the second operation zone. In addition, a first operation zone may be set and managed as a relatively higher zone than a second operation zone. Accordingly, an aerial vehicle control system may control an aerial vehicle moving at relatively high speed to move in the first operation zone and control an aerial vehicle moving at relatively low speed to move in the second operation zone. As another example, an aerial vehicle control system may manage a second operation zone as a slow land and a first operation zone as a fast lane.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As yet another example, a type of an aerial vehicle may be set according to size or purpose of use, and a type of an aerial vehicle capable of operating in a multiplicity of operation zones may be set and managed. As an example, according to purpose of use, aerial vehicles may be classified into passenger aerial vehicles and cargo aerial vehicles. Accordingly, an aerial vehicle control system may control a passenger aerial vehicle to move in the first operation zone and control a cargo aerial vehicle to move in the second operation zone. As another example, according to size, aerial vehicles may be classified into small aerial vehicles, mid-sized aerial vehicles and large aerial vehicles. Correspondingly, an aerial vehicle control system may control an aerial vehicle with relatively large size to operate in a higher course. As an example, an aerial vehicle control system may control a large aerial vehicle to move in the first operation zone and control a small aerial vehicle or a mid-sized aerial vehicle to move in the second operation zone. As yet another example, an aerial vehicle operation zone may include a first operation zone, a second operation zone and a third operation zone, and an aerial vehicle control system may control a large aerial vehicle to move in the first operation zone, a mid-sized aerial vehicle to move in the second operation zone and a small aerial vehicle to move in the third operation zone.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a first operation zone, a second operation zone and a third operation zone are illustrated as multiple operation zones, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and the number of operation zones may vary.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, an aerial vehicle operation zone may include a supplementary operation zone capable of expanding an operation zone either vertically or horizontally. For example, there may be an obstacle at a certain point or in a section of an aerial vehicle operation zone, a supplementary operation zone may be set to drive by evading the obstacle. As an example, a supplementary operation zone may be configured by expanding an operation zone in vertical direction. As another example, one of 8 directions from an operation path of an aerial vehicle may be set as a supplementary operation zone.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Furthermore, a supplementary operation zone may be configured adaptively according to a type of an obstacle. For example, in case there is a fixed obstacle, an aerial vehicle control system may set a supplementary operation zone in a corresponding section so that an aerial vehicle operation zone may be managed by being temporarily expanded. As another example, in case a movable obstacle is identified, an aerial vehicle control system may identify a movement direction and speed of the movable obstacle and set a supplementary operation zone by selecting one of 8 directions from an operation course of an aerial vehicle as an optimal evasion zone.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As an example, an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set based on a predetermined altitude. As another example, an aerial vehicle operation zone may change its altitude adaptively according to weather information. For example, weather information may include information for identifying weather conditions like snowfall, rainfall, fog and the like, and an altitude range of an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set based on such weather information. An altitude range of an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set in predetermined distance units (e.g., 300 m, 500 m, and 1 km).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Meanwhile, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, an aerial vehicle may enter an aerial vehicle operation zone restrictedly through a take-off and landing facility. Herein, the take-off and landing facility may include a space, in which an aerial vehicle may take off or land, and a controller capable of controlling entry into and exit from an aerial vehicle operation zone. As an example, the take-off and landing facility may include an expressway tollgate facility, a service facility and the like. Furthermore, it is desirable that the take-off and landing facility is installed at one side or both sides of a road zone.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As another example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a road zone may have a northbound lane and a southbound lane separate from each other, and an expressway tollgate facility, a service facility and the like may be installed in the central areas of the northbound lane and the southbound lane respectively. Thus, a take-off and landing facility may be located in the central area of a road zone.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Furthermore, a take-off and landing facility may be connected with a control server that performs control of take-off and landing of an aerial vehicle, control of entry into and exit from an aerial vehicle operation zone, and information exchange with an aerial vehicle. A control server may include a local control server and a central control server. A local control server may include a server that is provided within a take-off and landing facility or adjacent to the take-off and landing facility. In addition, a central control server may include a server that is connected with at least one local control server and performs overall control of an aerial vehicle control system.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a conceptual view showing schematically a configuration of an aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a view illustrating a structure of an aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a take-off and landing facility and an aerial vehicle operation zone may be set, and an aerial vehicle control system may control the movement or operation of a personal aerial vehicle in the take-off and landing facility and the aerial vehicle operation zone.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A take-off and landing facility may include a stop, in which a personal aerial vehicle or a moving object may stop, and a take-off and landing field in which a personal aerial vehicle may take off and land. Herein, the stop and the take-off and landing field may be set as different areas on a single plane. As another example, a take-off and landing facility may include a building constructed with a multiplicity of floors, and a stop and a take-off and landing field may be set on different floors. As yet another example, a stop may be configured to separate areas in which a personal aerial vehicle or a moving object may stop. For example, a stop may include a first stop, where a personal aerial vehicle stands, and a second stop where a moving object stops. A first stop and a second stop may set as different areas on a single plane or as different floors. As yet another example, a first stop and a take-off and landing field may be set as different areas on a single plane, and a second stop may be set as a different floor from the first stop and the take-off and landing field.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">For example, a personal aerial vehicle may be available in a road zone, a stop, a take-off and landing field and an aerial vehicle operation zone and may include a moving object with a shape capable of vertical take-off and landing (e.g., vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and electric vertical take-off and landing (e-VTOL)). Accordingly, a personal aerial vehicle may move from a road zone to a stop, a take-off and landing field and the like and move from the take-off and landing field to an aerial vehicle operation zone under the control of a control server (local control server or central control server). In addition, under the control of a control server (local control server or central control server), a personal aerial vehicle may move from an aerial vehicle operation zone to a take-off and landing field.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Furthermore, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, a section, in which a personal aerial vehicle is moved from a take-off and landing field to an aerial vehicle operation zone, is called an entry section, and a section, in which the personal aerial vehicle is moved from the aerial vehicle operation zone to the take-off and landing field, is called an exit section.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Meanwhile, a central control server may be connected with a local control server via a communication network and receive information on a personal aerial vehicle from the local control server. In addition, the central control server may provide the local control server with information necessary to control a personal aerial vehicle or to control an entry section or an exit section. In addition, the central control server may provide operation information necessary for a personal aerial vehicle to operate in an aerial vehicle operation zone. Meanwhile, although a personal aerial vehicle may freely move in a take-off and landing field, an entry section, an exit section and an aerial vehicle operation zone, as personal aerial vehicles move at relatively high speed, an accident is very likely to happen in the take-off and landing field, the entry section and the exit section. Accordingly, it is necessary to set control right for movement or operation by distinguishing a local control server, a central control server, a personal aerial vehicle and the like according to a location or situation of the personal aerial vehicle.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, an aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a local control server, a central control server, and a personal aerial vehicle, and the local control server, the central control server and the personal aerial vehicle may exchange information necessary for control via communication. Also, a personal aerial vehicle may control movement or operation based on information received from a local control server and a central control server.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">A personal aerial vehicle and a local control server may be connected with each other based on a vehicle to everything (V2X) communication scheme, and the personal aerial vehicle and a central control server may be connected with each other based on a vehicle to everything (V2X) communication scheme. As an example, it is desirable that a personal aerial vehicle and a local control server are connected to each other through a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) scheme and the personal aerial vehicle and a central control server are connected to each other through a V2I scheme. A personal aerial vehicle and a local control server may be connected with each other via aeronautical telecommunication network (AFTN), and the personal aerial vehicle and a central control server may be connected with each other via AFTN. As yet another example, a personal aerial vehicle and a local control server may be connected with each other via a base station-based communication network, and the personal aerial vehicle and a central control server may be connected with each other via a base station-based communication network. As an example, a base station-based communication network may include a cellular communication network, a communication network based on 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), a communication network based on long term evolution (LTE) and a communication network based on fifth generation (5G) technology standard. Although, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, a communication network based on 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), a communication network based on long term evolution (LTE) and a communication network based on fifth generation (5G) technology standard are described as examples of base station-based communications, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and various types of cellular communication networks may be used.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Furthermore, an aerial vehicle control system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may configure different communication networks connecting a local control server or a central control server according to a location of a personal aerial vehicle. As an example, in case a personal aerial vehicle exists within a take-off and landing facility or exists in an entry section or an exit section, the personal aerial vehicle may be connected with a local control server based on an X2V scheme. In addition, in case the personal aerial vehicle exists in an aerial vehicle operation zone, the personal aerial vehicle may be connected with the central control server (or local control server) via AFTN or cellular communication network.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In addition, a personal aerial vehicle may be connected with another personal aerial vehicle through a V2X scheme. Thus, a personal aerial vehicle may be connected with another neighboring personal aerial vehicle through a V2X scheme, and a distance between neighboring personal aerial vehicles may be measured so that a collision between personal aerial vehicles may be prevented.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Basically, a central control server may set an operation condition in an aerial vehicle control system such as an entry section, an exit section, an aerial vehicle operation zone and the like and set and provide a control parameter matching the operation condition to a local control server or a personal aerial vehicle. Herein, the operation condition may include a speed, an interval, a set altitude of an aerial vehicle operation zone and the like.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Furthermore, a central control server may check and store a weather condition necessary to set an operation condition. To this end, the central control server may be connected with a device (or server) capable of providing weather information via a communication network and receive and store weather information periodically. As another example, the central control server may receive and store weather information from a device (or server) capable of providing weather information whenever a preset condition (e.g., lighting, gale, storm, heavy rainfall) is satisfied.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Also, a central control server may manage operation information of a personal aerial vehicle operated within an aerial vehicle control system and identify and manage a degree of congestion of each section of an aerial vehicle operation zone based on the operation information.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Also, a central control server may identify and manage event information (e.g., accident, obstacle, emergency situation) occurring within an aerial vehicle operation zone.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Also, a central control server may perform network linkage between local control servers, management of situations in a take-off and landing facility connected to a local control server, and the like.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Meanwhile, a local control server may manage control right of a personal aerial vehicle in an entry section, an exit section and an aerial vehicle operation zone. As an example, a local control server may set control right of a personal aerial vehicle to a local control server or to a personal aerial vehicle. To this end, a local control server may receive information required to set control right of a personal aerial vehicle from the personal aerial vehicle and set and manage the control right for the personal aerial vehicle based on the received information.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Also, a local control server may identify and manage a condition of a stop, a condition of a take-off and landing field and the like. For example, the condition of a stop may include an occupancy state of a spot included in the stop, an identifier of a moving object or a personal aerial vehicle present at the occupied spot and the like. Likewise, the condition of a take-off and landing field may include an occupancy state of a spot included in the take-off and landing field, an identifier of a personal aerial vehicle present at the occupied spot and the like. Furthermore, a local control server may identify and manage a degree of congestion in a take-off and landing facility based on a condition of a stop, a condition of a take-off and landing field and the like.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Furthermore, a local control server may check and store the above-described weather condition. As an example, a local control server may receive and store weather information from a central control server. As another example, a local control server may be connected with a device (or server) capable of providing weather information via a communication network and receive and store weather information periodically. Also, a local control server may store and manage operation conditions like an entry section, an exit section and an aerial vehicle operation zone. An operation condition may be received from a central control server and be managed.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Also, a local control server may identify and manage event information (e.g., accident, obstacle, emergency situation) occurring within an aerial vehicle operation zone. Event information may be received from a central control server or be generated based on a degree of congestion of a take-off and landing facility, weather information and the like.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Meanwhile, like a conventional personal aerial vehicle, a personal aerial vehicle may be controlled to move in a predetermined airspace, and the movement may be controlled through a user's operation control or autonomous driving control. Particularly, the movement or operation of a personal aerial vehicle may be controlled in a take-off and landing field, an entry section, an exit section, and an aerial vehicle operation zone, and the movement or operation may be controlled based on information received from a local control server or a central control server. Furthermore, control right of a personal aerial vehicle may be determined according to a zone that is set in an aerial vehicle control system, and movement or operation may be controlled in response to the determined control right.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate a structure of a take-off and landing facility in a multimodal transportation system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">First, as described above, a take-off and landing facility in a multimodal transportation system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a stop and a take-off and landing pad, and the stop in particular may include a zone, in which a freight transfer air vehicle may stop (hereinafter, referred to as &#x2018;freight transfer air vehicle stop zone&#x2019;), and a zone in which a freight transfer moving object may stop (hereinafter, referred to as &#x2018;freight transfer moving object zone&#x2019;). Also, the stop may further include a freight standby zone in which freight may be temporarily loaded and stored. As an example, a freight transfer air vehicle stop zone and a freight transfer moving object stop zone may be provided on a same plane. As another example, a take-off and landing facility may consist of a plurality of floors, and a freight transfer air vehicle stop zone, a freight transfer moving object stop zone, or a freight standby zone may be provided on different floors.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Furthermore, a stop may include a zone, in which a general air vehicle may stop (hereinafter, referred to as &#x2018;general air vehicle stop zone&#x2019;), and a zone in which a general moving object may stop (hereinafter, referred to as &#x2018;general moving object stop zone&#x2019;).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">A general air vehicle stop zone and a general moving object stop zone may be in an area different from an area for a freight transfer air vehicle stop zone and a freight transfer moving object stop zone. As an example, a general air vehicle stop zone and a freight transfer air vehicle stop zone may be on a same plane, and a general moving object stop zone and a freight transfer moving object stop zone may be on different planes. For example, a general air vehicle stop zone and a freight transfer air vehicle stop zone may be in an area with open overhead space (e.g. rooftop of a building or open space on the ground), and a general moving object stop zone and a freight transfer moving object stop zone may be in a space under the general air vehicle stop zone and the freight transfer air vehicle stop zone (e.g., in a building or in an underground space). Another example, a freight transfer air vehicle stop zone and a freight transfer moving object stop zone may be in an area with open overhead space (e.g. rooftop of a building or open space on the ground), and a general air vehicle stop zone and a general moving object stop zone may be in a space under the freight transfer air vehicle stop zone and the freight transfer moving object stop zone (e.g. in a building or in an underground space).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Although, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, a freight transfer air vehicle stop zone, a freight transfer moving object stop zone, a general air vehicle stop zone, a general moving object stop zone and a freight standby zone are exemplified with respect to their structures, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and the structures may be modified and applied in various ways by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Meanwhile, a take-off and landing facility may include an apparatus that is capable of transferring freight among a freight transfer air vehicle stop zone, a freight transfer moving object stop zone, or a freight standby zone. Herein, the apparatus capable of transferring freight may include a conveyor belt, a cargo-carrying robot and the like. Furthermore, an apparatus capable of transferring freight may be connected with a local transportation management server (or central transportation management server) via a communication network and transfer freight, based on information provided from the local transportation management server (or central transportation management server), between freight transfer air vehicles, between freight transfer moving objects, or between a freight transfer air vehicle and a freight transfer moving object. As an example, as a freight transfer air vehicle stops in a freight transfer air vehicle zone, the freight transfer air vehicle may request movement of freight, which is loaded in the air vehicle, to a local transportation management server, and the local transportation management server may check, through a central transportation management server, information on the freight (hereinafter, referred to as &#x2018;freight information&#x2019;), for which the movement is requested, and a zone to which the freight may be moved. Accordingly, the apparatus capable of transferring freight may transfer freight to a corresponding zone. Herein, the corresponding zone may include a zone, in which a freight transfer air vehicle stops, a zone, in which a freight transfer moving object stops, and the like. As another example, the corresponding zone may include a freight standby zone.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an operation of processing transfer of freight in a multimodal transportation system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a multimodal transportation system may process overall transportation of freight through a local transportation management server, which is connected with a take-off and landing facility, and a central transportation management server. The central transportation management server may manage information on freight (freight information), which is to be transferred in the multimodal transportation system, and provide the freight information to a user through a user device, a moving object or an air vehicle. Accordingly, the user may select freight to be transferred through a user device, a moving object or an air vehicle. As an example, a situation is illustrated in which freight is transferred from a departure point of a first area to a destination of a second area. The central transportation management server may provide freight information to a user device (e.g. moving object, portable terminal), and a user may select freight to be moved, using the user device (e.g. moving object, portable terminal). Herein, the central transportation management server may provide information on destination and waypoint of freight, and the user may confirm the destination or the waypoint and select freight that matches a destination or waypoint to which the user wants to move. As another example, the central transportation management server may be configured to compare the destination and waypoint of freight and the destination and waypoint of a user and to provide a list of coincident freight.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Next, the user may load freight on a moving object and move to a first take-off and landing facility.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">A first local transportation management server, which corresponds to the first take-off and landing facility, may identify entry of the moving object loaded with freight and execute an operation for moving the freight to an air vehicle. As an example, the first local transportation management server may allocate and provide a zone (freight transfer moving object stop zone), to which the moving object loaded with freight is moved, and execute the operation for moving the freight to an air vehicle. Thus, the freight may be loaded in the air vehicle and be moved from the first take-off and landing facility to a second take-off and landing facility. Herein, the central transportation management server may manage and provide information on the air vehicle loaded with freight, location information of the air vehicle, an arrival time of the air vehicle at the second take-off and landing facility and the like. Also, the central transportation management server may execute an operation of a moving object for freight from the second take-off and landing facility to a destination of the second area. As described above, information on an air vehicle loaded with freight, location information of the air vehicle and an arrival time of the air vehicle at the second take-off and landing facility and information on a destination of freight may be provided to a user device (e.g. moving object, portable terminal), and a user may select freight to be moved, using the user device (e.g. moving object, portable terminal). In addition, as the air vehicle loaded with freight arrives at the second take-off and landing facility, the second local transportation management server may provide the central transportation management server with information that the freight has arrived at the take-off and landing facility, and the central transportation management server may provide the information to the user who selects the movement of the freight. Accordingly, the user may load the freight in the take-off and landing facility and move to a destination.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view illustrating an operation of allocating freight in a multimodal transportation system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a central transportation management server provided in a multimodal transportation system may be connected with a freight handling server. The freight handling server may register and manage information (freight information) that is basically necessary to transport freight from a departure point to a destination. Herein, the freight information may include an identifier of freight, a departure point, a destination, information on a sender, information on a receiver, a type of freight, a size of freight and the like. Although, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, a freight handling server is exemplified to register and manage freight information, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto and various modifications are possible by considering an operation of the conventional server apparatus for handling freight.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">A freight handling server may provide freight information, which is registered and managed, to a central transportation management server. The central transportation management server may store and manage freight information. In particular, the central transportation management server may provide an environment in which freight may be transferred through a freight transfer PAV and a freight transfer moving object, which are operated in a multimodal transportation system.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">As an example, the central transportation management server may provide freight information to a user device (e.g. air vehicle, moving object, portable terminal). In addition, the user device may display the received freight information and provide an environment capable of selecting predetermined freight that may be transferred through an air vehicle or a moving object. Also, the user device may be configured to transmit a message (hereinafter, referred to as &#x2018;freight transfer request message&#x2019;) requesting transfer of freight, which is selected by a user, to the central transportation management server. For example, the freight transfer request message may include an identifier of selected freight, an identifier of an entity (air vehicle, moving object, etc.), which will transfer, a type of an entity (air vehicle, moving object, etc.), which will transfer, information on a transfer departure point, information on a transfer destination, a transfer departure time, a transfer arrival time and the like. Herein, the information on a transfer departure point and the information on a transfer destination may include information that indicates a take-off and landing facility used as a logistics hub. As another example, since the information on a transfer departure point and the information on a transfer destination may be designated not as a take-off and landing facility but as an initial delivery point of freight, a final destination of freight and the like, the information on a transfer departure point and the information on a transfer destination may include address information of the departure point and address information of the destination.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The central transportation management server may allocate transfer of freight, which is selected by a user, by using information contained in a freight transfer request message. For example, the central transportation management server may identify freight selected by the user and determine an entity (air vehicle, moving object, etc.), which will transfer the freight, and a departure point and a destination of the freight transfer.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In addition, based on information thus determined, the central transportation management server may configure freight transfer approval information. As an example, the transfer approval information may include an identifier of freight, an identifier of an entity (air vehicle, moving object, etc.), which will transfer, a type of an entity (air vehicle, moving object, etc.), which will transfer, information on a transfer departure point, information on a transfer destination, a transfer departure time, a transfer arrival time, and a result of freight transfer approval.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The central transportation management server may provide the freight transfer approval information to a user device (e.g. air vehicle, moving object, portable terminal). In response to this, the user device (e.g. air vehicle, moving object, portable terminal) may store and manage the freight transfer approval information and be allocated a freight transfer air vehicle stop zone by using the freight transfer approval information while entering a take-off and landing facility.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Also, the central transportation management server may provide the freight transfer approval information to a freight handling server, and the freight handling server may store and manage the freight transfer approval information.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Although a central transportation management server has been described to provide freight transfer approval information to a user device, the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and various modifications are applicable as long as freight transfer approval information may be managed. As an example, the central transportation management server may configure a freight transfer response message, which includes an identifier of a freight transfer request message and a result of freight transfer approval, and provide the freight transfer response message to a user device (e.g. air vehicle, moving object, portable terminal). In response to this, the user device may confirm, based on an identifier of the freight transfer request message, an identifier of freight, an identifier of an entity (air vehicle, moving object, etc.), which will transfer, a type of an entity (air vehicle, moving object, etc.), which will transfer, information on a transfer departure point, information on a transfer destination, a transfer departure time and a transfer arrival time and configure and store freight transfer approval information.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A to <b>7</b>B</figref> are a view illustrating an operation of processing freight transfer in a multimodal transportation system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrate an operation of processing freight transfer of a freight transfer air vehicle in a multimodal transportation system.
