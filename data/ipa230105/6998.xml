More precisely, the invention relates to the integration of new user equipment into the operator's information system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A remote management service of user equipment by an operator's information system by means of a communication network is carried out in a secure and trusted environment in order to guarantee the security, confidentiality and integrity of the data passing through the communication network and data stored in equipment belonging to this same communication network. An information system includes all of the user equipment management servers. These user equipment management servers interact with the user equipment through a management solution set up by the operator.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, the integration of a new user equipment into an information system is performed by means of communication protocols ensuring the authentication of the user equipment to be integrated and guaranteeing the integrity and the confidentiality of messages exchanged between the user equipment to be integrated and a user equipment management server located in the communication network.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This solution is based on the fact that the items of user equipment to be integrated are provided, at the time of their manufacture, with an authentication certificate supplied to the manufacturer by the operator managing the information system in which the user equipment is to be integrated. Thus, during the integration process, the user equipment transmits its certificate to a user equipment management server that forms part of the information system of the operator. In the absence of such a certificate, the integration method of the user equipment with the information system is stopped.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first disadvantage of such a solution is that it requires cumbersome and inflexible logistics in order to be implemented. Indeed, the operator managing the information system in which the user equipment is to be integrated has to provide the certificates to the various manufacturers of user equipment through a secure channel.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another disadvantage of such a solution is the fact that the same operator managing the information system in which user equipment is to be integrated cannot provide certificates to large number of manufacturers of connected objects, thus limiting the choice of its users with regard to the connected objects they might wish to integrate, whereas the development of these connected objects offers an increasingly varied choice in terms of the functions implemented by these connected objects or in terms of design.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is therefore a need to provide a technique for authenticating and integrating new user equipment into an information system that does not have all or some of these disadvantages.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention addresses this need by proposing a method for integrating at least one item of user equipment of a local area network intended to be integrated into an information system, said method being implemented by a server interfacing the local area network and the information system and comprising the following steps:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">transmitting to the user equipment instructions relating to at least one test to be performed by said user equipment relating to at least one item of authenticated user equipment belonging to the local area network, said instructions being determined as a function of functions that can be executed by said user equipment and by said authenticated user equipment,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">when the results of the test are conclusive, transmitting to the user equipment connection parameters to at least one authenticated user equipment management server of the information system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Such a solution relies on an ecosystem of user equipment already authenticated with the operator's information system and present in the local area network in order to authenticate the user equipment to be integrated into the information system and thus authorise its integration into the information system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to ensure the security of the operator's information system, as long as the user equipment has not been authenticated, the latter is only authorised to communicate with a server interfacing the local area network and the information system. Thus, this intermediate server controls all of the message exchanges with the user equipment to be integrated. It allows the isolation of the user equipment to be integrated from the rest of the information system in charge of the integrated equipment which is involved in the authentication of the user equipment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The user equipment to be integrated transmits information relating to at least one function that it can perform to the intermediate server. For example, when the user equipment is a connected lamp, the latter can turn on, turn off, change the colour of the light emitted, etc. All of this information is transmitted to the intermediate server which retransmits it to a test server.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Based on information relating to the user equipment transmitted by the intermediate server to the test server and information relating to other user equipment of the local area network that has already been authenticated and integrated into the information system, the test server transmits instructions relating to a test to be performed by the user equipment to be integrated. In the example selected, when the user equipment is a connected lamp and a connected light sensor has already been authenticated and integrated into the information system, the test server can for example transmit instructions to the user equipment to be integrated to switch on and emit a green light for a given period of time. At the same time, the connected light sensor detects the light emission produced by the test server.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The results of the test are sent back to the test server which determines whether or not they are conclusive. If the results are conclusive, i.e. if the light sensor has detected a sequence of light emissions in accordance with the test server's instruction, then the user equipment is authenticated. It is then authorised to connect to an authenticated user equipment management server located in the operator's information system and is therefore integrated into the information system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a first feature of the integration method, information relating to at least one function that can be executed by said user equipment is received in response to a request transmitted to said user equipment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This makes it possible to discover the features and capabilities of the user equipment to be integrated into the information system in order to deduce the tests to be performed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a second feature of the integration method, the transmission of the request is triggered by receiving at least one piece of information about the presence of the user equipment in the local area network.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, if it is determined that the user equipment is not actually located in the local area network, the integration method is stopped.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The invention also relates to a method for authenticating at least one item of user equipment of a local area network to be integrated into an information system, said method being implemented by a test server of the information system and comprising the following steps:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">receiving information about at least one function that can be executed by said user equipment,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">determining instructions relating to at least one test to be performed by said user equipment in relation to at least one item of authenticated user equipment belonging to said local area network as a function of functions that can be performed by said user equipment and by said authenticated user equipment,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">transmitting to the user equipment instructions relating to said at least one test to be performed,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">transmitting, via an authenticated user equipment management server of the information system, instructions relating to said at least one test to be performed to at least one authenticated item of user equipment,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">authenticating said user equipment based on test results received from said user equipment and from said at least one item of authenticated user equipment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Such an authentication method uses already authenticated user equipment located in the local area network in order to authenticate the user equipment to be integrated in a safe and secure manner.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an alternative embodiment of the integration method, the latter comprises a step of determining at least one trust parameter associated with at least one test result.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This may make it possible to limit the access of the user equipment to certain services provided via the information system.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one variation of this alternative implementation of the authentication method, the trust parameter depends on the authenticated user equipment in relation to which the test is performed.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Indeed, according to whether the already authenticated user equipment has been authenticated in accordance with the present authentication method or because it was provided with a certificate at the time of manufacture, the trust parameter associated with at least one result of a test performed is not the same. A value of the trust parameter associated with the result of a test performed in relation to a user equipment with a factory certificate reflects a higher level of trust than a value of the trust parameter associated with the result of a test performed in relation to user equipment authenticated according to the present authentication method.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The subject-matter of the invention is also a server interfacing a local area network and an information system, the server comprising means for:</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">transmitting to at least one item of user equipment, instructions relating to at least one test to be performed by said user equipment in relation to at least one item of authenticated user equipment belonging to the local area network, said instructions being determined as a function of functions that can be executed by said user equipment and by said authenticated user equipment,</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">when the results of the test are conclusive, transmitting to the user equipment connection parameters to at least one authenticated user equipment management server of the information system.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The invention also relates to a test server capable of authenticating at least one item of user equipment of a local area network to be integrated into an information system, said test server comprising means for:</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">receiving information relating to at least one function that can be performed by said user equipment,</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">determining instructions relating to at least one test to be performed by said user equipment in relation to at least one authenticated user equipment belonging to said local area network as a function of functions that can be performed by said user equipment and by said authenticated user equipment,</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">transmitting to the user equipment instructions relating to said at least one test to be performed,</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">transmitting, via an authenticated user equipment management server of the information system, instructions relating to said at least one test to be performed to at least one item of authenticated user equipment,</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">authenticating said user equipment based on test results received from said user equipment and said at least one item of authenticated user equipment.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The invention also relates to a computer-readable storage medium on which computer programs are stored comprising program code instructions for performing the steps of the methods according to the invention as described above.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Such a recording medium can be any entity or device capable of storing the programs. For example, the medium can comprise a storage means, such as a ROM, for example a CD ROM or a microelectronic circuit ROM, or a magnetic storage medium, for example a USB stick or a hard drive.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">On the other hand, such a recording medium can be a transmissible medium such as an electric or optical signal, which can be conveyed via an electric or optical cable, by radio or by other means, so that the computer programs contained therein can be executed remotely. The programs according to the invention can in particular be downloaded onto a network, for example the internet.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Alternatively, the recording medium can be an integrated circuit in which the programs are incorporated, the circuit being adapted to execute or to be used for executing the aforementioned methods which are subject-matters of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Other purposes, features and advantages of the proposed methods are explained in more detail in the following description, given simply by way of an illustrative and non-limiting example, with reference to the figures in which:</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows schematically a system in which the proposed methods are implemented,</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the steps of integration and authentication methods implemented according to a particular embodiment,</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the intermediate server according to a particular embodiment,</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the test server according to a particular embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows schematically a system <b>1</b> in which the integration and authentication methods are implemented.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The system <b>1</b> consists of at least one LAN (Local Area Network) and an operator's information system IS located in a WAN (Wide Area Network).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The local area network LAN comprises a gateway GW allowing user equipment present in the local area network LAN to exchange data with remote equipment located in the communication network. A plurality of items of user equipment <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are located in the local area network LAN. The items of user equipment <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> have already been authenticated and are integrated into the information system IS. The user equipment <b>11</b> has been authenticated by using the proposed methods while the user equipment <b>12</b> has a factory certificate. The user equipment <b>10</b> does not have a factory certificate and a local area network LAN user wants to integrate it into the information system IS, to allow remote management.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The user equipment <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> can be for example connected objects such as sensors, lamps, switches or even cell phones, tablets, TV decoders or set-top-boxes, connected speakers, connected household appliances, etc.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A server <b>13</b>, referred to as an intermediate server, interfaces the local area network LAN with the WAN communication network.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The information system IS of the operator includes among other things a test server <b>14</b> and at least one management server <b>15</b> for authenticated user equipment <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>. The exchanges between the management server <b>15</b> and an authenticated item of user equipment are based on a protocol that describes the methods implemented by the management server as well as the user equipment, a software component implemented on the equipment, which both conform to the specifications related to the protocol. An example of such a protocol is CWMP&#x2014;CPE WAN Management Protocol&#x2014;defined in the technical report TR-069 specified by the Broadband Forum. Furthermore, the functionalities of the user equipment can be discovered through this protocol, for example through the data model defined in the technical report TR-181 for CWMP specified by the Broadband Forum. The management server <b>15</b> performs a set of user equipment administration and maintenance functions, such as firmware updates or reconfigurations.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the intermediate server <b>13</b> and the test server <b>14</b> are functional components embedded in the same equipment of the information system IS.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the steps of the integration and authentication methods in particular embodiments in order to authenticate an item of user equipment <b>10</b> and then to integrate it into the operator's information system IS.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one step E<b>1</b>, the user equipment <b>10</b> transmits a message MSG1 to the gateway GW in order to initiate an integration method in the information system IS. Such a message MSG1 is for example a DHCP message (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) of the DHCP discovery type.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In step E<b>2</b>, the gateway GW determines that the user equipment <b>10</b> is not authenticated and transmits a message MSG2 to the user equipment including connection information to a boot server (not shown in the figures) located in the WAN communication network.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus, the message MSG2 is for example a message of the DHCPOffer type with a specific option. For example, this option can be DHCPv6 Vendor Class Option 16 (if the user equipment supports IPv6), DHCP Vendor Class Identifier Option 60, or DHCP V-I Vendor Class Option 124.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a particular embodiment, the user equipment <b>10</b> is configured to store connection information to a boot server using a local interface (as defined in technical report TR-064 for the CWMP protocol, specified by the Broadband Forum).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In step E<b>3</b>, the user equipment <b>10</b> transmits in a new message MSG1&#x2032;, intended for the boot server, a request to initiate integration into the information system IS.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step E<b>4</b>, the boot server transmits a message MSG3 to the user equipment <b>10</b> comprising connection information to the intermediate server <b>13</b>, connection information to a first control module CM<b>1</b> (not shown in the figures) located in the local area network LAN and connection information to a second control module CM<b>2</b> (not shown in the figures) located in the WAN communication network.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a particular embodiment, the message MSG3 does not include connection information. In this case, the intermediate server <b>13</b> and the management server <b>15</b> share the same IP address and the redirection is performed by a component in the information system IS. This component verifies whether the user equipment <b>10</b> is authenticated to redirect the communication to the management server <b>15</b> and if not to the intermediate server <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">During step E<b>5</b>, the user equipment <b>10</b> transmits a first connection request to the first control module CM<b>1</b>. At the same time, the user equipment <b>10</b> transmits a second connection request to the second control module CM<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In step E<b>6</b>, the first control module CM<b>1</b> and the second control module CM<b>2</b> determine whether the user equipment <b>10</b> is actually located in the local area network LAN. Such a determination consists for example of verifying that the user equipment <b>10</b> is connected to a Wi-Fi access point embedded in the gateway GW.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">If it is determined, by at least of one of the first CM<b>1</b> or second CM<b>2</b> control module, that the user equipment <b>10</b> is not located in the local area network LAN, the integration is stopped because the user equipment <b>10</b> can potentially compromise the security of the local area network LAN and the information system IS. In such a case, the LAN user is informed of the situation.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">If it is determined by the first or the second control module, that the user equipment <b>10</b> is located in the local area network LAN, the intermediate server <b>13</b> is informed of this in step E<b>7</b>, for example by receiving at least one piece of information about the presence of the user equipment <b>10</b> in the local area network LAN.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step E<b>8</b>, the intermediate server <b>13</b> transmits to the user equipment <b>10</b> a request RQ<b>1</b> transmitting information relating to at least one function that can be performed by the user equipment <b>10</b>. For example, when the user equipment <b>10</b> is a connected lamp, the latter can turn on, turn off, change the colour of the emitted light, etc. Thus, the functions that can be executed by the user equipment <b>10</b> are: emitting light, turning off the light, changing the colour of the light. In another example, when the user equipment <b>10</b> is a connected speaker, the latter can play music, turn off, change the volume of the sound, etc. Thus, the functions that can be performed by the user equipment <b>10</b> are: emitting sound, turning off the sound, changing the volume of the sound, etc. In step E<b>9</b>, the user equipment <b>10</b> transmits a message MSG4 to the intermediate server <b>13</b> comprising a list of functions that it can execute.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step E<b>10</b>, the intermediate server <b>13</b> transmits to the test server <b>14</b> the list of functions that the user equipment <b>10</b> can execute.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In step E<b>11</b>, the test server <b>14</b> determines instructions relating to at least one test to be performed by the user equipment <b>10</b> in relation to at least one authenticated user equipment <b>11</b> or <b>12</b> as a function of functions which can be performed by the three pieces of user equipment <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Knowing an identifier of the local area network LAN in which the user equipment <b>10</b> is located, the test server <b>14</b> identifies items of authenticated user equipment <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> present in the local area network LAN. Based on the functions that can be performed by the user equipment <b>10</b> and functions which can be executed by authenticated user equipment <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, which are stored in a memory of the test server <b>14</b>, the test server <b>14</b> selects at least one authenticated user equipment <b>11</b> or <b>12</b> with which the user equipment <b>10</b> performs the test. A test is always carried out by a pair of items of user equipment of which a first member is user equipment <b>10</b> and the second member is an authenticated user equipment.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In step E<b>12</b>, the test server <b>14</b> transmits, via the intermediate server <b>13</b>, a message MSG5 to the user equipment <b>10</b> comprising the instructions relating to the test to be performed.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In step E<b>13</b>, the test server <b>14</b> transmits, via the management server <b>15</b>, a message MSG6 to the authenticated user equipment <b>11</b> comprising the instructions relating to the test to be performed.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the chosen example, when the user equipment <b>10</b> is a connected light and the authenticated user equipment <b>11</b> is a light sensor, the test server <b>14</b> can for example transmit instructions to the user equipment <b>10</b> to switch on and emit a green light for a given period of time. At the same time, the authenticated user equipment <b>11</b> receives instructions to detect the emission of a green light for a given period of time.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In step E<b>14</b>, the test server <b>14</b> receives, via the intermediate server <b>13</b>, the results of the test performed by the user equipment <b>10</b>. These results can consist of a message indicating that the user equipment <b>10</b> has executed the received instructions.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In step E<b>15</b>, the test server <b>14</b> receives, via the management server <b>15</b>, the results of the test performed by the authenticated user equipment <b>11</b>. These results are for example a message comprising information describing the phenomena captured by the authenticated user equipment <b>11</b> during the test, in the example selected the given period.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment of the invention, the test server <b>14</b> associates a trust parameter with the result of the test performed according to the authenticated user equipment <b>11</b> or <b>12</b> in relation to which the test was performed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Indeed, depending on whether the already authenticated user equipment has been authenticated according to the present authentication method for the user equipment <b>11</b>, or because it was provided with a certificate at the time of its manufacture, for the user equipment <b>12</b>, the trust parameter associated with the result of the test carried out is not the same. A value of the trust parameter associated with the result of the test performed in relation to the user equipment <b>12</b> with a factory certificate reflects a higher level of trust than a value of the trust parameter associated with the result of the test carried out in relation to the user equipment <b>11</b> authenticated according to the present authentication method.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In step E<b>16</b>, the test server <b>14</b> authenticates the user equipment <b>10</b> based on the received test results. Thus, when the results of the user equipment <b>10</b> indicate that it has executed the instructions received and the results of the user equipment <b>11</b> indicate that the phenomena captured by the authenticated user equipment <b>11</b> correspond to the instructions that were transmitted, the test server <b>14</b> authenticates the user equipment <b>10</b>. Otherwise, the user equipment <b>10</b> is not authenticated and the local area network LAN user is informed. In step E<b>17</b>, the test server <b>14</b> transmits to the user equipment <b>10</b> and via the intermediate server <b>13</b> a message MSG7 comprising connection parameters to the management server <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">On receiving the message MSG7, the user equipment <b>10</b> transmits a connection request to the management server <b>15</b> based on the connection parameters included in the message MSG7, in step E<b>18</b>.
