More specifically, embodiments of the invention described herein pertain to conjugates of biologically active agents conjugated to PSMA binding ligands.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The prostate is one of the male reproductive organs found in the pelvis below the urinary bladder. It functions to produce and store seminal fluid which provides nutrients and fluids that are vital for the survival of sperm introduced into the vagina during reproduction. Like many other tissues, the prostate glands are also prone to develop either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) tumors. The American Cancer Society predicted that over 230,000 men would be diagnosed with prostrate cancer and over 30,000 men would die from the disease in year 2005. In fact, prostate cancer is one of the most common male cancers in western societies, and is the second leading form of malignancy among American men. Current treatment methods for prostrate cancer include hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and combination therapy. The selection of a treatment generally varies depending on the stage of the cancer. However, many of these treatments affect the quality of life of the patient, especially those men who are diagnosed with prostrate cancer over age 50. For example, the use of hormonal drugs is often accompanied by side effects such as osteoporosis and liver damage. Such side effects might be mitigated by the use of treatments that are more selective or specific to the tissue being responsible for the disease state, and avoid non-target tissues like the bones or the liver. As described herein, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) represents a target for such selective or specific treatments.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">PSMA is named largely due to its higher level of expression on prostate cancer cells; however, its particular function on prostate cancer cells remains unresolved. PSMA is over-expressed in the malignant prostate tissues when compared to other organs in the human body such as kidney, proximal small intestine, and salivary glands. Though PSMA is expressed in brain, that expression is minimal, and most ligands of PSMA are polar and are not capable of penetrating the blood brain barrier. PSMA is a type II cell surface membrane-bound glycoprotein with &#x2dc;110 kD molecular weight, including an intracellular segment (amino acids 1-18), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 19-43), and an extensive extracellular domain (amino acids 44-750). While the functions of the intracellular segment and the transmembrane domains are currently believed to be insignificant, the extracellular domain is involved in several distinct activities. PSMA plays a role in central nervous system, where it metabolizes N-acetyl-aspartyl glutamate (NAAG) into glutamic and N-acetyl aspartic acid. Accordingly, it is also sometimes referred to as an N-acetyl alpha linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase). PSMA is also sometimes referred to as a folate hydrolase I (FOLH I) or glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCP II) due to its role in the proximal small intestine where it removes &#x3b3;-linked glutamate from poly-&#x3b3;-glutamated folate and &#x3b1;-linked glutamate from peptides and small molecules.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PSMA also shares similarities with human transferrin receptor (TfR), because both PSMA and TfR are type II glycoproteins. More specifically, PSMA shows 54% and 60% homology to TfR1 and TfR2, respectively. However, though TfR exists only in dimeric form due to the formation of inter-strand sulfhydryl linkages, PSMA can exist in either dimeric or monomeric form.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Unlike many other membrane-bound proteins, PSMA undergoes rapid internalization into the cell in a similar fashion to cell surface bound receptors like vitamin receptors. PSMA is internalized through clathrin-coated pits and subsequently can either recycle to the cell surface or go to lysosomes. It has been suggested that the dimer and monomer form of PSMA are inter-convertible, though direct evidence of the interconversion is being debated. Even so, only the dimer of PSMA possesses enzymatic activity, and the monomer does not.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Though the activity of the PSMA on the cell surface of the prostate cells remains under investigation, it has been recognized by the inventors herein that PSMA represents a viable target for the selective and/or specific delivery of biologically active agents, including diagnostic agents, imaging agents, and therapeutic agents to such prostate cells.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has been discovered that biologically active compounds that are conjugated to ligands capable of binding to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) via a linker may be useful in the imaging, diagnosis, and/or treatment of prostate cancer, and related diseases that involve pathogenic cell populations expressing or over-expressing PSMA. PSMA is a cell surface protein that is internalized in a process analogous to endocytosis observed with cell surface receptors, such as vitamin receptors. Accordingly, it has been discovered that certain conjugates that include a linker having a predetermined length, and/or a predetermined diameter, and/or preselected functional groups along its length may be used to treat, image, and/or diagnose such diseases.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one illustrative embodiment of the invention, conjugates having the formula</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>B-L-D<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0012" num="0000">are described wherein B is a prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) binding or targeting ligand, L is a linker, and D is a drug. As used herein, the term drug D collectively includes therapeutic agents, cytotoxic agents, imaging agents, diagnostic agents, and the like, unless otherwise indicated or by the context. For example, in one illustrative configuration, the conjugate described herein is used to eliminate a pathogenic population of cells and therefore the drug D is a therapeutic agent, a cytotoxic agent, and the like. In another illustrative configuration, the conjugate described herein is used to image and/or diagnose a disease or disease state, and therefore the drug D is an imaging agent, a diagnostic agent, and the like. Other configurations are also contemplated and described herein. It is to be understood that analogs and derivatives of each of the foregoing B, L, and D are also contemplated and described herein, and that when used herein, the terms B, L, and D collectively refer to such analogs and derivatives.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">In one illustrative embodiment, the linker L may be a releasable or non-releasable linker. In one aspect, the linker L, is at least about 7 atoms in length. In one variation, the linker L is at least about 10 atoms in length. In one variation, the linker L is at least about 14 atoms in length. In another variation, the linker L is between about 7 and about 31, between about 7 and about 24, or between about 7 and about 20 atoms in length. In another variation, the linker L is between about 14 and about 31, between about 14 and about 24, or between about 14 and about 20 atoms in length.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">In an alternative aspect, the linker L is at least about 10 angstroms (&#x212b;) in length. In one variation, the linker L is at least about 15 &#x212b; in length. In another variation, the linker L is at least about 20 &#x212b; in length. In another variation, the linker L is in the range from about 10 &#x212b; to about 30 &#x212b; in length.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">In an alternative aspect, at least a portion of the length of the linker L is about 5 &#x212b; in diameter or less at the end connected to the binding ligand B. In one variation, at least a portion of the length of the linker L is about 4 &#x212b; or less, or about 3 &#x212b; or less in diameter at the end connected to the binding ligand B. It is appreciated that the illustrative embodiments that include a diameter requirement of about 5 &#x212b; or less, about 4 &#x212b; or less, or about 3 &#x212b; or less may include that requirement for a predetermined length of the linker, thereby defining a cylindrical-like portion of the linker. Illustratively, in another variation, the linker includes a cylindrical portion at the end connected to the binding ligand that is at least about 7 &#x212b; in length and about 5 &#x212b; or less, about 4 &#x212b; or less, or about 3 &#x212b; or less in diameter.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">In another embodiment, the linker L includes one or more hydrophilic linkers capable of interacting with one or more residues of PSMA, including amino acids that have hydrophobic side chains, such as Ser, Thr, Cys, Arg, Orn, Lys, Asp, Glu, Gln, and like residues. In another embodiment, the linker L includes one or more hydrophobic linkers capable of interacting with one or more residues of PSMA, including amino acids that have hydrophilic side chains, such as Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, Met, and like residues. It is to be understood that the foregoing embodiments and aspects may be included in the linker L either alone or in combination with each other. For example, linkers L that are at least about 7 atoms in length and about 5 &#x212b;, about 4 &#x212b; or less, or about 3 &#x212b; or less in diameter or less are contemplated and described herein, and also include one or more hydrophilic linkers capable of interacting with one or more residues of PSMA, including Val, Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, Met, and like residues are contemplated and described herein.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">In another embodiment, one end of the linker is not branched and comprises a chain of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms. In one embodiment, the linear chain of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms is at least 5 atoms in length. In one variation, the linear chain is at least 7 atoms, or at least 10 atoms in length. In another embodiment, the chain of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are not substituted. In one variation, a portion of the chain of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms is cyclized with a divalent fragment. For example, a linker (L) comprising the dipeptide Phe-Phe may include a piperazin-1,4-diyl structure by cyclizing two nitrogens with an ethylene fragment, or substituted variation thereof.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">In another embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions are described herein, where the pharmaceutical composition includes the conjugates described herein in amounts effective to treat diseases and disease states, diagnose diseases or disease states, and/or image tissues and/or cells that are associated with pathogenic populations of cells expressing or over expressing PSMA. Illustratively, the pharmaceutical compositions also include one or more carriers, diluents, and/or excipients.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">In another embodiment, methods for treating diseases and disease states, diagnosing diseases or disease states, and/or imaging tissues and/or cells that are associated with pathogenic populations of cells expressing or over expressing PSMA are described herein. Such methods include the step of administering the conjugates described herein, and/or pharmaceutical compositions containing the conjugates described herein, in amounts effective to treat diseases and disease states, diagnose diseases or disease states, and/or image tissues and/or cells that are associated with pathogenic populations of cells expressing or over expressing PSMA.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.

The linker L can comprise multiple bivalent linkers, including the bivalent linkers described herein. It is also to be understood that as used herein. TA collectively refers to therapeutic agents, and analogs and derivatives thereof, IA collectively refers to imaging agents, and analogs and derivatives thereof, and DA collectively refers to diagnostic agents, and analogs and derivatives thereof.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0056">The linker may also include one or more spacer linkers and optionally additional releasable linkers. The spacer and releasable linkers may be attached to each other in any order or combination. Similarly, the PSMA binding ligand may be attached to a spacer linker or to a releasable linker. Similarly, the drug, therapeutic agent, diagnostic agent, or imaging agent may be attached to a spacer linker or to a releasable linker. Each of these components of the conjugates may be connected through existing or additional heteroatoms on the targeting ligand, drug, therapeutic agent, diagnostic agent, imaging agent, releasable or spacer linker. Illustrative heteroatoms include nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and the formulae &#x2014;(NHR<sup>1</sup>NHR<sup>2</sup>)&#x2014;, &#x2014;SO&#x2014;, &#x2014;(SO<sub>2</sub>)&#x2014;, and &#x2014;N(R)O&#x2014;, wherein R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, and R<sup>3 </sup>are each independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, heteroalkyl, heterocyclyl, aryl, heteroaryl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl, and the like, each of which may be optionally substituted.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0057">In one illustrative embodiment, compounds are described herein that include linkers having predetermined length and diameter dimensions. In one aspect, linkers are described herein that satisfy one or more minimum length requirements, or a length requirement falling within a predetermined range. In another aspect, satisfaction of a minimum length requirement may be understood to be determined by computer modeling of the extended conformations of linkers. In another aspect, satisfaction of a minimum length requirement may be understood to be determined by having a certain number of atoms, whether or not substituted, forming a backbone chain of atoms connecting the binding ligand (B) with the drug (D). In another embodiment, the backbone chain of atoms is cyclized with another divalent fragment. In another aspect, linkers are described herein that satisfy one or more maximum or minimum diameter requirements. In another aspect, satisfaction of a maximum or minimum diameter requirement may be understood to be determined by computer modeling of various conformations of linkers modeled as the space-filling, CPK, or like configurations. In another aspect, satisfaction of a maximum or minimum diameter requirement may be understood to be apply to one or more selected portions of the linker, for example the portion of the linker proximal to the binding ligand (B), or the portion of the linker proximal to the drug (D), and the like. In another aspect, linkers are described herein that satisfy one or more chemical composition requirements, such as linkers that include one or more polar groups that may positively interact with the one or more Arg or Lys side-chain nitrogens and/or Asp or Glu side chain oxygens found in the funnel portion of PSMA. In one variation, linkers are described herein that satisfy one or more chemical composition requirements, such as linkers that include one or more non-polar groups that may positively interact with the one or more Tyr or Phe side-chain carbons found in the funnel portion of PSMA.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0058">In one embodiment, the atom-length of the linker is defined by the number of atoms separating the binding or targeting ligand B, or analog or derivative thereof, and the drug D, or analog or derivative thereof. Accordingly, in configurations where the binding ligand B, or analog or derivative thereof, is attached directly to the drug D, or analog or derivative thereof, the attachment is also termed herein as a &#x201c;0-atom&#x201d; linker. It is understood that such 0-atom linkers include the configuration wherein B and D are directly attached by removing a hydrogen atom from each attachment point on B and D, respectively. It is also understood that such 0-atom linkers include the configuration wherein B and D are attached through an overlapping heteroatom by removing a hydrogen atom from one of B or D, and a heteroatom functional group, such as OH, SH, NH<sub>2</sub>, and the like from the other of B or D. It is also understood that such 0-atom linkers include the configuration wherein B and D are attached through a double bond, which may be formed by removing two hydrogen atoms from each attachment point on B and D, respectively, or whereby B and D are attached through one or more overlapping heteroatoms by removing two hydrogen atoms, one hydrogen and one heteroatom functional group, or two heteroatom functional groups, such as OH, SH, NH<sub>2</sub>, and the like, from each of B or D. In addition, B and D may be attached through a double bond formed by removing a double bonded heteroatom functional group, such as O, S, NH, and the like, from one or both of B or D. It is also to be understood that such heteroatom functional groups include those attached to saturated carbon atoms, unsaturated carbon atoms (including carbonyl groups), and other heteroatoms. Similarly, the length of linkers that are greater than 0 atoms are defined in an analogous manner.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0059">Accordingly, in another illustrative embodiment, linkers (L) are described having a chain length of at least 7 atoms. In one variation, linkers (L) are described having a chain length of at least 14 atoms. In another variation, linkers (L) are described having a chain length in the range from about 7 atoms to about 20 atoms. In another variation, linkers (L) are described having a chain length in the range from about 14 atoms to about 24 atoms.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0060">In another embodiment, the length of the linker (L) is defined by measuring the length of an extended conformation of the linker. Such extended conformations may be measured in art-recognized computer modeling programs, such as PC Model 7 (MMX). Accordingly, in another illustrative embodiment, linkers are described having a chain length of at least 15 &#x212b;, at least 20 &#x212b;, or at least 25 &#x212b;.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0061">In another embodiment, linkers are described having at least one hydrophobic side chain group, such as an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, or like group, each of which is optionally substituted. In one aspect, the hydrophobic group is included in the linker by incorporating one or more Phe or Tyr groups, including substituted variants thereof, and analogs and derivatives thereof, in the linker chain. It is appreciated that such Phe and/or Tyr side chain groups may form positive pi-pi (&#x3c0;-&#x3c0;) interactions with Tyr and Phe residues found in the funnel of PSMA. In addition, it is appreciated that the presence of large side chain branches, such as the arylalkyl groups found on Phe and Tyr may provide a level of conformational rigidity to the linker, thus limiting the degrees of freedom, and reducing coiling and promoting extended conformations of the linker. Without being bound by theory, it is appreciated that such entropy restrictions may increase the overall binding energy of the bound conjugates described herein. In addition, it is appreciated that the rigidity increases that may be provided by sterically hindered side chains, such as Phe and Tyr described herein, may reduce or prevent coiling and interactions between the ligand and the imaging agent. For example, computational energy minimization of a representative 9-atom and 14-atom linker (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B</figref>) shows that there are no intra-molecular interactions between the ligand and the imaging agent. Moreover, the presence of side chain the two Phe side chains appears to promote a more extended conformation in syn-SK33 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>) than in the aminohexanoic acid-containing conjugate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>) It has been discovered herein that the funnel shaped tunnel leading to the catalytic site or active site of PSMA imposes length, shape, and/or chemical composition requirements on the linker portion of conjugates of PSMA binding ligands and therapeutic, diagnostic, and imaging agents that positively and negatively affect the interactions between PSMA and those conjugates. Described herein are illustrative embodiments of those conjugates that include such length, shape, and/or chemical composition requirements on the linker. Such length, shape, and/or chemical composition requirements were assessed using molecular modeling. For example, the space filling and surface model of the PSMA complex with (s)-2-(4-iodobenzensylphosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic [2-PMPA derivative] PDB ID code 2C6P were generated using PROTEIN EXPLORER. The PROTEIN EXPLORER model verified the 20 &#x212b; deep funnel, and also showed diameter features at various locations along the funnel that may be used to define linkers having favorable structural features. In addition, the model showed that close to the active site of PSMA, there are a higher number of hydrophobic residues that may provide additional binding interactions when the corresponding functional groups are included in the linker. Finally, the model showed the presence of three hydrophobic pockets that may provide additional binding interactions when the corresponding functional groups are included in the linker.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0062">In another illustrative embodiment, the following molecular models were created for a conjugate of MUPA and a tripeptide <sup>99m</sup>Tc imaging agent connected by a 9-atom linker, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, and syn-SK33 including a branched 14-atom linker, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>. The models were created using PC Model 7 (MMX) with energy minimization, and using the following bond length parameters: C&#x2014;C(sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3</sup>)=1.53 &#x212b;, C&#x2014;C(sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>2</sup>)=1.51 &#x212b;, C&#x2014;N(sp<sup>3</sup>-N)=1.47 &#x212b;, C&#x2014;N(sp<sup>2</sup>-N)=1.38 &#x212b;. Such models may be used to calculate the length of the linker connecting the binding ligand (B) and the drug (D). In addition, such models may be modified to create extended conformations, and subsequently used to calculate the length of the linker connecting the binding ligand (B) and the drug (D).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0063">The first human PSMA gene was cloned from LNCaP cells and is reported to be located in chromosome 11p11-12. In addition, there is a PSMA-like gene located at the loci 11q14.3. The crystal structure of PSMA has been reported by two different groups at different resolutions, and each shows that the active site contains two zinc atoms, confirming that PSMA is also considered a zinc metalloprotease. Davis et al, PNAS, 102:5981-86, (2005) reported the crystal structure at low resolution (3.5 &#x212b;), while Mesters et al, The EMBO Journal, 1-10 (2006) reported the crystal structure at higher resolution (2.2.2 &#x212b;), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The crystal structures show that PSMA is a homodimer that contains a protease domain, an apical domain, a helical domain and a CPG2 dimerization domain. The prutease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues and a substrate binding region including three arginine residues (also referred to as a substrate binding arginine patch). In the crystal structure, the two zinc ions in the active site are each ligated to an oxygen of phosphate, or to the phosphinate moiety of the inhibitor GPI 18431 for the co-crystal structure. In the high resolution crystal structures of the extracellular domain, PSMA was co-crystallized with both potent inhibitors, weak inhibitors, and glutamate at 2.0, 2.4, and 2.2 &#x212b;, respectively. The high resolution crystal structure shows a 20 &#x212b; deep funnel shaped tunnel leads to the catalytic site or active site of PSMA. The funnel is lined with the side chains of a number of Arg and Lys residues, Asp and Glu residues, and Tyr and Phe residues.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0064">In another embodiment, the linker (L) is a chain of atoms selected from C, N, O, S, Si, and P. The linker may have a wide variety of lengths, such as in the range from about 7 to about 100. The atoms used in forming the linker may be combined in all chemically relevant ways, such as chains of carbon atoms forming alkylene groups, chains of carbon and oxygen atoms forming polyoxyalkylene groups, chains of carbon and nitrogen atoms forming polyamines, and others. In addition, it is to be understood that the bonds connecting atoms in the chain may be either saturated or unsaturated, such that for example, alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkanes, arylenes, imides, and the like may be divalent radicals that are included in the linker. In addition, it is to be understood that the atoms forming the linker may also be cyclized upon each other to form divalent cyclic radicals in the linker. In each of the foregoing and other linkers described herein the chain forming the linker may be substituted with a wide variety of groups.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0065">In another embodiment, linkers (L) are described that include at least one releasable linker. In one variation, linkers (L) are described that include at least two releasable linkers. In another variation, linkers (L) are described that include at least one self-immolative linker. In another variation, linkers (L) are described that include at least one releasable linker that is not a disulfide. In another embodiment, linkers (L) are described that do not include a releasable linker.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0066">It is appreciated that releasable linkers may be used when the drug to be delivered is advantageously liberated from the binding ligand-linker conjugate so that the free drug will have the same or nearly the same effect at the target as it would when administered without the targeting provided by the conjugates described herein. In another embodiment, the linker L is a non-releasable linker. It is appreciated that non-releasable linkers may be used when the drug is advantageously retained by the binding ligand-linker conjugate, such as in imaging, diagnosing, uses of the conjugates described herein. It is to be understood that the choice of a releasable linker or a non-releasable linker may be made independently for each application or configuration of the conjugates, without limiting the invention described herein. It is to be further understood that the linkers L described herein comprise various atoms, chains of atoms, functional groups, and combinations of functional groups. Where appropriate in the present disclosure, the linker L may be referred to by the presence of spacer linkers, releasable linkers, and heteroatoms. However, such references are not to be construed as limiting the definition of the linkers L described herein.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0067">The linker (L) comprising spacer and/or releasable linkers (i.e., cleavable linkers) can be any biocompatible linker. The releasable or cleavable linker can be, for example, a linker susceptible to cleavage under the reducing or oxidizing conditions present in or on cells, a pH-sensitive linker that may be an acid-labile or base-labile linker, or a linker that is cleavable by biochemical or metabolic processes, such as an enzyme-labile linker. In one embodiment, the spacer and/or releasable linker comprises about 1 to about 30 atoms, or about 2 to about 20 atoms. Lower molecular weight linkers (i.e., those having an approximate molecular weight of about 30 to about 300) are also described. Precursors to such linkers may be selected to have either nucleophilic or electrophilic functional groups, or both, optionally in a protected form with a readily cleavable protecting group to facilitate their use in synthesis of the intermediate species.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0068">The term &#x201c;releasable linker&#x201d; as used herein refers to a linker that includes at least one bond that can be broken under physiological conditions (e.g., a pH-labile, acid-labile, oxidatively-labile, or enzyme-labile bond). The cleavable bond or bonds may be present in the interior of a cleavable linker and/or at one or both ends of a cleavable linker. It should be appreciated that such physiological conditions resulting in bond breaking include standard chemical hydrolysis reactions that occur, for example, at physiological pH, or as a result of compartmentalization into a cellular organelle such as an endosome having a lower pH than cytosolic pH. Illustratively, the bivalent linkers described herein may undergo cleavage under other physiological or metabolic conditions, such as by the action of a glutathione mediated mechanism. It is appreciated that the lability of the cleavable bond may be adjusted by including functional groups or fragments within the bivalent linker L that are able to assist or facilitate such bond breakage, also termed anchimeric assistance. The lability of the cleavable bond can also be adjusted by, for example, substitutional changes at or near the cleavable bond, such as including alpha branching adjacent to a cleavable disulfide bond, increasing the hydrophobicity of substituent % on silicon in a moiety having a silicon-oxygen bond that may be hydrolyzed, homologating alkoxy groups that form part of a ketal or acetal that may be hydrolyzed, and the like. In addition, it is appreciated that additional functional groups or fragments may be included within the bivalent linker L that are able to assist or facilitate additional fragmentation of the PSMA binding drug linker conjugates after bond breaking of the releasable linker.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0069">In another embodiment, the linker includes radicals that form one or more spacer linkers and/or releasable linkers that are taken together to form the linkers described herein having certain length, diameter, and/or functional group requirements.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0070">Another illustrative embodiment of the linkers described herein, include releasable linkers that cleave under the conditions described herein by a chemical mechanism involving beta elimination. In one aspect, such releasable linkers include beta-thio, beta-hydroxy, and beta-amino substituted carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof, such as esters, amides, carbonates, carbamates, and ureas. In another aspect, such releasable linkers include 2- and 4-thioarylesters, carbamates, and carbonates.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0071">It is to be understood that releasable linkers may also be referred to by the functional groups they contain, illustratively such as disulfide groups, ketal groups, and the like, as described herein. Accordingly, it is understood that a cleavable bond can connect two adjacent atoms within the releasable linker and/or connect other linkers, or the binding ligand B, or the therapeutic, diagnostic, or imaging agent D, as described herein, at either or both ends of the releasable linker. In the case where a cleavable bond connects two adjacent atoms within the releasable linker, following breakage of the bond, the releasable linker is broken into two or more fragments. Alternatively, in the case where a cleavable bond is between the releasable linker and another moiety, such as an additional heteroatom, a spacer linker, another releasable linker, the drug D, or analog or derivative thereof, or the binding ligand B, or analog or derivative thereof, following breakage of the bond, the releasable linker is separated from the other moiety.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0072">In another embodiment, the releasable and spacer linkers may be arranged in such a way that subsequent to the cleavage of a bond in the bivalent linker, released functional groups anchimerically assist the breakage or cleavage of additional bonds, as described above. An illustrative embodiment of such a bivalent linker or portion thereof includes compounds having the formula:</p><p id="p-0080" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="19.98mm" wi="67.90mm" file="US20230000836A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0081" num="0000">where X is an heteroatom, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, n is an integer selected from 0, 1, 2, and 3, R is hydrogen, or a substituent, including a substituent capable of stabilizing a positive charge inductively or by resonance on the aryl ring, such as alkoxy, and the like, and the symbol (*) indicates points of attachment for additional spacer or releasable linkers, or heteroatoms, forming the bivalent linker, or alternatively for attachment of the drug, or analog or derivative thereof, or the vitamin, or analog or derivative thereof. It is appreciated that other substituents may be present on the aryl ring, the benzyl carbon, the alkanoic acid, or the methylene bridge, including but not limited to hydroxy, alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, halo, and the like. Assisted cleavage may include mechanisms involving benzylium intermediates, benzyne intermediates, lactone cyclization, oxonium internediates, beta-elimination, and the like. It is further appreciated that, in addition to fragmentation subsequent to cleavage of the releasable linker, the initial cleavage of the releasable linker may be facilitated by an anchimerically assisted mechanism.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0073">In this embodiment, the hydroxyalkanoic acid, which may cyclize, facilitates cleavage of the methylene bridge, by for example an oxonium ion, and facilitates bond cleavage or subsequent fragmentation after bond cleavage of the releasable linker. Alternatively, acid catalyzed oxonium ion-assisted cleavage of the methylene bridge may begin a cascade of fragmentation of this illustrative bivalent linker, or fragment thereof. Alternatively, acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the carbamate may facilitate the beta elimination of the hydroxyalkanoic acid, which may cyclize, and facilitate cleavage of methylene bridge, by for example an oxonium ion. It is appreciated that other chemical mechanisms of bond breakage or cleavage under the metabolic, physiological, or cellular conditions described herein may initiate such a cascade of fragmentation.

It is to be understood that although the above fragmentation mechanisms are depicted as concerted mechanisms, any number of discrete steps may take place to effect the ultimate fragmentation of the bivalent linker to the final products shown. For example, it is appreciated that the bond cleavage may also occur by acid catalyzed elimination of the carbamate moiety, which may be anchimerically assisted by the stabilization provided by either the aryl group of the beta sulfur or disulfide illustrated in the above examples. In those variations of this embodiment, the releasable linker is the carbamate moiety. Alternatively, the fragmentation may be initiated by a nucleophilic attack on the disulfide group, causing cleavage to form a thiolate. The thiolate may intermolecularly displace a carbonic acid or carbamic acid moiety and form the corresponding thiacyclopropane.

The therapeutic factor can be selected from a chemotherapeutic agent, or another therapeutic factor capable of complementing the efficacy of the administered binding ligand drug delivery conjugate.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0171">In one illustrative aspect, therapeutically effective combinations of these factors can be used. In one embodiment, for example, therapeutically effective amounts of the therapeutic factor, for example, in amounts ranging from about 0.1 MIU/m<sup>2</sup>/dose/day to about 15 MIU/m<sup>2</sup>/dose/day in a multiple dose daily regimen, or for example, in amounts ranging from about 0.1 MIU/m<sup>2</sup>/dose/day to about 7.5 MIU/m<sup>2</sup>/dose/day in a multiple dose daily regimen, can be used along with the binding ligand drug delivery conjugates to eliminate, reduce, or neutralize pathogenic cells in a host animal harboring the pathogenic cells (MIU=million international units; m<sup>2</sup>=approximate body surface area of an average human).</p><p id="p-0224" num="0172">In another embodiment, chemotherapeutic agents, which are, for example, cytotoxic themselves or can work to enhance tumor permeability, are also suitable for use in the method of the invention in combination with the binding ligand drug delivery conjugates. Such chemotherapeutic agents include adrenocorticoids and corticosteroids, alkylating agents, antiandrogens, antiestrogens, androgens, aclamycin and aclamycin derivatives, estrogens, antimetabolites such as cytosine arabinoside, purine analogs, pyrimidine analogs, and methotrexate, busulfan, carboplatin, chlorambucil, cisplatin and other platinum compounds, tamoxiphen, taxol, paclitaxel, paclitaxel derivatives, Taxotere&#xae;, cyclophosphamide, daunomycin, doxorubicin, rhizoxin, T2 toxin, plant alkaloids, prednisone, hydroxyurea, teniposide, mitomycins, discodermolides, microtubule inhibitors, epothilones, tubulysin, cyclopropyl benz[e]indolone, seco-cyclopropyl benz[e]indolone.

In other embodiments, the host animal can be treated with conjugates comprising the same binding ligand linked to different drugs, or various binding ligands linked to various drugs. In another illustrative embodiment, binding ligand drug delivery conjugates with the same or different vitamins, and the same or different drugs comprising multiple vitamins and multiple drugs as part of the same drug delivery conjugate could be used.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0175">In another illustrative aspect, any effective regimen for administering the binding ligand drug delivery conjugates can be used. For example, the binding ligand drug delivery conjugates can be administered as single doses, or can be divided and administered as a multiple-dose daily regimen. In other embodiments, a staggered regimen, for example, one to three days per week can be used as an alternative to daily treatment, and for the purpose of defining this invention such intermittent or staggered daily regimen is considered to be equivalent to every day treatment and within the scope of this invention. In one embodiment, the host is treated with multiple injections of the binding ligand drug delivery conjugate to eliminate the population of pathogenic cells. In another embodiment, the host is injected multiple times (preferably about 2 up to about 50 times) with the binding ligand drug delivery conjugate, for example, at 12-72 hour intervals or at 48-72 hour intervals. In other embodiments, additional injections of the binding ligand drug delivery conjugate can be administered to the patient at an interval of days or months after the initial injections(s) and the additional injections prevent recurrence of the disease state caused by the pathogenic cells.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0176">Illustratively, the binding ligand drug delivery conjugates can be administered parenterally to the animal or patient suffering from the disease state, for example, intradermally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or intravenously in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, the binding ligand drug delivery conjugates can be administered to the animal or patient by other medically useful procedures and effective doses can be administered in standard or prolonged release dosage forms. In another aspect, the therapeutic method can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic methods recognized for treatment of disease states mediated by activated macrophages.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0177">Described herein is a method for imaging pathogenic cell populations that express or over-express PSMA.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0178">Described herein is a method for diagnosing diseases and disease states that are related to pathogenic cell populations that express or over-express PSMA. The compounds described herein bind selectively and/or specifically to cells that express or over-express PSMA. In addition, they not only show selectivity between pathogenic cells and normal tissues, they show selectivity among pathogenic cell populations (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> where PSMA expressing LnCAP cells are preferentially visualized compared to A549 tumors or KB tumos, which are not). In addition, the response is specific to PSMA binding as indicated by competition studies conducted with the conjugates described herein where binding is determined with the conjugate alone or in the presence of excess PMPA, a known binding ligand of PSMA. Binding at both the kidney and tumor is blocked in the presence of excess PMPA (see, for example, Method Examples described herein).</p><p id="p-0231" num="0179">In another embodiment, the conjugate has a binding constant K<sub>d </sub>of about 100 nM or less. In another aspect, the conjugate has a binding constant K<sub>d </sub>of about 75 nM or less. In another aspect, the conjugate has a binding constant K<sub>d </sub>of about 50 nM or less. In another aspect, the conjugate has a binding constant K<sub>d </sub>of about 25 nM or less.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0180">In another embodiment, the conjugates described herein exhibit selectivity for PSMA expressing or PSMA over-expressing cells or tissues relative to normal tissues such as blood, hear, lung, liver, spleen, duodenum, skin, muscle, bladder, and prostate, with at least 3-fold selectivity, or at least 5-fold selectivity. In one variation, the conjugates described herein exhibit selectivity for PSMA expressing or PSMA over-expressing cells or tissues relative to normal tissues with at least 10-fold selectivity. It is appreciated that the selectivity observed for imaging is indicative of the selectivity that may be observed in treating disease states responsive to the selective or specific elimination of cells or cell populations that express or over-express PSMA.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0181">The unitary daily dosage of the drug delivery conjugate can vary significantly depending on the host condition, the disease state being treated, the molecular weight of the conjugate, its route of administration and tissue distribution, and the possibility of co-usage of other therapeutic treatments such as radiation therapy. The effective amount to be administered to a patient is based on body surface area, patient weight, and physician assessment of patient condition. Effective doses can range, for example, from about 1 ng/kg to about 1 mg/kg, from about 1 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 500 &#x3bc;g/kg, from about 1 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 100 &#x3bc;g/kg, and from about 1 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 10 &#x3bc;g/kg.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0182">Generally, any manner of forming a conjugate between the bivalent linker (L) and the binding ligand (B), or analog or derivative thereof, between the bivalent linker (L) and the drug, or analog or derivative thereof, including any intervening heteroatoms, can be utilized in accordance with the present invention. Also, any art-recognized method of forming a conjugate between the spacer linker, the releasable linker, and one or more heteroatoms to form the bivalent linker (L) can be used. The conjugate can be formed by direct conjugation of any of these molecules, for example, through hydrogen, ionic, or covalent bonds. Covalent bonding can occur, for example, through the formation of amide, ester, disulfide, or imino bonds between acid, aldehyde, hydroxy, amino, sulfhydryl, or hydrazo groups.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0183">The synthetic methods are chosen depending upon the selection of the optionally included heteroatoms or the heteroatoms that are already present on the spacer linkers, releasable linkers, the drug, and/or the binding ligand.

New York (1991), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0184">More specifically, disulfide groups can be generally formed by reacting an alkyl or aryl sulfonylthioalkyl derivative, or the corresponding heteroaryldithioalkyl derivative such as a pyridin-2-yldithioalkyl derivative, and the like, with an alkylenethiol derivative. For example, the required alkyl or aryl sulfonylthioalkyl derivative may be prepared according to the method of Ranasinghe and Fuchs, Synth. Commun. 18(3), 227-32 (1988), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Other methods of preparing unsymmetrical dialkyl disulfides are based on a transthiolation of unsymmetrical heteroaryl-alkyl disulfides, such as 2-thiopyridinyl, 3-nitro-2-thiopyridinyl, and like disulfides, with alkyl thiol, as described in WO 88/01622, European Patent Application No. 0116208A1, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,691,024, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Further, carbonates, thiocarbonates, and carbamates can generally be formed by reacting an hydroxy-substituted compound, a thio-substituted compound, or an amine-substituted compound, respectively, with an activated alkoxycarbonyl derivative having a suitable leaving group.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0237" num="0185">The compounds described herein may be prepared by conventional organic synthetic methods.
