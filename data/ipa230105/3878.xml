Ice crystals are known to form in high altitude cloud structures as well as in and around developing and active convective activity. Areas with higher concentrations of atmospheric ice crystals pose significant risks to aircraft. Rather than accruing on aircraft surfaces, atmospheric ice crystals abrade and damage critical aircraft elements, such as engine components and pilot systems. This damage can be difficult to detect and can lead to costly repairs.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While pilots generally avoid convective activity, they do operate in high altitude cloud structures, as well as above, around, and below the strongest areas of convective activity. Currently, these convective areas can be detected by in-flight weather radar and lightning detection equipment on board the aircraft, and by dual polarimetric methods on the ground. Research and flight test data indicates that the radar measured echo strength for areas with higher Ice Water Content (IWC) tend to decrease at a slower rate with altitude/temperature than for areas that do not have higher probability IWC. However, there is currently no instruments capable of detecting ice crystals at longer ranges. Additionally, although current in-flight weather radar can infer the presence of ice crystals, they are prone to nuisance alerts and hence need to be qualified.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A system and method for ice crystal detection and qualification are disclosed. In one embodiment, echo power may be determined using a mechanically steered radar performing continuous or successive scans at different elevations with each scan spaced in time. In other embodiments an electronically steered antenna (ESA) may be utilized to perform two elevations scans that are not spaced in time. The echo power may be analyzed to detect and then qualify the presence and location of IWC in one of two ways: (1) Detection <b>100</b> and (2) Qualification <b>200</b>. Through detection <b>100</b>, the radar signal processor (RSP) may directly use a vertical storm characteristic model to determine and annunciate the presence of ice crystals. Through qualification <b>200</b>, in order to reduce nuisance alerts, the RSP may use other algorithms such as functions relating single pulse reflectivity (Z) and IWC to determine the probability of icing and use the vertical storm characteristics to qualify detection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In other embodiments, the airborne radar may also consider vertical storm structure to infer the presence of ice crystals. For areas with high probability of ice crystals, the reflected power changes with altitude/temperature at a rate slower than the rate of areas with a lower probability of ice crystals. The radar may compute a power residual based on scans at different elevations and compare each scan, pair of scans, scans of the same elevation, against a threshold. Icing is confirmed if the power residual is less than the threshold. This method may also be used to qualify ice crystals and hence reduce the probability of nuisance alerts.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In preferred embodiments of the present invention, first in-flight radar echo power is computed from at least two antenna elevations. Next, the logarithm of the powers is computed for the at least two elevations using an area parameter to reduce signal noise. A power residual which could be computed as the ratio of the logarithm of the power is then computed and compared to a threshold. Aircraft crew may then be informed aurally or visually of water ice crystal presence when the determined ratio is lower than the selected or determined ratio.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This Summary is provided solely as an introduction to subject matter that is fully described in the Detailed Description and Drawings.

The echo power may be analyzed to detect and then qualify the presence and location of water ice crystals in one of two ways: (1) Detection <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>): The Radar Signal Processor (RSP) may directly use a vertical storm characteristic model to determine and annunciate the presence of ice crystals; and (2) Qualification <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>): In order to reduce nuisance alerts, the RSP may use other algorithms such as functions relating single pulse reflectivity (Z) and IWC to determine the probability of icing and use the vertical storm characteristics to qualify detection.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system performs a pre-processing phase <b>102</b> followed by an IWC detection phase <b>104</b>. During the pre-processing phase <b>102</b>, the RSP commands the antenna to perform at least two scans <b>106</b> in at least two elevations. The elevation angles of the at least two scans <b>106</b> may depend, for example, on the aircraft altitude, static air temperature measured by the aircraft, total temperature, pressure, lapse rate, terrain, echo strength gradient, reflectivity gradient, and the like, as these variables may affect air density, light scattering, and radar functions. The echoes received from each elevation are sampled and stored in memory <b>108</b>. During these scans <b>106</b>, the radar can transmit a single pulse or a series of pulses. The pulse rate may be set at a rate that will not interfere with the transmission or receipt of sequential pulses. These pulses can be unmodulated pulses or can have some form of amplitude, frequency or phase modulation. For each pixel sampled for the at least two scans, the RSP computes the raw power, performs a log operation on the power to convert it into dB <b>110</b>, and filters this power in dB to reduce noise and other unwanted echoes <b>112</b>. For example, according to:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Power</i>(<i>dB</i>)=10*<i>log</i><sub>10</sub>(<i>raw power</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">Power is the radar echo strength for each range bin/pixel in front of the aircraft.

For each pixel sampled, the RSP computes a reflectivity based on the measured power. Reflectivity (Z) is the sum of the diameter of each hydrometeor raised to the sixth power per cubic meter. It is a function of particle diameter and particle density, as well as a function of range. In relation to range, reflectivity decreases as a second power or fourth power. Reflectivity cannot be directly measured by a radar, but instead must be estimated based on radar parameters. The relationship between received power and reflectivity is calculated according to methods used by those skilled in the art. The industry standard term for this reflectivity is &#x2018;Z&#x2019;. A log operation is performed on this Z which results in a parameter with units of dBZ.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><i>Z=f</i>(<i>Power</i>)</p><p id="p-0034" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>dBz=</i>10*<i>log</i><sub>10</sub>(<i>Z</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">The RSP then computes an estimate to IWC based on the relationship between Z and IWC <b>204</b>.

In a preferred embodiment the qualification logic resembles the previously described detection logic. For the pixels having a valid IWC detection (for example, IWC&#x3e;0.8 grams per cubic meter), the power residual in that pixel or an area of pixels is compared to a threshold <b>208</b>. The IWC in a pixel or an area of pixels is qualified and an icing flag is set to TRUE if the power residual is less than a predetermined threshold <b>210</b>. All other IWC values are disqualified and a corresponding IWC flag for that pixel is set to false <b>212</b>.

Power and reflectivity below a set threshold calculated according to atmospheric characteristics (e.g., static temperature, total temperature, pressure, lapse rate, terrain, echo strength gradient, reflectivity gradient, and the like) can be used to detect the presence and locations of ice crystals.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">It is to be understood that embodiments of the methods disclosed herein may include one or more of the steps described herein.
