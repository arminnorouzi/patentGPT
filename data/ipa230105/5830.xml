Unfortunately, such cracks may extend through a nearby conductive line to cut (wholly or in part) the conductive line. This outcome, caused by the misalignment between the center of the conductive pad and the center of the protective layer opening, may decrease the durability and overall reliability of the package substrate, as well as a semiconductor package incorporating the package substrate.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the inventive concept provide package substrates exhibiting improved durability and reliability, as well as more reliable semiconductor packages including same.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the inventive concept, there is provided a package substrate including; a first conductive line extending in a first horizontal direction, a first conductive pad on an upper surface of the package substrate and horizontally spaced apart from the first conductive line in a second horizontal direction, and a protective layer covering the first conductive line and including a first opening selectively exposing a portion of the first conductive pad, wherein the first opening has an elliptical shape having a minor axis defined by a first width extending in the first horizontal direction and a major axis defined by a first length extending in the second horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect of the inventive concept, there is provided a semiconductor package including; a first package substrate, a first semiconductor chip mounted on the first package substrate, a second package substrate on the first semiconductor chip, an inter-substrate connection structure connecting the first package substrate and the second package substrate;<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">a third package substrate on the second package substrate, and an inter-sub-package connection member between the second package substrate and the third package substrate.

The first conductive line LN<b>1</b> may extend in a first horizontal (or an X) direction. The first conductive pad PD<b>1</b> may be laterally (or horizontally) spaced apart (e.g., in a second horizontal (or a Y) direction intersecting the first horizontal direction) from the first conductive line LN<b>1</b>. Although not specifically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the first conductive line LN<b>1</b> may be connected to (e.g., contact) one or more conductive pads. The protective layer PL may cover (e.g., overlay in a vertical (or a Z) direction substantially perpendicular to the first horizontal direction and the second horizontal directions) the first conductive line LN<b>1</b> and portions of the first conductive pad PD<b>1</b>. However, the protective layer PL may include a first opening OP<b>1</b> selectively exposing a portion of the first conductive pad PD<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0019">The first opening OP<b>1</b> may have a first &#x201c;width&#x201d; L<b>1</b> (e.g., a dimension measured in the first horizontal direction) and a first &#x201c;length&#x201d; L<b>1</b> (e.g., a dimension measured in the second horizontal direction), wherein the first width W<b>1</b> is less than the first length L<b>1</b>. In some embodiments, the first opening OP<b>1</b> may have a substantially elliptical shape and the first conductive pad PD<b>1</b> may have a substantially circular shape. Hence, a major axis of the first opening OP<b>1</b> may extend in the second horizontal direction, and a minor axis substantially orthogonal to the major axis may extend in the first horizontal direction. That is, the first opening OP<b>1</b> may have an elongated elliptical shape having a longer dimension (i.e., the major axis) extending in the second direction and the shorter dimension (i.e., a minor axis) extending in the first horizontal direction. With this configuration, even when a misalignment between the first opening OP<b>1</b> and the first conductive pad PD<b>1</b> occurs, resulting cracks are much more likely to extend (or propagate) in the first horizontal direction (e.g., in parallel with the direction of extension for the first conductive line LN<b>1</b>). As a result, the likelihood of damage to, or cutting of the first conductive line LN<b>1</b> may be markedly reduced or eliminated, thereby improving the overall durability and reliability of the package substrate <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0020">In some embodiments, the first length L<b>1</b> of the first opening OP<b>1</b> may be substantially equal to a second length L<b>2</b> of the first conductive pad PD<b>1</b>. Accordingly, cracking may extend in the first horizontal direction (e.g., from a point at which the outer (or circumferential) edge of the first opening OP<b>1</b> and the outer edge of the first conductive pad PD<b>1</b> meet. In this manner, cutting of the first conductive line LN<b>1</b> due to cracking may be prevented, and the overall durability and reliability of the package substrate <b>100</b> may be improved.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0021">In some embodiments, the package substrate <b>100</b> may further include a second conductive line LN<b>2</b> extending in the second horizontal direction, wherein the first conductive pad PD<b>1</b> is disposed closer to the first conductive line LN<b>1</b> than to the second conductive line LN<b>2</b>. For example, a first distance D<b>1</b> (e.g., measured in the second horizontal direction) between a closest edge of the first conductive line LN<b>1</b> and the outer edge of the first conductive pad PD<b>1</b> may be less than a second distance D<b>2</b> (e.g., measured in the first horizontal direction) between a closest edge of the second conductive line LN<b>2</b> and the outer edge of the first conductive pad PD<b>1</b>.
