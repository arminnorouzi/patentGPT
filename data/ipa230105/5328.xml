id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a game system used for a game played by placing a gaming chip on one of a plurality of betting targets laid out on a table.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, there is known a system which, at a table where a game is played by placing gaming chips on one of the betting targets laid out on the table, captures the gaming chips on the table with a camera to obtain an image, then analyzes the image by an image analyzing device and identifies a betting target on which the gaming chips are placed and the type and number of the gaming chip to determine how much gaming chips have been bet on which betting target.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A plurality of play positions are provided on the table so that a plurality of players can play at the same time. On the table, a betting area is provided for each play position. In each betting area, a plurality of betting targets are laid out. A player playing in a play position places a gaming chip on one of the plurality of betting targets laid out in the betting area allocated to his/her play position to bet the gaming chips on the betting target. When a plurality of gaming chips are bet on a betting target, the plurality of gaming chips are stacked and placed on the betting target to form a single stack.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, by designing the image analyzing device in consideration of the fact that the betting area is divided for each play position in this manner, it is possible to determine which betting target and how many gaming chips have been bet on each play position. For example, in a table for a baccarat game, at least &#x201c;PLAYER&#x201d; and &#x201c;BANKER&#x201d; are provided as multiple types of betting targets for each play position. The game system can determine whether a player in each play position has bet on &#x201c;PLAYER&#x201d; or &#x201c;BANKER&#x201d; and also how much the bet amount is by analyzing the image taken (e.g., Patent Literature 1).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to this system, a player identification system for identifying players can be used to determine which player has bet how much gaming chips on which betting target. In addition thereto, by using the game result determination system for determining the outcome of the game, it is possible to determine which player has bet how many gaming chips, how many gaming chips have been redeemed, and how many gaming chips have been collected by dealer (for example, see JP2019-149155A).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Even if a table has more than one play position, it does not necessarily mean that the player must be in one of the play positions to play the game. In particular, when all the available play positions are already in use, a player who is not in a play position may participate in the game by placing his or her gaming chips in the betting area allocated to a player playing in a play position (hereinafter referred to as the &#x201c;main player&#x201d;). Thus, when a player who is not in a play position bets on a betting target in one of the betting areas allocated to the player in the play position, this is referred to as &#x201c;back-betting&#x201d;, and the player who does back-betting is referred to as the &#x201c;back-betting player&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such back-betting results in multiple players betting gaming chips on multiple betting targets in one betting area of the plurality of betting area which is divided for each play position, therefore results in multiple stacks of gaming chips will be present on the same betting target or multiple betting targets different from each other in one bet area. In conventional systems, in such cases, it is difficult to determine which of the multiple stacks of gaming chips placed in the same betting area is the main player's stack and which stack is the back-betting player's stack.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, the present invention is to provide a game system that can determine which stack of gaming chips placed by a plurality of players on the same betting area is the stack placed by which player.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The game system of one aspect of the invention comprises: a table having a betting area in which multiple types of betting targets are placed; a camera that captures the table to generate an image; and an information processing device that is configured to identify on which of the betting target a stack of gaming chips is being bet on, based on a position of the stack of gaming chips in the image, wherein the information processing device is configured to determine which stack is main player's stack and which stack is back-betting player's stack based on the image when a plurality of stacks of gaming chips are being bet on the same betting area.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This configuration makes it possible to determine which stack is the main player's stack and which stack is the back-betting player's stack, even if multiple stacks of gaming chips are bet on the same betting area.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the above game system, the information processing device may be configured to determine which stack is the main player's stack and which stack is the back-betting player's stack based on positional relationships of the plurality of stacks betting on the same betting area with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With this configuration, even if multiple stacks of gaming chips are bet on the same betting area, it is possible to determine which stack is the main player's stack and which stack is the back-betting player's stack based on the relative positions of those stacks. For example, if a game is played with a rule that a back bet should be placed to the right of a main bet, the system can determine that the left stack is the main player's stack and the right stack is the back-betting player's stack.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the above game system, the information processing device may be configured to determine which stack is the main player's stack and which stack is the back-betting player's stack based on a positional relationship between the stack and the betting target on which the stack is bet.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">This configuration makes it possible to determine which stack is which player's stack based on where the stack is placed on the betting target. For example, if a game is played under a rule set by the casino that the main bet should be placed in the center and left of the betting target, and the back bet should be placed on the right side of the betting target, the system can determine that the stack placed in the center or left of the betting target is the main betting player's stacks, and the stack placed on the right side of the betting target is the stacks of the back-betting player's stack. Furthermore, even if no back-betting player bet a stack and there is only a stack within the betting target that is bet by the main player only, it will be possible to determine that the stack is the main player's stack based on the position at which the stack is placed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the above game system, the camera may capture a player betting a stack of gaming chips, and the information processing device may be configured to recognize in the image each player who has bet the stack on the same betting area, and based on the recognition results, determine which stack is the main player's stack and which stack is the back-betting player's stack.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">With this configuration, it is possible to recognize the player who bet the stack, whereby it is possible to determine which player is the main player, which player is the back-betting player, and also which stack is the main player's, which stack is the back-betting player's.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the above game system, the information processing device may be configured to recognize in the image a body part or clothing part of the each player who has bet the stack on the same betting area, and based on the results of recognition of the body part or clothing part, determine which stack is the main player's stack and wherein it is determined which stack is the back-betting player's stack.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With this configuration, even if the casino does not set the rules for where the stack should be bet on, and the game is played such that the player is free to bet the stack anywhere in a betting target, the system can still identify which stack belongs to which player based on a body part or clothing part recognized from the captured image.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the above game system, the information processing device may be configured to identify which body part or clothing part of the recognized body part or clothing part is a body part or clothing part of either player, and based on the identification result, determine which stack is the main player's stack and which stack is the back-betting player's stack.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With this configuration, it is possible to recognize which body part or clothing part belongs to which player, and then to determine which body part or clothing part has been bet which stack.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the above game system, the information processing device may be configured to determine a direction of the recognized body part or clothing part, and based on the result of the determination, determine which stack is the main player's stack and which stack is the back-betting player's stack.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With this configuration, it is possible to determine which stack belongs to which player, for example, from the direction of the extension of the body part or clothing betting the stack, even if it is difficult to recognize the faces of the main player and the back-betting player, or to recognize the body part or clothing.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the above game system, the information processing device may be configured to determine whether the plurality of stacks bet on the same betting area are stacks of the same player based on the image.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With this configuration, it is possible to determine which stack belongs to which player, even if, for example, one player is betting on more than one stack because of a large betting amount, or if more than one player respectively bet a stack.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the above game system, the information processing device may be configured to determine whether the plurality of stacks are stacks of the same player based on a distance of the plurality of stacks.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With this configuration, it is possible to determine, for example, if the distance between the stacks is close, they are bets made by the same player, and if the distance between the stacks is far, they are bets made by more than one player.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the above game system, the information processing device may be configured to determine which stack is the main player's stack and which stack is the back-betting player's stack based on a plurality of the images obtained in chronological order.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With this configuration, it is possible to distinguish which stack belongs to which player, not only from a single image captured, but also from multiple images obtained in chronological order, i.e., video.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the above game system, the information processing device may be configured to determine which stack is a main player's stack and which stack is a back-betting player's stack based on an order in which the plurality of stacks bet on the same betting area were bet.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With this configuration, for example, if the casino has a rule that the main player should bet first and the back-betting player should bet later, the system can determine that the first stack bet is the main player's and the last stack bet is the back-betting player's.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the present invention, it is possible to determine which stack is the main player's stack and which stack is the back-betting player's stack, even if a plurality of stacks of gaming chips are bet on the same betting area.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading

The color may be a layer of the gaming chip <b>8</b>, applied circumferentially on the sides of the gaming chip <b>8</b>, or as a predetermined mark on the surface of the gaming chip <b>8</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a color attached circumferentially to a side of the gaming chip <b>8</b>. The color represents a type (value) of the gaming chip <b>8</b>. In other words, the gaming chip <b>8</b> is given a color according to the type (value) of the gaming chip <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The information processing device <b>12</b> detects the stack <b>80</b> from within the image using a neural network that has been trained to detect the stack <b>80</b>. Specifically, the information processing device <b>12</b> detects a rectangular region <b>9</b> (bounding box) including the stack <b>80</b> from within the image (object detection) or extracts a region of the stack <b>80</b> (hereinafter referred to as the &#x201c;stack region&#x201d;)(region segmentation).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The information processing device <b>12</b> extracts a region in which the partially assigned color is presented, and determines the type of each gaming chip <b>8</b> based on the partially assigned color of each gaming chip <b>8</b> in the detected stack <b>80</b>. This determination may be made using template matching or a machine learning model such as a neural network. The two of them may be used in combination, or each of them may be used to make a stepwise determination.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the information processing device <b>12</b> may recognize the stack <b>80</b> or the type of gaming chip <b>8</b> that forms the stack <b>80</b> by a method of measuring features on the image such as shape, brightness, saturation, tint, etc., based on the image analysis to the captured image <b>11</b>, without using an artificial intelligence device.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, the method of recognizing which betting target <b>7</b> the stack <b>80</b> is placed on will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a portion of an image taken by the camera <b>10</b><i>b </i>directly above the gaming table <b>2</b>. In this image, the topmost gaming chip <b>8</b> of the stack <b>80</b> is observed in a circular shape. The information processing device <b>12</b> defines a two-dimensional arranged grid for this image, and for each grid, which betting target <b>7</b> the grid in question corresponds to. The information processing device <b>12</b> detects the stack <b>80</b> from the image and determines in which grid the detected stack <b>80</b> (specifically, the center of the topmost gaming chip <b>8</b> of the stack <b>80</b>) is located, thereby determining in which betting target <b>7</b> the stack <b>80</b> is placed. Based on the captured image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it is also possible to determine in which grid the stack <b>80</b> is located, thereby determining in which position in the betting target <b>7</b> the stack <b>80</b> is placed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the information processing device <b>12</b> determines on which betting target <b>7</b> the stack <b>80</b> is placed based on the captured image <b>11</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the information processing device <b>12</b> does as follows. That is, when using a captured image obtained from an oblique upward angle, such as the captured image <b>11</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the information processing device <b>12</b> determines, according to the coordinate value of a pixel (i.e., the position in the captured image) at the center of a bottom edge of the detected rectangular region <b>9</b> or the lowest point in the center of the maximum left and right width of the extracted stack region, the position where the stack <b>80</b> is located (i.e., the betting target <b>7</b> or the position within the betting target <b>7</b>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Alternatively, in determining the position where the stack <b>80</b> is located (i.e., the betting target <b>7</b> or the position within the betting target <b>7</b>) from the captured image <b>11</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the information processing device <b>12</b> may determine that the stack <b>80</b> exists at the coordinates of the center of the left and right directions of the color circumferentially attached to the side of the bottom gaming chip <b>8</b>. Alternatively, the position of the stack <b>80</b> may be determined by estimating the overall shape of the gaming chip <b>8</b> from the arc shape of the color arc attached in the circumferential direction and identifying the coordinates of the center of the gaming chip <b>8</b> from the overall shape.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The information processing device <b>12</b> stores which coordinates correspond to which betting target <b>7</b>, and the information stored is compared with the coordinates indicating the center of the gaming chip <b>8</b> determined from the captured image <b>11</b><i>a </i>to recognize on which betting target <b>7</b> the stack <b>80</b> is placed. The information processing device <b>12</b> may also detect or extract each betting target <b>7</b> from the captured image using a machine learning model such as a neural network to determine the betting target <b>7</b> on which the stack <b>80</b> is placed by detecting or extracting each betting target <b>7</b> from the captured image.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The information processing device <b>12</b> may also recognize the center of the topmost chip and the number of gaming chips <b>8</b> in the stack <b>80</b> and based on those, estimate the position of the center of the lowest gaming chip in the stack <b>80</b> and use that as the position of the stack <b>80</b>. In this case, the information processor <b>12</b> calculates the position of the right angle of the right triangle as the position of the lowest gaming chip, that is, the position of the stack, wherein the right triangle has a line segment connecting the camera <b>10</b> and the center of the topmost chip as the slope of the diagonal, has a height calculated from the number of gaming chips <b>8</b>, and has the base on the table surface.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The information processing unit <b>12</b> transforms the coordinates of each pixel of the image obtained from the camera <b>10</b> into the table coordinate system set on the table surface. This transformation formula is determined from the position and posture relationship between the table surface and the camera <b>10</b>, and is known as long as the camera <b>10</b> is fixed. By transforming the position of the recognized stack <b>80</b> in the respective images of the multiple cameras <b>10</b> into the table coordinate system, the position of the stack <b>80</b> in the respective images of the multiple cameras <b>10</b> can be handled in a unified manner for the stack <b>80</b> captured by the multiple cameras.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The information processing device <b>12</b> has a map of betting targets corresponding to the table coordinate system. The information processor <b>12</b> determines which of the <b>7</b> betting targets the stack <b>80</b> is located on by mapping the position (coordinates) of the stack <b>80</b> converted to the table coordinate system onto the map (the first map) where the <b>7</b> betting targets are set.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The information processing device <b>12</b> further has a map (a second map) in which some of the betting targets (e.g., the relatively large areas such as the TIE area <b>7</b><i>c</i>, the PLAYER WIN area <b>7</b><i>d</i>, and BANKER WIN area <b>7</b><i>e</i>) are further divided into a number of sub-areas. The information processing device <b>12</b> determines which sub-area of the betting target <b>7</b> the stack <b>80</b> is located in by mapping the positions (coordinates) of the stacks converted to the table coordinate system onto the second map. As such a second map, for example, a map may be used in which three sub-areas are defined by dividing the TIE area <b>7</b><i>c </i>longitudinally into three parts, four sub-areas are defined by dividing the PLAYER WIN area <b>7</b><i>d </i>and BANKER WIN area <b>7</b><i>e </i>respectively into four parts.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the positions of the stack <b>80</b> obtained by the plurality of cameras <b>10</b> respectively are converted to the table coordinate system, an error may occur between them. This error can be caused by a shift in the posture or position of the camera <b>10</b>, an inaccuracy in the transformation formula for the coordinate transformation, or an error in the recognition of the position of the stack <b>80</b>. If the positions of the same stack <b>80</b> captured by the plurality of cameras <b>10</b> are misaligned when each is converted to the table coordinate system, the median value of those stack <b>80</b> may be regarded as the coordinates of the stack <b>80</b>. If the stacks <b>80</b> were captured by the plurality of cameras <b>10</b> respectively, and the distance between them in the table coordinate system is less than a predetermined threshold, the information processing device <b>12</b> may consider those stacks <b>80</b> to be the same stack, and if the distance between them is greater than the threshold value, it may recognize them to be two different stacks.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the above example, the information processing device <b>12</b> determined which betting target or sub-area the stack <b>80</b> was placed in after converting all of the stack <b>80</b> positions obtained from each of the plurality of cameras <b>10</b> into the same table coordinate system, however, instead of this, the information processing device <b>12</b> may determine which betting target or sub-area the recognized stack <b>80</b> is located in by preparing a map with each betting target or sub-area in the captured image <b>11</b> of each camera <b>10</b> and mapping the location of the recognized stack <b>80</b> in the captured image <b>11</b> of each camera onto that map without any coordinate transformation.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a second example of a captured image <b>11</b><i>b </i>generated by the camera <b>10</b> capturing the betting area <b>6</b>.

Now suppose that the casino sets a rule that the back bet should be placed to the right of the main bet from the player to the dealer, and the game is played in accordance with that rule, and a captured image <b>11</b><i>b </i>is generated. In this case, the information processing device <b>12</b> determines, based on the captured image <b>11</b><i>b</i>, that a stack <b>80</b><i>b </i>placed in PLAYER WIN area <b>7</b><i>d </i>is placed on the left side and a stack <b>80</b><i>a </i>placed in TIE area <b>7</b><i>c </i>is placed on the right side of the stack <b>80</b><i>b</i>, and furthermore, based on the above rule, determines that <b>80</b><i>b </i>is the main bet and stack <b>80</b><i>a </i>is the back bet.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Based on the above rules, it is possible to determine whether each stack <b>80</b> is a main bet or a back bet, even when multiple stacks <b>80</b> are betting in the same betting area <b>6</b> by main player <b>3</b><i>m </i>and back-betting player <b>3</b><i>b</i>.

The method of recognizing the region of the arm <b>15</b> from the captured image <b>11</b><i>c </i>is basically the same as the method of extracting the region of the gaming chip <b>8</b> described above. In the case of recognizing the gaming chip <b>8</b>, a specific color attached to the gaming chip <b>8</b> is used as a reference, but in the case of recognizing the arm <b>15</b>, the color or pattern of the clothing and the color of the arm are used as a reference.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The information processing device <b>12</b> captures the arms <b>15</b> of each player in advance and stores the captured images of each arm <b>15</b> in association with the information identifying the player concerned.

In this case, judging simply by the order, the second stack <b>80</b> bet by main player <b>3</b><i>m </i>is judged to be the one bet by back-betting player <b>3</b><i>b </i>bet. Therefore, to determine whether the second and subsequent stacks of <b>80</b> are back bets by main player <b>3</b><i>m </i>or back betting player <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the information processing device <b>12</b> may make the following determination.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The camera <b>10</b> continuously captures a plurality of images and provides the information processing device <b>12</b> with a time series of captured images <b>11</b>. In this case, if the second stack <b>80</b> is bet within a predetermined time (for example, 2 seconds) after the first stack <b>80</b> was bet, the information processor <b>12</b> recognizes that the first stack and the second stack were bet by the same player, and if the third stack <b>80</b> is bet within a predetermined time after the second stack <b>80</b> was bet, the information processor <b>12</b> recognizes that the second stack and the third stack were bet by the same player.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Even if there are multiple stacks <b>80</b> in the same betting area <b>6</b>, they may all have been bet by main player <b>3</b><i>m</i>. In this case, the information processing device <b>12</b> will not be able to determine whether the second stack of <b>80</b> is the first stack of <b>80</b> is bet within a predetermined time after the first stack is bet, the information processor <b>12</b> recognizes that the first stack and the second stack were bet by the same player, and the third stack is If the second stack is bet within a predetermined time after the second stack is bet, the second stack and the third stack may be recognized as having been bet by the same player.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">If there are multiple stacks <b>80</b> in the same betting area <b>6</b>, the information processing device <b>12</b> may determine whether those stacks <b>80</b> were bet by the same player based on the amount and number of gaming chips <b>8</b> in those stacks <b>80</b>. For example, when there are a stack <b>80</b> of ten $10,000 chips (totaling $100,000) and a stack <b>80</b> of two $1,000 chips, the information processing device <b>12</b> may determine that those stacks were bet by separate players. This is because it is unlikely that a player who bets $100,000 would further bet $1,000 for a total of $101,000. In this case, the information processing device <b>12</b> may recognize the stack <b>80</b> with the larger amount as the stack bet by the main player.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates the configuration of the game system <b>20</b> of the second example of the present invention.
