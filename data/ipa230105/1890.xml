One type of vehicle parking system for trucks is an electronic parking system. In some electronic parking systems, the parking brake is automatically applied when the truck driver is detected as having exited the driver's seat but not exiting the truck cab. A seat pressure switch or a seat belt switch is usually used to detect presence of a person in the driver's seat. Some trucks include a hill start assist system in which the brake is automatically applied when the truck is stopped on an uphill inclined roadway. Accordingly, those skilled in the art continue with research and development efforts in the field of parking systems of a vehicle, such as a commercial truck, that has an electronic parking system, and may or may not have a hill start assist system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one embodiment, a parking brake apparatus is provided for a vehicle having components of a parking brake system.

The specific construction of the parking brake apparatus may vary. It is to be understood that the disclosure below provides a number of embodiments or examples for implementing different features of various embodiments. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described to simplify the present disclosure. These are merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a schematic block diagram showing an example parking brake apparatus <b>100</b><i>a </i>constructed in accordance with an embodiment is illustrated. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, electrical line connections are shown as solid lines, pneumatic lines connections are shown as dashed lines, and mechanical couplings are shown as double solid lines.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Parking brake apparatus <b>100</b><i>a </i>includes a controller area network (CAN) bus <b>110</b><i>a </i>to which a number of vehicle devices are connected to communicate with each other. The CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be in a standardized serial communication format, such as SAE J1939, or in a proprietary format. It is conceivable that some or all of the vehicle devices be hardwired for communication instead of using the CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a </i>for communication.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Vehicle devices that may be connected to the CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a </i>include, but are not limited to, a transmission controller <b>120</b><i>a</i>, a service brake controller <b>130</b><i>a</i>, a parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a</i>, and other controllers <b>170</b><i>a</i>. The transmission controller <b>120</b><i>a </i>is in the form of an electronic controller unit that may provide to the CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a </i>a variety of signals including configuration messages, diagnostic status, clutch status (e.g., open/closed), gear status, and transmission-specific signals such as &#x201c;ready to release brakes&#x201d;. Similarly, the service brake controller <b>130</b><i>a </i>is in the form of an electronic controller unit that may provide to the CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a </i>a variety of signals including configuration messages, diagnostic status, brake lamp status, service brake pressure, and brake-specific signals such an &#x201c;ok to release brakes&#x201d; acknowledgement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The other controllers <b>170</b><i>a </i>may include an engine controller which controls the vehicle engine. As another example, the other controllers <b>170</b><i>a </i>include a headway controller, such as used in a radar-based adaptive cruise control systems.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>is in the form of an electronic controller unit that is arranged to monitor signals on the CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a </i>to provide one or more control signals to apply parking brakes based upon control logic <b>200</b><i>a </i>that is stored in a data storage unit of the parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a</i>. In particular, the parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>provides one or more signals on line <b>142</b><i>a </i>to control operation of parking brake valves <b>144</b><i>a</i>. Compressed air supply <b>146</b><i>a </i>provides a source of compressed air in line <b>148</b><i>a </i>to parking brake valves <b>144</b><i>a</i>. Parking brake valves <b>144</b><i>a </i>are controlled by parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>to vary pneumatic pressure in line <b>150</b><i>a </i>to one or more chambers of spring brake chambers <b>152</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">More specifically, when the parking brakes of the vehicle are applied, the parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>provides signals on line <b>142</b><i>a </i>that are applied to parking brake valves <b>144</b><i>a </i>so as to exhaust air in one or more chambers of spring brake chambers <b>152</b><i>a</i>. The spring brake chambers <b>152</b><i>a </i>are operatively coupled via line <b>154</b><i>a </i>in known manner to parking brake springs <b>156</b><i>a</i>. When air in spring brake chambers <b>152</b><i>a </i>is exhausted and system air pressure drops to less than about 45 psi to 60 psi, parking brake springs <b>156</b><i>a </i>are activated to apply the vehicle parking brakes, as is known. Structure and operation of parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>and parking brake valves <b>144</b><i>a </i>for controlling operation of spring brake chambers <b>152</b><i>a </i>and parking brake springs <b>156</b><i>a </i>of the vehicle are conventional and, therefore, will not be further described.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>also provides a number of signals on line <b>158</b><i>a </i>to one or a number of driver alerting devices <b>160</b><i>a</i>. The driver alerting devices <b>160</b><i>a </i>may comprise any number of devices that can provide any combination of signals including a visual signal, an audio signal, and a haptic signal to alert the vehicle driver. Other devices that provide different types of signals to alert the vehicle driver are possible.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, the control logic <b>200</b><i>a </i>enables the parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>to provide one or more control signals on line <b>142</b><i>a </i>to apply the parking brakes to prevent a vehicle rollaway when a first signal that is indicative of a hill start assist system installed on the vehicle is detected to be present and a second signal that is indicative of the hill start assist system being activated is received on the CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a </i>from another device or controller (e.g., the transmission controller <b>120</b><i>a </i>or the service brake controller <b>130</b><i>a</i>). The feature of applying the vehicle parking brakes to prevent a vehicle rollaway is referred to herein as the &#x201c;anti-rollaway&#x201d; feature.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A hill start assist system is a driver assistance system in which applied service brakes are maintained for a predetermined time period as the vehicle driver switches from applying pressure to the foot-brake pedal to the foot-gas pedal when the vehicle is on an inclined roadway. When sensors on the vehicle detect that the vehicle is on an incline, the hill start assist system is activated to maintain the service brakes applied for the predetermined time period. Structure and operation of hill start assist systems are conventional and, therefore, will not be further described.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the first signal is embedded into a memory associated with the parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a</i>, and is therefore obtained by retrieving the embedded signal. In some embodiments, the first signal is provided by another device or controller, and is therefore obtained via the CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a</i>. The parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>is configured and arranged to assume that no hill start assist system is installed on the vehicle when a first signal is absent. The vehicle driver may be provided with an indication that a hill start assist system is installed on the vehicle when the first signal is present, and the second signal is obtained from the CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a</i>. When this occurs, the vehicle driver is provided with an indication thereof in the form of a visual signal, an audible signal, or a haptic signal on the driver alerting devices <b>160</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a flow diagram <b>200</b><i>a </i>depicts an example method of operating the parking brake apparatus <b>100</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> in accordance with an embodiment. The flow diagram <b>200</b><i>a </i>is an embodiment of the control logic <b>200</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and will be referred to herein as &#x201c;control logic <b>200</b><i>a</i>&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The control logic <b>200</b><i>a </i>in block <b>210</b><i>a </i>begins by making a determination a as to whether a hill start assist system is installed on the vehicle. As previously described, the control logic <b>200</b><i>a </i>may perform this by looking at the memory of the parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>or at the CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a </i>for the first signal that is indicative of a hill start assist system installed on the vehicle. If the determination in block <b>210</b><i>a </i>is affirmative (i.e., a hill start assist system is installed on the vehicle), the process of control logic <b>200</b><i>a </i>proceeds to block <b>220</b><i>a</i>. In block <b>220</b><i>a</i>, a determination is made as to whether the hill start assist system is being activated. As previously described, the control logic <b>200</b><i>a </i>may perform this by looking at the CAN bus <b>110</b><i>a </i>for the second signal from another device or controller.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">If the determination in block <b>220</b><i>a </i>is affirmative (i.e., the hill start assist system is being activated), the process proceeds to block <b>230</b><i>a </i>in which a first parking brake control algorithm (which may comprise a time-delay based parking brake control algorithm) is invoked. When this occurs, the parking brakes are applied after a first predetermined amount of time has elapsed since when the parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>obtained both the first and second signals. More specifically, the parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>executes program instructions of the first parking brake control algorithm when the first signal that is indicative of a hill start assist system installed on the vehicle is detected to be present and the second signal is received. The process of control logic <b>200</b><i>a </i>then ends.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">However, if the determination in block <b>220</b><i>a </i>is negative (i.e., the hill start assist system is not being activated), the process of control logic <b>200</b><i>a </i>proceeds to block <b>240</b><i>a </i>in which a second parking brake control algorithm (which may comprise a standard parking brake control algorithm) is invoked. When this occurs, the parking brakes are applied after a second predetermined amount of time has elapsed since when the parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>detected only the first signal. The parking brake controller <b>140</b><i>a </i>executes program instructions of the second parking brake control algorithm when the first signal that is indicative of a hill start assist system installed on the vehicle is absent. The process of control logic <b>200</b><i>a </i>then ends.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second predetermined amount of time is different from the first predetermined amount of time. In some embodiments, the second predetermined amount of time is greater than the first predetermined amount of time. For example, the first predetermined amount of time is about five (5) seconds and the second predetermined amount of time is about thirty (30) seconds. In some embodiments, the second predetermined amount of time may be zero (i.e., no time delay).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a schematic block diagram showing an example parking brake apparatus <b>100</b><i>b </i>constructed in accordance with an embodiment is illustrated.
