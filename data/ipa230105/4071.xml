id="p-0057" num="0056">The in-vehicle optical sensor cover described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011-244417 includes a vibration mechanism including a piezoelectric element and an electrode that are provided in a housing of a camera cover and vibrate the cover glass by generating an ultrasonic wave or a low frequency wave. In the in-vehicle optical sensor cover described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011-244417, the cover glass is vibrated by the vibration mechanism while or after a cleaning liquid is ejected from an ejection port of the cleaning nozzle toward the glass surface of the cover glass.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">However, the in-vehicle optical sensor cover described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011-244417 still has room for improvement from the viewpoint of removing liquid droplets. In the in-vehicle optical sensor cover described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011-244417, when a light-transmissive body, which is a cover glass to which liquid droplets adhere, is vibrated, the liquid droplets may remain in the light-transmissive body due to the vibration, therefore, there is a problem in that it is difficult for the in-vehicle optical sensor cover described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011-244417 to remove liquid droplets adhering to the light-transmissive body.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, in the in-vehicle optical sensor cover described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011-244417, it is difficult to remove liquid droplets containing a foreign matter adhering to the light-transmissive body. The liquid droplets containing the foreign matter are, for example, muddy water. Muddy water is more likely to remain in the light-transmissive body than liquid droplets that do not contain the foreign matter, such as rainwater, for example. Therefore, there is a problem in that it is difficult to remove muddy water from the light-transmissive body even when the light-transmissive body is cleaned with the cleaning liquid.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">These problems are novel problems discovered by the inventors of preferred embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As a result of intensive studies to solve these problems, the inventors of preferred embodiments of the present invention have discovered that the sliding angle of a liquid droplet adhering to the light-transmissive body changes when

equal to or less than about 1.7&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>m/s<sup>2</sup>, and a second vibration mode in which the light-transmissive body is vibrated at a vibration acceleration of, for example, equal to or more than about 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>m/s<sup>2 </sup>and equal to or less than about 8.0&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>m/s<sup>2</sup>, and the controller may control the vibrator to execute the second vibration mode after executing the first vibration mode.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">With such a configuration, it is possible to further improve the liquid droplet removal performance.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The vibrator may include a piezoelectric element, and the controller may control a value of a voltage applied to the piezoelectric element to be, for example, equal to or more

than about 2 Vp-p and equal to or less than about 15 Vp-p in the second vibration mode.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">With such a configuration, the vibration acceleration can be controlled more easily.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The vibration device may further include a displacement detection sensor to detect information related to a displacement amount of the light-transmissive body and transmit the information to the controller, and the controller may control the vibration acceleration of the vibrator based on the information.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">With such a configuration, the vibration acceleration of the vibrator can be controlled based on the information related to the displacement amount of the light-transmissive body.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The vibration device may further include a blower to spray gas onto a surface of the light-transmissive body.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">With such a configuration, it is possible to further improve the liquid droplet removal performance.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The vibration device may further include a discharge device to discharge liquid onto the surface of the light-transmissive body.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">With such a configuration, the liquid can be discharged onto the surface of the light-transmissive body, and the discharged liquid can be removed from the surface of the light-transmissive body.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A water-repellent coating layer may be provided on the surface of the light-transmissive body.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">With such a

Displacements of the light-transmissive body <b>2</b> excited by vibration of the vibrator <b>3</b> were detected by a laser displacement meter (Olympus Corporation: BX51M), and measured by a multimeter (Keysight: 2110) and an oscilloscope (Tektro: Oscilloscope TBS1104). The vibration acceleration was calculated by an equation &#x3b1;=(2&#x3c0;f)<sup>2</sup>A, where &#x3b1; is vibration acceleration, f is frequencies, and A is amplitude (displacement amount).</p><p id="p-0286" num="0283">As described in Preferred Embodiment 1, when the sliding angle &#x3b8; is larger than about 40 degrees, the adhesion energy E of the liquid droplet is larger than the force with which the liquid droplet slides down from the surface of the light-transmissive body <b>2</b> to the outside. Therefore, the liquid droplets gather at a portion where the displacement amount is maximum in the light-transmissive body <b>2</b>, that is, a central portion of the light-transmissive body <b>2</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>, when the vibration acceleration &#x3b1; is equal to or more about 8.1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>m/s<sup>2</sup>, the sliding angle &#x3b8; is larger than about 40 degrees. Note that when the vibration acceleration &#x3b1; is larger than about 1.7&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>m/s<sup>2</sup>, the sliding angle &#x3b8; is close to about 90 degrees. When the sliding angle is close to about 90 degrees, the liquid droplet behaves like a vertical drop, and the behavior of the liquid droplet does not change even when the sliding angle is further increased. That is, when the sliding angle is close to about 90 degrees, the behavior of the liquid droplet is saturated. Further, when the vibration acceleration &#x3b1; is too large, the load applied to the vibration device itself increases. For this reason, the vibration acceleration of about 1.7&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>m/s<sup>2 </sup>at which the sliding angle for saturating the behavior of the liquid droplet is close to about 90 degrees was set as the maximum value of the vibration acceleration.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0284">Therefore, in the first vibration mode, the vibration acceleration &#x3b1; is preferably equal to or more than about 8.1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>m/s<sup>2 </sup>and equal to or less than about 1.7&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>m/s<sup>2 </sup>(see &#x201c;Cl&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>).

In Preferred Embodiment 6, liquid droplets can be collected on the surface of the light-transmissive body <b>2</b> by executing the first vibration mode.
