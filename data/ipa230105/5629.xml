Therefore, the water quality is of essential importance, because any worsening thereof will at least make these dismantling activities more difficult if not impossible even. Depending on the operation, e.g. due to the metered adding of zinc or implementing of decontamination processes, residues of, for example, nickel oxalate, iron oxalate, zinc compounds, or deposits such as salts, oxides, CRUD, i.e. spongy or crusty deposits, may be present on the metal surfaces particularly of the primary circuit systems. Thermal dismantling processes such as, e.g., plasma gas cutting, can be used during the underwater dismantling. Due to the high process temperatures and the incorporation of cutting gases, surface deposits can react and thus enter the water. Furthermore, reactions can occur between the cutting gas and liquid due to the high process temperatures, and the resulting compounds can enter the water.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, metal ions, such as iron, chromium, nickel, and manganese ions, or radionuclides can be dissolved in water in significant quantities and that is both during thermal and during mechanical dismantling. The latter can be implemented by means of cutting, for example. Moreover, hazardous substances which are harmful to health and carcinogenic, such as chromium (VI) and nickel compounds, can be released and enter the water.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If the solution is oversaturated with metal ions or metal compounds, the substances can precipitate out as deposits, whereby the view is significantly impacted to the extent that there is no longer a clear view as required for the underwater dismantling.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The water quality is often impacted due to the prolonged dismantling works, which can last weeks or months, when the water is easily heated, there are many ions in the water, and oxygen is dissolved due to the circulation, such that an ideal breeding ground forms for the growth of microorganisms or algae. This also negatively impacts the viewing conditions. Furthermore, negative effects such as, e.g., corrosion, can result on the dismantling tools.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">DE 90 15 427 U1 discloses a device for underwater dismantling of contaminated components of a nuclear facility. During the dismantling, any chips and abraded particles present are deposited into an external filter, which is arranged in a liquid circuit, into which the fuel pool of the nuclear facility is integrated.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to carry out cleaning of a liquid in which irradiated components are dismantled, DE 696 06 778 T2 provides for filtered devices used in series, wherein initially the coarsest impurities are retained by means of a pre-filtering sieve and then filter cartridges are used for fine filtering.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">JP 2016-133 362 A relates to a method for decontamination of a water tank. To this end, a nozzle module is inserted into the water tank, by means of which nozzle module the wall of the tank is exposed to liquid which is being suctioned from the tank, in order to supply a plurality of filter units, which may be activated carbon filters, after the liquid flows through an intermediate tank. Zeolite is used to adsorb strontium.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,188 B1 discloses a filter system for coarse and fine filtering.

No. 4,975,199 A provides for particulate filters in order to then supply this removed water to reverse osmosis systems.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0018">The object of the present invention is to refine a method and an arrangement of the aforementioned type such that negative impacting of the viewing conditions as well as an accumulation of hazardous substances are prevented during underwater dismantling.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0019">In order to achieve the object, it is essentially proposed according to the method that the liquid flows through at least one first filter device in the form of a coarse filter and one second filter device, in which at least one device from the group comprising ion exchangers, reverse osmosis systems, ultrafiltration systems, activated carbon filters, zeolite filters, or biological filters is used for the filtration, and that at least the first and/or the second filter device, preferably both the first and the second filter device, is/are arranged in the vessel.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0020">However, it is also possible for the first filter device to be arranged within the vessel and the second filter device to be arranged outside the vessel. If the second filter device is positioned outside the vessel, a simple exchange of ion exchanger resins or a maintenance of the filter of the second filter device can easily be implemented.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0021">The vessel is part of the circuit.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0022">In this case, it is particularly provided that the liquid flows through the first and one further filter device before flowing through the second filter device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0023">The first filter device may be a coarse filter, such as a sand filter or wire mesh filter with a filter fineness or pore size between 1 mm and 5 mm so that particles between 1 mm and 5 mm are filtered out of the liquid from the circuit.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0024">The further filter device is a fine filter and may have, e.g., one or more filter cartridges, such as activated carbon cartridges or wound filter cartridges, with a filter fineness between 1 &#x3bc;m and 150 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0025">In other words, according to the invention, a water treatment is carried out during dismantling of devices underwater in that the water initially flows through a coarse filter, then a fine filter, and finally a filter device, in which at least one filter from the group comprising ion exchangers, reverse osmosis systems, activated carbon filters, ultrafiltration systems, zeolite filters, and biological filters is used.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026">In this case, the liquid flows within the circuit in the vessel itself. According to the invention, a closed system in the vessel is used, i.e. the liquid is guided through the circuit in the vessel itself, in order to separate out particles so that any negative impact on the viewing conditions during dismantling is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0027">If the filter devices are positioned within the vessel, there is the additional advantage that the radioactive load is not increased outside of the vessel because the liquid remains in the vessel. Dirt and harmful substances are removed at the same time as the dismantling process. This suppresses the accumulation of harmful substances in the liquid and prevents corrosion of dismantling devices.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0028">The ion exchanger is particularly a cation exchanger or anion exchanger or cation exchanger or anion exchanger.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0029">The cation exchanger should be a strongly or weakly acidic cation exchanger and/or the anion exchanger should be a strongly or weakly alkaline anion exchanger.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">A selective ion exchanger could also be used as the ion exchanger in order to bind, e.g., Li, Cs, or radionuclides.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">According to the prior art, if the liquid present during the underwater dismantling flows through two filter devices, which typically enable a coarse and a fine filtration, which are arranged outside of the vessel and thus lead to a radioactive load in the environment of the vessel, it is provided according to the invention that, on the one hand, a cleaning of the liquid takes place in the vessel itself and, on the other hand, a special filter step is provided which ensures that the ions, microorganisms, or radionuclides causing an impact are removed from the liquid such that a clear view is provided even when the dismantling works are carried out over a long period of time, i.e. weeks and possibly months, and/or at temperatures which particularly provide a breeding ground for the growth of microorganisms and algae.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">According to the invention, an accumulation of harmful substances in the liquid is prevented. An increase in the ambient dose rate and corrosion on the dismantling devices are also suppressed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033">In particular, the invention provides that the second filter device comprises several ion exchangers, such as radionuclide-selective ion exchangers and/or anion exchangers and/or cation exchangers, which are arranged fluidically in parallel and/or in series.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">An arrangement of the aforementioned type is characterized in that at least one first and one second filter device are arranged in the circuit, in that the first filter device is a coarse filter and the second filter device is a device from the group comprising ion exchangers, reverse osmosis systems, ultrafiltration systems, zeolite filters, activated carbon filters, and biological filters, and in that the first and/or second filter device, particularly the first and the second filter device, is/are arranged in the vessel.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035">In particular, the invention also provides that the second filter device is positioned upstream of a further filter device, wherein particularly the first filter device is a coarse filter and the second filter device is a fine filter.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">The further filter device, i.e. the fine filter, should be or is also arranged in the vessel.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">Alternatively, it is possible for the first filter device to be arranged within the vessel and the second filter device to be arranged outside the vessel. The further filter device may be arranged in the vessel or outside the vessel.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0038">Regardless of this, the second filter device should have at least two ion exchangers, which are used fluidically in series or in parallel.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0039">Preferably, the second filter device has at least one ion exchanger from the group comprising radionuclide-selective ion exchangers, anion exchangers, or cation exchangers.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0040" num="0040">Further details, advantages, and features of the invention result not only from the claims, the features to be taken from said claims&#x2014;on their own and/or in combination&#x2014;as well as the exemplary embodiments to be obtained from the following description of the drawing.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">The following is shown:</p><p id="p-0042" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> a first exemplary embodiment of an underwater dismantling arrangement; and</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> a second embodiment of an underwater dismantling arrangement.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0044" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows, as a first exemplary embodiment of the teaching according to the invention, a section of a water-filled vessel <b>10</b> of a nuclear facility, such as reactor wells, in which underwater dismantling works are carried out.
