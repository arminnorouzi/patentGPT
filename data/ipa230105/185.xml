This not only causes respiratory difficulty, and the face mask may be contaminated by the wearer's saliva as he/she engages verbal communications. To obviate these shortcomings, recent face masks are designed to have multiple folds or to have three-dimensional shapes. The latter is costlier so that most users choose the former planar ones.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When a graphical pattern is printed on a planar and multi-fold face mask, either the pattern is partially covered by the folds or, when the folds of the face mask are expanded for wearing, the pattern breaks up. In addition, if the folds are not fully unfolded, the breathability of the face mask is still compromised.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The original design of the planar face mask with folds is that, when the folds are expanded, the face mask may better match the wearer's face. However, after the face mask is worn, it is still possible that the face mask is overly close to the face to cause respiratory difficulty, or the face mask is not close enough to offer effective protection. The wearer may enhance the breathability by manually adjusting the folds of the face mask. However, this adjustment move may contaminate the face mask with the bacteria on the wearer's hand.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A major objective of the present invention is to provide a face mask that has a main piece in the front of the face mask with reduced number of folds so that an intact graphical pattern on the main piece may be presented. The main piece is positioned towards a lower portion of the face mask to enhance breathability while effective coverage and comfort of the face mask are preserved.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the objective, the face mask includes a main piece, a first upper bending section, a first upper piece, a second upper bending section, a second upper piece, a first lower bending section, a first lower piece, a second lower bending section, and a second lower piece. An upper portion of the main piece is bended backward at the first upper bending section and extended downward to form the first upper piece. The first upper piece is bended backward at the second upper bending section and extended upward to form the second upper piece. A lower portion of the main piece is bended backward at the first lower bending section and then extended upward to form the first lower piece. The first lower piece is bended backward at the second lower bending section and extended downward to form the second lower piece. The main piece has a main piece height, and the main piece has a first lateral line vertically dividing the main piece into two equal halves. The second upper piece has a second upper piece height. The second lower piece has a second lower piece height. A face mask height is defined as the distance between an upper edge of the second upper piece and a lower edge of the second lower piece. The face mask has a second lateral line vertically dividing the face mask into two equal halves. A vertical distance is between the first lateral line and the second lateral line, Relative to the face mask height, the main piece height is between 42% and 64%, the second upper piece height is between 42% and 48%, and the second lower piece height is between 31% and 39%. The first lateral line is below the second lateral line and the vertical distance, relative to the face mask height, is between 2% and 10%.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the large main piece, a printed graphical pattern thereon may be presented completely and more appealing. The main piece, without folds, also provides better breathability. As the first lateral line is below the second lateral line, the main piece is positioned correspondingly to a wearer's nose and mouth, further enhancing breathability. The asymmetric design with a higher second upper piece height and a shorter second lower piece height helps positioning the main piece right in front of the wearer's nose and mouth. The shorter second lower piece may still completely cover the wearer's chin. The face mask therefore can be expanded conveniently without sacrificing protection and comfort.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described above, the face mask therefore resolves the shortcomings of the conventional planar face masks where the multiple folds lead to broken graphical pattern, inferior breathability, and lesser degree of coverage.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing objectives and summary provide only a brief introduction to the present invention.

The first lateral line <b>11</b> is located lower than the second lateral line L, and the vertical distance D, relative to the face mask height T, is between 2% and 10%.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, a face mask of the present invention has the second upper piece <b>24</b>, the second upper bending section <b>23</b>, the first upper piece <b>22</b>, the first upper bending section <b>21</b>, the main piece <b>1</b>, the first lower bending section <b>31</b>, the first lower piece <b>32</b>, the second lower bending section <b>33</b>, and the second lower piece <b>34</b><i>a </i>edge-to-edge connected in this order into a single piece that is folded at the second upper bending section <b>23</b>, the first upper bending section <b>21</b>, the first lower bending section <b>31</b>, and the second lower bending section <b>33</b>. Each of these components of the face mask may be single-layered or multi-layered. The main piece <b>1</b>'s height A occupies the face mask height T's 42%&#x2dc;64%, meaning the main piece <b>1</b> constitutes a significant part of the front side of the face mask. Therefore, a graphic pattern <b>12</b> like logo or advertisement printed on the main piece <b>1</b> can be fully presented without being affected by the folds of the face mask, greatly enhancing the face mask's visual appealing. Basically the face mask includes the main piece <b>1</b> as one layer and the second upper piece <b>24</b> together with second lower piece <b>34</b> as another layer. After the lateral edges of all the pieces and sections are welded together, the first upper piece <b>22</b> and the second upper piece <b>24</b>, as well as the first lower piece <b>32</b> and the second lower piece <b>34</b>, can be easily expanded without being affected by the welding. The first upper piece <b>22</b>, the second upper piece <b>24</b>, the first lower piece <b>32</b>, and the second lower piece <b>34</b> also provide support to the main piece <b>1</b>, so that a greater breathing space <b>4</b> is formed there between, thereby enhancing the breathability of the face mask.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, as the location of a wearer's nose and mouth corresponds to a lower part of the face mask, the second upper piece height B is designed to be between 42% and 48% of the face mask height T, and the second lower piece height C is designed to be between 31% and 39% of the face mask height T. By having this asymmetric arrangement with the second upper piece height B greater than the second lower piece height C, the wearer's nose and mouth would be directly behind the main piece <b>1</b> after the face mask is expanded and worn to enhance breathability. In addition, the face mask may still adequately cover the wearer's chin to provide effective protection without. sacrificing comfort. Specifically, the first lateral line <b>11</b> of the main piece <b>1</b> is vertically below the second lateral line L of the face mask height T, and the vertical distance D relative to the face mask height T is between 2% and 10%. In other words, the distance from the upper edge of the second upper piece <b>24</b> (also the upper edge of the face mask) to the first lateral line <b>11</b> relative to the face ask height T is between 52% and 60%. The main piece <b>1</b>, without any fold, maximizes the breathability of the face mask.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a third embodiment of the present invention is structurally similar to the previous embodiments and the difference lies in that an upper portion of the second upper piece <b>24</b><i>a </i>is bended outward to form a third upper piece <b>241</b><i>a</i>, a lower portion of the second lower piece <b>34</b><i>a </i>is bended forward to form a third lower piece <b>341</b><i>a. </i>The third upper piece <b>241</b><i>a </i>and the third lower piece <b>341</b><i>a </i>make the upper and lower edges of the face mask clean, neat, and more appealing A nose clip may be embedded within or hidden by the third upper piece <b>241</b><i>a. </i>A gap <b>13</b><i>a </i>is formed between the second upper bending section <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the second lower bending section <b>33</b><i>a </i>whose height relative to the face mask height T is between 15% and 27%.
