description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to compositions useful in the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by eicosanoids and in particular to modified tick-derived compounds having leukotriene/hydroxyeicosanoid (LK/E) binding activity for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosanoids, and in particular LTB<sub>4</sub>.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Eicosanoids are a family of oxygenated biologically active lipid mediators that are derived from the 20-carbon fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) through three major enzymatic pathways: cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LO), and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450). Eicosanoids include prostanoids (including prostaglandins, PGs, and thromboxanes, TXBs) derived from COX pathway, leukotrienes (LKs) from LO pathway and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) from LO and P450 monooxygenase pathways (Curtis-Prior, 2004; Peters-Golden &#x26; Henderson Jr., 2007). Eicosanoids mediate numerous effects on diverse cell types and organs. These effects include regulation of vascular tone and permeability of capillaries and venules (PGs, TBXs, LKs), contraction or relaxation of muscle (PGs, TBXs, cysteinyl LKs), stimulation or inhibition of platelet function (TBXs, PGs, LKs), regulation of renal blood flow and mineral metabolism (Imig, 2000; Hao and Breyer, 2007), control of growth and or spread of malignant cells (Schwartz et al, 2005; Aya, 2006), and activation of leukocytes in particular in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (LKs, HETEs) (Samuelsson, 1983; Kim &#x26; Luster, 2007).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Leukotriene B4 (LTB<sub>4</sub>) is the most powerful chemotactic and chemokinetic eicosanoid described and promotes adhesion of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium via upregulation of integrins (Hoover et al, 1984). It is also a complete secretagogue for neutrophils, induces their aggregation and increases microvascular permeability. LTB<sub>4 </sub>recruits and activates natural killer cells, monocytes and eosinophils. It increases superoxide radical formation (Harrison and Murphy, 1995) and modulates gene expression including production of a number of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators which may augment and prolong tissue inflammation (Ford-Hutchinson, 1990; Showell et al., 1995). LTB<sub>4 </sub>also has roles in the induction and management of adaptive immune responses. For example regulation of dendritic cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes (Klaas et al, 2005; Del Prete et al, 2007), Th2 cytokine IL-13 production from lung T cells (Miyahara et al, 2006), recruitment of antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells (Taube et al, 2006) and activation and proliferation of human B lymphocytes (Yamaoka et al, 1989).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Leukotriene B<sub>4 </sub>(LTB<sub>4</sub>) and the hydroxyeicosanoids mediate their effects though the BLT1 and BLT2 G-protein coupled receptors (Yokomizo et al, 1997, 2000). Human BLT1 is a high affinity receptor (K<sub>D </sub>0.39-1.5 nM; Tager and Luster, 2003) specific for LTB<sub>4 </sub>with only 20-hydroxy LTB<sub>4 </sub>and 12-epi LTB<sub>4 </sub>able to displace LTB<sub>4 </sub>in competitive binding studies (Yokomizo et al., 2001). Human BLT2 has a 20-fold lower affinity (K<sub>D </sub>23 nM) for LTB<sub>4 </sub>than BLT1 and is activated by binding a broader range of eicosanoids including 12-epi LTB<sub>4</sub>, 20-hydroxy LTB<sub>4</sub>, 12(S)- and 15(S)-HETE and 12(S)- and 15(S)-HPETE (Yokomizo et al., 2001). Human BLT2 has 45.2 and 44.6% amino acid identity with human and mouse BLT1, while human and mouse BLT2 have 92.7% identity (Yokomizo et al, 2000).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Human BLT1 is mainly expressed on the surface of leukocytes, though it has recently been described in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. Human BLT2 is expressed in a broader range of tissue and cell types. A number of specific antagonists of BLT1 and BLT2 have been described which inhibit activation, extravasation and apoptosis of human neutrophils (Kim and Luster, 2007) and reduce symptoms caused by neutrophil infiltration in mouse models of inflammatory arthritis (Kim et al., 2006) and renal ischaemia reperfusion (Noiri et al., 2000). Increasing numbers of studies indicate that both BLT1 and BLT2 can mediate pathological effects through LTB<sub>4 </sub>and hydroxyeicosanoids (Lundeen et al., 2006), although BLT1 certainly has a dominant role in some pathologies such as collagen induced arthritis in mice (Shao et al, 2006). BLT1&#x2212;/&#x2212; deficient mice have also highlighted the importance of BLT1 in directing neutrophil migration in inflammatory responses. In particular, a 5LO deficient mouse strain was used to show autocrine activation of BLT1 on neutrophils is needed for their recruitment into arthritic joints (Chen et al., 2006).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Oxidised isomeric derivatives of LTB<sub>4 </sub>such as B4 isoleukotrienes are also biologically active (Harrison et al, 1995). As are the hydroxyeicosanoids, for example 5(S)-HETE is a highly potent chemoattractant for eosinophils (Powell and Rokach, 2005). The cysteinyl LKs, which are derived from LTA<sub>4</sub>, are correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including: bronchoconstriction caused by contraction of smooth muscle lining the airways; mucosal edema caused by vascular leakage; increased secretion of mucus; and the presence of an inflammatory-cell infiltrate that is rich in eosinophils (Bisgaard et al., 1985; Drazen et al., 1988).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A number of marketed drugs target the eicosanoids. These include the glucocorticoids which modulate phopholipase A2 (PLA<sub>2</sub>) and thereby inhibit release of the eicosanoid precursor AA (Sebaldt et al., 1990). Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) and other COX2 inhibitors which prevent synthesis of the PGs and TXBs (Curry et al., 2005). There are also a number of LK modifiers which either inhibit the 5-LO enzyme required for LTB<sub>4 </sub>synthesis (Zileuton; Dube et al., 1998), or antagonise the CysLT<sub>1 </sub>receptor that mediates the effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes (Zafirlukast and Montelukast) (Sharma and Mohammed, 2006). The LK modifiers are orally available and have been approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of e.g. asthma. No drug that acts specifically on LTB<sub>4 </sub>or its receptors has yet reached the market.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO2004/106369 describes a soft tick derived complement (C) inhibitor Coversin that inhibits both the classical, lectin and alternative complement pathways by direct binding to complement component C5 (Nunn et al, 2005). Coversin is derived from the salivary glands of haemotophagous arthropods. It has proven therapeutic potential (Hepburn et al, 2007). Coversin prevents complement (C)-mediated activation of C component 5 (C5) in a wide range of mammalian species including humans (Barratt-Due, A., et al. (2011) J. Immunol. 187, 4913-4919)). By binding directly to the CUB, C5d and C5-C345C C5 domains Coversin prevents cleavage of C5 by the C5 complement convertases, thereby preventing release of anaphylatoxin C5a and formation of C5b which nucleates formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) comprising complement components C5b-9 complex (see e.g. Jore et al. 2016). It has also been shown that Coversin binds to eicosanoids, in particular LKs, especially LTB<sub>4 </sub>(Roversi, P., et al., (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 2013, 288:18789-18802) enclosing then within the body of the protein. It is known that Coversin can bind LTB<sub>4 </sub>and C5 simultaneously, and the binding sites are located on opposite faces of Coversin, and the LTB<sub>4 </sub>binding pocket is fully accessible in the C5-Coversin complex (Jore et al. 2016).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It has been found that the Coversin polypeptide can be modified to reduce or remove its C5 binding activity (and hence its complement inhibitor activity) while retaining leukotriene/hydroxyeicosanoid (LK/E) binding activity (e.g. LTB4 binding activity). In particular, the present inventors have shown that modifying Coversin polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NO: 3 at specific residues can reduce or remove C5 binding.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention therefore relates to modified versions of Coversin polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NO: 3 which show reduced or no C5 binding but which bind to LK/E, and to polynucleotides encoding such modified Coversin polypeptides.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Such modified Coversin polypeptides, or polynucleotides encoding such modified Coversin polypeptides act as LK/E inhibitors and can be used in the prevention and treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by LK/E. It can be seen that these modified molecules will show reduced or no binding to C5 and as a consequence there will be reduced or no inhibition of the C5 convertase, and reduced or no interference with complement activity.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention also relates to the use of the modified Coversin polypeptides and encoding nucleotides of the invention in the treatment and prevention of diseases where leukotrienes, especially LTB<sub>4 </sub>and hydroxyeicosanoids are implicated in the pathology of the diseases. The modified Coversin polypeptides of the invention can bind to and cage LKs and hydroxyeicosanoids. This may prevent the ligands interacting with both the BLT1 and BLT2 receptors and ameliorate the proinflammatory effects of the fatty acids which have frequently been shown to depend on signaling through both receptors. Thus in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided the modified Coversin polypeptides and encoding nucleotides of the invention for the treatment of a disease or condition mediated by a leukotriene or hydroxyeicosanoid.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention may be used in the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by a leukotriene or hydroxyeicosanoid. Examples of diseases and disorders which can be treated in accordance with the present invention include contact hypersensitivity, ulcerative colitis, oesophygeal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, acne, aneurysm, periodontal disease, cystic fibrosis, asthma, and bronchiolitis.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further examples include lung and airways conditions preferably selected from Alpha-1 antitrypsin disease (AATD), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), idiopathic pulmonary disease (IPD), severe persistent asthma, exercise and aspirin induced asthma, allergic rhinitis, and silicosis; skin conditions preferably selected from autoimmune blistering diseases, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and Churg-Strauss Syndrome; cancers preferably selected from pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, oesophageal cancer, and cancer metastases; eye conditions such as autoimmune uveitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and others listed later in this application.

Deletions from other positions in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3 are also envisaged as forming part of the invention, if the resulting polypeptide retains the LK/E binding activity of the modified Coversin (e.g. as described herein in relation to the modified polypeptides) and has reduced or absent complement inhibitor activity (e.g. as described herein in relation to the modified polypeptides).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0197">The modified Coversin polypeptides of the invention may also be provided as a fusion protein comprising the modified Coversin polypeptide genetically or chemically fused to another peptide. A fusion protein may be obtained, for example, by cloning a polynucleotide encoding the modified Coversin polypeptide in frame to the coding sequences for a heterologous protein sequence. The term &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d;, when used herein, is intended to designate any polypeptide other than the modified Coversin polypeptide of the invention. Examples of heterologous sequences, that can be comprised in the soluble fusion proteins either at N- or at C-terminus, are the following: extracellular domains of membrane-bound protein, immunoglobulin constant regions (Fc region), PAS or XTEN or other similar unstructured polypeptides, multimerization domains, domains of extracellular proteins, signal sequences, export sequences, or sequences allowing purification by affinity chromatography. Many of these heterologous sequences are commercially available in expression plasmids since these sequences are commonly included in the fusion proteins in order to provide additional properties without significantly impairing the specific biological activity of the protein fused to them. Examples of such additional properties are a longer lasting half-life in body fluids (e.g. resulting from the addition of an Fc region or Pasylation (Schlapschy M, et al Protein Eng Des Sel. 2013 August; 26(8):489-501), the extracellular localization, or an easier purification procedure as allowed by a tag such as a histidine, GST, FLAG, avidin or HA tag. Fusion proteins may additionally contain linker sequences (e.g. 1-50, 2-30, 3-20, 5-10 amino acids in length), such that the components are separated by this linker.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0198">Fusion proteins are thus examples of proteins comprising modified Coversin polypeptides, and include by way of specific example a protein comprising a PAS sequence and a modified Coversin polypeptide sequence. PAS sequences are described e.g. in Schlapschy M, et al Protein Eng Des Sel. 2013 August; 26(8):489-501, and EP 08773567.6, with a PASylated Coversin molecule being described in Kuhn et al Bioconjugate Chem., 2016, 27 (10), pp 2359-2371. PASylation describes the genetic fusion of a protein with conformationally disordered polypeptide sequences composed of the amino acids Pro, Ala, and/or Ser. This is a technology developed by XL Protein (http://xl-protein.com/) and provides a simple way to attach a solvated random chain with large hydrodynamic volume to the protein to which it is fused. The polypeptide sequence adopts a bulky random coil structure. The size of the resulting fusion protein is thus much bigger than the protein to which it is fused. This has been shown to reduce clearance in biological systems. Appropriate PAS sequences are described in EP08773567.6, as well as the Schlapschy reference above. Any suitable PAS sequence may be used in the fusion protein. Examples include an amino acid sequence consisting of at least about 100 amino acid residues forming a random coil conformation and consisting of alanine, serine and proline residues (or consisting of proline and alanine residues). This may comprise a plurality of amino acid repeats, wherein said repeats consist of Ala, Ser, and Pro residues (or proline and alanine residues) and wherein no more than 6 consecutive amino acid residues are identical. Proline residues may constitute more than 4% and less than 40% of the amino acids of the sequence. The sequence may comprise an amino acid sequence selected from:</p><p id="p-0106" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="168pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;13)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>ASPAAPAPASPAAPAPSAPA;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;14)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>AAPASPAPAAPSAPAPAAPS;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;15)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>APSSPSPSAPSSPSPASPSS,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;16)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>SAPSSPSPSAPSSPSPASPS,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;17)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>SSPSAPSPSSPASPSPSSPA,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;18)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>AASPAAPSAPPAAASPAAPSAPPA</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>and</entry></row><row><entry/><entry> </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;19)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>ASAAAPAAASAAASAPSAAA</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>or circular permuted versions or multimers of these sequences as a whole or parts of these sequences.

For example, they may be glycosylated, pegylated, phosphorylated or comprise modified amino acid residues. Such modified polypeptides fall within the scope of the term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; used herein. In other embodiments the modified Coversin polypeptides of the invention are not chemically modified, e.g. post-translationally modified (e.g. not glycosylated, pegylated, phosphorylated).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0201">Modified Coversin polypeptides of the invention may be in a substantially isolated form. In the case when the polypeptides of the invention have been expressed in a host cell this may be that they have been separated from at least one component of the host cell and/or growth media in which it was expressed. It will be understood that the modified Coversin polypeptide may be mixed with carriers or diluents which will not interfere with the intended purpose of the polypeptide and still be regarded as substantially isolated. A polypeptide for use in the invention may also be in a substantially purified form, in which case it will generally comprise the polypeptide in a preparation in which more than 50%, e.g. more than 80%, 90%, 95% or 99%, by weight of the polypeptide in the preparation is a polypeptide of the invention. This may be determined, for example by electrophoresis or chromatography.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0202">The modified Coversin polypeptides may also be made synthetically or by recombinant means. For example, a recombinant Coversin polypeptide may be produced by transfecting mammalian, fungal, bacterial or insect cells in culture with an expression vector comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the modified Coversin polypeptide operably linked to suitable control sequences, culturing the cells, extracting and purifying the modified Coversin polypeptide produced by the cells. The polypeptides may also be modified following either synthetic or recombinant production. Polypeptides for use in the invention may also be produced using D-amino acids. In such cases the amino acids will be linked in reverse sequence in the C to N orientation. This is conventional in the art for producing such polypeptides.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0203">A number of side chain modifications are known in the art and may be made to the side chains of the modified Coversin polypeptides, provided that the modified Coversin polypeptides retain LK/E binding activity and exhibit reduced or absent complement inhibitor activity (e.g. complement C5 binding activity).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Polynucleotides</heading><p id="p-0112" num="0204">According to one aspect of the present invention, polynucleotides encoding the modified Coversin polypeptides of the invention are provided.

Background hybridization may occur, for example, because of other DNAs present in a DNA library. The signal level generated by the interaction between a polynucleotide of the invention and the coding sequence or complement of the coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 (or nucleotides 55 to 507 thereof) with the necessary changes to reflect the modifications made to SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3 in the modified Coversin polypeptides of the invention is typically at least 10 fold, preferably at least 100 fold, as intense as interactions between other polynucleotides and the coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 (or nucleotides 55 to 507 thereof).

Selective hybridisation may typically be achieved using conditions of medium to high stringency. However, such hybridisation may be carried out under any suitable conditions known in the art (see Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 1989).
