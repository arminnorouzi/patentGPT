Such a trimmer <b>1</b> generally includes a shaft <b>2</b> with a handle <b>4</b> toward one end and a motor housing <b>6</b> enclosing an electric motor <b>8</b> with a motor-driven output, or drive shaft, <b>5</b> for connection to a trimmer head <b>10</b> on the other end. Various powered trimmers (e.g., battery-powered, gas-powered, etc.) may be used with the trimmer head <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the illustrated trimmer head <b>10</b> includes a body <b>14</b> rotatable about an axis A (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) and supporting a spool <b>18</b> for retaining one or more lines (not shown). Line is wound around the spool <b>18</b> and extends through opposed eyelets <b>22</b> to cut vegetation (e.g., grass, weeds, etc.) The housing <b>14</b> includes a main body <b>30</b> drivingly connectable to the trimmer drive shaft <b>5</b> and a bottom plate <b>34</b> coupled to the spool <b>18</b>. The main body <b>30</b> and the bottom plate <b>34</b> cooperate to define a cavity <b>38</b> for the spool <b>18</b>. In the illustrated arrangement, the main body <b>30</b> and the bottom plate <b>34</b> are rotatably and axially fixed to the drive shaft <b>5</b>. The housing is coupled to a retainer <b>42</b> so as to capture the spool <b>18</b> therebetween. The spool <b>18</b> is fixed to the bottom plate <b>34</b> such that the retainer <b>42</b> is captured therebetween. More specifically, the spool <b>18</b> and the bottom plate <b>34</b> are rotatably and axially fixed to each other and are movable relative to the main body <b>30</b> and the retainer <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The main body <b>30</b> is generally cylindrical and includes a first end <b>30</b><i>a</i>, a second end <b>30</b><i>b </i>opposite the first end <b>30</b><i>a</i>, and a longitudinal axis <b>62</b> extending from the first end <b>30</b><i>a </i>to the second end <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The main body <b>30</b> additionally includes a sidewall <b>58</b> and a base wall <b>70</b>. The sidewall <b>58</b> defines a pair of eyelet openings <b>74</b> and a pair of retainer openings <b>78</b>. The eyelet openings <b>74</b> are shaped and sized to receive the eyelets <b>22</b>, and the retainer openings <b>78</b> are shaped and sized to receive at least a portion of the retainer <b>42</b>. The base wall <b>70</b> includes a center boss <b>82</b> having a connection member <b>84</b> for connection to the trimmer drive shaft <b>5</b>. A series of teeth <b>88</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) are positioned on an inner surface of the base wall <b>70</b> and are engageable with a corresponding series of teeth on the spool <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the main body <b>30</b> additionally includes one or more weighted plates <b>90</b>. Specifically, the weighted plates <b>90</b> are coupled to the base wall <b>70</b> of the main body <b>30</b>. The weighted plates <b>90</b> are coupled to the main body <b>30</b> adjacent to the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>, thereby adding weight to the trimmer head <b>10</b> at a location close to the rotational axis A of the trimmer head <b>10</b>. The plates <b>90</b> provide additional mass to the trimmer head <b>10</b>, thereby reducing vibration and imbalance of the trimmer head <b>10</b> as it rotates. For example, during operation of the trimmer head <b>10</b>, vibration may occur as a result of clearance between components of the trimmer head <b>10</b> (e.g., the main body <b>30</b>, the retainer <b>42</b>, the spool <b>18</b>, etc.). The weighted plates <b>90</b> add mass to the main body <b>30</b>, thereby reducing clearance between the components, minimizing vibration, and reducing the overall percentage of mass in the bottom plate <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The weighted plates <b>90</b> are generally rectangular and are composed of a metallic or other dense material (e.g., steel). However, the plates <b>90</b> may include alternative shapes and sizes and/or may be composed of alternative materials. For instance, in some embodiments, the plates <b>90</b> may be circular, triangular, or even annular in shape. In the illustrated embodiment, the plates <b>90</b> are illustrated on the trimmer head <b>10</b>, which is a housing mounted trimmer head. However, the plates <b>90</b> may additionally or alternatively be positioned on a housing of a spool mounted trimmer head. The plates <b>90</b> may be permanently or removably affixed to a component of the trimmer head <b>10</b> in a variety of ways. In some embodiments, the plates <b>90</b> may be affixed to the trimmer head <b>10</b> by an adhesive. In other embodiments, the plates <b>90</b> may be affixed to the trimmer head <b>10</b> by one or more screws, bolts, clips, or the like. In embodiments with removable plates <b>90</b> affixed with, for instance, a contact adhesive or clips, the trimmer head <b>10</b> may be balanced rotatably about the rotational axis A similar to what is done for automotive wheels. Such embodiments may be able to account for manufacturing variations of components of the trimmer head <b>10</b> and/or may allow the end use to change the location of the one or more plates <b>90</b> according to the end user's preferences.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the retainer <b>42</b> includes a ring <b>106</b> defining a central opening <b>110</b>. The retainer <b>42</b> includes a series of teeth <b>114</b> positioned on an upper surface of the ring <b>42</b>. The teeth <b>114</b> are engageable with corresponding teeth positioned on the spool <b>18</b>. Flexible retainer arms <b>122</b> extend from the ring <b>106</b>, each having a retainer member <b>126</b> engageable in the associated retainer openings <b>78</b> to connect the main body <b>30</b> and the retainer <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The bottom plate <b>34</b> is generally cylindrical and includes a center boss <b>46</b> with one or more connecting projections <b>48</b>. The bottom plate <b>34</b> includes an outer rim <b>54</b> and a main outer wall <b>52</b>. The outer rim <b>54</b> of the bottom plate <b>34</b> covers an end of the sidewall <b>58</b> of the main body <b>30</b> to enclose the cavity <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an edge <b>100</b> is formed on an outer surface of the bottom plate <b>34</b> at a junction between the outer rim <b>54</b> and the main outer wall <b>52</b>. More specifically, the edge <b>100</b> is generally chamfered.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The main outer wall <b>52</b> includes wear rings. The wear rings are generally circular and protrude from the main outer wall <b>52</b>. The wear rings are concentrically positioned on the main outer wall <b>52</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>62</b>. The bottom plate <b>34</b> additionally includes ribs protruding from the main outer wall <b>52</b>. The ribs include a thickness equal to the thickness of the wear rings.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As a user operates the string trimmer <b>1</b>, the trimmer head <b>10</b> may be bumped against a work surface. However, the angle at which the trimmer head <b>10</b> is oriented relative to the work surface as it is &#x201c;bumped&#x201d; depends on the height of the user. For example, typically the main outer wall <b>52</b> is oriented within a range of 0-45 degrees relative to the work surface as it is bumped against the work surface. The wear rings and chamfered edge <b>100</b> prevent damage to the housing <b>14</b> of the trimmer head <b>10</b>, regardless of the angle at which the main outer wall <b>52</b> is oriented relative to the work surface. Because the wear rings protrude from the main outer wall <b>52</b>, as the trimmer head <b>10</b> is bumped against the ground, the wear rings contact the work surface rather than the outer rim <b>54</b> or main outer wall <b>52</b>. As such, the bottom plate <b>34</b> is prevented from undergoing wear.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the spool <b>18</b> includes a central body <b>130</b> having an upper recess <b>164</b> and a lower recess <b>168</b>. The upper recess <b>164</b> slidingly receives the center boss <b>82</b> of the main body <b>30</b> and a biasing spring <b>170</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The biasing spring <b>170</b> is operable to bias the spool <b>18</b> downwardly away from the main body <b>30</b> to an initial position. The lower recess <b>168</b> includes a receptacle member <b>172</b> shaped and sized to interface with the connecting projections <b>48</b> of the bottom plate <b>34</b>, thereby coupling the spool <b>18</b> to the bottom plate <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The spool <b>18</b> also includes a first, upper flange <b>152</b> extending around the upper recess <b>164</b>, a second, lower flange <b>156</b> spaced apart from the lower recess <b>168</b>, and a third, intermediate flange <b>158</b> dividing the cavity <b>38</b> into upper- and lower-line receptacles. A first series of teeth are formed on the upper flange <b>152</b> and are selectively engageable with the teeth <b>88</b>&#x2032; on the main body <b>30</b>, and a second series of teeth are formed on the lower flange <b>156</b> and are selectively engageable with the teeth <b>114</b> on the retainer <b>42</b>. In the biased, initial position of the spool <b>18</b>, the second series of teeth engage the retainer teeth <b>114</b> to drivingly connect the spool <b>18</b> (and the bottom plate <b>34</b>) with the retainer <b>42</b> (and the main body <b>30</b> and the trimmer drive shaft <b>5</b>). The intermediate flange <b>158</b> defines a tube <b>176</b> for receiving the line. The tube <b>176</b> has opposing radial ends opening into the upper- and lower-line receptacles, respectively. In some embodiments, the spool <b>18</b> includes fewer or additional flanges. For example, in some embodiments, the spool <b>18</b> only includes the first flange <b>152</b> and the second flange <b>156</b>. In still further embodiments, the spool <b>18</b> may be constructed without flanges.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To install line, the end of the single line is fed in one eyelet <b>22</b>, into and through the tube <b>176</b>. The end of the line is then fed in the other eyelet <b>22</b>, such that an equal amount of line extends from each eyelet <b>22</b>. The line is centered and then wound onto the spool <b>18</b> (e.g., by turning the bottom plate <b>34</b> in a direction opposite to a feed direction) until sufficient line extends from each eyelet <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In operation, the trimmer <b>1</b> is operated to rotate the drive shaft <b>5</b> and, thereby, the main body <b>30</b> (along with the retainer <b>42</b>). In the biased, initial position, the second series of teeth engage the retainer teeth <b>114</b> to drivingly connect the spool <b>18</b>, and the bottom plate <b>34</b>, with the retainer <b>42</b> (and with the main body <b>30</b> and the trimmer drive shaft <b>5</b>). As a result, the spool <b>18</b> and the line are rotated so that the line cuts vegetation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the trimmer head <b>10</b> is being operated, the head <b>10</b> may experience vibration, especially as it is &#x201c;bumped&#x201d; against the work surface. Because the wear rings are positioned on the main outer wall <b>52</b> of the bottom plate <b>34</b>, the wear rings contact the work surface rather than the main outer wall <b>52</b>. Therefore, the housing <b>14</b> is protected from wear against the ground. In the event that the user bumps the trimmer head <b>10</b> against the ground at an angle (e.g., the main outer wall <b>52</b> is oriented at an angle relative to the work surface), the chamfered edge <b>100</b> of the bottom plate <b>34</b> contacts the work surface rather than the outer rim <b>54</b> and/or the main outer wall <b>52</b>, thereby protecting the housing <b>14</b> from wear.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Because the plates <b>90</b> are positioned on the base wall <b>70</b>, mass is added to the main body <b>30</b>, thereby reducing the impact of imbalances and vibration within the trimmer head <b>10</b>. Additionally, because the plates <b>90</b> are positioned adjacent to the rotational axis A, vibration is reduced within the trimmer head <b>10</b> while the head <b>10</b> is spinning. The additional mass on the main body <b>30</b> also reduces the overall percent of mass in the bottom cap <b>34</b> in comparison to the rest of the trimmer head <b>10</b>. Therefore, the mass is more evenly distributed within the trimmer head <b>10</b> in some embodiments. In other embodiments, the mass is distributed such that the trimmer head <b>10</b> is heavier near the connection point adjacent the drive shaft <b>5</b> and the base wall <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although aspects of the invention have been described in detail with reference to certain preferred constructions, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or more independent aspects of the invention as described.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
