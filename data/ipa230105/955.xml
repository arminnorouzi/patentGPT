Primary CNSL (PCNSL), an aggressive subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), is typically responsive to high dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), with overall response rates (ORR) of up to 74% in the upfront setting (Batchelor, T, et al., <i>J Clin Oncol, </i>21(6): p. 1044-9 (2003)). Still, prognosis is poor with 20-30% cured. Ferreri, A. J., <i>Blood </i>118(3): p. 510-22 (2011); Gavrilovic, I. T., et al., <i>J Clin Oncol </i>24(28): p. 4570-4 (2006)). Patients with disease of the bone marrow, testicles, paranasal sinuses, bone, retroperitoneal lymph nodes and epidural space as well as those with extranodal disease are at increased risk of development of secondary CNSL (SCNSL). SCNSL carries a poor prognosis with a median survival of 1-5 months. See Grier, J. and T. Batchelor, <i>Curr Oncol Rep, </i>7(1): p. 55-60 (2005).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">High-dose methotrexate (MTX)-based regimens are the standard treatment for CNSL. The optimal dosing of MTX for use in CNSL has not been well defined. MTX is predominantly cleared via renal excretion (70-90%) with contribution from the hepatic system via conversion of MTX to 7-hydroxymethotrexate. Between 2-12% of adults can sustain acute kidney injury as a result of HD-MTX. See Widemann, B. C., et al., <i>J Clin Oncol, </i>28(25): p. 3979-86 (2010). Acute kidney injury can in return result in delayed MTX clearance and toxic levels which can lead to systemic effects such as hepatic injury, pneumonitis, and bone marrow suppression. While these toxicities are uncommon (&#x3c;10%), the low incidence is due in part to MTX dose reduction (required in 14-44% of patients) or premature cessation of therapy (5-8% of patients) in the setting of MTX-related acute kidney injury. See Jahnke, K. et al., <i>Ann Oncol </i>16(3): p. 445-9 (2005).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is an urgent need for methods that reduce the nephrotoxic risks associated with high-dose methotrexate therapy (HD-MTX), particularly in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted healthcare as a limited resource, with elective inpatient admissions particularly problematic.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for treating central nervous system lymphoma in a subject in need thereof comprising (a) administering to the subject an effective amount of methotrexate; and (b) administering to the subject an amount of glucarpidase that is sufficient to reduce the level of methotrexate in the subject's serum by &#x3e;90%, wherein the glucarpidase is administered 10 to 48 hours following administration of methotrexate, and wherein steps (a)-(b) are performed for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more cycles.

The methods of the present technology reduce methotrexate (MTX) serum concentrations to levels that are considered non-problematic for systemic toxicities whilst maintaining MTX cerebrospinal fluid concentrations at therapeutic levels. Other studies have raised concerns regarding the emergence of glucarpidase neutralizing antibodies and their potential effects on glucarpidase activity in patients receiving the MTX/glucarpidase therapeutic regimen. See Adamson et al., <i>J. Clinical Oncology </i>10(8): 1359-1364 (1992). However, the present study shows that the emergence of glucarpidase antibodies in a subset of treated patients receiving repeated doses of glucarpidase did not appear to negatively impact the efficacy of the MTX/glucarpidase therapeutic regimen with respect to ameliorating CNS lymphoma. Indeed, the methods disclosed herein are capable of providing complete or near complete patient responses over a treatment regimen involving multiple MTX-rituximab administrations followed by glucarpidase within 12-48 hours.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein generally have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this technology belongs.

MTX penetrates the blood brain barrier when administered at high doses (&#x3e;1.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>) as a rapid infusion (Borsi, J. D. and P. J. Moe, <i>Cancer </i>1987. 60(1): p. 5-13 (1987); Shapiro, W. R., D. F. Young, and B. M. Mehta, <i>N Engl J Med, </i>293(4): p. 161-6 (1975)). A retrospective analysis of 357 patients suggested a statistically significant survival benefit with regimens that include doses 3 g/m<sup>2 </sup>(Reni, M., et al., <i>Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, </i>2001. 51(2): p. 419-25 (2001)) though doses up to 8 g/m<sup>2 </sup>are common in lymphoma management (Herrlinger, U., et al., <i>Ann Neurol, </i>51(2): p. 247-52 (2002); Illerhaus, G., et al., <i>J Clin Oncol, </i>24(24): p. 3865-70 (2006); Rubenstein, J. L., et al., <i>J Clin Oncol, </i>31(25): p. 3061-8 (2013); Illerhaus, G., et al., <i>Lancet Haematol, </i>3(8): p. e388-97 (2016)). The structure of MTX is provided below:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="24.98mm" wi="75.10mm" file="US20230000956A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">While MTX is generally well tolerated, patients with MTX toxicity, renal failure, and other side effects may require dose reduction and rarely, cessation of therapy. MTX is predominantly cleared via renal excretion (70-90%) with contribution from the hepatic system via conversion of MTX to 7-hydroxymethotrexate. Between 2-12% of adults can sustain acute kidney injury as a result of HD-MTX. See Widemann, B. C., et al., <i>J Clin Oncol, </i>28(25): p. 3979-86 (2010). MTX toxicity can sometimes be severe and fatal. MTX is a weak acid and most soluble at a lower pH. Precipitation of MTX in the renal tubules is a likely mechanism of nephrotoxicity (Garneau, A. P., J. Riopel, and P. Isenring, <i>N Engl J Med, </i>373(27): p. 2691-3 (2015)) though vasoconstriction and direct tubular toxicity may also play a role. To reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity, supportive care is pre-emptively provided to all patients in the form of hydration (volume expansion) and urinary alkalinization. As a result, HD-MTX is almost always administered in the inpatient setting with continuous intravenous hydration and frequent monitoring of urine pH and serum MTX levels. Patients are typically maintained on supportive hydration with regular monitoring until serum levels reach &#x2264;100 nmol, as measured by immunoassay. The half-life of IV MTX ranges between 8 and 12 hours and there is great inter- and intra-patient variability in clearance times. Treatments necessitate numerous hospitalizations of at least several days.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">As dosage and administration of MTX is limited by systemic toxicity, rescue therapies for this have been developed. Leucovorin, or folinic acid, is a rescue agent administered to protect against the toxic systemic effects of MTX, and is metabolized to 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, providing a source of reduced folates able to bypass the effects of MTX. Leucovorin is dosed beginning 24 to 36 hours after MTX administration. Delays longer than 48 hours post-MTX are associated with increased risk of severe toxicity (Bertino, J. R., <i>Semin Oncol, </i>4(2): p. 203-16 (1977)). Leucovorin competes with MTX for cellular uptake and for polyglutamylation intracellularly which enhances intracellular retention and affinity for target enzymes. Since it works by competitive inhibition, leucovorin is less effective when MTX levels are high. While leucovorin reduces the rate of toxic and fatal side effects of MTX, it does not eliminate the need for inpatient admission and close monitoring after MTX administration.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Glucarpidase</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0046">Glucarpidase or carboxypeptidase G2 (e.g., Voraxaze&#xae;) is a recombinant bacterial enzyme that cleaves serum MTX to inactive metabolites.

The approved dose is 50 units/kg which has been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in patients experiencing delayed MTX elimination as a result of renal impairment. At this dose, routine use of glucarpidase is cost-prohibitive. It is well-tolerated with fewer than 3% of patients reporting nausea, vomiting, hypotension, paresthesias, flushing, and headache. When MTX is cleaved, metabolites glutamate and 4-deoxy-4-amino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA) are formed. DAMPA is not cytotoxic and is eliminated primarily by the liver though data in non-human primates suggests urinary excretion also plays a role in clearance.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="76.45mm" wi="66.55mm" file="US20230000956A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0053" num="0048">Glucarpidase is derived from a bacterial source (<i>Pseudomonas </i>sp. (strain RS-16)) and is potentially immunogenic. The development of antibodies has been described in roughly 17% of patients who received first or second doses of glucarpidase (Ramsey, L. B., et al., <i>Oncologist </i>23(1): p. 52-61 (2018)). While the clinical significance of antibody development is not clear, there is the possibility that the formation of anti-glucarpidase antibodies would result in reduced glucarpidase efficacy for MTX cleavage and treatment of MTX toxicity. For example, EMEA Pre-authorisation Evaluation EMEA/CHMP/171907/2008 for use of glucarpidase in treating methotrexate toxicity noted that the antibody formation post glucarpidase was 37-43% in clinical studies and did not seem to be related to age or gender. In vitro data indicated that the antibodies may have some neutralising potency: serum from four of 22 patients with an antibody response inhibited glucarpidase enzymatic activity in vitro by 28-58%. As the anticipated use of glucarpidase in this scenario was one single dose, antibody formation was not considered a critical issue. However, the impact of the anti-glucarpidase antibodies on the efficacy of repeated administrations of low-dose glucarpidase for the purpose of MTX clearance is unknown.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0049">Currently, Voraxaze&#xae; is not indicated for patients with expected clearance of MTX or with normal or only mildly impaired renal function because of concerns that glucarpidase administration would result in subtherapeutic doses of MTX, thus reducing the efficacy of CNSL therapy. Glucarpidase is a large molecule at 83 kDa and has a volume of distribution of 3.6 L, comparable to plasma. The half-life of glucarpidase is between 6 and 9 hours, independent of renal function. Glucarpidase is not believed to cross the blood brain barrier or cellular membranes due to its size though this has not been definitively demonstrated given the paucity of clinical data.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0000">Formulations Including Methotrexate and/or Glucarpidase</p><p id="p-0056" num="0050">The pharmaceutical compositions of the present technology can be manufactured by methods well known in the art such as conventional granulating, mixing, dissolving, encapsulating, lyophilizing, or emulsifying processes, among others. Compositions may be produced in various forms, including granules, precipitates, or particulates, powders, including freeze dried, rotary dried or spray dried powders, amorphous powders, tablets, capsules, syrup, suppositories, injections, emulsions, elixirs, suspensions or solutions. Formulations may optionally contain solvents, diluents, and other liquid vehicles, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, pH modifiers, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. In certain embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are formulated for administration to a mammal, such as a human.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0051">Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, cyclodextrins, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0052">Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. Compositions formulated for parenteral administration may be injected by bolus injection or by timed push, or may be administered by continuous infusion.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0053">In order to prolong the effect of a compound(s) of the present disclosure, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0054">Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents such as phosphates or carbonates.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0055">Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0056">The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.

The effective amount may be determined during pre-clinical trials and clinical trials by methods familiar to physicians and clinicians. MTX or glucarpidase may be administered systemically or locally.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0058">MTX or glucarpidase can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions for administration, singly or in combination, to a subject for the treatment or prevention of a disease or condition disclosed herein. Such compositions typically include the active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; includes saline, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0059">Pharmaceutical compositions are typically formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intradermal, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous), oral, inhalation, transdermal (topical), intraocular, iontophoretic, and transmucosal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfate; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. For convenience of the patient or treating physician, the dosing formulation can be provided in a kit containing all necessary equipment (e.g., vials of drug, vials of diluent, syringes and needles) for a treatment course (e.g., 7 days of treatment).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0060">Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use can include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, CREMOPHOR EL&#x2122; (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, a composition for parenteral administration must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0061">The pharmaceutical compositions having MTX or glucarpidase can include a carrier, which can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thiomerasol, and the like. Glutathione and other antioxidants can be included to prevent oxidation. In many cases, it will be advantageous to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0062">Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, typical methods of preparation include vacuum drying and freeze drying, which can yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0063">Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0064">For administration by inhalation, the compounds can be delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or dispenser, which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.

For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. In one embodiment, transdermal administration may be performed by iontophoresis.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0066">A therapeutic agent can be formulated in a carrier system. The carrier can be a colloidal system. The colloidal system can be a liposome, a phospholipid bilayer vehicle. In one embodiment, the therapeutic agent is encapsulated in a liposome while maintaining the agent's structural integrity. One skilled in the art would appreciate that there are a variety of methods to prepare liposomes. (See Lichtenberg, et al., <i>Methods Biochem. Anal., </i>33:337-462 (1988); Anselem, et al., <i>Liposome Technology</i>, CRC Press (1993)). Liposomal formulations can delay clearance and increase cellular uptake (See Reddy, <i>Ann. Pharmacother., </i>34(7-8):915-923 (2000)). An active agent can also be loaded into a particle prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients including, but not limited to, soluble, insoluble, permeable, impermeable, biodegradable or gastroretentive polymers or liposomes. Such particles include, but are not limited to, nanoparticles, biodegradable nanoparticles, microparticles, biodegradable microparticles, nanospheres, biodegradable nanospheres, microspheres, biodegradable microspheres, capsules, emulsions, liposomes, micelles and viral vector systems.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0067">The carrier can also be a polymer, e.g., a biodegradable, biocompatible polymer matrix. In one embodiment, the therapeutic agent can be embedded in the polymer matrix, while maintaining the agent's structural integrity. The polymer may be natural, such as polypeptides, proteins or polysaccharides, or synthetic, such as poly &#x3b1;-hydroxy acids. Examples include carriers made of, e.g., collagen, fibronectin, elastin, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, polysaccharide, fibrin, gelatin, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the polymer is poly-lactic acid (PLA) or copoly lactic/glycolic acid (PGLA). The polymeric matrices can be prepared and isolated in a variety of forms and sizes, including microspheres and nanospheres. Polymer formulations can lead to prolonged duration of therapeutic effect. (See Reddy, <i>Ann. Pharmacother., </i>34(7-8):915-923 (2000)). A polymer formulation for human growth hormone (hGH) has been used in clinical trials.

In other embodiments, compounds can be administered in a local rather than systemic means, such as administration (e.g., by injection) at a tumor site.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0081">Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments of the methods disclosed herein, MTX can be administered prior to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), simultaneously with, or subsequent to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of glucarpidase to a patient with CNSL.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0082">In some embodiments, MTX and glucarpidase are administered to a patient, for example, a mammal, such as a human, in a sequence and within a time interval such that the two compositions act together to provide a greater benefit than if each composition were administered alone. For example, MTX and glucarpidase can be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time; however, if not administered at the same time, MTX and glucarpidase are administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect of the combination of the two compositions. In one embodiment, MTX and glucarpidase exert their effects at times which overlap. In some embodiments, MTX and glucarpidase are each administered as separate dosage forms, in any appropriate form and by any suitable route. In other embodiments, MTX and glucarpidase are administered simultaneously in a single dosage form.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0083">It will be appreciated that the frequency with which any of these therapeutic agents can be administered can be once or more than once over a period of about 2 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days, about 7 days, about 8 days, about 9 days, about 10 days, about 11 days, about 12 days, about 13 days, about 14 days, about 20 days, about 24 days, about 28 days, about a week, about 2 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 4 weeks, about a month, about every 2 months, about every 3 months, about every 4 months, about every 5 months, about every 6 months, about every 7 months, about every 8 months, about every 9 months, about every 10 months, about every 11 months, about every year, about every 2 years, about every 3 years, about every 4 years, or about every 5 years.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0084">For example, the MTX and glucarpidase regimen (MTX/glucarpidase regimen) may be administered weekly, biweekly (after every 2 weeks), or monthly for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more cycles. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, each cycle is a 14-day cycle, a 13-day cycle, a 12-day cycle, an 11-day cycle, a 10-day cycle, a 9-day cycle, an 8-day cycle, a 7-day cycle, a 6-day cycle, a 5-day cycle, a 4-day cycle, or a 3-day cycle.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0085">Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the MTX/glucarpidase regimen may be administered once a week followed by a particular period of non-treatment, or twice a week wherein the first dose of the MTX/glucarpidase regimen is followed by a particular period of non-treatment (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days) prior to administration of the second dose of the MTX/glucarpidase regimen. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the MTX and glucarpidase can be sequentially administered on the same day, followed by 6-27 days of non-treatment. In other embodiments, MTX is administered on day 1, glucarpidase is administered on any of day 2, day 3, day 4, or day 5, followed by 5-26 days of non-treatment.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0086">In some embodiments, individual doses of MTX and glucarpidase are administered within a time interval such that the two compositions can work together (e.g., within 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 5 days, 6 days, 1 week, or 2 weeks). In some embodiments, the treatment period during which the therapeutic agents are administered is then followed by a non-treatment period of a particular time duration, during which the therapeutic agents are not administered to the patient. This non-treatment period can then be followed by a series of subsequent treatment and non-treatment periods of the same or different frequencies for the same or different lengths of time. In some embodiments, the treatment and non-treatment periods are alternated. It will be understood that the period of treatment in cycling therapy may continue until the patient has achieved a complete response or a partial response, at which point the treatment may be stopped. Alternatively, the period of treatment in cycling therapy may continue until the patient has achieved a complete response or a partial response, at which point the period of treatment may continue for a particular number of cycles. In some embodiments, the length of the period of treatment may be a particular number of cycles, regardless of patient response. In some other embodiments, the length of the period of treatment may continue until the patient relapses.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0087">In some embodiments, MTX and glucarpidase are cyclically administered to a patient. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first agent (e.g., a first prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second agent and/or third agent (e.g., a second and/or third prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies, avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and/or improve the efficacy of the treatment.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0088">In some embodiments, MTX is administered for a particular length of time prior to administration of glucarpidase. For example, in a 21-day cycle, MTX may be administered on days 1 to 5, days 1 to 7, days 1 to 10, or days 1 to 14, and glucarpidase may be administered on days 6 to 21, days 8 to 21, days 11 to 21, or days 15 to 21. In other embodiments, glucarpidase is administered for a particular length of time prior to administration of MTX. For example, in a 21-day cycle, glucarpidase may be administered on days 1 to 5, days 1 to 7, days 1 to 10, or days 1 to 14, and MTX may be administered on days 6 to 21, days 8 to 21, days 11 to 21, or days 15 to 21.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0089">In one embodiment, the administration is on a dose schedule in which MTX is administered beginning on day 1, followed by glucarpidase about 4-96 hours (e.g., 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours,) after MTX administration (e.g., glucarpidase is administered on day 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 and MTX is administered on day 1 of the schedule), followed by 0-28 days of non-treatment.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0090">In some embodiments, MTX and glucarpidase are each administered at a dose and schedule typically used for that agent during monotherapy. In other embodiments, when MTX and glucarpidase are administered concomitantly, one or both of the agents can advantageously be administered at a lower dose than typically administered when the agent is used during monotherapy, such that the dose falls below the threshold that an adverse side effect is elicited.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0091">The therapeutically effective amounts or suitable dosages of MTX and glucarpidase in combination depends upon a number of factors, including the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated, the particular therapeutic composition, the route of administration and the age, weight, general health, and response of the individual patient. In certain embodiments, the suitable dose level is one that achieves a therapeutic response as measured by lymphoma regression or other standard measures of disease progression, progression free survival, or overall survival. In other embodiments, the suitable dose level is one that achieves this therapeutic response and also minimizes any side effects associated with the administration of the therapeutic agent.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0092">Suitable daily dosages of MTX can generally range, in single or divided or multiple doses, from about 10% to about 120% of its maximum tolerated dose. In certain embodiments, the suitable dosages of MTX are from about 20% to about 100% of its maximum tolerated dose. In other embodiments, the suitable dosages of MTX are from about 25% to about 90% of its maximum tolerated dose. In some embodiments, the suitable dosages of MTX are from about 30% to about 80% of its maximum tolerated dose. In other embodiments, the suitable dosages of MTX are from about 40% to about 75% of its maximum tolerated dose. In some embodiments, the suitable dosages of MTX are from about 45% to about 60% of its maximum tolerated dose. In other embodiments, suitable dosages of MTX are about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 100%, about 105%, about 110%, about 115%, or about 120% of its maximum tolerated dose.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0093">Suitable daily dosages of glucarpidase can generally range, in single or divided or multiple doses, from about 10% to about 120% of its maximum tolerated dose. In certain embodiments, the suitable dosages of glucarpidase are from about 20% to about 100% of its maximum tolerated dose. In some other embodiments, the suitable dosages of glucarpidase are from about 25% to about 90% of its maximum tolerated dose. In some other embodiments, the suitable dosages of glucarpidase are from about 30% to about 80% of its maximum tolerated dose.

The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are advantageous. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0095">The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds may be within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to determine useful doses in humans accurately. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0096">Typically, an effective amount of MTX or glucarpidase, sufficient for achieving a therapeutic or prophylactic effect, may range from about 0.000001 mg per kilogram body weight per day to about 10,000 mg per kilogram body weight per day. Suitably, the dosage ranges are from about 0.0001 mg per kilogram body weight per day to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day. For example dosages can be 1 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight every day, every two days or every three days or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg every week, every two weeks or every three weeks. In one embodiment, a single dosage of MTX or glucarpidase ranges from 0.001-10,000 micrograms per kg body weight. In one embodiment, MTX or glucarpidase concentrations in a carrier range from 0.2 to 2000 micrograms per delivered milliliter. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration once per day or once a week. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, or until the subject shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0097">In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a MTX or glucarpidase may be defined as a concentration of MTX or glucarpidase at the target tissue of 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>molar, e.g., approximately 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>molar. This concentration may be delivered by systemic doses of 0.001 to 100 mg/kg or equivalent dose by body surface area. The schedule of doses would be optimized to maintain the therapeutic concentration at the target tissue, such as by single daily or weekly administration, but also including continuous administration (e.g., parenteral infusion or transdermal application).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0098">The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to, the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic compositions described herein can include a single treatment or a series of treatments.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0099">The mammal treated in accordance with the present methods can be any mammal, including, for example, farm animals, such as sheep, pigs, cows, and horses; pet animals, such as dogs and cats; laboratory animals, such as rats, mice and rabbits.

Patients were enrolled into two cohorts with Cohort A receiving MTX 3 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and Cohort B receiving MTX 6 g/m<sup>2</sup>. Glucarpidase 2000 U or 1000 U was administered 24 hours following the initiation of MTX infusion. A cycle is typically 14&#xb1;7 days. In the present Example, rituximab was administered on Day 1, MTX on Day 2, glucarpidase Day 3, followed by an 11-day non-treatment period before the start of the next cycle.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0115">Serum was collected at pre-specified time points (e.g., pre-glucarpidase, 1 hour post glucarpidase administration, 6 hours post glucarpidase administration, 24 hours post glucarpidase administration, then every 24 hours until clearance) and concentrations of MTX and 2,4-diamino-N<sup>10</sup>-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA) were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected throughout treatment. Serum was collected for analysis of anti-glucarpidase antibodies. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the dosage regimen administered to subjects in Cohort A and Cohort B. Rituximab, MTX and glucarpidase were administered intravenously. Rituximab was always dosed at 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0116">Results: 8 patients were enrolled in the study. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the treatment regimen for each of the 8 enrolled patients. A total of 42 doses of MTX were collectively administered to the 8 patients (24 doses at 3 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and 24 doses at 6 g/m<sup>2</sup>). Patients collectively received 32 doses of glucarpidase 2000 U and 10 doses of glucarpidase 1000 U. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0117">Out of the 5 enrolled patients, administration of glucarpidase resulted in at least a 95% reduction in serum MTX levels within 15 minutes of administration in 23/24 doses (96%). A 93% decrease was seen with the remaining dose (2000 U). In 23/24 doses, MTX levels were reduced to less than 100 nmol/L within 15 minutes of glucarpidase. A transient increase in MTX levels above 100 nmol/L was seen following 8 of 24 doses (33%), typically around 24 hours after administration of glucarpidase (median elevation of MTX to 290 nmol/L; range 119-516 nmol/L). CSF methotrexate concentrations were evaluated in two patients and remained therapeutic following glucarpidase administration.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0118">End of treatment response was evaluated in two patients, one with complete response (CR) and one with near CR. Mid-treatment response was evaluated in two additional patients, one with partial response (PR) and one with stable disease (SD). One patient was not eligible for response assessment due to ongoing treatment. Three grade 3 adverse events were seen in two patients, which involved lung infection (<i>pneumocystis </i>pneumonia), sepsis related to central line infection, and decreased lymphocyte count. No grade 4 or 5 adverse events occurred. There were no adverse events associated with glucarpidase administration. The most common adverse events were hypoglycemia unlikely related to treatment (Holdhoff, M., et al., <i>Neurology, </i>83(3): p. 235-9 (2014), anemia and decreased lymphocyte count (Kansara, R., et al., <i>Am J Hematol, </i>90(12): p. 1149-54 (2015)). Analysis of anti-glucarpidase antibodies was to be determined at a later time point.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0119">Administration of low-dose glucarpidase 24 hours after MTX resulted in rapid reduction in serum MTX levels. In patients analyzed to date, CSF MTX levels remained therapeutic and clinical response was observed. Anti-glucarpidase antibody titer levels were obtained for two patients. The first patient exhibited detectable anti-glucarpidase antibodies, but was still responsive to the repeated doses of the MTX/glucarpidase regimen. The second patient did not develop any anti-glucarpidase antibodies and responded well to the MTX/glucarpidase regimen.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0120">These results demonstrate that the combination therapy methods of the present technology are useful in methods for treating CNS Lymphoma in a subject in need thereof.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 2: Extended Effects of Combination Therapy Methods of the Present Technology in CNS Lymphoma Patients</heading><p id="p-0128" num="0121">Methods. In a phase I dose-finding study of planned-use glucarpidase following HD-MTX, patients were treated with either MTX at 3 g/m<sup>2</sup>, 6 g/m<sup>2</sup>, or 8 g/m<sup>2</sup>. Glucarpidase was dose-reduced to 1000 U or 2000 U and given 24 hours after MTX. To date, 50 treatments have been administered across 12 patients. MTX levels following glucarpidase were determined via mass spectrometry as immunoassay fails to differentiate MTX from byproducts.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0122">Glucarpidase 1000 U (14 treatments) or 2000 U (36 treatments) resulted in at least a 95% reduction in serum MTX levels within 15 minutes following 49/50 doses. A 93% decrease was seen with the remaining dose (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Rebound in MTX levels was seen after 19/50 doses across 5 patients, most frequently 6 hours after glucarpidase. Rebound occurred following 11/14 doses of glucarpidase 1000 U reaching an average of 39% of starting MTX levels and 9/36 doses of glucarpidase 2000 U reaching an average of 18% of starting MTX levels. Glucarpidase was not detected in the CSF of 7 patients analyzed to date. Anti-glucarpidase antibodies were detected in 6 of 8 patients analyzed to date.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0123">Potentially cytotoxic MTX concentrations (10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M) were observed in CSF 25 hours (10/11) following MTX administration (1 hour after glucarpidase) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Radiographic responses are evaluable in 9 patients: 5 had a complete and 2 a partial response, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 78% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). One patient had stable disease, and one patient had progressive disease. The non-responding patient had multiple recurrences and failed three prior treatments. Glucarpidase has been well tolerated with only one grade 4 anaphylactic reaction and no grade 3 events. Based on these data, a dose of 2000 U was selected for future studies.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0124">These results demonstrate that low-dose glucarpidase is effective in reducing MTX levels &#x3e;95% and remains effective even after repeated doses and despite the formation of anti-glucarpidase antibodies. These results were unexpected given that previous studies have reported that such anti-glucarpidase antibodies can have neutralizing potency, and thus adversely impact glucarpidase enzymatic activity in patients receiving the MTX/glucarpidase therapeutic regimen. See Adamson et al., <i>J. Clinical Oncology </i>10(8): 1359-1364 (1992); EMEA Pre-authorisation Evaluation EMEA/CHMP/171907/2008. In fact, glucarpidase was not detected in the CSF of patients, and CSF MTX concentrations following glucarpidase remain at cytotoxic levels. Clinical response remained high with a response rate of 78%.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0125">Accordingly, these results demonstrate that the combination therapy methods of the present technology are useful in methods for treating CNS Lymphoma in a subject in need thereof.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 3: Feasibility of Outpatient HD-MTX Administration in Combination with Planned-Use Low-Dose Glucarpidase in CNS Lymphoma Patients</heading><p id="p-0133" num="0126">In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak in New York City.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0127">Elective procedures and admissions were canceled to create bed space for COVID-19 infected patients. To minimize face-to-face patient contact during HD-MTX treatment, the present study was amended to pilot the planned use of low-dose glucarpidase with outpatient HD-MTX administration. The study allowed for 10 single outpatient HD-MTX treatments. Eligible patients had normal renal function at baseline and had previously tolerated standard inpatient HD-MTX therapy. Patients were treated in outpatient chemotherapy infusion suites with MTX at 3.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, pre- and post-hydration on day 1. Patients returned the next day for additional IV hydration and glucarpidase 2000 U, then on day 3 for an MTX level by mass spectrometry. Triggers for hospitalization were defined by MTX levels and development of a grade &#x2265;3 creatinine elevation. To date, 7 outpatient HD-MTX treatments have been administered to 3 patients. In all cases, serum MTX levels were reduced to &#x3c;100 nmol/L at 48 hours. Hospital admission was not required after any treatment. Three treatments resulted in grade 1 AST/ALT elevation (2 patients).

Patients with active systemic disease are excluded because of the potential for glucarpidase to interfere with systemic therapy. Patients with baseline renal dysfunction are also excluded due to increased risk of MTX-related nephrotoxicity. All patients will be planned for 8 cycles of HD-MTX at a dose of 3.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>. Additional agents such as rituximab, vincristine, and procarbazine may be administered concurrently at the discretion of the treating physician and in accordance with standard of care.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0132">Treatment administration: On cycle day 1, patients will receive pre-hydration with D5W NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>over 4 hours, followed by MTX at 3.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, then an additional 2 hours of hydration. Glucarpidase 2000 U is administered 24 hours after MTX on day 2, along with additional hydration. Blood for MTX level is drawn on day 3 and processed by mass spectrometry. The first two cycles will be administered inpatient to ensure tolerability, the following six will occur outpatient. This study allows for physician's choice for consolidation therapy following completion of MTX therapy.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0133">Monitoring: Laboratory assessments including complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and urine pH are performed on days 1-3. MTX levels are assessed on days 2 and 3. MTX levels drawn within 48 hours following glucarpidase administration are processed by mass spectrometry. During outpatient cycles (3-8) patients check and record urine pH at home until MTX clearance is documented. If urine pH falls &#x3c;7.0, patients take additional oral sodium bicarbonate. Neuroimaging and CSF sampling will occur at baseline, after cycle 4, and at end of treatment. All patients will undergo assessment for adverse events which will be summarized based on the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. AEs will be reported and described in terms of incidence and severity. Response will be determined based on the IPCG guidelines for tumor response assessment. Prospective studies report overall response rate (ORR) to MTX-based therapy in 50-90% of treated patients. Based on this experience and the small sample size of this study, it is anticipated that 70% of the enrolled patients will show a response to therapy.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0134">CSF will be sampled in cycles 1 and 2, 6 hours and 1 hour following glucarpidase administration, respectively. CSF will be analyzed for MTX concentration and presence of glucarpidase. Collected data will be de-identified and stored in Medidata for analysis. CSF samples obtained throughout this study will be used to further correlate CSF MTX concentrations with response and survival metrics.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0135">Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) measures will be administered and semi-structured qualitative interviews will be performed with patients enrolled in the study of outpatient MTX in combination with glucarpidase. 12 additional patients will also be enrolled for standard of care HD-MTX in the inpatient setting to serve as contemporary controls. PROs will be assessed in all patients at baseline, mid-way through HD-MTX treatment (cycle 4), and at end of treatment. Patients will receive a battery of surveys to assess symptoms from CNSL, side effects related to treatment, psychological and emotional well-being during treatment, and time spent in contact with the health care system. The following metrics will be obtained</p><p id="p-0143" num="0136">(1) The FACT-CNS (version 5) a 39-item compilation of general questions divided into five domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, Functional Well-Being, and a CNS subscale. It is a supplement to the FACT-G, a scale well-validated in the oncology population, and is appropriate for use in adult patients with CNS malignancy. This measure is being obtained to capture physical and existential symptoms of disease throughout the treatment course;</p><p id="p-0144" num="0137">(2) PRO version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE): developed by the National Cancer Institute to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in patients on cancer clinical trials and serves as a companion to the CTCAE standard scale for AE reporting. It is included to capture side effects/toxicity from treatment;</p><p id="p-0145" num="0138">(3) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, a brief assessment validated in the cancer population that indicates presence or absence of anxiety/depression and correlates with severity;</p><p id="p-0146" num="0139">(4) the Temporal Aspects of Cancer Care survey is a 5 minute survey for use in the brain tumor population. It assesses quality of life and addresses how much patient time is spent in contact with the healthcare system. The total survey time is 35 minutes. Surveys will be administered during treatment. In the case of early termination of study participation, the end of treatment surveys will be obtained either in clinic or on the patient's own time.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0140">To supplement the PRO data, semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with both groups of patients. To understand patient experiences across the treatment trajectory, and assess change in perceptions over time, patients will participate in a total of three interviews: prior to treatment initiation, mid-way (cycle 4) and end of treatment. A separate semi-structured moderator's guide will be developed for each time point and will include flexibility for the moderator to ask follow-up questions (&#x201c;probes&#x201d;) to enable patients to elaborate. Interviews will attempt to capture impact of healthcare utilization and family burden, as well as elicit other themes. Interviews will last up to 30 minutes and will be audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0141">PRO Administration: PRO surveys will be administered to the 12 patients enrolled in the study for outpatient HD-MTX with glucarpidase. Additionally, consent will be obtained from 12 control patients with isolated CNSL who are receiving standard HD-MTX in the inpatient setting. Control patients will receive the same surveys at the same time points of treatment. After four interviews have been completed across all patients, a quality assurance review will be performed to evaluate concordance between interviewers.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0142">Chart surveys and patient interviews will be conducted at cycle 4 (mid-way) and at the end of treatment to determine unplanned points of contact with the healthcare system since treatment initiation. These assessments will capture unplanned hospital admissions, the number of admission days, unplanned emergency room or urgent care visits, and unplanned outpatient clinic visits to medical specialists of any kind and primary care providers. The number of hours spent in contact with the healthcare system (inpatient and outpatient) based on visit and admission check-in and check-out times will be tabulated. When not available, estimated times will be provided by patients.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0143">It is expected that outpatient HD-MTX in combination with glucarpidase is both safe and effective. These results will provide baseline information on PROs with standard CNSL treatment and standardize these metrics for future CNSL trials. In addition, it is anticipated that qualitative interviews will uncover new CNSL patient experience themes, which can be used to generate new items for future PROs</p><p id="p-0151" num="0144">Accordingly, these results demonstrate that the combination therapy methods of the present technology are useful in methods for treating CNS Lymphoma in a subject in need thereof.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">EQUIVALENTS</heading><p id="p-0152" num="0145">The present technology is not to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described in this application, which are intended as single illustrations of individual aspects of the present technology.
