The braking system of the vehicle has undergone several changes and improvements, from leather friction brake to drum and disc brakes, then to a mechanical anti-lock braking system, and then to an analog electronic anti-lock braking system with the development of electronics technologies. Research on a brake-by-wire (BBW) emerges in recent years.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The brake-by-wire includes an electro-hydraulic brake (EHB) and an electro-mechanical brake (EMB). The EHB, developed on the basis of a conventional hydraulic brake, operates by driving a hydraulic system via a motor. However, it is difficult to integrate the EHB with another electronic control system due to the difficulty of its hydraulic production and electronic control. In contrast, the EMB discards a hydraulic device and uses an electronic-mechanical system instead. The EMB has high respond speed, thus a braking distance is greatly shortened. In addition, the EMB has no hydraulic system and is therefore simplified and lightweight, facilitating integration of functions such as electronic parking, anti-lock, and brake force allocation. However, the EMB is insufficient in system security and reliability as it has no mechanical failure protection device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to resolve the safety and reliability problem of the EMB, a hybrid braking system based on hydraulic pressure and electronic machinery may be used. Still, the existing scheme can only use the conventional hydraulic brake for the front wheels and the EMB for the rear wheels. In this scheme, when the vehicle is in a normal working condition, because the front wheel retains the hydraulic brake, the braking system is still complex, with high costs while no full play to advantages of the EMB.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application provides a braking system, an assembly method, a braking method, and a vehicle, so that when a vehicle is in a normal working condition or a non-complete failure working condition, brake force is provided entirely by an electro-mechanical braking system, without depending on a hydraulic system. When the vehicle is in a complete failure working condition, brake force can be provided by the hydraulic system in a manner that a driver steps on a brake pedal.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, this application provides a braking system, which may include a pedal assembly, a hydraulic assembly, a reversing assembly, a driving wheel assembly, a pedal feel simulator, and a first electronic control unit (ECU). The pedal assembly is connected to an input push rod of the hydraulic assembly, and the first ECU is electrically connected to the reversing assembly, and controls the reversing assembly to switch a working location. The reversing assembly includes at least two working locations. When the reversing assembly is at a first working location, the braking system is in a complete failure working condition, and a brake fluid output port of the hydraulic assembly is connected to the driving wheel assembly through the reversing assembly. The input push rod generates displacement under action of the pedal assembly, so that a brake fluid in the hydraulic assembly flows into the driving wheel assembly, and the driving wheel assembly is driven by the brake fluid to provide brake force. When the reversing assembly is at a second working location, the braking system is in a normal working condition or a non-complete failure working condition, the brake fluid output port of the hydraulic assembly is connected to the pedal feel simulator through the reversing assembly. The pedal feel simulator is configured to generate feedback force of the pedal assembly, the first ECU is electrically connected to the driving wheel assembly, and controls the driving wheel assembly to provide brake force. It can be known from the first aspect that, in the normal working condition or the non-complete failure working condition, step motion of a brake pedal is entirely decoupled from establishment of brake torque. When a vehicle is in the normal working condition or the non-complete failure working condition, brake force is provided entirely by an electro-mechanical braking system, without depending on a hydraulic system. When the vehicle is in the complete failure working condition, brake force can be provided by the hydraulic system in a manner that a driver steps on the brake pedal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Optionally, with reference to the first aspect, in a first possible implementation, the driving wheel assembly includes a front wheel assembly and a rear wheel assembly. When the reversing assembly is at the first working location, the brake fluid output port of the hydraulic assembly is connected to the front wheel assembly through the reversing assembly. When the reversing assembly is at the second working location, the first ECU controls the front wheel assembly and the rear wheel assembly to provide brake force. It can be learned from the first possible implementation of the first aspect that, when the vehicle is in the normal working condition or the non-complete failure working condition, independent control of brake torque of four wheels is implemented through the electro-mechanical braking system. When the vehicle is in a complete failure condition, a hydraulic device is disposed on the front wheel assembly, so that the system establishes a mechanical-hydraulic connection relationship. Therefore, security is improved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, with reference to the first aspect, in a second possible implementation, the driving wheel assembly includes a front wheel assembly and a rear wheel assembly. When the reversing assembly is at the first working location, the brake fluid output port of the hydraulic assembly is connected to the rear wheel assembly through the reversing assembly. When the reversing assembly is at the second working location, the first ECU controls the front wheel assembly and the rear wheel assembly to provide brake force.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Optionally, with reference to the first aspect, in a third possible implementation, the driving wheel assembly includes a front wheel assembly and a rear wheel assembly. When the reversing assembly is at the first working location, the brake fluid output port of the hydraulic assembly is connected to the front wheel assembly and the rear wheel assembly through the reversing assembly. When the reversing assembly is at the second working location, the first ECU controls the front wheel assembly and the rear wheel assembly to provide brake force.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally, with reference to the first to the third possible implementations of the first aspect, in a fourth possible implementation, the reversing assembly is a two-position three-way reversing valve. It can be learned from the fourth possible implementation of the first aspect that, a specific reversing assembly is provided. This increases diversity of the solution.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, with reference to the fourth possible implementation of the first aspect, in a fifth possible implementation, the two-position three-way reversing valve includes one oil inlet and two oil outlets, and the brake fluid output port of the hydraulic assembly is connected to the oil inlet of the two-position three-way reversing valve. When the reversing assembly is at the first working location, one oil outlet of the two-position three-way reversing valve is connected to the driving wheel assembly. When the reversing assembly is at the second working location, the other oil outlet of the two-position three-way reversing valve is connected to the pedal feel simulator.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Optionally, with reference to the first to the fifth possible implementations of the first aspect, in a sixth possible implementation, the front wheel assembly may include two front wheels and a first electro-mechanical brake (EMB) brake actuator. The first EMB brake actuator is respectively mounted on each wheel of the two front wheels, and the first EMB brake actuator may include a brake wheel cylinder. When the reversing assembly is at the first working location, the brake fluid output port of the hydraulic assembly is connected to the brake wheel cylinder through the reversing assembly, and the input push rod generates displacement under action of the pedal assembly, so that a brake fluid in the hydraulic assembly flows into the brake wheel cylinder, and the brake wheel cylinder is driven by the brake fluid to provide brake force for two front wheels. It can be learned from the sixth possible implementation of the first aspect that: A specific structure of the front wheel assembly is given. In a complete failure condition, a driver may step on a brake pedal, and a liquid in a brake master cylinder may flow into the brake wheel cylinder of two front wheel assemblies, to establish a mechanical connection. In a complete failure condition, the driver steps on the brake pedal to generate enough brake force.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Optionally, with reference to the sixth possible implementation of the first aspect, in a seventh possible implementation, the rear wheel assembly may include two rear wheels and a second EMB brake actuator, and the second EMB brake actuator is respectively mounted on each wheel of the two rear wheels. When the reversing assembly is at the second working location, the first ECU sends an instruction to the first EMB brake actuator and the second EMB brake actuator based on a brake signal. The first EMB brake actuator provides brake force for the two front wheels according to the instruction. The second EMB brake actuator provides brake force for the two rear wheels according to the instruction, where the brake signal includes a displacement signal obtained by a pedal travel sensor of the pedal assembly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optionally, with reference to the first to the seventh possible implementations of the first aspect, in an eighth possible implementation, the hydraulic assembly includes a brake master cylinder in which a brake fluid is stored, and a cross-sectional area of the brake wheel cylinder is greater than that of the brake master cylinder. In this way, a cross-sectional area ratio (a cross-sectional area A<b>2</b> of the brake wheel cylinder/a cross-sectional area of a brake master cylinder A<b>1</b>) can be used to amplify the brake control force. This ensures that sufficient failure brake force is generated. Specifically, input force F<b>1</b>=area A<b>1</b>*pressure P, and output force F<b>2</b>=area A<b>2</b>*pressure P. The input force is the brake control force. When A<b>1</b> is reduced, larger pressure may be generated. Because a feature of hydraulic transmission is that pressure is equal everywhere, larger output force may be generated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, with reference to the first to the eighth possible implementations of the first aspect, in a ninth possible implementation, the rear wheel assembly includes two rear wheels and a second EMB brake actuator, and the second EMB brake actuator is respectively mounted on each wheel of the two rear wheels. When the reversing assembly is at the second working location, the first ECU sends the instruction to the first EMB brake actuator and the second EMB brake actuator based on the brake signal. The first EMB brake actuator provides brake force for the two front wheels according to the instruction. The second EMB brake actuator provides brake force for the two rear wheels according to the instruction, where the brake signal includes an instruction of an advanced driver assistant system (ADAS).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, with reference to the first to the ninth possible implementations of the first aspect, in a tenth possible implementation, the braking system further includes a first one-way valve and a second one-way valve. The first one-way valve is disposed on a pipe between the hydraulic assembly and the front wheel assembly, and a conduction direction of the first one-way valve is a direction from the front wheel assembly to the hydraulic assembly. The second one-way valve is disposed on a pipe between the hydraulic assembly and the pedal feel simulator, and a conduction direction of the second one-way valve is a direction from the pedal feel simulator to the hydraulic assembly. It can be known from the tenth possible implementation of the first aspect that, when the brake pedal is released, the one-way valve may assist the system in quickly releasing pressure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a second aspect, this application provides a braking method, where a first electronic control unit (ECU) obtains a brake signal, and the first ECU controls, based on the brake signal, a reversing assembly to switch a working location. When the reversing assembly is at a first working location, a brake fluid output port of the hydraulic assembly is connected to a driving wheel assembly through the reversing assembly. When the reversing assembly is at a second working location, the brake fluid output port of the hydraulic assembly is connected to the pedal feel simulator through the reversing assembly, and the first ECU controls the driving wheel assembly to provide brake force. It can be learned from the second aspect that the first ECU controls switching of the working location of the reversing assembly, so as to implement switching of a brake source in different working conditions. Specifically, when the system is in a power-on state, that is, when the system is in a normal working condition or a non-complete failure working condition, the first ECU controls the reversing assembly to be at the second working location, and the system adopts electro-mechanical brake. When the system is in a power-off state, that is, when the system is in a complete failure working condition, the system adopts hydraulic brake.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Optionally, with reference to the second aspect, in a first possible implementation, that a first electronic control unit (ECU) obtains a brake signal includes: The first ECU receives a displacement signal obtained by a pedal travel sensor of a pedal assembly.

In a normal working condition or a non-complete failure condition, electro-mechanical brake-by-wire is implemented based on one controller and four EMB brake actuators, and no hydraulic system is required for force transfer. A controller is also referred to as an electronic control unit (ECU) in some scenarios. The non-complete failure working condition means that the system is degraded due to a fault, but does not entirely lose a working capability. For example, a threshold may be generally set. For example, when the threshold is set to 0.5 g, a deceleration capability is greater than the threshold, that is, the non-complete failure working condition. When the deceleration capability is less than the threshold, it is considered as a complete failure working condition. In the complete failure working condition, a driver may step on a brake pedal, and a front wheel hydraulic assembly provides brake force, to ensure basic safety and meet a regulatory requirement. The following describes a structure of a braking system provided in an embodiment of this application from a perspective of a scenario with reference to the normal working condition and the complete failure working condition. It should be noted that a system working principle in a scenario of the non-complete failure working condition is the same as a system working principle in the normal working condition. For understanding, refer to the working principle in the normal working condition.

The first EMB brake actuator <b>402</b> may include a second ECU <b>4021</b>, a motor <b>4022</b>, a planetary gear mechanism <b>4023</b>, a ball screw mechanism <b>4024</b>, a brake wheel cylinder <b>4025</b>, a brake housing <b>4026</b>, a sealing ring <b>4027</b>, an oil inlet <b>4028</b>, a friction plate <b>4029</b> and a brake disc <b>5030</b>. The planetary gear mechanism <b>4023</b> and the ball screw mechanism <b>4024</b> may also be referred to as a transmission mechanism. The planetary gear mechanism <b>4023</b>, the ball screw mechanism <b>4024</b>, the brake wheel cylinder <b>4025</b>, the friction plate <b>4029</b>, and the brake disc <b>4030</b> are all accommodated in the brake housing <b>4026</b>, and the transmission mechanism is integrated in the brake wheel cylinder <b>4025</b>. The oil inlet <b>4028</b> is connected to a brake oil pipe, that is, connected to the first EMB brake actuator <b>402</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. When a reversing assembly is at a first working location, a vehicle is in a complete failure working condition, and a driver steps on a pedal, so that a brake fluid in the hydraulic assembly enters the brake wheel cylinder <b>4025</b> through the oil inlet <b>4028</b>. The sealing ring <b>4027</b> is configured to prevent oil leakage from a gap between the brake wheel cylinder <b>4025</b> and the brake housing <b>4026</b>. Driven by the brake fluid, the brake wheel cylinder <b>4025</b> presses the friction plate <b>4029</b> and the brake disc <b>4030</b> tightly. This implements brake through friction between the friction plate <b>4029</b> and the brake disc <b>4030</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a specific implementation, a cross-sectional area of the brake wheel cylinder <b>4025</b> is greater than a cross-sectional area of the brake master cylinder <b>202</b>. In this way, a cross-sectional area ratio (a cross-sectional area A<b>2</b> of the brake wheel cylinder/a cross-sectional area of a brake master cylinder A<b>1</b>) can be used to amplify the brake control force. This ensures that sufficient failure brake force is generated. Specifically, input force F<b>1</b>=area A<b>1</b>*pressure P. and output force F<b>2</b>=area A<b>2</b>*pressure P. The input force is the brake control force. When A<b>1</b> is reduced, larger pressure may be generated. Because a feature of hydraulic transmission is that pressure is equal everywhere, larger output force may be generated.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A location relationship among the second ECU <b>4021</b>, the motor <b>4022</b>, the planetary gear mechanism <b>4023</b>, and the ball screw mechanism <b>4024</b>, and a location relationship between the friction plate <b>4029</b> and the brake disc <b>4030</b> are the conventional technology. This is not specifically limited in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the reversing assembly is at a second working location, when a vehicle is in a normal working condition or a non-complete failure working condition, the input push rod generates displacement under action of the pedal assembly, so that a brake fluid in the hydraulic assembly flows into the pedal feel simulator <b>6</b>. The pedal feel simulator is used to generate feedback force of the pedal assembly. Brake pedal feeling refers to feedback of the pedal to a driver's foot during a brake process. A brake-by-wire system cancels the conventional hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical force transmission mechanisms, so that pedal displacement and pressure greatly differ from those of the conventional braking system under a same brake working condition. In this case, it is difficult for the driver to feel and control. Therefore, the pedal feel simulator <b>6</b> needs to be additionally disposed to simulate a special effect of the brake pedal, so that the driver may have a good feel of control during the brake process and accurately master a magnitude of applied brake force.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first ECU <b>7</b> controls, according to an obtained brake signal, the front wheel assembly <b>4</b> and the rear wheel assembly <b>5</b> to provide brake force. In a specific implementation, the brake signal may include a displacement signal obtained by the pedal travel sensor <b>102</b>. In a specific implementation, for example, in an intelligent driving scenario, the brake signal may further include an instruction of an upper-layer advanced driver assistant system (ADAS). The ADAS includes driver assistant functions such as a pre-collision security function, an adaptive cruise control function, and a lane keeping assistant function. These driver assistant functions are constructed in a same vehicle to help the driver avoid a collision, follow a vehicle ahead, or keep own vehicle in its lane. In a specific implementation, the brake signal may alternatively be other information related to a vehicle status. For example, the brake signal may alternatively be a steering wheel angle, a wheel speed signal, longitudinal acceleration (a driving direction of the vehicle at a current moment is a longitudinal direction), transverse acceleration, or drive motor torque.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The rear wheel assembly <b>5</b> includes two rear wheels <b>501</b> and a second EMB brake actuator <b>502</b>.

For example, a threshold may be generally set. For example, when the threshold is set to 0.5 g, the deceleration capability is greater than the threshold, that is, a non-complete failure working condition. When the first ECU determines that deceleration capability is greater than 0.5 g based on the brake signal, the first ECU controls the reversing assembly to switch to the second working location, to adopt EMB brake. When the deceleration capability is less than the threshold, it is considered as a complete failure working condition. When the first ECU determines that deceleration capability is less than 0.5 g based on the brake signal, the first ECU controls the reversing assembly to switch to the first working location. In the complete failure working condition, a driver may step on a brake pedal, and a front wheel hydraulic assembly provides brake force, to ensure basic safety and meet a regulatory requirement.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">How the first ECU <b>7</b> controls the EMB actuator to work is the conventional technology. To better understand the technical solutions provided in this application, the following provides descriptions with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a brake control method according to an embodiment of this application. The first ECU <b>7</b> may perform processing based on the brake signal mentioned above, to calculate brake force required by a vehicle. Specifically, the brake signal may include an instruction of an upper-layer ADAS, a signal obtained by the pedal travel sensor <b>102</b>, a steering wheel angle, a wheel speed signal, longitudinal acceleration, transverse acceleration, and the like. In addition, the brake signal may further include some other wheel status information, for example, drive motor torque. After determining the brake force required by the vehicle, the first ECU allocates the brake force, and sends control instructions to second ECU and third ECU in EMB brake actuators of four wheels, to implement independent control of brake torques of the four wheels. To implement more flexible control of an intelligent vehicle, the use of independent electro-mechanical actuators of the four wheels can better meet needs of a future vehicle. The brake force allocation may include energy recovery control, and coordinated allocation of EMB friction brake force and motor feedback brake force. The EMB friction brake force is friction force generated when a motor of the EMB actuator works and pushes a friction plate to clamp a brake disc. The motor feedback brake force obtained through brake force allocation is motor brake force that may be generated when a new energy vehicle is started through a drive motor of the vehicle, and may implement motor feedback brake through a vehicle control unit (VCU) or a drive motor control unit (MCU). A new energy vehicle such as a pure electric vehicle or a hybrid vehicle is generally equipped with a drive motor and a power battery. When the vehicle brakes, the motor may work in a feedback brake mode required by an electric generator to charge the battery, so as to recycle brake energy that is originally dissipated by friction of a brake pad. In this way, energy efficiency is improved. Energy recovery control refers to coordinated allocation of the EMB friction brake force and motor feedback brake force.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The first ECU <b>7</b> is also responsible for failure security management. When four EMB actuators are faulty (for example, EMB actuators of one or two wheels cannot work properly), the system is degraded and enters a limp home mode. The remaining EMB actuators are used to implement brake-by-wire. When the system entirely fails, the first ECU <b>7</b> controls a two-position three-way valve to change a working location, closes a loop of the pedal feel simulator <b>6</b> that simulates hydraulic characteristics, and opens a backup hydraulic loop of the EMB actuator of the front wheel to ensure a sufficient deceleration capability when the system fails.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">According to the braking system provided in this application, in a normal working condition, step motion of the brake pedal is entirely decoupled from establishment of brake torque. A hydraulic system is only used to generate pedal feedback force, and actual brake torque is established by the EMB actuator. This makes full use of all the advantages of the electro-mechanical braking system. In a complete failure working condition, the driver can step on the brake pedal, so that a liquid in a brake master cylinder may flow into brake wheel cylinders of two front wheel EMB actuators to establish a mechanical connection. In the complete failure working condition, the driver can step on the brake pedal to generate enough brake force.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an embodiment of this application further provides an assembly method.
