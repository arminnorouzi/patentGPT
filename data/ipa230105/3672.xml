It relates to a device and method for measuring angles of orientation of an x-ray imaging system comprising an x-ray source, an x-ray detector and a sample holder arranged to receive a sample to be analysed, the sample holder being placed between the x-ray source and the x-ray detector.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention particularly applies to x-ray imaging systems used for controlling single crystal parts by the Laue method. Such a system is based on the study of a diffraction pattern generated on the sensor by the diffraction of a polychromatic x-ray beam during its passage through a single crystal part. In particular, the shape and the position of the spots constituting the diffraction pattern may be compared with those of a reference set of diffraction patterns, in such a way as to determine the crystal orientation of the single crystal part. Nevertheless, the invention applies to any x-ray imaging system comprising an x-ray source and an x-ray detector of which it is desired to determine the alignment in relation to a sample to be imaged.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In any x-ray imaging system, the correct alignment of its various optical elements is necessary for obtaining a desired image resolution. At the very least, the orientation of the optical elements in relation to the optical axis of the system must be known with a sufficient accuracy to make it possible to reconstruct the image with the desired resolution. Most of the techniques that make it possible to determine the alignment of an x-ray imaging system require the use of dedicated equipment, rendered unnecessary during the operational image acquisition phase. By way of example, laser pointer systems may be used, such as described in B. Fay, J. Trotel and A. Frichet, Optical alignment for submicrons x-ray lithography, Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The alignment systems may also be based on the use of ghosts specially designed for this task. A ghost is placed on the path of the x-ray beam, between the radiation source and the detector. In so far as the dimensions and the absorption properties of the ghost are known, the image generated by the detector makes it possible to know the relative position of the radiation source, of the ghost and of the detector. The main drawback of this technique is that the alignment of the imaging system is determined with a limited accuracy by the spatial resolution of the detector.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The U.S. Pat. No. 6,453,006 B1 describes techniques for calibration and alignment of x-ray reflectometric systems comprising an x-ray source, a reflector, a sample to be tested and a detector. It particularly describes a method for aligning the reflector with the x-ray source consisting in disposing a fine wire between these elements to generate a shadow and in orienting the reflector so as to obtain the smallest possible width of the shadow. Here again, the accuracy of the alignment is limited by the spatial resolution of the detector.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The aforementioned solutions for aligning the optical elements of an x-ray imaging system therefore do not give entire satisfaction. A first aim of the invention is to propose a technique to make it possible to align an x-ray imaging system that only requires a limited number of optical elements in addition to those useful for the phase for measuring a sample. A second aim of the invention is to propose a technique making it possible to obtain a better accuracy of the alignment, in particular greater than the resolution of the x-ray detector of the imaging system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To this end, the invention is based on the use of the Laue method. This method is used not to study the crystal structure of a sample, but to determine the orientation of the optical elements of an x-ray imaging system with the aid of a reference sample the crystal structure and the orientation of which are known. The method according to the invention comprises installing the reference sample on a sample holder, emitting an x-ray beam passing through the reference sample and forming a diffraction pattern on a detector of the x-ray imaging system, generating an image comprising the diffraction pattern, and determining the orientation of the x-ray beam and that of the detector by comparing the diffraction pattern obtained with at least one target image including a diffraction pattern corresponding to known orientations of the x-ray beam and of the detector.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">More specifically, the object of the invention is a method for measuring angles of orientation of an x-ray imaging system, the x-ray imaging system comprising an x-ray source, an x-ray detector and a sample holder arranged to receive a sample to be analysed. The x-ray imaging system is arranged so that the x-ray source can emit a polychromatic x-ray beam along a main axis of propagation passing through the sample to be analysed and reaching a sensing area of the x-ray detector. An optical axis of the x-ray imaging system is defined between a centre of emission of the x-ray source and the x-ray detector.

It defines, with a second axis, denoted Y, and a third axis, denoted Z, a direct orthogonal mark XYZ. The plane passing through the axes X and Y is denoted &#x201c;plane XY&#x201d;; the plane passing through the axes X and Z is called &#x201c;plane XZ&#x201d;; and the plane passing through the axes Y and Z is called &#x201c;plane YZ&#x201d;. In addition to passing through the centre of emission of the x-ray source, the optical axis X may pass though the centre of the x-ray detector or close to this point.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">The x-ray source typically emits an x-ray beam of conical shape along a main axis of propagation X<sub>s</sub>, the centre of emission of the x-ray source corresponding to the top of the cone and the main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>corresponding to the axis of the cone. The main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>forms an angle &#x3be;<sub>xy </sub>with the optical axis X in the plane XY, that is to say by rotation about the axis Z, and an angle with the optical axis X in the plane XZ, that is to say by rotation about the axis Y.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">The x-ray detector may comprise a set of sensing elements disposed in a plane Y<sub>d</sub>Z<sub>d </sub>substantially orthogonal to the optical axis X. The orientation of the x-ray detector is defined in a direct orthogonal mark X<sub>d</sub>Y<sub>d</sub>Z<sub>d</sub>. The mark X<sub>d</sub>Y<sub>d</sub>Z<sub>d </sub>forms, in relation to the mark XYZ, an angle &#x3b1; by rotation about the axis Z, an angle &#x3b2; by rotation about the axis Y and an angle &#x3b3; by rotation about the axis X. It should be noted that the x-ray detector may also comprise a set of sensing elements disposed linearly along an axis Y<sub>d </sub>or Z<sub>d </sub>and displaced linearly along an orthogonal axis Z<sub>d </sub>or Y<sub>d</sub>, respectively, in order to reconstitute the plane Y<sub>d</sub>Z<sub>d</sub>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">According to a first embodiment, the step of determining the orientation of the main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>and the orientation of the sensing area of the x-ray detector comprises comparing the observed image with a set of target images, each target image showing a diffraction pattern for a preset orientation of the main axis of propagation and a preset orientation of the sensing area of the x-ray detector, said orientations being different for each target image.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">The orientation of the main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>and that of the sensing area of the x-ray detector may particularly correspond to the respective orientations for the target image the diffraction pattern of which is the most similar to the diffraction pattern of the observed image. The criterion of similarity between the diffraction pattern of the target image and the diffraction pattern of the observed image comprises for example an average distance between each spot in the observed image and the corresponding spot in the target image.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">According to a second embodiment, the step of determining the orientation of the main axis of propagation and the orientation of the sensing area of the x-ray detector comprises the substeps of:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0019">determining a similarity parameter representative of a degree of similarity between the diffraction pattern of the observed image and the diffraction pattern of a current target image for a given orientation of the main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>and a given orientation of the sensing area of the x-ray detector,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0020">comparing the similarity parameter with a similarity threshold,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0021">when the similarity parameter is less than the similarity threshold, identifying the given orientation of the main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>and the given orientation of the sensing area of the x-ray detector as effective orientations of the main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>and of the sensing area of the x-ray detector,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0022">when the similarity parameter is greater than or equal to the similarity threshold, generating a new current target image, at least one of the given orientations for the current target image being different from the corresponding given orientation for the preceding target image, and reiterating the preceding substeps until the similarity parameter is less than the similarity threshold.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0023">Each target image may be determined by a digital modelling of the diffraction generated by the reference sample installed on the sample holder, for a given orientation of the main axis of propagation and a given orientation of the sensing area of the x-ray detector. Laue diffraction modelling software may be used for this purpose. The Laue diffraction modelling software is for example the PyMicro software, developed by Henry Proudhon. This software is based on VTK and python libraries.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0024">The method for measuring angles of orientation of an x-ray imaging system may further comprise, prior to the step of emitting the x-ray beam, a step of installing the reference sample on the sample holder.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0025">The sample holder may include a support surface to receive alternately the sample to be analysed or the reference sample. The support surface may define, by convention, a reference plane. This reference plane may be the plane XZ.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0026">The reference sample may be formed in a single crystal material, for example a single crystal silicon. It is preferably placed on the sample holder so that one of its crystal surfaces is parallel to the plane YZ.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0027">Another object of the invention is a device for measuring angles of orientation of an x-ray imaging system, the x-ray imaging system comprising an x-ray source, an x-ray detector and a sample holder arranged to receive a sample to be analysed.

An optical axis of the x-ray imaging system is defined between a centre of the x-ray source and the x-ray detector. The device comprises a processing unit configured to:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0028">emit, by the x-ray source, a polychromatic x-ray beam along the main axis of propagation, so that the x-ray beam passes through a reference sample installed on the sample holder and forms a diffraction pattern on the sensing area of the x-ray detector,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0029">generate, with the x-ray detector, an observed image, the observed image comprising the diffraction pattern, and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0030">determine the orientation of the main axis of propagation and the orientation of the sensing area of the x-ray detector by comparing the observed image with at least one target image, the target image including a diffraction pattern obtained for the reference sample with a preset orientation of the main axis of propagation and a preset orientation of the sensing area of the x-ray detector.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0022" num="0031">The device may in addition include a first diaphragm placed upstream of the sample holder, and arranged to limit a transverse area of the x-ray beam. The transverse area is defined in the plane YZ. The limitation of the transverse area makes it possible to ensure that the entire x-ray beam reaching the x-ray detector has indeed passed through the reference sample. Thus, the first diaphragm may include an opening the dimensions of which in the plane YZ are smaller than the corresponding dimensions of the reference sample.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0032">The device for measuring angles of orientation of an x-ray imaging system may further include a second diaphragm and/or a collimator placed between the x-ray source and the first diaphragm, arranged to obtain a collimated x-ray beam at the sample holder. The second diaphragm and/or the collimator is particularly of interest when the distance between the x-ray source and the x-ray detector is greater than or equal to 30 cm.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0033">According to a particular embodiment, the device further comprises a shutter element placed downstream of the sample holder, and arranged to prevent a portion of the beam having passed through the reference sample without being diffracted, from reaching the sensing area of the x-ray detector. The shutter element thus makes it possible to form, on the x-ray detector, an image only comprising the diffraction pattern, and not the transmitted portion of the x-ray beam. The intensity range of the x-ray beam received is then reduced by comparing the case where the transmitted portion of the x-ray beam is also received by the detector. The result is a greater dynamic of the observed intensities of the spots (for the sampling), and therefore a limitation of the electronic noise and a better resolution for measuring the intensity of the image.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0034">The shutter element is formed in an x-ray opaque material. It is for example made of lead.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0035">In the presence of the first diaphragm, the shutter element preferably has dimensions, in the plane YZ, larger than the corresponding dimensions of the opening of the first diaphragm.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0036">The device for measuring angles of orientation of an x-ray imaging system may further include the reference sample.

The device for measuring angles of orientation of an x-ray imaging system <b>20</b> comprises a processing unit <b>21</b>, a reference sample <b>22</b>, a first diaphragm <b>23</b>, a second diaphragm <b>24</b> and a shutter element <b>25</b>. The reference sample <b>22</b> is formed in a single crystal material, for example made of silicon. It is placed on the sample holder <b>12</b> so that one of its crystal surfaces is parallel to the plane YZ. When passing through the reference sample <b>22</b>, the polychromatic x-ray beam <b>14</b> is partially diffracted and is called &#x201c;diffracted beam <b>15</b>&#x201d;. Indeed, in accordance with Bragg's Law, the wavelengths of the x-ray beam <b>14</b> that are in Bragg condition with crystal planes of the reference sample <b>22</b>, generate constructive and destructive interferences, so that the x-ray beam is diffracted. The shape and the position of the diffracted beam <b>15</b> depend on the orientation of the x-ray source <b>11</b> and on the orientation of the reference sample <b>22</b>. Insofar as the sample holder <b>12</b> and the reference sample <b>22</b> are used by convention to define the reference mark, the shape and the position of the diffracted beam <b>15</b> depend in practice on the angles &#x3be;<sub>xy </sub>and &#x3be;<sub>xz</sub>. The projection of the diffracted beam <b>15</b> on the sensing area <b>131</b> of the detector <b>13</b> forms a diffraction pattern consisting of spots. The shape and the position of the spots of the diffraction pattern therefore depend on the orientation of the source <b>11</b>, but also on the orientation of the detector <b>13</b>, that is to say angles &#x3b1;, &#x3c1; and &#x3b3;. The detector <b>13</b> is arranged to generate an image comprising the diffraction pattern thus formed on its sensing area <b>131</b>. This image is called &#x201c;observed image&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0049">The processing unit <b>21</b> is arranged to synchronise the source <b>11</b> and the detector <b>13</b>. In particular, it is arranged to emit the x-ray beam <b>14</b> by the source <b>11</b> and generate the observed image with the aid of the detector <b>13</b>. The processing unit <b>21</b> is further arranged to determine, by an image processing applied on the observed image, the orientation of the source <b>11</b> and that of the detector <b>13</b>. The image processing may comprise a first step wherein the position of the centroids of the diffraction spots is determined. Segmentation approaches combined with mass centre calculations may be used, just like deep-learning techniques using neural networks to distinguish the diffraction spots in images. The orientation of the source <b>11</b> and that of the detector <b>13</b> is subsequently determined in a second step by comparing the positions of the centroids of the diffraction spots in the observed image with the positions of the centroids of the diffraction spots in at least one reference image, called &#x201c;target image&#x201d;. Said target image includes a diffraction pattern obtained for the reference sample <b>22</b> with a preset orientation (known) of the source <b>11</b> and a preset orientation (known) of the detector <b>13</b>. The target image includes for example a diffraction pattern obtained with a source <b>11</b> and a detector <b>13</b> perfectly aligned with the reference sample <b>22</b>, that is to say with a main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>parallel to the optical axis X and a mark X<sub>d</sub>Y<sub>d</sub>Z<sub>d </sub>combined with the mark XYZ. The determination of the orientation of the source <b>11</b> and of that of the detector <b>13</b> is described more precisely below, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0050">The first diaphragm <b>23</b> is placed upstream of the sample holder <b>12</b>, for example as close as possible to the sample holder <b>12</b>. It is arranged to limit a transverse area of the x-ray beam <b>14</b> in the plane XY. This limitation of area makes it possible to ensure that the entire x-ray beam reaching the detector <b>13</b> has effectively passed through the reference sample <b>22</b>. The first diaphragm <b>23</b> includes for example an opening the dimensions of which in the plane YZ are smaller than the corresponding dimensions of the reference sample <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">The second diaphragm <b>24</b> is placed between the source <b>11</b> and the first diaphragm <b>23</b>. It is for example placed as close as possible to the source <b>11</b>. It is arranged to obtain a collimated x-ray beam at the sample holder <b>12</b>. The second diaphragm <b>24</b> is mainly of interest when the distance between the source <b>11</b> and the detector <b>13</b> is greater than or equal to 30 cm. This diaphragm <b>24</b> may advantageously be replaced with a collimator positioned so that its focal point is located at the centre of the source <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">The shutter element <b>25</b> is placed downstream of the sample holder <b>12</b>. It is for example placed as close as possible to the detector <b>13</b>. The shutter element <b>25</b> is arranged to prevent a portion of the x-ray beam <b>14</b> having passed through the reference sample <b>22</b> without undergoing diffraction, from reaching the sensing area <b>131</b> of the detector <b>13</b>. This portion of the x-ray beam <b>14</b>, if it is not blocked, would form a central spot of relatively high intensity on the detector <b>13</b>. This central spot would involve a relatively high electronic noise and therefore a lower resolution of the intensity measurement of the observed image. The shutter element <b>25</b> is formed in an x-ray opaque material, for example made of lead. When the x-ray beam <b>14</b> is collimated, the dimensions of the shutter element <b>25</b> may be equal to or slightly larger than the corresponding dimensions of the opening of the first diaphragm <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053">The first diaphragm <b>23</b>, the second diaphragm <b>24</b> (or the collimator) and the shutter element <b>25</b> may form a one-piece unit. The reference sample <b>22</b> may also be integral with these optical elements.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example of method for measuring angles of orientation of the x-ray imaging system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The method <b>40</b> comprises a step <b>41</b> of installing the reference sample <b>22</b>, a step <b>42</b> of emitting the x-ray beam <b>14</b>, a step <b>43</b> of generating the observed image and a step <b>44</b> of determining the orientation of the source and of the detector. During step <b>41</b>, the reference sample <b>22</b> is installed on the sample holder <b>12</b> so that one of its crystal planes is parallel with the plane YZ. The radiation source <b>11</b> may then be controlled by the processing unit <b>21</b> in step <b>42</b> in order to emit the polychromatic x-ray beam <b>14</b> according to the main axis of propagation X<sub>s</sub>. At the same time, the processing unit <b>21</b> may control the x-ray detector <b>13</b> in step <b>43</b> so that it generates the observed image, said image comprising the diffraction pattern produced by the reference sample <b>22</b>. Finally, during step <b>44</b>, the processing unit <b>21</b> determines the orientation of the main axis of propagation X<sub>s</sub>, defined by the angles &#x3be;<sub>xy </sub>and &#x3be;<sub>xz </sub>as well as the orientation of the sensing area <b>131</b> of the x-ray detector <b>13</b>, defined by the angles &#x3b1;, &#x3c1; and &#x3b3;. As indicated above, these orientations are determined by comparing the observed image with at least one target image including a diffraction pattern obtained for the reference sample with a preset orientation of the main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>of the source <b>11</b> and a preset orientation of the sensing area <b>131</b> of the x-ray detector <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0055">According to a first embodiment, the determination of the orientation of the source <b>11</b> and of the detector <b>13</b> comprises a first step of determining the position of the centroids of the spots of the diffraction pattern in the observed image and a second step of comparing the observed image with a predetermined set of target images. Each target image shows a diffraction pattern obtained with the reference sample <b>22</b> for a preset orientation of the main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>and for a preset orientation of the sensing area <b>131</b>. The orientations are different for each target image, so that the set of target images provides a representative sample of the diffraction patterns likely to be obtained with the x-ray imaging system <b>10</b>. The comparison of the observed image with a target image involves for example determining an average of the distances between the centroid of each spot in the observed image and the centroid of each corresponding spot in the target image. The angles &#x3be;<sub>xy </sub>and &#x3be;<sub>xz </sub>as well as the angles &#x3b1;, &#x3c1; and &#x3b3; are then determined as being those associated with the target image for which the average of the distances is the lowest. This target image has the diffraction pattern that best corresponds to the diffraction pattern of the observed image.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0056">The various target images may be obtained by a digital modelling of the diffraction generated by the reference sample <b>22</b> installed on the sample holder <b>12</b>, for a preset orientation of the main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>(angles &#x3be;<sub>xy </sub>and &#x3be;<sub>xz</sub>) and a preset orientation of the sensing area <b>131</b> of the detector <b>13</b> (angles &#x3b1;, &#x3b2; and &#x3b3;). This digital modelling is for example performed with the aid of Laue diffraction modelling software such as the PyMicro software. Alternatively, the target images may be generated with the aid of a calibrated x-ray imaging system and of which the orientations of the source and of the detector are accurately controlled and measured. The position of the centroids of the spots of the diffraction pattern in each target image may be determined as those of the centroids of the spots of the diffraction pattern in the observed image.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a second embodiment of the step <b>44</b> of determining the orientation of the main axis of propagation X<sub>s </sub>and of the sensing area <b>131</b> of the x-ray detector <b>13</b>. In this embodiment, an iterative process is applied from an initial target image. More specifically, in a first substep <b>441</b>, the position of the centroids of the diffraction spots in the observed image is determined, in a similar way to the first embodiment. In a second substep <b>442</b>, a distance between the centroid of each spot of the diffraction pattern in the observed image and the centroid of the corresponding spot in the target image considered&#x2014;namely the initial target image during the first occurrence of substep <b>442</b>&#x2014;is calculated. In a third substep <b>443</b>, an average distance is calculated, the average distance being an average of the distances between the various spots in the observed image and the corresponding spots in the target image considered. In a fourth substep <b>444</b>, the average distance is compared with a threshold distance D<sub>th</sub>. The threshold distance D<sub>th </sub>is determined depending on the accuracy desired for measuring the angles &#x3be;<sub>xy</sub>, &#x3be;<sub>xz</sub>, &#x3b1;, &#x3b2; and &#x3b3;. If the average distance is less than the threshold distance D<sub>th</sub>, the angles &#x3be;<sub>xy</sub>, &#x3be;<sub>xz</sub>, &#x3b1;, &#x3b2; and &#x3b3; associated with the target image considered are identified, in a substep <b>445</b>, as being those defining the orientation of the source <b>11</b> and of the detector <b>13</b>. On the other hand, if during substep <b>444</b>, it is determined that the average distance is greater than or equal to the threshold distance D<sub>th</sub>, a new target image is generated in a substep <b>446</b> and substeps <b>442</b>, <b>443</b> and <b>444</b> are reiterated with this new target image. The new target image is generated with an orientation of the main axis of propagation of the source <b>11</b> different from the orientation of the current target image and/or with an orientation of the sensing area <b>131</b> of the detector <b>13</b> different from the orientation of the current target image. Preferably, the angles &#x3be;<sub>xy</sub>, &#x3be;<sub>xz</sub>, &#x3b1;, &#x3b2; and &#x3b3; are selected in such a way as to generate a new target image different from all of the preceding target images. Moreover, the angles &#x3be;<sub>xy</sub>, &#x3be;<sub>xz</sub>, &#x3b1;, &#x3b2; and &#x3b3; may be selected depending on the average distance calculated for the current target image or on the various average distances calculated for the preceding target images.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0058">It should be noted that, in the description above, it has been considered that the reference sample <b>22</b> was aligned with the reference mark XYZ, and particularly with the optical axis X of the x-ray imaging system <b>10</b>. Nevertheless, the invention also applies when this condition is not met. Additional angles defining the orientation of the reference sample then need to be determined. For the embodiment involving a comparison with the diffraction patterns of a set of target images, this involves having a larger library of images, taking as additional degrees of freedom the angle or angles defining the orientation of the reference sample <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0059">On the other hand, in the two embodiments of the step <b>44</b> of determining the orientation of the x-ray source <b>11</b> and the orientation of the x-ray detector <b>13</b>, it has been considered that the observed image was compared to a target image based on the position of the centroids of the spots of their diffraction pattern. Nevertheless, instead of centroids, it is possible to take into account another point of the diffraction spots. Furthermore, the comparison of the observed image with a target image may take into account other properties of the diffraction patterns, such as the shape of the spots.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
