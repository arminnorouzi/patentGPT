Typical lithium-ion batteries include at least two electrodes and an electrolyte and/or separator. One of the two electrodes may serve as a positive electrode or cathode and the other electrode may serve as a negative electrode or anode. A separator and/or electrolyte may be disposed between the negative and positive electrodes. The electrolyte is suitable for conducting lithium ions between the electrodes and, like the two electrodes, may be in solid and/or liquid form and/or a hybrid thereof. In instances of solid-state batteries, which include solid-state electrodes and a solid-state electrolyte, the solid-state electrolyte may physically separate the electrodes so that a distinct separator is not required.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional rechargeable lithium-ion batteries operate by reversibly passing lithium ions back and forth between the negative electrode and the positive electrode. For example, lithium ions may move from the positive electrode to the negative electrode during charging of the battery, and in the opposite direction when discharging the battery. Such lithium-ion batteries can reversibly supply power to an associated load device on demand. More specifically, electrical power can be supplied to a load device by the lithium-ion battery until the lithium content of the negative electrode is effectively depleted. The battery may then be recharged by passing a suitable direct electrical current in the opposite direction between the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During discharge, the negative electrode may contain a comparatively high concentration of intercalated lithium, which is oxidized into lithium ions releasing electrons. Lithium ions may travel from the negative electrode to the positive electrode, for example, through the ionically conductive electrolyte solution contained within the pores of an interposed porous separator. Concurrently, electrons pass through an external circuit from the negative electrode to the positive electrode. Such lithium ions may be assimilated into the material of the positive electrode by an electrochemical reduction reaction. The battery may be recharged or regenerated after a partial or full discharge of its available capacity by an external power source, which reverses the electrochemical reactions that transpired during discharge.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In various instances, however, a portion of the intercalated lithium remains with the negative electrode following the first cycle due to, for example, conversion reactions and/or the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the negative electrode during the first cycle, as well as ongoing lithium loss due to, for example, continuous solid electrolyte interphase breakage. Such permanent loss of lithium ions may result in a decreased specific energy and power in the battery resulting from, for example, added positive electrode mass that does not participate in the reversible operation of the battery. For example, the lithium-ion battery may experience an irreversible capacity loss of greater than or equal to about 5% to less than or equal to about 30% after the first cycle, and in the instance of silicon-containing negative electrodes, or other volume-expanding negative electroactive materials (e.g., tin (Sn), aluminum (Al), germanium (Ge)), an irreversible capacity loss of greater than or equal to about 20% to less than or equal to about 40% after the first cycle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current methods to compensate for first cycle lithium loss include, for example, electrochemical processes where a silicon-containing anode is lithiated using an electrolyte bath. However, such processes are susceptible to electrolyte pollution, and as a result, instability. Another method of compensation includes, for example, in-cell lithiation, which includes adding lithium to a cell. Such processes, however, require the use of mesh current collectors, which have high material costs, as well as coating costs. Yet another method of compensation includes, for example, the deposition of lithium on an anode. However, in such instances, it is difficult (and costly) to produce evenly deposited lithium layers. Accordingly, it would be desirable to develop improved electrodes and electroactive materials, and methods of making and using the same, that can address these challenges.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure relates to over-lithiated cathode materials (i.e., positive electroactive materials) for use in an electrochemical cell that cycles lithium ions, and methods of making and using the same.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In various aspects, the positive electrode includes a positive electroactive material.

Often, in a lithium-ion battery pack, batteries or cells may be electrically connected in a stack or winding configuration to increase overall output. Lithium-ion batteries operate by reversibly passing lithium ions between the first and second electrodes. For example, lithium ions may move from a positive electrode to a negative electrode during charging of the battery, and in the opposite direction when discharging the battery. The electrolyte is suitable for conducting lithium ions (or sodium ions in the case of sodium-ion batteries, and the like) and may be in liquid, gel, or solid form. For example, an exemplary and schematic illustration of an electrochemical cell (also referred to as the battery) <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0053">Such cells are used in vehicle or automotive transportation applications (e.g., motorcycles, boats, tractors, buses, motorcycles, mobile homes, campers, and tanks). However, the present technology may be employed in a wide variety of other industries and applications, including aerospace components, consumer goods, devices, buildings (e.g., houses, offices, sheds, and warehouses), office equipment and furniture, and industrial equipment machinery, agricultural or farm equipment, or heavy machinery, by way of non-limiting example. Further, although the illustrated examples include a single positive electrode cathode and a single anode, the skilled artisan will recognize that the present teachings extend to various other configurations, including those having one or more cathodes and one or more anodes, as well as various current collectors with electroactive layers disposed on or adjacent to one or more surfaces thereof.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0054">The battery <b>20</b> includes a negative electrode <b>22</b> (e.g., anode), a positive electrode <b>24</b> (e.g., cathode), and a separator <b>26</b> disposed between the two electrodes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The separator <b>26</b> provides electrical separation&#x2014;prevents physical contact&#x2014;between the electrodes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The separator <b>26</b> also provides a minimal resistance path for internal passage of lithium ions, and in certain instances, related anions, during cycling of the lithium ions. In various aspects, the separator <b>26</b> comprises an electrolyte <b>30</b> that may, in certain aspects, also be present in the negative electrode <b>22</b> and positive electrode <b>24</b>. In certain variations, the separator <b>26</b> may be formed by a solid-state electrolyte. For example, the separator <b>26</b> may be defined by a plurality of solid-state electrolyte particles (not shown).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0055">A negative electrode current collector <b>32</b> may be positioned at or near the negative electrode <b>22</b>. The negative electrode current collector <b>32</b> may be a metal foil, metal grid or screen, or expanded metal comprising copper or any other appropriate electrically conductive material known to those of skill in the art. A positive electrode current collector <b>34</b> may be positioned at or near the positive electrode <b>24</b>. The positive electrode current collector <b>34</b> may be a metal foil, metal grid or screen, or expanded metal comprising aluminum or any other appropriate electrically conductive material known to those of skill in the art. The negative electrode current collector <b>32</b> and the positive electrode current collector <b>34</b> respectively collect and move free electrons to and from an external circuit <b>40</b>. For example, an interruptible external circuit <b>40</b> and a load device <b>42</b> may connect the negative electrode <b>22</b> (through the negative electrode current collector <b>32</b>) and the positive electrode <b>24</b> (through the positive electrode current collector <b>34</b>).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0056">The battery <b>20</b> can generate an electric current during discharge by way of reversible electrochemical reactions that occur when the external circuit <b>40</b> is closed (to connect the negative electrode <b>22</b> and the positive electrode <b>24</b>) and the negative electrode <b>22</b> has a lower potential than the positive electrode. The chemical potential difference between the positive electrode <b>24</b> and the negative electrode <b>22</b> drives electrons produced by a reaction, for example, the oxidation of intercalated lithium, at the negative electrode <b>22</b> through the external circuit <b>40</b> toward the positive electrode <b>24</b>. Lithium ions that are also produced at the negative electrode <b>22</b> are concurrently transferred through the electrolyte <b>30</b> contained in the separator <b>26</b> toward the positive electrode <b>24</b>. The electrons flow through the external circuit <b>40</b> and the lithium ions migrate across the separator <b>26</b> containing the electrolyte <b>30</b> to form intercalated lithium at the positive electrode <b>24</b>. As noted above, electrolyte <b>30</b> is typically also present in the negative electrode <b>22</b> and positive electrode <b>24</b>. The electric current passing through the external circuit <b>40</b> can be harnessed and directed through the load device <b>42</b> until the lithium in the negative electrode <b>22</b> is depleted and the capacity of the battery <b>20</b> is diminished.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0057">The battery <b>20</b> can be charged or re-energized at any time by connecting an external power source to the lithium ion battery <b>20</b> to reverse the electrochemical reactions that occur during battery discharge. Connecting an external electrical energy source to the battery <b>20</b> promotes a reaction, for example, non-spontaneous oxidation of intercalated lithium, at the positive electrode <b>24</b> so that electrons and lithium ions are produced. The lithium ions flow back toward the negative electrode <b>22</b> through the electrolyte <b>30</b> across the separator <b>26</b> to replenish the negative electrode <b>22</b> with lithium (e.g., intercalated lithium) for use during the next battery discharge event. As such, a complete discharging event followed by a complete charging event is considered to be a cycle, where lithium ions are cycled between the positive electrode <b>24</b> and the negative electrode <b>22</b>. The external power source that may be used to charge the battery <b>20</b> may vary depending on the size, construction, and particular end-use of the battery <b>20</b>. Some notable and exemplary external power sources include, but are not limited to, an AC-DC converter connected to an AC electrical power grid though a wall outlet and a motor vehicle alternator.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0058">In many lithium-ion battery configurations, each of the negative electrode current collector <b>32</b>, negative electrode <b>22</b>, separator <b>26</b>, positive electrode <b>24</b>, and positive electrode current collector <b>34</b> are prepared as relatively thin layers (for example, from several microns to a fraction of a millimeter or less in thickness) and assembled in layers connected in electrical parallel arrangement to provide a suitable electrical energy and power package. In various aspects, the battery <b>20</b> may also include a variety of other components that, while not depicted here, are nonetheless known to those of skill in the art. For instance, the battery <b>20</b> may include a casing, gaskets, terminal caps, tabs, battery terminals, and any other conventional components or materials that may be situated within the battery <b>20</b>, including between or around the negative electrode <b>22</b>, the positive electrode <b>24</b>, and/or the separator <b>26</b>. The battery <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a liquid electrolyte <b>30</b> and shows representative concepts of battery operation. However, the present technology also applies to solid-state batteries that include solid-state electrolytes and/or solid-state electroactive particles that may have different designs as known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0059">As noted above, the size and shape of the battery <b>20</b> may vary depending on the particular application for which it is designed. Battery-powered vehicles and hand-held consumer electronic devices, for example, are two examples where the battery <b>20</b> would most likely be designed to different size, capacity, and power-output specifications. The battery <b>20</b> may also be connected in series or parallel with other similar lithium-ion cells or batteries to produce a greater voltage output, energy, and power if it is required by the load device <b>42</b>. Accordingly, the battery <b>20</b> can generate electric current to a load device <b>42</b> that is part of the external circuit <b>40</b>. The load device <b>42</b> may be powered by the electric current passing through the external circuit <b>40</b> when the battery <b>20</b> is discharging. While the electrical load device <b>42</b> may be any number of known electrically-powered devices, a few specific examples include an electric motor for an electrified vehicle, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a cellular phone, and cordless power tools or appliances. The load device <b>42</b> may also be an electricity-generating apparatus that charges the battery <b>20</b> for purposes of storing electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0060">With renewed reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the positive electrode <b>24</b>, the negative electrode <b>22</b>, and the separator <b>26</b> may each include an electrolyte solution or system <b>30</b> inside their pores, capable of conducting lithium ions between the negative electrode <b>22</b> and the positive electrode <b>24</b>. Any appropriate electrolyte <b>30</b>, whether in solid, liquid, or gel form, capable of conducting lithium ions between the negative electrode <b>22</b> and the positive electrode <b>24</b> may be used in the lithium-ion battery <b>20</b>. In certain aspects, the electrolyte <b>30</b> may be a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte solution (e.g., &#x3e;1M) that includes a lithium salt dissolved in an organic solvent or a mixture of organic solvents. Numerous conventional non-aqueous liquid electrolyte <b>30</b> solutions may be employed in the lithium-ion battery <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0061">In certain aspects, the electrolyte <b>30</b> may be a non-aqueous liquid electrolyte solution that includes one or more lithium salts dissolved in an organic solvent or a mixture of organic solvents. For example, a non-limiting list of lithium salts that may be dissolved in an organic solvent to form the non-aqueous liquid electrolyte solution include lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>), lithium perchlorate (LiClO<sub>4</sub>), lithium tetrachloroaluminate (LiAlCl<sub>4</sub>), lithium iodide (LiI), lithium bromide (LiBr), lithium thiocyanate (LiSCN), lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF<sub>4</sub>), lithium tetraphenylborate (LiB(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiB(C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) (LiBOB), lithium difluorooxalatoborate (LiBF<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)), lithium hexafluoroarsenate (LiAsF<sub>6</sub>), lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiCF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>), lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonylimide (LiN(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiN(FSO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) (LiSFI), and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0062">These and other similar lithium salts may be dissolved in a variety of non-aqueous aprotic organic solvents, including but not limited to, various alkyl carbonates, such as cyclic carbonates (e.g., ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), butylene carbonate (BC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)), linear carbonates (e.g., dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), ethylmethylcarbonate (EMC)), aliphatic carboxylic esters (e.g., methyl formate, methyl acetate, methyl propionate), &#x3b3;-lactones (e.g., &#x3b3;-butyrolactone, &#x3b3;-valerolactone), chain structure ethers (e.g., 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1-2-diethoxyethane, ethoxymethoxyethane), cyclic ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran), 1,3-dioxolane), sulfur compounds (e.g., sulfolane), and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0063">The porous separator <b>26</b> may include, in certain instances, a microporous polymeric separator including a polyolefin. The polyolefin may be a homopolymer (derived from a single monomer constituent) or a heteropolymer (derived from more than one monomer constituent), which may be either linear or branched. If a heteropolymer is derived from two monomer constituents, the polyolefin may assume any copolymer chain arrangement, including those of a block copolymer or a random copolymer. Similarly, if the polyolefin is a heteropolymer derived from more than two monomer constituents, it may likewise be a block copolymer or a random copolymer. In certain aspects, the polyolefin may be polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), or a blend of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), or multi-layered structured porous films of PE and/or PP. Commercially available polyolefin porous separator membranes <b>26</b> include CELGARD&#xae; 2500 (a monolayer polypropylene separator) and CELGARD&#xae; 2320 (a trilayer polypropylene/polyethylene/polypropylene separator) available from Celgard LLC.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0064">When the separator <b>26</b> is a microporous polymeric separator, it may be a single layer or a multi-layer laminate, which may be fabricated from either a dry or a wet process.

In other aspects, the separator <b>26</b> may be a fibrous membrane having an abundance of pores extending between the opposing surfaces and may have an average thickness of less than a millimeter, for example. As another example, however, multiple discrete layers of similar or dissimilar polyolefins may be assembled to form the microporous polymer separator <b>26</b>. The separator <b>26</b> may also comprise other polymers in addition to the polyolefin such as, but not limited to, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF), a polyamide, polyimide, poly(amide-imide) copolymer, polyetherimide, and/or cellulose, or any other material suitable for creating the required porous structure.

Lithium ions may travel from the negative electrode <b>22</b> to the positive electrode <b>24</b>, for example, through the ionically conductive electrolyte <b>30</b> contained within the pores of an interposed porous separator <b>26</b>. Concurrently, electrons pass through an external circuit <b>40</b> from the negative electrode <b>22</b> to the positive electrode <b>24</b>. Such lithium ions may be assimilated into the material of the positive electrode <b>22</b> by an electrochemical reduction reaction. The battery <b>20</b> may be recharged or regenerated after a partial or full discharge of its available capacity by an external power source, which reverses the electrochemical reactions that transpired during discharge.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0074">In certain instances, however, especially in instances of silicon-containing electroactive materials, a portion of the intercalated lithium remains with the negative electrode <b>22</b> for example, conversion reactions and/or the formation of Li<sub>x</sub>Si and/or a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (not shown) on the negative electrode <b>22</b> during the first cycle, as well as ongoing lithium loss due to, for example, continuous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) breakage and rebuild. The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer can form over the surface of the negative electrode (anode), which is often generated by reaction products of anode material, electrolyte reduction, and/or lithium ion reduction. Such permanent loss of lithium ions may result in a decreased specific energy and power in the battery <b>20</b>. For example, the battery <b>20</b> may experience an irreversible capacity loss of greater than or equal to about 5% to less than or equal to about 30% after the first cycle.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0075">Lithiation, for example pre-lithiation of the electroactive materials prior to incorporation into the battery <b>20</b>, may compensate for such lithium losses during cycling. For example, an amount of lithium prelithiated together with appropriate negative electrode capacity and/or positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) can be used to control electrochemical potential within an appropriate window so as to improve the cycle stability of the battery <b>20</b>. Prelithiation can drive down the potential for silicon-containing electrodes. By way of non-limiting example, lithiation of silicon by direct reaction can be expressed by: 4.4xLi+Si&#x2192;Li<sub>4.4x</sub>Si, where 0&#x2264;x&#x2264;1, while for electrochemical lithiation of silicon, it can be expressed as 4.4xLi<sup>+</sup>+4.4xe<sup>&#x2212;+</sup>Si&#x2192;Li<sub>4.4x</sub>Si. In each instance, the reserved lithium can compensate for lithium lost during cycling, including during the first cycle, so as to decrease capacity loss over time.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0076">Common lithiation methods, such as electrochemical, direct contact, and lamination methods; however, often require half-cell fabrication and teardown and/or high temperature chemical processes. Furthermore, it can be difficult to control an extent of lithiation that occurs during these processes. Further, these processes often involve highly reactive chemicals and require additional manufacturing steps. These may be time consuming and potentially expensive processes. Further, such processes also commonly produce unworkable materials, for example anodes having undesirable thicknesses. The present disclosure provides over-lithiated cathode materials, and methods of forming the same, which can help to address these challenges.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0077">For example, in various aspects, the positive electrode <b>24</b> includes an over-lithiated positive electroactive material that provides, or serves as, a lithium reservoir in the cell <b>20</b>.
