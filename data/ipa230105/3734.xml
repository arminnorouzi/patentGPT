INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to cell free nucleosomes as biomarkers in plasma samples for vascular or haematological cancers.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Haematological cancers are the types of cancer affecting blood, bone marrow and lymph nodes. They are referred to as leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma depending on the type of cell affected. Leukaemia is cancer of the blood cells which usually starts in the bone marrow and travels through the bloodstream. In leukaemia, the bone marrow produces mutated cells and spreads them into the blood, where they grow and crowd out healthy blood cells. Lymphoma diseases affect the cells in the lymphatic system. In lymphomas, immune cells called lymphocytes grow out of control and collect in lymph nodes, the spleen, in other lymph tissues or in neighbouring organs. Myeloma, also known as multiple myeloma, develops in the bone marrow and affects plasma cells, which produce antibodies that attack infections and diseases. Examples of blood cancers include Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">References to &#x201c;acute leukaemia&#x201d; means the cancer progresses quickly and aggressively, usually requiring immediate treatment. ALL involves the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes which are unable to fight infection. This causes the patient to have less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the circulation. As a result, the patient usually suffers from a weakened immune system and the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, breathlessness and an increased risk of excessive bleeding. The risk for developing ALL is highest in children younger than 5 years of age and it is the most common type of leukaemia that affects children. The risk then declines slowly until the mid-20s, and begins to rise again slowly after age 50. Overall, about 4 of every 10 cases of ALL are in adults.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">AML affects myeloblasts which results in the accumulation of abnormal monocytes and granulocytes in the bone marrow. AML may also affect myeloid stem cells resulting in abnormal red blood cells or platelets. As with ALL, this causes the patient to have lower levels of healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the circulation. AML is one of the most common types of leukaemia in adults and the average age at diagnosis is 68.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">HL and NHL are the two main types of lymphoma. HL has a particular appearance under the microscope and contains cells called Reed-Sternberg cells (a type of B lymphocyte that has become cancerous), whereas NHL looks different under the microscope and does not contain Reed-Sternberg cells. Most lymphomas are NHL and only about 1 in 5 are HL. NHL is a cancer affecting lymphocytes and usually starts in lymph nodes or lymph tissue. It is one of the more common cancers among children, teens and young adults.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current methods of diagnosing leukaemia and myeloma involve obtaining a complete blood count (CBC) test to identify abnormal levels of white blood cells relative to red blood cells and platelets. However, an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) is not specific to patients with a haematological malignancy; it can also be the result of an ongoing response to infection or other inflammatory process. For lymphoma, an X-ray, CT or PET scan can be used to detect swollen lymph nodes, however this is also non-specific.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to confirm a diagnosis of a haematological cancer, a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy is required. Therefore overdiagnosis of haematological cancers at an early stage in the diagnostic process can lead to unnecessary biopsies which are invasive, potentially hazardous and relatively costly to healthcare providers. Cytogenetics analysis and/or immunophenotyping can also be used to confirm a haematological cancer diagnosis, however these methods are expensive to perform and therefore are typically only used at a late stage of the diagnostic process.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Human angiosarcoma is a rare vascular cancer affecting the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. Canine hemangiosarcoma is similarly a cancer involving proliferation of the vascular endothelium or the blood vessel walls and is a common canine cancer which is also difficult to diagnose. Canine cancers are more common than human cancers generally both due to the genetic effects of inbreeding and because dogs have a shorter life-span than humans and commonly contract cancer at 8 years of age or above. Detection and diagnosis of cancer in animal subjects presents additional difficulties over diagnosis of human cancers. Cancer detection in non-human animals often involves scanning, for example by Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI scanning, but animals will not remain still for the time required for scanning and must therefore be anaesthetised. Pet health insurance is rare and may not cover cancer diagnostics or therapy making these test financially out of reach for many pet owners. In addition, human blood tests for cancer marker proteins do not normally detect animal proteins so there are fewer available blood tests in veterinary oncology.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Holdenrieder et al. (2001) Int J Cancer 95: 114-120 previously described detecting the level of nucleosomes in serum samples of patients with benign and malignant diseases. However, the results presented for serum samples did not imply that there was any distinction between the level for haematological cancers, such as lymphoma, compared to the other cancer types tested. The epigenetic composition of circulating cell free nucleosomes in terms of their histone modification, histone variant, DNA modification and adduct content have also been investigated as blood based biomarkers in cancer, see WO 2005/019826, WO 2013/030577, WO 2013/030579 and WO 2013/084002.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There remains a need in the art to provide simple, cost-effective diagnostic methods for vascular or haematological cancers, especially those able to distinguish from patients with other types of disease or non-vascular or non-haematological cancer, but who may present with similar symptoms.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect, there is provided a use of a cell free nucleosome as a biomarker in a plasma sample, for the diagnosis or detecting of a vascular or haematological cancer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a further aspect, there is provided a use of a cell free nucleosome as a biomarker in a plasma sample, for the diagnosis or detection of a haematological cancer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a further aspect, there is provided a use of a cell free nucleosome as a biomarker in a plasma sample, for the diagnosis or detecting of a vascular cancer.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a further aspect, there is provided a method for diagnosing or detecting a vascular or haematological cancer which comprises the steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">(i) contacting a plasma sample obtained from the subject with a binding agent to detect or measure a cell free nucleosome;

In particular, the cancer is a haematological cancer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0033">The nucleosome is the basic unit of chromatin structure and consists of a protein complex of eight highly conserved core histones (comprising of a pair of each of the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). Around this complex is wrapped approximately 146 base pairs of DNA. Another histone, H1 or H5, acts as a linker and is involved in chromatin compaction. The DNA is wound around consecutive nucleosomes in a structure often said to resemble &#x201c;beads on a string&#x201d; and this forms the basic structure of open or euchromatin. In compacted or heterochromatin this string is coiled and super coiled into a closed and complex structure (Herranz and Esteller (2007) Methods Mol. Biol. 361: 25-62).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">References to &#x201c;nucleosome&#x201d; may refer to &#x201c;cell free nucleosome&#x201d; when detected in body fluid samples. It will be appreciated that the term cell free nucleosome throughout this document is intended to include any cell free chromatin fragment that includes one or more nucleosomes. &#x201c;Epigenetic features&#x201d;, &#x201c;epigenetic signal features&#x201d; or &#x201c;epigenetic signal structures&#x201d; of a cell free nucleosome as referred herein may comprise, without limitation, one or more histone post-translational modifications, histone isoforms, modified nucleotides and/or proteins bound to a nucleosome in a nucleosome-protein adduct.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">It will be understood that the cell free nucleosome may be detected by binding to a component thereof. The term &#x201c;component thereof&#x201d; as used herein refers to a part of the nucleosome, i.e. the whole nucleosome does not need to be detected. The component of the cell free nucleosomes may be selected from the group consisting of: a histone protein (i.e. histone H1, H2A, H2B, H3 or H4), a histone post-translational modification, a histone variant or isoform, a protein bound to the nucleosome (i.e. a nucleosome-protein adduct), a DNA fragment associated with the nucleosome and/or a modified nucleotide associated with the nucleosome. For example, the component thereof may be histone (isoform) H3.1 or histone H1 or DNA.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">Methods and uses of the invention may measure the level of (cell free) nucleosomes per se. References to &#x201c;nucleosomes per se&#x201d; refers to the total nucleosome level or concentration present in the sample, regardless of any epigenetic features the nucleosomes may or may not include. Detection of the total nucleosome level typically involves detecting a histone protein common to all nucleosomes, such as histone H4. Therefore, nucleosomes per se may be measured by detecting a core histone protein, such as histone H4. As described herein, histone proteins form structural units known as nucleosomes which are used to package DNA in eukaryotic cells. As previously reported in WO 2016/067029 (incorporated herein by reference), particular histone variants, such as histone H3.1, H3.2 or H3t, may be used to isolate cell free nucleosomes originating from tumour cells. Therefore, the total level of cell free nucleosomes of tumour origin may be detected.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037">Normal cell turnover in adult humans involves the creation by cell division of some 10<sup>11 </sup>cells daily and the death of a similar number, mainly by apoptosis. During the process of apoptosis chromatin is broken down into mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes which are released from the cells. Under normal conditions the levels of circulating nucleosomes found in healthy subjects is reported to be low. Elevated levels are found in subjects with a variety of conditions including many cancers, auto-immune diseases, inflammatory conditions, stroke and myocardial infarction (Holdenreider &#x26; Stieber (2009) Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci, 46(1): 1-24).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">Current nucleosome ELISA methods are used primarily in cell culture, usually as a method to detect apoptosis (Salgame et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res, 25(3): 680-681; Holdenrieder et al. (2001) supra; van Nieuwenhuijze et al. (2003) Ann Rheum Dis, 62: 10-14), but are also used for the measurement of circulating cell free nucleosomes in serum and plasma (Holdenrieder et al. (2001)). Cell free serum and plasma nucleosome levels released into the circulation by dying cells have been measured by ELISA methods in studies of a number of different cancers to evaluate their use as a potential biomarker. Mean circulating nucleosome levels are reported to be high in most, but not all, cancers studied. However, patients with malignant tumours are reported to have serum nucleosome concentrations that varied considerably and some patients with advanced tumour disease were found to have low circulating nucleosome levels, within the range measured for healthy subjects (Holdenrieder et al. (2001)).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">The cell free nucleosome may be a mononucleosome or oligonucleosome, or a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">Mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes can be detected by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbant Assay (ELISA) and several methods have been reported (e.g. Salgame et al. (1997); Holdenrieder et al. (2001); van Nieuwenhuijze et al. (2003)). These assays typically employ an anti-histone antibody (for example anti-H2B, anti-H3 or anti-H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) as capture antibody and an anti-DNA or anti-H2A-H2B-DNA complex antibody as detection antibody.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">Circulating nucleosomes are not a homogeneous group of protein-nucleic acid complexes. Rather, they are a heterogeneous group of chromatin fragments originating from the digestion of chromatin on cell death and include an immense variety of epigenetic structures including particular histone isoforms (or variants), post-translational histone modifications, nucleotides or modified nucleotides, and protein adducts. It will be clear to those skilled in the art that an elevation in nucleosome levels will be associated with elevations in some circulating nucleosome subsets containing particular epigenetic signals including nucleosomes comprising particular histone isoforms (or variants), comprising particular post-translational histone modifications, comprising particular nucleotides or modified nucleotides and comprising particular protein adducts. Assays for these types of chromatin fragments are known in the art (for example, see WO 2005/019826, WO 2013/030579, WO 2013/030578, WO 2013/084002 which are herein incorporated by reference).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">The biomarker used in the uses and methods of the invention may be the level of cell free nucleosomes per se and/or an epigenetic feature of a cell free nucleosome. It will be understood that the terms &#x201c;epigenetic signal structure&#x201d; and &#x201c;epigenetic feature&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. They refer to particular features of the nucleosome that may be detected. In one embodiment, the epigenetic feature of the nucleosome is selected from the group consisting of: a post-translational histone modification, a histone variant, a particular nucleotide and a protein adduct.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">In one embodiment, the epigenetic feature of the nucleosome comprises one or more histone variants or isoforms. The epigenetic feature of the cell free nucleosome may be a histone isoform, such as a histone isoform of a core nucleosome, in particular a histone H3 isoform.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0044">The term &#x201c;histone variant&#x201d; and &#x201c;histone isoform&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein. The structure of the nucleosome can also vary by the inclusion of alternative histone isoforms or variants which are different gene or splice products and have different amino acid sequences. Many histone isoforms are known in the art. Histone variants can be classed into a number of families which are subdivided into individual types. The nucleotide sequences of a large number of histone variants are known and publicly available for example in the National Human Genome Research Institute NHGRI Histone Database (Mari&#xf1;o-Ram&#xed;rez et al. The Histone Database: an integrated resource for histones and histone fold-containing proteins. <i>Database </i>Vol. 2011. and http://genome.nhgri.nih.gov/histones/complete.shtml), the GenBank (NIH genetic sequence) Database, the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). For example, variants of histone H2 include H2A1, H2A2, mH2A1, mH2A2, H2AX and H2AZ. In another example, histone isoforms of H3 include H3.1, H3.2 and H3t.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0045">In one embodiment, the histone isoform is H3.1. As shown in the examples presented herein, H3.1 was effective at distinguishing subjects with vascular or haematological cancer from healthy subjects. H3.1 was particularly effective at identifying patients with lymphoma because 84% of patients with NHL were distinguished from healthy subjects at 90% specificity (see Table 1).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0046">The structure of nucleosomes can vary by post translational modification (PTM) of histone proteins. PTM of histone proteins typically occurs on the tails of the core histones and common modifications include acetylation, methylation or ubiquitination of lysine residues as well as methylation of arginine residues and phosphorylation of serine residues and many others. Many histone modifications are known in the art and the number is increasing as new modifications are identified (Zhao and Garcia, 2015 Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol, 7: a025064). Therefore, in one embodiment, the epigenetic feature of the cell free nucleosome may be a histone post translational modification (PTM). The histone PTM may be a histone PTM of a core nucleosome, e.g. H3, H2A, H2B or H4, in particular H3, H2A or H2B. In particular, the histone PTM is a histone H3 PTM. Examples of such PTMs are described in WO 2005/019826.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">For example, the post translational modification may include acetylation, methylation, which may be mono-, di- or tri-methylation, phosphorylation, ribosylation, citrullination, ubiquitination, hydroxylation, glycosylation, nitrosylation, glutamination and/or isomerisation (see Ausio (2001) Biochem Cell Bio 79: 693). In one embodiment, the histone PTM is selected from methylation or citrullination. In a further embodiment, the histone PTM is H3K27me3 or H3 citrulline (H3cit). In a yet further embodiment, the histone PTM is H3cit. As shown in the examples presented herein, H3cit was the most effective histone PTM at distinguishing subjects with vascular or haematological cancer from healthy subjects.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">A group or class of related histone post translational modifications (rather than a single modification) may also be detected. A typical example, without limitation, would involve a 2-site immunoassay employing one antibody or other selective binder directed to bind to nucleosomes and one antibody or other selective binder directed to bind the group of histone modifications in question. Examples of such antibodies directed to bind to a group of histone modifications would include, for illustrative purposes without limitation, anti-pan-acetylation antibodies (e.g. a Pan-acetyl H4 antibody [H4panAc]), anti-citrullination antibodies or anti-ubiquitin antibodies.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">In one embodiment, the epigenetic feature of the nucleosome comprises one or more DNA modifications. In addition to the epigenetic signalling mediated by nucleosome histone isoform and PTM composition, nucleosomes also differ in their nucleotide and modified nucleotide composition. Global DNA hypomethylation is a hallmark of cancer cells and some nucleosomes may comprise more 5-methylcytosine residues (or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine residues or other nucleotides or modified nucleotides) than other nucleosomes. In one embodiment, the DNA modification is selected from 5-methylcytosine or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0050">In one embodiment, the epigenetic feature of the nucleosome comprises one or more protein-nucleosome adducts or complexes. A further type of circulating nucleosome subset is nucleosome protein adducts. It has been known for many years that chromatin comprises a large number of non-histone proteins bound to its constituent DNA and/or histones. These chromatin associated proteins are of a wide variety of types and have a variety of functions including transcription factors, transcription enhancement factors, transcription repression factors, histone modifying enzymes, DNA damage repair proteins and many more. These chromatin fragments including nucleosomes and other non-histone chromatin proteins or DNA and other non-histone chromatin proteins are described in the art.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0051">In one embodiment, the protein adducted to the nucleosome (and which therefore may be used as a biomarker) is selected from: a transcription factor, a High Mobility Group Protein or chromatin modifying enzyme. References to &#x201c;transcription factor&#x201d; refer to proteins that bind to DNA and regulate gene expression by promoting (i.e. activators) or suppressing (i.e. repressors) transcription. Transcription factors contain one or more DNA-binding domains (DBDs), which attach to specific sequences of DNA adjacent to the genes that they regulate. All of the circulating nucleosomes and nucleosome moieties, types or subgroups described herein may be useful in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0052">It will be understood that more than one epigenetic feature of cell free nucleosomes may be detected in methods and uses of the invention. Multiple biomarkers may be used as a combined biomarker. Therefore, in one embodiment, the use comprises more than one epigenetic feature of cell free nucleosomes as a combined biomarker. The epigenetic features may be the same type (e.g. PTMs, histone isoforms, nucleotides or protein adducts) or different types (e.g. a PTM in combination with a histone isoform). For example, a post-translational histone modification and a histone variant may be detected (i.e. more than one type of epigenetic feature is detected). Alternatively, or additionally, more than one type of post-translational histone modification is detected, or more than one type of histone isoform is detected. In one aspect, the use comprises a post-translational histone modification and a histone isoform as a combined biomarker in a plasma sample, for the diagnosis or detection of a vascular or haematological cancer. In one embodiment, the combined biomarker is H3.1 and H3cit. In an alternative embodiment, the combined biomarker is H3.1 and H3K27Me3.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0053">The term &#x201c;biomarker&#x201d; means a distinctive biological or biologically derived indicator of a process, event, or condition. Biomarkers can be used in methods of diagnosis, e.g. clinical screening, and prognosis assessment and in monitoring the results of therapy, identifying patients most likely to respond to a particular therapeutic treatment, drug screening and development. Biomarkers and uses thereof are valuable for identification of new drug treatments and for discovery of new targets for drug treatment.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0054">Methods and uses described herein may be tested in body fluid samples, in particular blood, serum or plasma samples. Preferably, plasma samples are used. Plasma samples may be collected in collection tubes containing one or more anticoagulants such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), heparin, or sodium citrate, in particular EDTA.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0055">Haematological Cancers</p><p id="p-0051" num="0056">Haematological cancers are cancers of the blood, therefore may also be referred to as &#x201c;blood cancers&#x201d;. There are 3 principal types of haematological cancers: leukaemias, which are caused by the rapid production of abnormal white blood cells; lymphomas which are caused by abnormal lymphoma cells; and myelomas, which is a cancer of the plasma cells.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0057">In one embodiment the haematological cancer is selected from lymphoma, leukaemia, myeloma, chronic myeloproliferative disease, monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance, myelodysplastic syndrome and amyloidosis. In a further embodiment, the haematological cancer is selected from leukaemia or lymphoma.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0058">Leukaemia affects white blood cells and can be classified by the type of white cell affected (myeloid or lymphatic) and by the way the disease progresses (acute or chronic). Several types of leukaemia have been identified including, but not limited to: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL; which may also be referred to as Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia), Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukaemia (AMKL), Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL), Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (C-AML), Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (C-ALL), Chronic Eosinophilic Leukaemia (CEL), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (CMML), Chronic Neutrophilic Leukaemia, Hairy Cell Leukaemia, Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (JMML), Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukaemia (LGLL), T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia and Prolymphocytic Leukaemia.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0059">In one embodiment, the leukaemia is an acute leukaemia, such as Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukaemia (AMKL) or Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL). In a further embodiment, the leukaemia is selected from Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). Alternatively, in one embodiment, the leukaemia is a chronic leukaemia, such as Chronic Eosinophilic Leukaemia (CEL), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (CMML) or Chronic Neutrophilic Leukaemia.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0060">Both Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) are lymphomas. The majority of NHL patients are over the age of 55 when first diagnosed, whereas the median age for diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is 39. In one embodiment, the lymphoma is Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). NHL may arise in lymph nodes anywhere in the body, whereas HL typically begins in the upper body, such as the neck, chest or armpits.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0061">Hodgkin lymphoma is often diagnosed at an early stage and is therefore considered one of the most treatable cancers. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is typically not diagnosed until it has reached a more advanced stage, therefore methods of the invention find particular use in the diagnosis of NHL where there is a need to detect patients at an early stage of disease to improve treatment outcome.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0062">Other Blood Cancers</p><p id="p-0058" num="0063">Angiosarcoma and Hemangiosarcoma are soft tissue cancers involving proliferation of the cells lining the vascular system, therefore may be referred to as &#x201c;vascular cancers&#x201d;. Like haematopoietic cancers, these intimately associated with the vasculature and the affected cells are in direct contact with the circulating fluid of the blood. We have shown that these blood cancers are associated with very high levels of circulating nucleosomes which are similar to the levels observed in lymphoma.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0064">Detection and Diagnosis Methods</p><p id="p-0060" num="0065">The invention provides methods which can be used in the detection or diagnosis of patients with vascular or haematological cancers.

Immunoassays include 2-site immunoassays or immunometric assays employing enzyme detection methods (for example ELISA), fluorescence labelled immunometric assays, time-resolved fluorescence labelled immunometric assays, chemiluminescent immunometric assays, immunoturbidimetric assays, particulate labelled immunometric assays and immunoradiometric assays as well as single-site immunoassays, reagent limited immunoassays, competitive immunoassay methods including labelled antigen and labelled antibody single antibody immunoassay methods with a variety of label types including radioactive, enzyme, fluorescent, time-resolved fluorescent and particulate labels. All of said immunoassay methods are well known in the art, see for example Salgame et al. (1997) and van Nieuwenhuijze et al.

In particular, quantifying may be performed by measuring the concentration of the target in the sample or samples. Biological samples that may be tested in a method of the invention include those as defined hereinbefore. The samples can be prepared, for example where appropriate diluted or concentrated, and stored in the usual manner. The present invention finds particular use in plasma samples which may be obtained from the subject.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0099">Identification, detection and/or quantification of biomarkers may be performed by detection of the biomarker or of a fragment thereof, e.g. a fragment with C-terminal truncation, or with N-terminal truncation. Fragments are suitably greater than 4 amino acids in length, for example 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 amino acids in length. It is noted in particular that peptides of the same or related sequence to that of histone tails are particularly useful fragments of histone proteins.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0100">For example, detecting and/or quantifying can be performed by one or more method(s) selected from the group consisting of: SELDI (-TOF), MALDI (-TOF), a 1-D gel-based analysis, a 2-D gel-based analysis, Mass spec (MS), reverse phase (RP) LC, size permeation (gel filtration), ion exchange, affinity, HPLC, UPLC and other LC or LC MS-based techniques. Appropriate LC MS techniques include ICAT&#xae; (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA), or iTRAQ&#xae; (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Liquid chromatography (e.g. high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or low pressure liquid chromatography (LPLC)), thin-layer chromatography, NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy could also be used.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0101">Methods involving detection and/or quantification of one or more biomarkers of the invention can be performed on bench-top instruments, or can be incorporated onto disposable, diagnostic or monitoring platforms that can be used in a non-laboratory environment, e.g. in the physician's office or at the subject's bedside. Suitable biosensors for performing methods of the invention include &#x201c;credit&#x201d; cards with optical or acoustic readers. Biosensors can be configured to allow the data collected to be electronically transmitted to the physician for interpretation and thus can form the basis for e-medicine.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0102">The identification of biomarkers for a disease state permits integration of diagnostic procedures and therapeutic regimes. The biomarkers provide the means to indicate therapeutic response, failure to respond, unfavourable side-effect profile, degree of medication compliance and achievement of adequate serum drug levels. The biomarkers may be used to provide warning of adverse drug response. Biomarkers are useful in development of personalized therapies, as assessment of response can be used to fine-tune dosage, minimise the number of prescribed medications, reduce the delay in attaining effective therapy and avoid adverse drug reactions. Thus by monitoring a biomarker of the invention, subject care can be tailored precisely to match the needs determined by the disorder and the pharmacogenomic profile of the subject, the biomarker can thus be used to titrate the optimal dose, predict a positive therapeutic response and identify those subjects at high risk of severe side effects.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0103">Biomarker-based tests provide a first line assessment of &#x2018;new&#x2019; subjects, and provide objective measures for accurate and rapid diagnosis, not achievable using the current measures.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0104">Biomarker monitoring methods, biosensors and kits are also vital as subject monitoring tools, to enable the physician to determine whether relapse is due to worsening of the disorder. If pharmacological treatment is assessed to be inadequate, then therapy can be reinstated or increased; a change in therapy can be given if appropriate. As the biomarkers are sensitive to the state of the disorder, they provide an indication of the impact of drug therapy.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0105">References to &#x201c;subject&#x201d; or &#x201c;patient&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. The subject may be a human or an animal subject. In one embodiment, the subject is a human. In one embodiment, the subject is a (non-human) animal. In one embodiment, the subject is a non-human mammal, such as a dog, mouse, rat or horse, in particular a dog. The use, panels and methods described herein may be performed in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0106">In one embodiment, the subject is suspected of relapse to a vascular or haematological cancer. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is the name given to small numbers of leukaemic cells (cancer cells from the bone marrow) that remain in the person during treatment, or after treatment when the patient is in remission (i.e. patients with no symptoms or signs of disease). However, MRD is the major cause of relapse in cancer and leukaemia. Methods of the invention are therefore useful in monitoring patients who are suspected of relapse, particularly patients who are in remission from cancer.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0107">The subject tested using the methods described herein may present with symptoms indicative of haematological cancer, for example anaemia, leucocytosis and/or swollen lymph nodes. In one embodiment, the subject has a high level of leucocytosis. This may also be referred to a &#x201c;high white blood cell count&#x201d;. Haematological cancers typically cause increased proliferation of abnormal white or red blood cells which results in a high white blood cell count. However, leucocytosis is not sufficient to diagnose a patient with a haematological cancer (in particular leukaemia) because it is frequently a sign of an inflammatory response, most commonly the result of infection. Therefore, methods of the invention are able to provide a more specific method to detect patients who are likely to be suffering from a haematological cancer.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0108">Detecting and/or quantifying may be compared to a cut-off level. Cut-off values can be predetermined by analysing results from multiple patients and controls, and determining a suitable value for classifying a subject as with or without the disease. For example, for diseases where the level of biomarker is higher in patients suffering from the disease, then if the level detected is higher than the cut-off, the patient is indicated to suffer from the disease. Alternatively, for diseases where the level of biomarker is lower in patients suffering from the disease, then if the level detected is lower than the cut-off, the patient is indicated to suffer from the disease. The advantages of using simple cut-off values include the ease with which clinicians are able to understand the test and the elimination of any need for software or other aids in the interpretation of the test results. Cut-off levels can be determined using methods in the art.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0109">Detecting and/or quantifying may also be compared to a control. It will be clear to those skilled in the art that the control subjects may be selected on a variety of basis which may include, for example, subjects known to be free of the disease or may be subjects with a different disease (for example, for the investigation of differential diagnosis). The &#x201c;control&#x201d; may comprise a healthy subject, a non-diseased subject and/or a subject without a vascular or haematological cancer. Comparison with a control is well known in the field of diagnostics.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0110">Therefore, in one embodiment, the method additionally comprises comparing the level of said cell free nucleosomes in said plasma sample with one or more controls. For example, the method may comprise comparing the level of cell free nucleosomes present in a plasma sample obtained from the subject with the level of cell free nucleosomes present in a plasma sample obtained from a normal subject. The control may be a healthy subject. Alternatively, the control may be a diseased subject, such as subject with an infection.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0111">Alternatively, the control is a subject with a cancer which is not a vascular or haematological cancer, i.e. the control subject has a cancer which affects a different organ in the body. The data provided herein shows that biomarkers of the invention were significantly elevated in blood cancer patients compared to patients with other forms of cancer, therefore they may be used to differentially diagnose patients with vascular or haematological cancers over patients with other forms of cancer. Therefore, in one aspect the diagnosis comprises differential diagnosis of vascular or haematological cancer over non-vascular or non-haematological cancer. A &#x201c;non-vascular or non-haematological cancer&#x201d; is a cancer which is not a blood cancer and does not involve proliferation of the blood cells or vascular cells, such as bladder cancer, bone cancer, brain cancer, oesophageal cancer, head &#x26; neck cancer, skin cancer (such as melanoma), thyroid cancer, tongue cancer, uterine cancer and/or cervical cancer.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0112">The control may be a subject with a high level of leucocytosis. As discussed herein, leucocytosis is not a symptom which is unique to leukaemia. Therefore, methods of the invention may be used to compare a control with a high level of leucocytosis which is not the result of a vascular or haematological cancer, such as a control with inflammation, an infection and/or taking medication.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0113">In one embodiment, the level of cell free nucleosomes is elevated compared to the control.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0114">It will be understood that it is not necessary to measure controls levels for comparative purposes on every occasion. For example, for healthy/non-diseased controls, once the &#x2018;normal range&#x2019; is established it can be used as a benchmark for all subsequent tests. A normal range can be established by obtaining samples from multiple control subjects without a vascular or haematological cancer and testing for the level of biomarker. Results (i.e. biomarker levels) for subjects suspected to have a vascular or haematological cancer can then be examined to see if they fall within, or outside of, the respective normal range. Use of a &#x2018;normal range&#x2019; is standard practice for the detection of disease.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0115">In one embodiment, the method additionally comprises determining at least one clinical parameter for the patient. This parameter can be used in the interpretation of results. Clinical parameters may include any relevant clinical information for example, without limitation, gender, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status and dietary habits. Therefore, in one embodiment, the clinical parameter is selected from the group consisting of: age, sex and body mass index (BMI).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0116">In one embodiment, the method of the invention is performed to identify a subject at high risk of having a vascular or haematological cancer and therefore in need of further testing (i.e. further cancer investigations). The further testing may involve one or more of: biopsy (such as bone marrow biopsy or lymph node biopsy), cytogenetic testing, immunophenotyping, CT scanning, X-ray (in particular chest X-ray to identify swollen lymph nodes) and/or lumbar puncture.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0117">Methods and biomarkers described herein may be used to identify if a patient is in need of a biopsy, in particular a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Therefore, according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of identifying a patient in need of a biopsy comprising obtaining a plasma sample from said patient, detecting the level of cell free nucleosomes in the plasma sample, and using the results obtained from the panel test to identify whether the patient is in need of a biopsy.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0118">According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of identifying a patient in need of a biopsy comprising obtaining a plasma sample from said patient, applying the sample to a panel test as defined herein, and using the results obtained from the panel test to identify whether the patient is in need of a biopsy.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0119">Additional Biomarkers</p><p id="p-0105" num="0120">The level of cell free nucleosomes may be detected or measured as one of a panel of measurements. The panel may comprise different epigenetic features of the nucleosome as described hereinbefore (e.g. a histone isoform and a PTM). In one embodiment, the panel comprises one or more cytokines, such as one or more interleukins.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0121">Interleukins (ILs) are a group of cytokines, usually secreted by leukocytes, that act as signal molecules. They have key roles in stimulating immune responses and inflammation. They were first identified in the 1970s and have been designated numerically as more interleukin types have been discovered. Examples of interleukins include, but are not limited to: IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14 and IL-15.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0122">In one embodiment, the one or more interleukins is selected from the group consisting of: Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0123">The interleukin may be IL-6. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine with a wide variety of biological functions. It is a potent inducer of fever and the acute phase response. The sequence of human IL-6 is known in the art and is described at UniProt Accession No. P05231. In one particular embodiment, the interleukin may be IL-6 and the panel of measurements may comprise measurement of histone isoform H3.1 and IL-6.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0124">Alternatively, or additionally, the interleukin may be IL-10. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine with a wide variety of biological functions. The sequence of human IL-10 is known in the art and is described at UniProt Accession No. P22301. In one particular embodiment, the interleukin may be IL-10 and the panel of measurements may comprise measurement of histone post-translational modification H3cit and IL-10.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0125">Alternatively, or additionally, the interleukin may be IL-1&#x3b2;. Interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and is involved in a variety of cellular activities, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In one particular embodiment, the interleukin may be IL-1&#x3b2; and the panel of measurements may comprise measurement of histone isoform H3.1 and IL-1&#x3b2;. More particularly, the panel may comprise measurement of histone isoform H3.1 and IL-1&#x3b2;, wherein the vascular or haematological cancer is lymphoma, such as NHL.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0126">In one embodiment, the panel comprises an epigenetic feature of a cell free nucleosome and an interleukin. In another embodiment, the panel comprises an epigenetic feature of a cell free nucleosome and two interleukins. For example, the cell free nucleosome measurement can be combined with more than one interleukin measurement, such as IL-6 and IL-1&#x3b2; or IL-10 and IL-1&#x3b2; or IL-6 and IL-10. In a further embodiment, the epigenetic feature of a cell free nucleosome is selected from a histone isoform, such as H3.1, and a post translationally modified histone, such as H3cit. In a yet further embodiment, the panel of measurements is H3.1, IL-6 and IL-1&#x3b2;.

For each subject, a whole blood draw was collected in an EDTA vacutainer tube and the tube was inverted 10 times gently. The whole blood was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1500 g within 2 hours of blood draw. Plasma was transferred to a cryotube and frozen immediately. In the cohort, 62 subjects were healthy, 25 subjects had Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), 22 subjects had Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) and 7 subjects had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL). Subjects with leukaemia or lymphoma could be further categorised as patients with cancer at diagnosis (31 subjects in total; 16 subjects with NHL at diagnosis, 15 subjects with leukaemia at diagnosis), or patients with cancer from relapse (15 subjects in total; 6 subjects with NHL relapse, 9 subjects with leukaemia relapse).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0145">The samples were analysed for nucleosomes containing H3.1 by ELISA. In brief, measurements of nucleosomes containing histone isoform H3.1 were made as follows: 80 &#x3bc;l assay buffer and 20 &#x3bc;l of plasma sample or standard nucleosome preparation was added to a microtiter well coated with an antibody directed to bind to histone H3.1. The microtiter plate was covered and incubated with gentle shaking for 2.5 hours at room temperature. The contents of the microtiter wells were discarded. The wells were washed three times with 200 &#x3bc;l of a wash solution and 100 &#x3bc;l of a biotinylated anti-nucleosome antibody was added.

The treatment was successful and dog 1 was determined to be in remission on clinical grounds on day 160. The success of the CHOP treatment is reflected in the downward trend in nucleosome levels over the treatment course and disease remission was predicted by the near normal nucleosome levels by day 122. The results demonstrate that nucleosome levels are useful as a prognostic indicator and can be used to guide treatment regimens and to monitor subjects in remission for disease relapse.

He was monitored regularly by whole body CT scan every 2-3 months. He was noted to have recurrence 2 years later and this is reflected in a high level of circulating nucleosomes. The recurrence was treated successfully with doxorubicin, dacarbazine and an immunomodulatory agent as well as whole lung radiation and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and dog 2 was determined to be in remission based on whole body CT imaging. The success of the various treatments is reflected in the near normal nucleosome levels measured in January 2020. In February of 2020 dog 2 was diagnosed on imaging grounds as having a complete response, but interestingly the measured nucleosome levels began to rise in February before the imaging was able to detect progressive disease at the next scan in April 2020. The nucleosome levels remained high when progressive disease was noted in April. Had the nucleosome levels been known at the time of treatment, more intense monitoring would have been established for this patient in February. The results demonstrate that nucleosome levels can be used to guide treatment regimens and to monitor subjects in remission for disease relapse.

He was treated on day 1 with vincristine for Progressive Disease (PD) as part of a CHOP chemotherapy regimen. The vincristine treatment led to an improvement in clinical condition to Stable Disease (SD) which was reflected in a fall in nucleosome level as shown by the results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. However, CHOP treatment was discontinued due to both toxicity reasons and a lack of robust observed clinical response. Treatment with lomustine plus L-asparaginase (L-spar) was initiated on day 22 and followed by further lomustine treatments on days 34, 79, and 113. The clinical findings improved to partial remission on day 34 and 79 as determined through tumour measurements and then to complete response (CR) to treatment on days 113 and 145 by which time dog 3 was in remission and no further chemotherapy was administered. Nucleosome levels rose between days 22-34 and then fell consistently from day 34 onwards, predicting the success of the lomustine treatment later observed clinically as complete response on days 113 and 145. Moreover, nucleosome levels fell into the range observed for healthy dogs on day 145 in accord with the clinical findings. CRP levels were always within the normal range and were not useful for clinical purposes.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0170">Dog 4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>) was diagnosed with Stage Vb intra-abdominal, hypercalcaemic, lymphoma. He was started on a CHOP chemotherapy regime of vincristine and doxorubicin on day 1 through to day 93 and his response to treatment was monitored based on circulating calcium levels. It was appreciated clinically by the veterinarians that there was some response to vincristine but no response to doxorubicin. Treatment was then switched from CHOP to lomustine plus L-spar on days 108-164 which he also did not respond to. As a response to vincristine had been noticed, treatment by COP (CHOP without the use of doxorubicin) was initiated on day 164 using vincristine (a blood sample could not be taken on day 167). Dog 4 responded to COP therapy and was still responding to treatment at the time of writing. The measured nucleosome levels reflect the observed clinical findings (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>). There was a decrease in nucleosome level at most time points following treatment with vincristine reflecting the response to this therapy and an increase in nucleosome level after each dose of doxorubicin reflecting the lack of response to this treatment. Dog 4 was also clinically found to have a partial response to cyclophosphamide which was also reflected in a decreased nucleosome concentration. However, nucleosome levels remained above normal levels indicating the continuing need for further treatment. Nucleosome measurements clearly correlate to clinical findings and can be used to monitor disease remission and to guide treatment selection. For example, nucleosome levels predicted the lack of response to doxorubicin therapy which may have been discontinued earlier if informed by nucleosome levels. CRP analysis did not show any significant variation and was not useful for clinical purposes.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
