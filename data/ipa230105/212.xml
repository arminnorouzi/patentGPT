For example, a perimeter of a flat upper is the area that extends along the boundary of that upper. The perimeter, as used herein, includes the edge that defines the outer boundary as well as an area inbound of the edge that can receive at least some portions of the gathering system as described herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;perimeter direction&#x201d; refers to a direction that extends generally along the perimeter of an upper and can vary along different locations along the perimeter. For example, the perimeter direction of an upper at a particular location along the perimeter extends towards immediately adjacent locations along the perimeter of that upper.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term &#x201c;gathering system&#x201d; refers to a structure that includes a string, cord, cable, or other elongate member (generally referred to as a &#x201c;gathering string&#x201d;) that is movably secured to a portion of the upper. &#x201c;Movably secured,&#x201d; as used herein, means that an element (e.g., gathering string) is movable along at least one direction (e.g., a peripheral direction) relative to another structure (e.g., the upper), while being at least party constrained in at least one other direction (e.g., a lateral or medial direction) by one or more &#x201c;securing members.&#x201d; In some embodiments, the &#x201c;securing member&#x201d; can comprise a series of stitches that extend over at least a portion of the gathering string.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the term &#x201c;gathering string path&#x201d; refers to a path in which the gathering string extends and includes a first portion that is at least partially enclosed by securing member(s) (e.g., a &#x201c;secured portion&#x201d; of the gathering string path) and a second portion that in which the gathering string is not enclosed by securing members (e.g., an &#x201c;unsecured portion&#x201d; of the gathering string path). As used herein, the term &#x201c;gathering pattern&#x201d; refers to a pattern associated with the gathering string path. As will be understood from the disclosure here, the gathering pattern can vary depending on the location of the securing members</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, the term &#x201c;sole structure&#x201d; refers to any combination of materials that provides support for a wearer's foot and bears the surface that is in direct contact with the ground or playing surface, such as, for example, a single sole; a combination of an outsole and an inner sole; a combination of an outsole, a midsole, and an inner sole; and a combination of an outer covering, an outsole, a midsole and an inner sole.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the term &#x201c;fixedly attached&#x201d; refers to two components joined in a manner such that the components may not be readily separated from one another without destroying and/or damaging one or both of the components.

Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, suitable methods and materials are described below. The materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting. Other features of the disclosure are apparent from the detailed description, claims, abstract, and drawings.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The Disclosed Technology</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Various methods of forming an article of footwear using gathering systems and articles of footwear formed using the gathering systems are described herein.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, a method of forming of an article of footwear is provided. The method includes providing an upper in a substantially flat orientation, securing a gathering string along at least a portion of a perimeter of a first surface of the upper with a securing member that is attached to the upper, the gathering string being movable relative to the securing member, positioning the upper on a last, and applying tension to the gathering string to at least partially conform the upper to a shape of the last.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the gathering string comprises at least one crossing portion that extends from a first location along the perimeter of the upper to a second location along the perimeter of the upper. The first location is spaced apart from the second location of the upper, such as from a medial side to a lateral side of the upper. In some embodiments, two or more crossing portions can be provided, and in some cases, the two or more crossing portions can intersect. The intersection can be at one or more of a midfoot region, a heel region, and/or a forefoot region.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the securing member comprises a plurality of stitches that capture the gathering string along the at least a portion of the perimeter, such as along at least 50 percent, 60%, 70%, or 80% of the perimeter of the upper. In some embodiments, the gathering string has a first portion that overlaps with a second portion along the perimeter of the upper, either in an adjacent manner or spaced apart from one another to define separate paths. The article of footwear can include a sole structure attached to the upper after applying tension to the gathering string.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another embodiment, an article of footwear is provided that includes an upper, a gathering string extending along at least a portion of a perimeter of a first surface of the upper, and a sole structure secured to the upper so that at least a portion of the gathering string is secured between the sole structure and the upper. The gathering string can be in tension so that the upper conformed to a last during construction of the article.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, a securing member, such as a plurality of stitches, are attached to the upper with at least a portion of the securing member being secured between the sole structure and the upper. The securing member extends along at least a portion of the gathering string to maintain the gathering string along the perimeter during construction of the upper.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Exemplary Embodiments of the Disclosed Technology</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an upper <b>100</b> of an article of footwear with an exterior surface <b>102</b> on which a gathering system <b>104</b> has been provided. The gathering system <b>104</b> includes a gathering string <b>106</b> that extends along at a portion of an outer perimeter <b>108</b> of the upper <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Upper <b>100</b> may include one or more material elements (for example, textiles, foam, leather, and synthetic leather), which may be stitched, adhesively bonded, molded, or otherwise formed to define an interior void configured to receive a foot. The material elements may be selected and arranged to selectively impart properties such as durability, air-permeability, wear-resistance, flexibility, and comfort.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the gathering string <b>106</b> is at least partially constrained in portions of the perimeter by a securing members <b>110</b>. The securing members <b>110</b> comprise a plurality of stitches that capture the gathering string <b>106</b> between a portion of the stitches that extend over the gathering string <b>106</b> and the exterior surface <b>102</b> of the upper <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Various securing members can be used so long as the securing member is capable of moveably securing the gathering string at or adjacent to at least a portion of the perimeter of the upper as disclosed herein. Although the stitch may extend over the perimeter edge in some embodiments, the securing member preferably is positioned entirely inward from the perimeter edge of the upper. That is, in some embodiments, unlike some conventional stroebel stitching methods where a portion of the securing member (e.g., stitch) extends over an edge of the upper to secure the upper to a sole structure, the securing member can be positioned inward of the perimeter edge and is not secured to the sole structure. In this manner, a portion of the upper extends from an outwardmost edge of the stitch to the perimeter edge.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Providing a portion of the upper that extends outward from the securing member can facilitate application of the securing member. For example, in some embodiments, the upper may include one or more tab portions that extend outward for retention of the upper in the flat configuration by another structure (e.g., a form <b>140</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Alternatively, or in addition to tabs, the upper can be retained in a flat configuration by other means, such as pockets formed along the perimeter edge (e.g., by folding over a portion of the upper) that receive an extending member of a form, holes that receive one or more pins, and/or removable stitches applied at an outwardly extending portion of the upper. As discussed in more details below, in some embodiments, portions of the upper that extend outward from the secured portion can be removed before attaching a sole structure to the upper.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In embodiments where the securing member comprises a stitch, the stitch can be any stitch suitable to movably retain the gathering string for the purposes described herein. Preferably, the stitch provides a pathway (e.g., a tunnel or passageway) in which the gathering string is at least partially enclosed. In some embodiments, the stitch can be a lock stitch that does not extend over the perimeter edge of the upper.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The gathering system <b>104</b> can be applied to the upper <b>100</b> as part of a flat-forming process of the upper (e.g., while the upper is maintained in a substantially flat condition). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary gathering pattern is provided. A gathering pattern is a pattern associated with the gathering string path and, in some embodiments, can include portions of the gathering string path that are secured or unsecured by the securing members (e.g., stitching). In some areas, the unsecured portions can also be crossing portions in which the gathering string crosses from one side of the upper to another (e.g., from a medial side to a lateral side). For example, the upper <b>100</b> reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a first side <b>114</b> (e.g., a medial side) and a second side <b>116</b> (e.g., lateral side).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The gathering string <b>108</b> has a first end <b>112</b> and a second end <b>118</b>, and the gathering string <b>108</b> is secured along at least a portion of the first side <b>114</b> (e.g., a medial side) and at least a portion of the second side <b>116</b>. In addition, between the first and second ends <b>112</b>, <b>118</b>, there are at least two crossing portions <b>120</b> that extend across the exterior surface <b>102</b> between the first and second sides <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The exemplary gathering system <b>104</b> is described below by the path in which the gathering string <b>106</b> is secured to the upper <b>100</b> by the securing members <b>110</b>. For convenience, the upper <b>100</b> is described as having a forefoot region <b>122</b>, a midfoot region <b>124</b>, and a heel region <b>126</b>. Any suitable system for applying the securing members <b>110</b> to the outer perimeter <b>108</b> of the upper <b>100</b> and thereby capturing the gathering string <b>106</b> can be used. For example, in the disclosed embodiment, the gathering string <b>106</b> is capture by a plurality of stitches that extend along outer perimeter. The laying of the gathering string <b>106</b> and application of the stitches can be achieved, for example, by an embroidery machine or the like.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the embroidery machine begins capturing the gathering string <b>106</b> at location A on the first side <b>114</b> and continue in the direction of the arrows along the outer perimeter <b>108</b> in the forefoot region <b>122</b> and continue on the second side <b>116</b> moving in the direction of the heel region <b>126</b>. At location B, the gathering string <b>106</b> can move across the exterior surface <b>102</b> of the upper <b>100</b> back to the first side at location C. The gathering string <b>106</b> defines a first crossing portion <b>120</b> between locations B and C. In some embodiments, locations B and C are offset from each other relative to a longitudinal axis <b>128</b> of the upper <b>100</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, location B is closer to the forefoot region than location C.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">From location C, the gathering string <b>106</b> is captured along the outer perimeter <b>108</b> in the direction of heel region <b>126</b>. At location D, near a heel end <b>130</b> of the first side <b>114</b> of the upper <b>100</b>, the gathering string <b>106</b> can move back across the exterior surface of the upper to location E on the second side <b>116</b> of the upper <b>100</b>, thereby forming a second crossing portion <b>120</b> between locations D and E.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">From location E, the gathering string <b>106</b> is captured along the outer perimeter <b>108</b> of the second side <b>116</b> moving towards the forefoot region <b>122</b>. At location F on the second side <b>116</b>, the gathering string <b>106</b> can move back across the exterior surface of the upper to location G on the first side <b>114</b> of the upper <b>100</b>, thereby forming a third crossing portion <b>120</b> between locations F and G. As noted above with the first crossing portion, locations F and G can be offset from each other relative to a longitudinal axis <b>128</b> of the upper <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">From location G, the gathering string <b>106</b> is captured along the outer perimeter <b>108</b> of the second side <b>114</b> moving again towards the forefoot region <b>122</b>, along the outer perimeter <b>108</b> along the forefoot region <b>122</b> and back over to the second side <b>116</b> to a location H, with the second end <b>118</b> extending away from location H. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a first free portion <b>130</b> is formed between first end <b>112</b> and location A, and a second free portion <b>132</b> is formed between second end <b>118</b> and location H.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, a portion of the gathering string can overlap with another portion of the gathering string along the outer perimeter. For example, as described above, the portion of the gathering string that extends between locations A and B at least partially overlaps with the portion of the gathering string that extends between locations G and H. In some embodiments, overlapping portions can be offset from one another so that one of the portions is closer to the outer perimeter the other at a particular location along the outer perimeter (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Alternatively, the overlapping portions can include a first securing portion entirely positioned within a second securing portion (e.g., the second securing portion has a wider stitch that extends across the entirety of the first securing portion) or the overlapping portions can include a first securing portion that partially overlaps with the second securing portion (e.g., either with or without the strings in the overlapping portion of the two securing portions).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternatively, the gathering string can have no overlapping portions. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, rather than crossing and returning to the forefoot region for a second &#x201c;pass&#x201d; between location G and H, the gathering string could start at location A, extend along the forefoot region to location B, cross to location C, extend to location D, cross to location E, and finish at location F with a portion of the gathering string extending from location F to provide the second free end.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, two or more different crossing portions <b>120</b> can intersect (e.g., cross over) one another between the first and second sides <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. In other words, when viewed from above, two crossing portions <b>120</b> can have a point of intersection with each other where one crossing portion overlaps with another crossing portion.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of the gathering system discussed above in which one or more uppers <b>100</b> are secured to and/or by a form <b>140</b> (e.g., a frame or jig) to help maintain the uppers in position and/or help guide the application of the gathering string and/or securing members to the upper.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">After the gathering system <b>104</b> is applied to the upper <b>100</b>, the upper <b>100</b> can be formed on a last <b>142</b> by positioning the upper <b>100</b> on the last <b>142</b> and moving the crossing portions <b>120</b> to a sole side of the upper <b>100</b>. A last, such as last <b>142</b>, is a tool form about which an article of footwear can be constructed and which, at least in part, can define the contours, shape, style, and other characteristics of a resulting article of footwear. For example, an interior volume of the lasted upper <b>100</b> is received on last <b>142</b> for further processing as described herein, including forming the outer perimeter of the upper into the shape of the last and adding a sole structure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Depending on the construction of the upper <b>100</b>, one or more additional processing steps may be performed before manipulating the gathering system to form the desired three-dimensional shape of the upper. For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the two sides of the heel <b>130</b> can be secured together, such as by stitching <b>144</b>. Stitching <b>144</b> or other steps in the process of forming the three-dimensional shape of the upper can be performed on the last or prior to placement of the upper on the last. When the heel portions are stitched together, the crossing portion <b>120</b> at the heel region can be substantially closed by tightening the gathering string.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates the upper <b>100</b> positioned on a last <b>142</b> with the crossing portions <b>120</b> moved to the sole side of the upper <b>100</b>. The two ends <b>112</b>, <b>118</b> of the gathering string <b>106</b> can be pulled to tighten the gathering string, which in turn pulls the outer perimeter of the upper <b>100</b> to conform to the shape of the last <b>142</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, for example, the upper <b>100</b>, including its outer perimeter, conforms to the shape of the last <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the two crossing portions <b>120</b> pull opposing sides of the outer perimeter <b>108</b> of the upper <b>100</b> towards each other, which further helps conform the upper <b>100</b> to the last <b>142</b>. The number of crossing portions can vary, as can the location of crossing portions along the medial and lateral sides of the upper. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, two crossing portions <b>120</b> are provided in the midfoot region <b>124</b>. Crossing portions in the midfoot region can be helpful to conform the upper in the region of the arches on the last since that is a region, in some articles, that the upper may be required to narrow more to conform to the last. Depending on the article of footwear, however, one or more crossing portions can be alternatively, or additionally, provided in other areas. For example, one or more crossing portions can be provided in one or more of a forefoot, midfoot, and/or heel region.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, as discussed above, the crossing portions can be offset relative to the longitudinal axis. This offset can be helpful to further conform the upper to the last. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates two crossing portions <b>120</b>, with one being offset by a distance L<b>1</b> and the second being offset by a distance L<b>2</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, L<b>1</b> is less than L<b>2</b>; however, the distances could be the same if desirable. Alternatively, in some embodiments the offset of a crossing portion can be substantially zero, such that the locations on each side are substantially at the same location relative to the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As discussed herein, the gathering system includes a secured portion of the gathering string that extends along portions of the outer perimeter <b>108</b> of the upper <b>100</b>. Preferably, the outside edge of the secured portion is 2 cm or less from the outer perimeter. Positioning the secured portion close to the outer perimeter edge can, for example, reduce bunching of material when the upper is formed into its three-dimensional shape. In some embodiments, it may be helpful to remove portions of the upper between the outer perimeter and the secured portion of the gathering system to reduce the gap between the outer perimeter and the secured portion. For example, to reduce the distance between the outer perimeter and secured portion, the portion therebetween can be trimmed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Tightening of the gathering system can be achieved by any suitable system that can apply suitable pressure to the ends of the gathering string to conform the upper to the last. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a fastening system <b>150</b> that gathers the two gathering string ends and applies a force to conform the upper <b>100</b> to the last <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">After the gathering system is tightened (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>), a sole structure can be applied to upper. To maintain the tightened upper configuration, the two ends of the gathering string can be secured to the upper and or to each other in some manner (e.g., tied and/or secured by any other coupling mechanism such as a mechanical fastener, adhesive, and/or a suitable thermal process). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates the two ends secured by a knot <b>146</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Alternatively, the upper can be maintained in the desired three-dimensional form without continuous application of force to the gathering string and/or without securing the gathering strings at its ends. For example, the gathering string can be selected to have sufficient friction in contact with the securing members to hold the upper in the desired three dimensional form until a sole structure is attached.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an upper <b>100</b> on a last <b>142</b>, with a sole structure <b>152</b> adjacent the upper <b>100</b> for application thereto. Sole structure <b>104</b> has a lower surface <b>154</b> (e.g., a ground contacting surface) and an upper surface <b>156</b>. Although sole structure <b>152</b> is illustrated as a single structure in the embodiments that follow, other types of sole structures can be used, such as, for example, any combination of an outsole, midsole, and inner sole. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, after a lower surface of the lasted upper <b>100</b> is coupled to the upper surface <b>156</b> of the sole structure <b>152</b>, the article of footwear can be removed from the last <b>142</b>. The upper can be secured to the sole structure in any suitable manner, including for example, by adhesives, mechanical bonding, and the like. For example, cement, or other bonding materials, can be applied to the outer perimeter of the upper and the upper can be secured to the upper surface <b>156</b> of the sole structure <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The construction of the upper described herein can eliminate the need for an insole and in some embodiments, the article of footwear has a midsole that is in direct contact with the foot of a wearer. Alternatively, if desired, an insole, such as sockliner, can be provided within the void of the article of footwear to provide additional support and/or cushioning. The sockliner can comprise one or more layers of material and/or be formed in a unitary construction that can be placed inside the article of footwear.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates another exemplary upper <b>200</b> positioned on a last <b>242</b> with a pair of crossing portions <b>220</b> moved to the sole side of the upper <b>100</b>. The gathering system <b>204</b> includes a secured portion of the gathering string <b>206</b> that extends along portions of the outer perimeter <b>208</b> of the upper <b>200</b>. A force is applied to the gathering string <b>206</b> (e.g., at the two ends) to tighten the gathering string, which in turn pulls the outer perimeter of the upper <b>200</b> to conform to the shape of the last <b>242</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As in other embodiments, crossing portions can be provided to facilitate conforming the upper to the last in different portions of the article. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, crossing portions <b>220</b> pull opposing sides of the outer perimeter <b>208</b> of the upper <b>200</b> towards each other in the midfoot region <b>224</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates another exemplary upper <b>300</b> positioned on a last <b>342</b>. The gathering system <b>304</b> includes a secured portion of the gathering string <b>306</b> that extends along an area of the outer perimeter <b>308</b> of the upper <b>300</b>. In this embodiment, portions of the gathering string <b>306</b> are spaced apart at the perimeter <b>308</b> of the upper <b>300</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the gathering string path includes an external path <b>358</b> and an internal path <b>360</b>. The external path <b>3658</b> is spaced apart from the internal path <b>360</b> with the external path being closer to the perimeter <b>308</b>. In some embodiments, the same gathering string <b>306</b> can extend through both the external and internal paths <b>358</b>, <b>360</b>. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the gathering string <b>308</b> can first form the external path and then cross over to form the internal path (or vice versa). In other embodiments, a first gathering string can define the external path and a second gathering string can define the internal path. In such an embodiment, both first and second strings can be tightened together (sequentially and/or simultaneously) to conform the upper to the last <b>342</b>. Two or more spaced apart paths, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, can, in some cases, help the upper conform more closely to the shape of the last. In some embodiments, one or both of the two paths can be non-overlapping (along the perimeter direction). For example, the first path can extend along the entire perimeter while the second path only extends in one or more of the forefoot, midfoot, or heel regions.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> also illustrate an exemplary embodiment in which more than two crossing portions <b>120</b> intersect (e.g., cross over) one another between the first and second sides <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a two pairs of crossing portions <b>320</b>. One pair is in the region of the arches in the midfoot and the other pair is positioned closer to (or in) the forefoot region.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates another exemplary gathering system <b>404</b> applied to another upper <b>400</b>. As in other embodiments, the gathering string <b>406</b> is capture by a plurality of stitches that extend along outer perimeter; however, the upper <b>400</b> is constructed so that it is stitched together along a lateral or medial side, rather than at the heel.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, an embroidery machine can begin capturing the gathering string <b>406</b> at location A on the first side <b>414</b> and continue in the direction of the arrows along the outer perimeter <b>408</b> in the forefoot region and continue on the second side <b>416</b> moving in the direction of the heel region. At location B, the gathering string <b>406</b> can move across the exterior surface <b>402</b> of the upper <b>400</b> back to the first side at location C. The gathering string <b>406</b> defines a first crossing portion <b>420</b> between locations B and C.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">From location C, the gathering string <b>406</b> is captured along the outer perimeter <b>408</b> in the direction of heel region. At location D, near a heel end <b>430</b> of the first side <b>414</b> of the upper <b>400</b>, the gathering string <b>406</b> can cross over the darted heel area to location E on the other side of the heel end <b>430</b>, thereby forming a second crossing portion <b>420</b> between locations D and E.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">From location E, the gathering string <b>406</b> is captured along the outer perimeter <b>408</b> until it reaches location F. At location F, the gathering string <b>106</b> can move back across the exterior surface of the upper to location G, thereby forming a third crossing portion <b>420</b> between locations F and G.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">From location G, the gathering string <b>406</b> is captured along the outer perimeter <b>408</b> of the second side <b>414</b> moving again towards the forefoot region, along the outer perimeter <b>408</b> along the forefoot region <b>422</b> and back over to the second side <b>416</b> to a location H, with the second end <b>418</b> extending away from location H.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">To form the upper of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, first and second portions <b>466</b>, <b>468</b> of the upper can be stitched together (either on a last or before applying to a last), the upper <b>400</b> can be positioned on a last and the crossing portions can be moved to the sole side of the upper <b>400</b>. Thus, in construction, the crossing portion between B and C and the crossing portion between F and G extend across a midfoot region of the upper.
