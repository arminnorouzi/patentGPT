A transmission side may transmit data from the network layer to the physical layer and a reception side may transmit data from the physical layer to the network layer. The purpose of the link layer is to compress (abstract) all input packet types into one format for processing by the physical layer and to secure flexibility and expandability of an input packet type which is not defined yet. In addition, the link layer may provide option for compressing (abstracting) unnecessary information of the header of input packets to efficiently transmit input data. Operation such as overhead reduction, encapsulation, etc. of the link layer is referred to as a link layer protocol and packets generated using this protocol may be referred to as link layer packets. The link layer may perform functions such as packet encapsulation, overhead reduction and/or signaling transmission. In the present disclosure, the link layer protocol is referred to as an ATSC link layer protocol (ALP), and the link layer packet is referred to as an ALP packet.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">At the transmission side, the link layer may perform an overhead reduction procedure with respect to input packets and then encapsulate the input packets into link layer packets. In addition, in some embodiments, the link layer may perform encapsulation into the link layer packets without performing the overhead reduction procedure. Due to use of the link layer protocol, data transmission overhead on the physical layer may be significantly reduced and the link layer protocol according to present disclosure may provide IP overhead reduction and/or MPEG-2 TS overhead reduction.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">When IP packets are input as input packets, the link layer may sequentially perform IP header compression, adaptation and/or encapsulation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In some embodiments, some processes may be omitted. At this time, a pre-processing module may be used prior to an RoHC module for optimal operation of IP header compression. First, when IP packets fragmented from a single IP packet are input, the pre-processing module collects the IP packets and recovers to the IP packet prior to fragmentation by performing pre-processing and then the recovered IP packet to the RoHC module. When the input IP packet is not an IP packet fragmented from the IP packet, the IP packet outputs to the RoHC module without performing pre-processing.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">The RoHC module may perform IP packet header compression for IP packets input to reduce unnecessary overhead. Context information may be extracted from the compressed header by performing the adaptation procedure in an adaptation module and transmitted out of band. The IP header compression and the adaption procedure may be collectively referred to as IP header compression. Also, the pre-processing, the IP header compression and the adaption procedure may be collectively referred to as IP header compression. Thereafter, the IP packets and/or the header compressed packets and/or context information may be encapsulated into link layer packets by performing the encapsulation procedure in an encapsulation module. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the pre-processing module, the RoHC module, and the adaption module may be collectively referred to as an IP header compression unit and the IP header compression unit and the encapsulation module may be collectively referred to as an ALP stream generator. That is, the ALP stream generator is a single ALP stream generator generating a single ALP stream. The ALP stream may be referred to as a link layer stream.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">When MPEG 2 TS packets are input as input packets, the link layer may sequentially perform overhead reduction and/or an encapsulation procedure with respect to the TS packets. In some embodiments, some procedures may be omitted. In overhead reduction, the link layer may provide sync byte removal, null packet deletion and/or common header removal (compression). Through sync byte removal, overhead reduction of 1 byte may be provided per TS packet. Null packet deletion may be performed in a manner in which reinsertion is possible at the reception side. In addition, deletion (compression) may be performed in a manner in which common information between consecutive headers may be restored at the reception side. Some of the overhead reduction procedures may be omitted. Thereafter, through the encapsulation procedure, the TS packets may be encapsulated into link layer packets. The link layer packet structure for encapsulation of the TS packets may be different from that of the other types of packets.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">Next, IP header compression will be described.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">The IP packets may have a fixed header format but some information necessary for a communication environment may be unnecessary for a broadcast environment. The link layer protocol may compress the header of the IP packet to provide a mechanism for reducing broadcast overhead.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">A transmitter may include an RoHC module (or header compressor) and/or an adaptation module for IP header compression as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The RoHC module may reduce the size of headers of IP packets based on a RoHC method. Then, adaptation module may extract context information from the header compressed IP packets and generate signaling information related to header compression.

Hereinafter, IP header compression may mean only IP header compression by an RoHC module and may be a concept that combines IP header compression by the RoHC module and the adaptation procedure by the adaptation module. This may be the same as in decompressing of the receiver.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">In the present disclosure, for convenience of description, IP packets prior to compression will be referred to as data packets, and packets after compression in RoHC type will be referred to as RoHC packets (or header compressed data packets).

At this time, in one embodiment, the UDP header is added to UDP payload, which includes the data processed in accordance with the MMTP or ROUTE protocol, to generate UDP packet, and the IP header is added to the UDP packet to generate IP/UDP packet. In the present disclosure, for convenience of description, the packet that includes the IP header, the UDP header and the payload or the packet that includes the IP header and the payload will be referred to as IP packet or data packet.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">In one embodiment, IP version, source IP address, destination IP address, IP fragment flag, source port number, destination port number of information included in an IP header and a UDP header of IP packets are little changed during IP streaming. In the present disclosure, fields for transmitting information which is little changed during streaming will be referred to as static fields. Also, information transmitted to the static fields will be referred to as static information. In the present disclosure, the static information is used to refer to static chain information. In RoHC compression, after such static information is transmitted once, additional information is not performed for a while. This will be referred to as Initialization and Refresh (IR) state, and RoHC packets for transmitting the static information to the header will be referred to as IR packets.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In addition, additional transmission is separately performed for dynamic information frequently changed but maintained for a certain time. The dynamic information is transmitted through a dynamic field, and is used to mean the same as the dynamic chain information in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">RoHC packets for transmitting the dynamic information to the header will be referred to as IR-DYN packets. In one embodiment, the IR packets also include dynamic information.

The IP packets fragmented from one IP packet have the same IP-ID field value. The IP packets which are not fragmented have different values. In the present disclosure, for convenience of description, the packets fragmented from one IP packet will be referred to as fragmented packets or fragmented IP packets.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">The DF field indicates whether a corresponding packet has been fragmented. The RND field is a flag indicating whether IP-ID is randomly operated. For example, if the DF field value is 0, it indicates that the corresponding packet is a fragmented packet, and if the DF field value is 1, it indicates that the corresponding packet is a packet which is not fragmented. The NBO field is a field indicating whether the IP-ID corresponds to a network byte order (NBO). The dynamic chain information may further include a more fragment (MF) flag field and a fragment offset field. The MF flag field indicates whether the corresponding packet is the last fragmented packet. For example, if the MF flag field value is 0, it indicates that the corresponding packet is the last fragmented packet, and if the MF flag field value is 1, it indicates that more fragmented packets exist. In other words, if the MF flag field value is 1, it indicates that the corresponding packet is not the last fragmented packet. The fragmented offset field indicates a relative position of the corresponding fragmented packet in a data region within IP packets when the IP packets are fragmented.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">If there is no IP fragmentation, all IP-ID field values of the IP packets which will be input are &#x2018;0x00&#x2019;, and the value of the DF field is always &#x2018;1&#x2019;. In this case, IP-ID encoding is not used. A context value of IP-ID is set to &#x2018;0x00&#x2019;, and context information of IP-ID is not updated. The context value of the DF in a dynamic chain is set to &#x2018;1&#x2019;. This case will be referred to as an unused IP-ID case.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">If IP fragmentation is either present or its presence is unknown, IP-ID values of the input IP packets are monotonically increased, and the value of the DF field is always &#x2018;0&#x2019;. Even though the fragmented packets are re-assembled prior to RoHC module, the IP-ID fields are compressed. In this case, the IP-ID is encoded by an offset IP-ID encoding scheme. A context of the IP-ID is updated based on the offset IP-ID encoding scheme. In the dynamic chain, the context value of the DF field is set to &#x2018;0&#x2019;. This case will be referred to as a sequential IP-ID case.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">The checksum field is optional, and the receiver calculates checksum for all packets for error detection of data, wherein checksum is only used in the UDP header. If the test result of the checksum field is different from the original data, the receiver discards data before moving to an application layer (that is, upper layer). In addition, if the checksum field value is 0x0000, the receiver does not perform a checksum test.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">The SN field displays a sequence number indicating the order of each packet included in packet streams. In one embodiment, the SN field is located next to the checksum field and generated in the IP header compressor (that is, compressor). The sequence number may be used for synchronization between an RoHC-U Description Table (RDT) and a compressed packet.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">Meanwhile, the other packets except the IR packet and the IR-DYN packet among the RoHC packets will be referred to as compressed packets. In one embodiment, a header of each compressed packet (or compressed packet) includes 1-2 byte information only.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, the IP header further includes a total length field, and the UDP header further includes a length field. The total length field of the IP header indicates a sum size of the IP header and the actual data region in a byte unit. That is, the total length field of the IP header indicates a total length of the corresponding IP packet. The length field of the UDP header indicates a sum size of the UDP header and the actual data region in a byte unit. That is, the length field of the UDP header indicates a total length of the corresponding IP packet. In accordance with the operation of ROHC, the total length field and the length field are not transmitted from the compressor (that is, IP header compressor) of the transmitting side to the decompressor (that is, IP header decompressor) of the receiving side.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">Next, fragmentation of the IP packets will be described.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">When a size of an IP packet to be transmitted from the IP/UDP layer to the link layer is greater than a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), fragmentation is performed for the IP packet, whereby the IP packet is split into two or more fragmented packets and then transmitted. In this case, in one embodiment, the MTU means a size of data that may be transmitted from the IP/UDP layer to the link layer at one time. That is, if the size of the IP packet to be transmitted to the link layer is greater than the MTU, the IP packet cannot be transmitted, whereby fragmentation is performed for the IP packet.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">If fragmentation is performed for the IP packet, the IP packet is split into two or more fragments and IP header is added to the front of each fragment to generate fragment packets. In other words, each fragment packet is an IP packet comprised of an IP header and a payload.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">For example, it is assumed that one IP packet having the UDP/IP header is fragmented into three IP packets. In this case, the same IP-ID field value is maintained in each IP header of three fragmented packets but different fragment offset field values are present. The DF flag field values within each IP header of the three fragmented packets are all se to 0, and therefore indicate that the corresponding packets are fragmented packets.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">At this time, the UDP header is only present in the first fragmented packet, and the IP header is present in all of three fragmented packets.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">Meanwhile, the RoHC scheme is used for header compression of the IP packets as described above. In one embodiment, considering characteristics of ATSC 3.0 broadcast link, RoHC framework operates in a unidirectional mode (U-mode). A plurality of header compression files are defined in the RoHC framework. Each profile indicates a specific protocol combination, and profile identifiers are allocated by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). In one embodiment, &#x2018;0x0002&#x2019; profile is used for ATSC 3.0.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">Next, an example of RoHC profile defined for ATSC 3.0 will be described.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">That is, the Profile Identifier is 0x0002, Profile is RoHC UDP, Protocol Combination is UDP/IP, and Reference standard is RFC 3095 and RFC 4815.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">That is, if even any one of the IP header and the UDP header does not exist in the header of the input IP packets, the RoHC module of the link layer does not perform header compression.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">Therefore, if it is assumed that one IP packet having the UDP/IP header is fragmented into three IP packets as described above, header compression is not performed for the other two fragmented IP packets having no UDP header. In other words, the RoHC module applies an uncompressed profile of which profile number is 0x00 if IP packets having no UDP header are input by IP fragmentation. At this time, header compression efficiency may not be expected for the uncompressed profile because the uncompressed profile transmits an actual IP header as it is by using RoHC header format.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">That is, header compression is performed for IP packet having the IP header and the UDP header by 0x02 profile, whereas header compression is performed for IP packet having the IP header but having no UDP header by 0x00 profile.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">If IP header compression is performed as above, some problems may occur. That is, if a compressed profile is changed in the middle of packet streams, a problem occurs in that system complexity and delay are increased. If a single type packet stream is delivered, one profile and RoHC packet structure according to one profile may be used but additional profile for IP fragmentation should be configured and correspond to additional RoHC packet structure. Also, delay occurs in the transmitter when converting a profile, and the receiver needs much memory capacity for synchronization between packet streams header compressed using different profiles. In order that a bandwidth is efficiently used based on RoHC and at the same time mass broadcast streams are quickly transmitted and received, it is important to reduce overhead. In order to reduce overhead, it is most effective to increase capacity for a broadcast transmitting network but a problem occurs in that much cost and time are required for updating an infrastructure of a broadcast system.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">In the present disclosure, in order to the above problem, a pre-processing module is provided prior to the RoHC module, and the IP packets fragmented in the pre-processing module are re-assembled into the original unfragmented IP packets and then output to the RoHC module.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">That is, in one embodiment, if the IP packets input by referring to the IP header of the input IP packets are fragmented IP packets, until all fragmented IP packets constituting the corresponding IP/UDP packets are received, the fragmented IP packets are stored in the buffer or memory. If the fragmented IP packets constituting the corresponding IP/UDP packets are all received, the received fragmented IP packets are combined and recovered to the original IP/UDP packets.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">Then, since the IP packets input to the RoHC module include the IP header and the UDP header, header compression is performed in 0x02 profile, and consideration for the other profiles is not required.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">Meanwhile, the RoHC framework defines RoHC channels to identify a compressed packet flow, that is, RoHC packet flow.

In one embodiment of the present disclosure, this parameter is inferred from the max_CID field in RDT. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the decompressor regards that the LARGE_CIDS parameter as &#x2018;false&#x2019; if the max_CID field has a value smaller than or equal to 15, and regards the LARGE_CIDS parameter as &#x2018;true&#x2019; if the max_CID field has a value greater than 15.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">PROFILES parameter indicates a range of a protocol (or layer) used for compression in the compressor. In one embodiment, the PROFILES parameter is transmitted through context_profile field of the RDT.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">The context of the compressor is the state that it is used to compress a header. The context of the decompressor is the state that it is used to decompress a header. Either of these or two in combination are usually referred to as &#x201c;context&#x201d; when it is clear which is intended. The context contains relevant information from previous headers in the packet stream, such as static fields and possible reference values for compression and decompression. Also, additional information describing packet streams is also a part of the context. For example, the additional information includes information as to how IP-ID field is changed and information as to how normal inter-packet is increased in sequence numbers or time stamp. Also, header field related information of a previous packet required for compression is a part of the context.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">Hereinafter, adaptation will be described.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">In case of transmission through a unidirectional link, if the receiver does not have context information, the decompressor of the receiver cannot restore the received packet header until a complete context is received. This may cause channel change delay and turn-on delay. For this reason, the context information and the configuration parameters are transmitted to the RDT (RoHC-U Description Table).</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Therefore, the adaption function may construct link layer signaling including the RDT by using the context information and/or the configuration parameters. In addition, the adaptation function provides out of band transmission of the context information and the configuration parameter between the compressor and the decompressor.

In other words, the adaptation function is used to reduce a decompression error caused by loss of the context information and error change delay.

The encapsulation module encapsulates packets in the RoHC packet flow into at least one link layer packet, and encapsulates the link layer signaling information into at least one link layer packet and transmits the encapsulated information to the physical layer. A PLP for transmitting at least one link layer packet including the RoHC packet flow may be different from or the same as a PLP for transmitting at least one link layer packet including the link layer signaling. At least one link layer packet including the link layer signaling information may be transmitted through a specific physical data path.

Through this case, the physical layer has only to process one packet format independently from a protocol type of a network layer (in this case, MPEG-2 TS packet may be considered as a type of a network layer packet).

The respective segments may be encapsulated into the link layer packet in the same order as the original position.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">Concatenation may also be used during the packet encapsulation procedure. If the network layer packet is enough small so that the payload of the link layer packet includes several network layer packets, concatenation may be performed.

As shown, since the case that CID having a value of 0 is allocated means that there is no CID related byte in the corresponding RoHC packet, a header length of the RoHC becomes shorter than the case that there is CID related byte. Since the same CID is allocated to the RoHC packets included in the same IP stream, if CID having a value of 0 is allocated to IP stream having more IP packets, compression efficiency is higher than IP stream having less IP packets.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0398">In other words, since one PLP is mapped into one RoHC channel, the CID having a value of 0 may be allocated to the most common IP stream per PLP.
