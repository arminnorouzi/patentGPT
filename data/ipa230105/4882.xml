It does not necessarily describe the most generic embodiment of the invention or the broadest range of alternative embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a practical application <b>100</b> of a stochastic process. The practical application is the provision of a zero-coupon bond <b>104</b> with a companion endowment fund <b>123</b>. The bond may comprise a face value <b>105</b>, a term <b>106</b>, and other covenants <b>108</b>. The covenants may be memorialized in an offering memorandum. The bond is provided <b>112</b> by a borrower <b>102</b> to a lender <b>110</b> in exchange <b>113</b> for proceeds <b>109</b>. The borrower may be characterized by a likelihood of default <b>103</b>. Examples of a likelihood of default include a numerical probability of default, or a credit rating.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The lender may be constrained by certain regulations <b>111</b>. A lender that is a pension fund, for example, may be constrained to invest in relatively safe investments, such as bonds.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The proceeds <b>109</b> from the bond may be initially transferred to a trustee <b>139</b>. The trustee may divide the proceeds into a first portion <b>116</b> and a second portion <b>122</b>. The first portion of the proceeds may be transferred <b>114</b> to the borrower. The borrower may allocate <b>120</b> the first portion of the proceeds to a first use <b>121</b>. For example, if the borrower is a sovereign entity, such as Bangladesh, the first use may be an investment in said sovereign entity's infrastructure, such as its electric grid. The investment in infrastructure may yield benefits to the sovereign entity, such as an improved economy, an increased tax base and/or fees collected for use of the infrastructure (e.g., tolls). These benefits may yield funds <b>130</b> that can pay back the bond upon its maturity at its term.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">There is some uncertainty <b>131</b>, however, on whether or not the proceeds allocated to the first use will produce enough funds for the borrower to pay back the face value of the bond. To protect against that, the second portion <b>122</b> of the proceeds may be allocated <b>124</b> by the trustee <b>139</b> to a second use, such as an endowment fund <b>123</b>. The endowment fund may be independently managed by the trustee. The second use may be designed to also produce funds <b>136</b> to repay the face value of the bond upon maturity. If the endowment fund needs a higher yield than the first use, then the uncertainty <b>137</b> in producing enough funds <b>136</b> to repay the face value of the bond may be higher than the uncertainty <b>131</b> of the first use.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The funds that may be available from the first use can be described by a first stochastic process over the term of the bond. If the funds are allocated to an infrastructure project, for example, there are uncertainties as to timely completion of the project, impact on the economy, impact of weather (e.g., typhoons), revenue collected, etc.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><b>100181</b> The funds that may be available from the second use can be described by a second stochastic process <b>138</b>. For example, if the second use is an endowment fund, such as an S&#x26;P 500 Index fund, then there are uncertainties as to the drift of the fund and the volatility of the fund over the term of the bond. An interactive stochastic design tool, therefore, is needed to design these stochastic processes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The interactive stochastic design tool will be described herein with respect to the second stochastic process. The tool, however, can be applied to any stochastic process including the first stochastic process, or the combination of the first and second stochastic process.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The interactive stochastic design tool can be used for physical stochastic processes. For example, the second use may be a tree plantation where the growth of the trees over a multi-year period is subject to uncertainties, such as weather. The second stochastic process, therefore, would model the growth of the trees.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The second stochastic process can also include the impact of price fluctuations. Hence the second stochastic process can integrate both physical and financial processes.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Stochastic Processes</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a graph <b>200</b> of alternative realizations of a second stochastic process, such as an endowment fund <b>123</b>. The graph shows fund value <b>202</b> as a Y axis versus time <b>204</b> as an X axis. A first realization <b>206</b> and a second realization <b>207</b> of the stochastic process are shown. Each realization has the same initial conditions. The path a given realization takes is a function of a selection of one or more random values used to calculate the values of said realization.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The realizations in this example are computed using a random walk model. Any model appropriate to the stochastic process may be used. Alternative models, for example, my include a random walk with a uniform variance or a random walk with a heterogeneous variance.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each realization has an initial value equal to the proceeds <b>122</b> allocated to the second use. The random walk for each subsequent time step <b>211</b> is computed by multiplying value of the random walk at the beginning of the time step by a factor equal to e raised to the power of a drift <b>212</b> plus a random offset <b>214</b>. Thus, if the drift is 0.04 and a randomly selected offset is &#x2212;0.05, then the factor is equal to e<sup>(0.04&#x2212;0.05)</sup>=0.99. Hence the next value of the random walk for this time step will be lower than the initial value for this time step.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Any random method appropriate to the stochastic process can be used to calculate subsequent values of the random walk.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The distribution of the random offsets can be any distribution appropriate to the stochastic process. For an endowment fund based on the S&#x26;P 500 Index, for example, appropriate distributions include a lognormal distribution, a Pareto distribution, or other long-tailed distributions. In the examples provided herein, the random offsets are described by a lognormal distribution with a mean of zero. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the realizations were calculated using an annualized standard deviation of 0.1 and a lognormal distribution.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In practice, the values for the drift for a given fund can be computed based on prior performance of the fund. The S&#x26;P 500 Index, for example, was initiated in 1950. Thus, values of the S&#x26;P 500 from initiation to the present can be used to determine values of drift and volatility (e.g., standard deviation) to be used in computing realizations thereof. More sophisticated models and expert judgement can also be used to forecast the drift and volatility of the fund over the term of the bond.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Threshold Boundaries</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Graph <b>200</b> also shows a first threshold boundary <b>208</b> and a second threshold boundary <b>209</b>. The threshold boundaries have a practical utility in improving the performance of the computer-based interactive stochastic design tool. As described below, a user, such as a designer of a stochastic process, can enforce the threshold boundaries in order to determine the expected performance of stochastic process under different boundary conditions. This reduces the number of realizations that have to be calculated and hence improves the performance of the computer performing the calculations.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first threshold boundary <b>208</b> has a constant value equal to the face value <b>105</b> of the bond. If a realization of the performance of the endowment fund crosses <b>222</b> the first threshold boundary during the term <b>106</b> of the bond, then one of the covenants of the bond may be to allow the lender to redeem the bond for its face value. From the lender's perspective, an early redemption means that the lender has earned a higher-than-expected rate of return on the bond. From the borrower's perspective, the future obligation to pay the bond is also relieved. Furthermore, there is no requirement to use any of the funds <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) realized from the first use <b>121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Thus, when looking at overall impacts of design parameters on the range of outcomes of the stochastic process, a designer may wish to remove (e.g., filter) all realizations that cross the first threshold boundary and then recompute the expected remaining shortfalls of the endowment fund to repay the face value of the bond at maturity.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second threshold boundary <b>209</b> has an initial value at the total proceeds <b>109</b> of the bond. The total proceeds are equal to the proceeds <b>120</b> allocated to the first use plus the proceeds <b>122</b> allocated to the second use plus any expenses. Hence the initial value of the second threshold boundary is between the initial value of the realizations of the stochastic process and the initial value of the first threshold boundary.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">(<b>00311</b> The second threshold boundary then grows exponentially <b>210</b> to a final value <b>229</b> at the term <b>106</b> of the bond. The final value is equal to the face value <b>105</b> of the bond. The threshold boundary, therefore, represents a line of constant yield for the bond. If a realization of the stochastic process crosses <b>220</b> the second threshold boundary, then the lender may want the option of redeeming the bond for the yield value at that time. A lender might wish to do this, for example, if the expected default rate of the borrower has gone up since the inception of the bond. Conversely, the borrower may wish to call the bond if its expected default rate has gone down since the inception of the bond and the borrower can now secure funds at a lower rate. Thus, a designer may wish to remove the realizations that cross the second threshold boundary and examine the statistics of the shortfalls <b>224</b> of the realizations <b>207</b> that remain.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Any number of other threshold boundaries may be provided in order to facilitate examining the impact of other design features on the stochastic process. For example, a &#x201c;liquidation boundary&#x201d; <b>226</b> may be provided somewhat below either the first threshold boundary or the second threshold boundary. The liquidation boundary would provide for at least a partial liquidation of the endowment fund prior to the value of the fund crossing the first or second threshold boundary. This would allow the trustee to unwind the fund's position without unduly impacting the market. The cost of this early unwinding can be factored into the bond expenses.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A &#x201c;price guarantee window boundary&#x201d; <b>228</b> may also be provided. The price guarantee window is a guarantee that the endowment fund will receive the price that was available when the value of the fund crossed <b>220</b> a threshold boundary even though there may be movement of the fund in the time window it takes to unwind the fund's position. By enforcing this threshold boundary, a designer can determine the expected costs of providing the price guarantee window.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Interactive Stochastic Design Tool</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic of a computer-based interactive stochastic design tool <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>400</b> for providing said computer-based interactive stochastic design tool.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the tool comprises:</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">an input device <b>306</b> (e.g., a touch screen <b>308</b>) adapted to receive input from a user;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">an output device <b>307</b> (e.g., said same touch screen <b>308</b>) adapted to provide graphical output <b>320</b> to said user;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">a digital processor (e.g., a server <b>304</b>); and</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">a permanent memory (e.g., one or more databases <b>302</b>) comprising computer readable instructions operable to cause said digital processor to carry out the steps <b>400</b>:</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">read in <b>316</b>, <b>401</b> initiation data describing a stochastic process and a threshold boundary;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">determine <b>402</b> one or more realizations of said stochastic process using said initiation data;</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">display <b>318</b>, <b>403</b>, by said output device, said one or more realizations <b>328</b> and said threshold boundary <b>330</b> as a graph;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">receive <b>324</b>, <b>404</b>, by said input device, an indication from said user to enforce said threshold boundary; and</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">redisplay <b>405</b>, by said output device, said graph showing said one or more realizations that do not cross said enforced threshold boundary.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The permanent memory <b>302</b> may comprise one or more of:</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">a database <b>310</b> comprising data describing the bond and the parties to the bond;</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">a database <b>312</b> comprising data describing one or more alternative endowment funds (e.g., a tree plantation); and</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">a database <b>314</b> comprising one or more stochastic models useful for simulating the performance of the endowment fund.

An advantage of an alphanumeric input field is that the user can type in an exact desired value. If an analog input field and an alphanumeric input field are provided for the same parameter (e.g., &#x201c;bond term (years)&#x201d;), then the field receiving the most recent user input may take priority.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0067">The threshold boundary enforcement user input field <b>510</b> may comprise a selection input field <b>512</b> for each selectable threshold boundary.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0068">The numerical output field <b>505</b> may provide calculated values <b>514</b> of various design parameters and other characteristics of a stochastic process based on the user input. The output fields may be updated in real time depending upon the calculation requirements of the models for the stochastic process and the speed of computation of the digital processor.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0069">The graphical output field <b>506</b>, may comprise a graph <b>516</b>. The graph may comprise one or more threshold boundaries <b>208</b>, <b>209</b> and one or more realizations <b>508</b> of the stochastic process.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0070">As used herein, a realization may comprise one or more of an individual realization or an aggregate realization. An example of an individual realization is a random walk. An example of an aggregate realization is the output of a Black-Scholes model. An aggregate realization may be an estimate of an average of individual realizations. Aggregate realizations may also include upper and lower bounds for the expected deviations of individual realizations from the average realization. A suitable upper and lower bound is plus or minus 1 or 2 standard deviations from the average.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0071">An advantage of displaying aggregate realizations is that the computation time is often short. Thus, slower processors can nonetheless display in real time the changes in realizations in response to variations in user input.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0072">An advantage of individual realizations is that the user can see the paths of each individual realization and hence see particular behaviors. These particular behaviors might include an individual realization crossing back and forth across a threshold boundary.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0073">The graphical output field <b>506</b> may display a sampling of individual realizations used to calculate the numerical output. For example, 100,000 random walks might be calculated in order to determine the values of the numerical output with adequate accuracy. A sample of 10 to 1,000 of the 100,000 random walks may be displayed in the graph so that collective behavior of the random walks as a whole can be seen as well individual behaviors. The displayed random walks may be selected by analytic methods (e.g., every 100th random walk) or stochastic methods (e.g., 100 random walks randomly selected from the 100,000). Experiment has shown that displaying 10 to 1,000 random walks is effective at giving a user a good sense for how the stochastic process might perform.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0074">Line weights and color of the realizations may be varied depending upon user requirements. For example, the colors of the realizations may be varied in accordance with the threshold boundaries that are selected. This will give a user an intuitive feel for which threshold boundaries are enforced when viewing a graph.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Enforced Threshold Boundaries</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a graphical user interface <b>600</b> of an interactive stochastic design tool with enforceable threshold boundaries.

The initial value may also include applicable expenses of the bond. Expenses are ignored herein for the sake of simplicity of explanation, but they can nonetheless be taken into account. Expenses may be particularly important for certain candidate endowment funds, such as managed funds, that strive to get higher than average returns.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0085">The second threshold boundary <b>209</b> may have a final value at the term <b>106</b> of the bond equal to the face value <b>105</b> of the bond. The second threshold boundary may grow exponentially between said initial value and said final value at a rate defined as the yield of the bond.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0086">The box plots <b>604</b>, <b>605</b> are graphical indications of the distribution of final values of the individual realizations at the term <b>106</b> of the bond. Any graphical indication of a distribution may be used, such as a bell curve. The graphical indication may be based on the computation of a large number (e.g., 100,000) individual realizations and not necessarily based solely on the displayed individual realizations.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0087">The graphical indications may also be based on analytic methods for determining the distribution of outcomes, such as a Black-Scholes model.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0088">The first box plot <b>605</b> indicates the distribution of individual realizations that exceed the face value of the bond at its term. The second box plot <b>604</b> indicates the distribution of individual realizations that are less than the face value of the bond at its term. Box plots can be defined in any manner suitable to the stochastic process being modeled. Box plots for a tree plantation, for example, may take into account yields of processing the trees depending upon their final use (e.g., lumber, pulp, veneers, etc.).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0089">A user can see that some of the realizations cross <b>612</b> the first threshold boundary and some cross <b>618</b> the second threshold boundary before the end of the term of the bond. The user may then enforce the first or second threshold boundary to see what impact that might have on the average expected shortfall over all runs or the average expected shortfall when there is a shortfall as shown in the numerical output field <b>603</b>. This will help the user determine if calling the bonds when either the first or second threshold is reached should be required, optional, or not allowed.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0090">In this example, the numerical output field <b>603</b> displays an average shortfall over all runs of $20. It displays an average shortfall when there is a shortfall of $36. The average shortfall over all runs assumes that the borrower will not have to pay off the bonds when the endowment fund crosses the first threshold boundary. The borrower then reaps on average the profit <b>605</b> of the realizations that exceed the face value of the bond. This reduces the average expected shortfall but may make the bonds less desirable. One of the attractive features of a bond with a companion endowment fund is that it gives lenders a chance to earn higher than expected returns if the endowment fund should cross the first threshold boundary before the end of the term of the bond. This is a further motivation for the user to view the impact of enforcing the first threshold boundary.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0091">The average shortfall when there is a shortfall also indicates to the user the impact of enforcing the first threshold boundary.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Enforcing the First Threshold Boundary</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graphical user interface <b>700</b> of the interactive stochastic design tool of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> with the first threshold boundary <b>208</b> enforced. The only realizations <b>702</b> that are displayed are those that do not cross the first threshold boundary. The boxplot <b>704</b> of the realizations that have a shortfall is the same in this example as the boxplot <b>604</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. If one of the realizations had exceeded the first threshold boundary and then came down for a final value at the term of the bond that was less than the face value of the bond, then the box plot and the computed shortfalls in the numerical output field <b>703</b> would be different than the examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> since the realization that crossed and then came down would have been eliminated and would no longer contribute to the average shortfall at the end of the term. Showing a higher number of realizations, such as <b>100</b>, would more likely reveal examples of realizations that cross the first threshold boundary but then return below by the end of the term of the bond.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0093">Some of the realizations cross <b>706</b>, <b>707</b> the second threshold boundary <b>209</b>. All of these realizations return below the second threshold boundary before the end of the term of the bond. This is a consequence of the first and second threshold boundaries joining at the end of the term of the bond. Any realization that did not return below the second threshold boundary would also have exceeded the first threshold boundary and hence would not be shown. The impact of these returning realizations can be determined by enforcing the second threshold boundary.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Enforcing the Second Threshold Boundary</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a graphical user interface <b>800</b> of the interactive stochastic design tool of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> with the second threshold boundary <b>209</b> enforced. None of the displayed realizations <b>802</b> intersect the second threshold boundary. The box plot <b>804</b>, has now changed as well as the computed average shortfalls in the numerical output field <b>803</b>. Compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the average shortfall over all runs has come down. This is due to the fact that more bonds would have been paid off early. The average shortfall when there is a shortfall, however, is larger since realizations that do not cross the second threshold boundary at all are more likely to be lower than realizations that do cross the second threshold boundary at least once. Thus, the user can make the tradeoff of a lower probability of having to make a higher payoff if the bonds are structured to require or allow redemption or calling if the endowment fund intersects the second threshold boundary.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0095">While the disclosure has been described with reference to one or more different exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made, and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
