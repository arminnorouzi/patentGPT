However, regardless of the half-bridge circuit or the full-bridge circuit, each bridge arm includes two switching transistors, namely, an upper switching transistor and a lower switching transistor. A first terminal of the upper switching transistor is connected to a positive electrode of a power supply, a second terminal of the upper switching transistor is connected to a first terminal of the lower switching transistor, and a second terminal of the lower switching transistor is grounded. Usually, when operating, the upper switching transistor and the lower switching transistor are alternately turned on but not turned on at the same time. In different application scenarios, a voltage of the power supply is different. For example, the voltage of the power supply may range from dozens to hundreds of volts, and in a scenario with a high voltage, the voltage of the power supply may even be thousands of volts.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Because the upper switching transistor is directly connected to the power supply, when the upper switching transistor is turned on and the lower switching transistor is turned off, a voltage at the second terminal of the upper switching transistor is the voltage of the power supply. Otherwise, when the upper switching transistor is turned off and the lower switching transistor is turned on, the voltage at the second terminal of the upper switching transistor is the ground. It can be learned that, when the upper switching transistor is in different states, the voltage at the second terminal of the upper switching transistor is switched between the voltage of the power supply and the ground, and a change range of the voltage may reach hundreds of volts or even thousands of volts. That is, a higher voltage class of an application scenario of the bridge circuit indicates a greater fluctuation of a voltage change.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, a switching transistor drive circuit in a high-voltage bridge circuit usually includes a high-voltage region, a low-voltage region, and a high-voltage isolation ring surrounding the high-voltage region. The high-voltage isolation ring is configured to isolate a floating voltage at a second terminal of an upper switching transistor. To be specific, a drive circuit of the upper switching transistor is integrated in the high-voltage region by using a semiconductor process, and a drive circuit of a lower switching transistor is integrated in the low-voltage region by using the semiconductor process. However, there are two different voltage domains in the high-voltage region, and P-type semiconductor devices in the different voltage domains have different bulk potential requirements. However, an independent P well for each P-type semiconductor device cannot be manufactured according to a current manufacturing process, and therefore, N well isolation of the P-type semiconductor devices in the different voltage domains cannot be implemented.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To resolve the foregoing technical problems, this application provides a drive circuit of a bridge arm switching transistor, a drive circuit, and a power converter, to implement isolation of bulk potentials of P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains in a high-voltage region without changing an existing semiconductor manufacturing process, thereby avoiding interference between the P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An embodiment of this application provides a drive circuit of a bridge arm switching transistor. The bridge arm switching transistor includes a first switching transistor and a second switching transistor. A first terminal of the first switching transistor is connected to a power supply, a second terminal of the first switching transistor is connected to a first terminal of the second switching transistor, and a second terminal of the second switching transistor is grounded. The drive circuit includes a low-voltage region and at least two high-voltage regions isolated by at least two isolation rings, where the at least two high-voltage regions include a first high-voltage region and a second high-voltage region. The first high-voltage region corresponds to a first voltage domain, the second high-voltage region corresponds to a second voltage domain, and a voltage of the first voltage domain is different from a voltage of the second voltage domain. A semiconductor device configured to drive the second switching transistor is disposed in the low-voltage region. P-type semiconductor devices are disposed in each of the first high-voltage region and the second high-voltage region, and the P-type semiconductor devices are configured to drive the first switching transistor. Because the first high-voltage region and the second high-voltage region are mutually isolated by the isolation rings, the P-type semiconductor devices disposed in the two high-voltage regions have N wells that are mutually isolated and independent of each other. Therefore, the P-type semiconductor devices in the two high-voltage regions do not interfere with each other.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The drive circuit provided in this embodiment of this application includes at least two isolation rings. For example, the drive circuit may include two isolation rings or more isolation rings, for example, three or four isolation rings. A quantity of isolation rings may be determined based on a quantity of different voltage domains included in a high-voltage region, that is, the quantity of isolation rings is the same as the quantity of voltage domains in the high-voltage region. A plurality of isolation rings may be manufactured at the same time, and a plurality of high-voltage regions may be formed at the same time. No additional semiconductor process is needed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the drive circuit provided in this embodiment of this application, at least two different isolation rings are disposed in a high-voltage region, to form at least two high-voltage regions, and each high-voltage region corresponds to one voltage domain, that is, a plurality of mutually isolated voltage domains are formed, and the mutually isolated voltage domains have different voltages. In this way, mutual isolation between P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains can be implemented, so that the P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains have different bulk potentials, thereby avoiding mutual interference between the P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains. In the drive circuit provided in this embodiment of this application, a requirement that the P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains have different bulk potentials can be implemented without changing an existing semiconductor process, so that the P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains have mutually isolated N wells. Therefore, the requirement that the P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains have different bulk potentials can be rapidly met in this manner. In addition, a plurality of isolation rings may be manufactured at the same time, and a plurality of high-voltage regions may be formed at the same time. No additional semiconductor process is needed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a possible implementation, the at least two isolation rings include a first isolation ring and a second isolation ring. The first isolation ring surrounds the first high-voltage region, and the second isolation ring surrounds the second high-voltage region. The low-voltage region is a region other than the first isolation ring and the second isolation ring. The first isolation ring and the second isolation ring are two independent isolation rings. In a possible manner, the low-voltage region exists between the first isolation ring and the second isolation ring.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a possible implementation, the first high-voltage region and the second high-voltage region need electric energy transmission and signal transmission, and signals include a drive signal and a control signal. Therefore, the drive circuit further includes bond wires, configured to transmit electric energy in the first high-voltage region to the second high-voltage region, and further configured to transmit the drive signal from the first high-voltage region to the second high-voltage region.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a possible implementation, the drive circuit further includes a voltage conversion circuit located in the first high-voltage region, and the voltage conversion circuit is configured to convert the voltage of the first voltage domain into the voltage of the second voltage domain. The bond wires are configured to connect an output voltage of the voltage conversion circuit to the second high-voltage region. The voltage conversion circuit may be a buck conversion circuit. To be specific, the voltage conversion circuit bucks the voltage of the first voltage domain, and transmits a bucked voltage to the second voltage domain through the bond wires, that is, the voltage of the second voltage domain is lower than the voltage of the first voltage domain.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a possible implementation, there are two implementations for the bond wires between the first high-voltage region and the second high-voltage region.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A first implementation is that the bond wires are directly bonded between a pad of the first high-voltage region and a pad of the second high-voltage region. This implementation is simple, and can implement internal wire bonding.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A second implementation is that a pad of the first high-voltage region is connected to a packaging pin of the drive circuit through the bond wire, and a pad of the second high-voltage region is connected to the packaging pin of the drive circuit through the bond wire, so that electric energy transmission and drive signal transmission are implemented between the first high-voltage region and the second high-voltage region. This implementation can implement an indirect connection through packaging.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a possible implementation, all the P-type semiconductor devices in the first high-voltage region have a same bulk potential. To be specific, all the P-type semiconductor devices in the first high-voltage region have a same N well, that is, the N well is shared. In this way, a process can be simplified, and manufacturing is simple. All the P-type semiconductor devices in the second high-voltage region have a same bulk potential. To be specific, all the P-type semiconductor devices in the second high-voltage region have a same N well, that is, the N well is shared. However, the two high-voltage regions do not share an N well. Therefore, signal interference caused by a same bulk potential can be avoided between the P-type semiconductor devices in the two high-voltage regions. An N-type semiconductor device in the first high-voltage region and an N-type semiconductor device in the second high-voltage region each have an independent P well. To be specific, each of N-type semiconductor devices in the two high-voltage regions and the low-voltage region has an independent P well.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a possible implementation, both the first isolation ring and the second isolation ring are silicon bases.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Because the drive circuit provided in this embodiment of this application includes the at least two high-voltage regions isolated by the at least two isolation rings, signal transmission exists between different high-voltage regions. For example, the first high-voltage region and the second high-voltage region are interconnected through the bond wires, and a parasitic inductance may be generated by each of the bond wires. In this case, interference is generated. To avoid the interference. In a possible implementation, the first high-voltage region includes a first NMOS transistor and a second NMOS transistor. The first NMOS transistor and the second NMOS transistor are symmetrically disposed. The first NMOS transistor and the second NMOS transistor are separately connected to a mirrored common-mode suppression circuit in the second high-voltage region. The first NMOS transistor and the second NMOS transistor are alternately turned on, so that one of two branches of the mirrored common-mode suppression circuit in the second high-voltage region is turned on.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a possible implementation, the second high-voltage region includes a first branch and a second branch. The first branch includes a third NMOS transistor, a fifth NMOS transistor, and a first PMOS transistor. The second branch includes a fourth NMOS transistor, a sixth NMOS transistor, and a second PMOS transistor. Both a first terminal of the first NMOS transistor and a first terminal of the second NMOS transistor are connected to a reference ground of the first high-voltage region, a second terminal of the first NMOS transistor is connected to a second terminal of the third NMOS transistor through the bond wire, and both the second terminal of the third NMOS transistor and a second terminal of the fourth NMOS transistor are connected to a reference ground of the second high-voltage region. Both a first terminal of the third NMOS transistor and a first terminal of the fourth NMOS transistor are connected to the voltage of the second voltage region. A second terminal of the second NMOS transistor is connected to the second terminal of the fourth NMOS transistor through the bond wire. Both a first terminal of the first PMOS transistor and a first terminal of the second PMOS transistor are connected to the voltage of the second voltage region. A second terminal of the first PMOS transistor is connected to a control terminal of the fifth NMOS transistor, and a second terminal of the second PMOS transistor is connected to a control terminal of the sixth NMOS transistor. Both a first terminal of the fifth NMOS transistor and a first terminal of the sixth NMOS transistor are connected to the voltage of the second voltage region. A second terminal of the fifth NMOS transistor and a second terminal of the sixth NMOS transistor are separately connected to the reference ground of the second high-voltage region through one capacitor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A mirrored differential circuit exists in each of two high-voltage basins, and the differential circuits are disposed to suppress common-mode signal interference generated by the two high-voltage basins. When potential conversion of the two high-voltage basins is inconsistent, a large common-mode signal is generated, and when a parasitic capacitance and the parasitic inductance of the bond wire do not match, the common-mode signal is converted into a differential-mode signal. In this case, the circuit fails. Therefore, the common-mode suppression circuit provided in this embodiment of this application can resolve the foregoing technical problem and avoid a case in which a common-mode signal is converted into a differential-mode signal.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a possible implementation, to ensure that more current flows into a load resistor side and reduce a signal transmission delay, a size of the third NMOS transistor is greater than a size of the fifth NMOS transistor, and a size of the fourth NMOS transistor is greater than a size of the sixth NMOS transistor.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An embodiment of this application further provides a drive circuit of a switching transistor. The drive circuit includes at least two high-voltage regions isolated by at least two isolation rings: a first high-voltage region and a second high-voltage region. The first high-voltage region corresponds to a first voltage domain, the second high-voltage region corresponds to a second voltage domain, and a voltage of the first voltage domain is different from a voltage of the second voltage domain. The first high-voltage region and the second high-voltage region each are configured to dispose a P-type semiconductor device, and the P-type semiconductor devices are configured to drive the first switching transistor. Because the first high-voltage region and the second high-voltage region are mutually isolated by the isolation rings, the P-type semiconductor devices disposed in the two high-voltage regions have N wells that are mutually isolated and independent of each other.

The power converter is configured to perform voltage transformation on the power supply and output a transformed voltage.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">This application has at least the following advantages:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the drive circuit provided in embodiments of this application, at least two different isolation rings are disposed in a high-voltage region to form at least two high-voltage regions, and each high-voltage region corresponds to one voltage domain, that is, a plurality of mutually isolated voltage domains are formed. The mutually isolated voltage domains have different voltages, for example, the first voltage domain corresponds to a first voltage, and the second voltage domain corresponds to a second voltage. Corresponding P-type semiconductor devices are disposed in each voltage domain, so that mutual isolation between P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains can be implemented. For example, the P-type semiconductor devices disposed in the first voltage domain have an N well of the first voltage, the P-type semiconductor devices disposed in the second voltage domain have an N well of the second voltage, and N-type potentials of the P-type semiconductors device corresponding to the two voltage domains are different. Therefore, the P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains have different bulk potentials, thereby avoiding mutual interference between the P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains. In the drive circuits provided in embodiments of this application, a requirement that the P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains have different bulk potentials can be implemented without changing an existing semiconductor process, so that the P-type semiconductor devices in different voltage domains have mutually isolated N wells.
