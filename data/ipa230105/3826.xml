Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to a wireless communication system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Sidelink (SL) communication is a communication scheme in which a direct link is established between User Equipments (UEs) and the UEs exchange voice and data directly with each other without intervention of an evolved Node B (eNB). SL communication is under consideration as a solution to the overhead of an eNB caused by rapidly increasing data traffic.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) refers to a communication technology through which a vehicle exchanges information with another vehicle, a pedestrian, an object having an infrastructure (or infra) established therein, and so on. The V2X may be divided into 4 types, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-network (V2N), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P). The V2X communication may be provided via a PC5 interface and/or Uu interface.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, as a wider range of communication devices require larger communication capacities, the need for mobile broadband communication that is more enhanced than the existing Radio Access Technology (RAT) is rising. Accordingly, discussions are made on services and user equipment (UE) that are sensitive to reliability and latency. And, a next generation radio access technology that is based on the enhanced mobile broadband communication, massive Machine Type Communication (MTC), Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and so on, may be referred to as a new radio access technology (RAT) or new radio (NR). Herein, the NR may also support vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a drawing for describing V2X communication based on NR, compared to V2X communication based on RAT used before NR. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be combined with various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regarding V2X communication, a scheme of providing a safety service, based on a V2X message such as BSM (Basic Safety Message), CAM (Cooperative Awareness Message), and DENM (Decentralized Environmental Notification Message) is focused in the discussion on the RAT used before the NR. The V2X message may include position information, dynamic information, attribute information, or the like. For example, a UE may transmit a periodic message type CAM and/or an event triggered message type DENM to another UE.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, the CAM may include dynamic state information of the vehicle such as direction and speed, static data of the vehicle such as a size, and basic vehicle information such as an exterior illumination state, route details, or the like. For example, the UE may broadcast the CAM, and latency of the CAM may be less than 100 ms. For example, the UE may generate the DENM and transmit it to another UE in an unexpected situation such as a vehicle breakdown, accident, or the like. For example, all vehicles within a transmission range of the UE may receive the CAM and/or the DENM. In this case, the DENM may have a higher priority than the CAM.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thereafter, regarding V2X communication, various V2X scenarios are proposed in NR. For example, the various V2X scenarios may include vehicle platooning, advanced driving, extended sensors, remote driving, or the like.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, based on the vehicle platooning, vehicles may move together by dynamically forming a group. For example, in order to perform platoon operations based on the vehicle platooning, the vehicles belonging to the group may receive periodic data from a leading vehicle. For example, the vehicles belonging to the group may decrease or increase an interval between the vehicles by using the periodic data.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, based on the advanced driving, the vehicle may be semi-automated or fully automated. For example, each vehicle may adjust trajectories or maneuvers, based on data obtained from a local sensor of a proximity vehicle and/or a proximity logical entity. In addition, for example, each vehicle may share driving intention with proximity vehicles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, based on the extended sensors, raw data, processed data, or live video data obtained through the local sensors may be exchanged between a vehicle, a logical entity, a UE of pedestrians, and/or a V2X application server. Therefore, for example, the vehicle may recognize a more improved environment than an environment in which a self-sensor is used for detection.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, based on the remote driving, for a person who cannot drive or a remote vehicle in a dangerous environment, a remote driver or a V2X application may operate or control the remote vehicle. For example, if a route is predictable such as public transportation, cloud computing based driving may be used for the operation or control of the remote vehicle. In addition, for example, an access for a cloud-based back-end service platform may be considered for the remote driving.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Meanwhile, a scheme of specifying service requirements for various V2X scenarios such as vehicle platooning, advanced driving, extended sensors, remote driving, or the like is discussed in NR-based V2X communication.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solutions</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an embodiment, provided herein is a method of performing, by a first apparatus, wireless communication.

IEEE 802.16m is an evolved version of IEEE 802.16e and provides backward compatibility with a system based on the IEEE 802.16e. The UTRA is part of a universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE) is part of an evolved UMTS (E-UMTS) using the E-UTRA. The 3GPP LTE uses the OFDMA in a downlink and uses the SC-FDMA in an uplink.

An AMF may provide functions, such as Non Access Stratum (NAS) security, idle state mobility processing, and so on. A UPF may provide functions, such as Mobility Anchoring, Protocol Data Unit (PDU) processing, and so on. A Session Management Function (SMF) may provide functions, such as user equipment (UE) Internet Protocol (IP) address allocation, PDU session control, and so on.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Layers of a radio interface protocol between the UE and the network can be classified into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the lower three layers of the open system interconnection (OSI) model that is well-known in the communication system. Among them, a physical (PHY) layer belonging to the first layer provides an information transfer service by using a physical channel, and a radio resource control (RRC) layer belonging to the third layer serves to control a radio resource between the UE and the network. For this, the RRC layer exchanges an RRC message between the UE and the BS.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a radio protocol architecture, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be combined with various embodiments of the present disclosure. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows a radio protocol architecture for a user plane, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> shows a radio protocol architecture for a control plane. The user plane corresponds to a protocol stack for user data transmission, and the control plane corresponds to a protocol stack for control signal transmission.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a physical layer provides an upper layer with an information transfer service through a physical channel. The physical layer is connected to a medium access control (MAC) layer which is an upper layer of the physical layer through a transport channel. Data is transferred between the MAC layer and the physical layer through the transport channel. The transport channel is classified according to how and with what characteristics data is transmitted through a radio interface.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Between different physical layers, i.e., a physical layer of a transmitter and a physical layer of a receiver, data are transferred through the physical channel. The physical channel is modulated using an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and utilizes time and frequency as a radio resource.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The MAC layer provides services to a radio link control (RLC) layer, which is a higher layer of the MAC layer, via a logical channel. The MAC layer provides a function of mapping multiple logical channels to multiple transport channels. The MAC layer also provides a function of logical channel multiplexing by mapping multiple logical channels to a single transport channel. The MAC layer provides data transfer services over logical channels.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The RLC layer performs concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of Radio Link Control Service Data Unit (RLC SDU). In order to ensure diverse quality of service (QoS) required by a radio bearer (RB), the RLC layer provides three types of operation modes, i.e., a transparent mode (TM), an unacknowledged mode (UM), and an acknowledged mode (AM). An AM RLC provides error correction through an automatic repeat request (ARQ).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A radio resource control (RRC) layer is defined only in the control plane. The RRC layer serves to control the logical channel, the transport channel, and the physical channel in association with configuration, reconfiguration and release of RBs. The RB is a logical path provided by the first layer (i.e., the physical layer or the PHY layer) and the second layer (i.e., the MAC layer, the RLC layer, and the packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer) for data delivery between the UE and the network.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Functions of a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer in the user plane include user data delivery, header compression, and ciphering. Functions of a PDCP layer in the control plane include control-plane data delivery and ciphering/integrity protection.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A service data adaptation protocol (SDAP) layer is defined only in a user plane. The SDAP layer performs mapping between a Quality of Service (QoS) flow and a data radio bearer (DRB) and QoS flow ID (QFI) marking in both DL and UL packets.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The configuration of the RB implies a process for specifying a radio protocol layer and channel properties to provide a particular service and for determining respective detailed parameters and operations. The RB can be classified into two types, i.e., a signaling RB (SRB) and a data RB (DRB). The SRB is used as a path for transmitting an RRC message in the control plane. The DRB is used as a path for transmitting user data in the user plane.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">When an RRC connection is established between an RRC layer of the UE and an RRC layer of the E-UTRAN, the UE is in an RRC_CONNECTED state, and, otherwise, the UE may be in an RRC_IDLE state. In case of the NR, an RRC_INACTIVE state is additionally defined, and a UE being in the RRC_INACTIVE state may maintain its connection with a core network whereas its connection with the BS is released.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Data is transmitted from the network to the UE through a downlink transport channel. Examples of the downlink transport channel include a broadcast channel (BCH) for transmitting system information and a downlink-shared channel (SCH) for transmitting user traffic or control messages. Traffic of downlink multicast or broadcast services or the control messages can be transmitted on the downlink-SCH or an additional downlink multicast channel (MCH). Data is transmitted from the UE to the network through an uplink transport channel. Examples of the uplink transport channel include a random access channel (RACH) for transmitting an initial control message and an uplink SCH for transmitting user traffic or control messages.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Examples of logical channels belonging to a higher channel of the transport channel and mapped onto the transport channels include a broadcast channel (BCCH), a paging control channel (PCCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a multicast control channel (MCCH), a multicast traffic channel (MTCH), etc.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The physical channel includes several OFDM symbols in a time domain and several sub-carriers in a frequency domain. One sub-frame includes a plurality of OFDM symbols in the time domain. A resource block is a unit of resource allocation, and consists of a plurality of OFDM symbols and a plurality of sub-carriers. Further, each subframe may use specific sub-carriers of specific OFDM symbols (e.g., a first OFDM symbol) of a corresponding subframe for a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), i.e., an L1/L2 control channel. A transmission time interval (TTI) is a unit time of subframe transmission.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a structure of an NR system, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.

A radio frame has a length of 10 ms and may be defined to be configured of two half-frames (HFs). A half-frame may include five 1 ms subframes (SFs). A subframe (SF) may be divided into one or more slots, and the number of slots within a subframe may be determined in accordance with subcarrier spacing (SCS). Each slot may include 12 or 14 OFDM(A) symbols according to a cyclic prefix (CP).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In case of using a normal CP, each slot may include 14 symbols.

A Resource Block (RB) may be defined as a plurality of consecutive subcarriers (e.g., 12 subcarriers) in the frequency domain. A Bandwidth Part (BWP) may be defined as a plurality of consecutive (Physical) Resource Blocks ((P)RBs) in the frequency domain, and the BWP may correspond to one numerology (e.g., SCS, CP length, and so on). A carrier may include a maximum of N number BWPs (e.g., <b>5</b> BWPs). Data communication may be performed via an activated BWP. Each element may be referred to as a Resource Element (RE) within a resource grid and one complex symbol may be mapped to each element.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0086">Meanwhile, a radio interface between a UE and another UE or a radio interface between the UE and a network may consist of an L1 layer, an L2 layer, and an L3 layer. In various embodiments of the present disclosure, the L1 layer may imply a physical layer. In addition, for example, the L2 layer may imply at least one of a MAC layer, an RLC layer, a PDCP layer, and an SDAP layer. In addition, for example, the L3 layer may imply an RRC layer.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">Hereinafter, a bandwidth part (BWP) and a carrier will be described.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0088">The BWP may be a set of consecutive physical resource blocks (PRBs) in a given numerology. The PRB may be selected from consecutive sub-sets of common resource blocks (CRBs) for the given numerology on a given carrier.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0089">When using bandwidth adaptation (BA), a reception bandwidth and transmission bandwidth of a UE are not necessarily as large as a bandwidth of a cell, and the reception bandwidth and transmission bandwidth of the BS may be adjusted. For example, a network/BS may inform the UE of bandwidth adjustment. For example, the UE receive information/configuration for bandwidth adjustment from the network/BS. In this case, the UE may perform bandwidth adjustment based on the received information/configuration. For example, the bandwidth adjustment may include an increase/decrease of the bandwidth, a position change of the bandwidth, or a change in subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0090">For example, the bandwidth may be decreased during a period in which activity is low to save power. For example, the position of the bandwidth may move in a frequency domain. For example, the position of the bandwidth may move in the frequency domain to increase scheduling flexibility. For example, the subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth may be changed. For example, the subcarrier spacing of the bandwidth may be changed to allow a different service. A subset of a total cell bandwidth of a cell may be called a bandwidth part (BWP). The BA may be performed when the BS/network configures the BWP to the UE and the BS/network informs the UE of the BWP currently in an active state among the configured BWPs.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0091">For example, the BWP may be at least any one of an active BWP, an initial BWP, and/or a default BWP. For example, the UE may not monitor downlink radio link quality in a DL BWP other than an active DL BWP on a primary cell (PCell). For example, the UE may not receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS (excluding RRM) outside the active DL BWP. For example, the UE may not trigger a channel state information (CSI) report for the inactive DL BWP. For example, the UE may not transmit PUCCH or PUSCH outside an active UL BWP. For example, in a downlink case, the initial BWP may be given as a consecutive RB set for an RMSI CORESET (configured by PBCH). For example, in an uplink case, the initial BWP may be given by SIB for a random access procedure. For example, the default BWP may be configured by a higher layer. For example, an initial value of the default BWP may be an initial DL BWP. For energy saving, if the UE fails to detect DCI during a specific period, the UE may switch the active BWP of the UE to the default BWP.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0092">Meanwhile, the BWP may be defined for SL. The same SL BWP may be used in transmission and reception. For example, a transmitting UE may transmit an SL channel or an SL signal on a specific BWP, and a receiving UE may receive the SL channel or the SL signal on the specific BWP. In a licensed carrier, the SL BWP may be defined separately from a Uu BWP, and the SL BWP may have configuration signaling separate from the Uu BWP. For example, the UE may receive a configuration for the SL BWP from the BS/network. The SL BWP may be (pre-)configured in a carrier with respect to an out-of-coverage NR V2X UE and an RRC_IDLE UE. For the UE in the RRC_CONNECTED mode, at least one SL BWP may be activated in the carrier.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an example of a BWP, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.

For example, length-127 M-sequences may be used for the S-PSS, and length-127 gold sequences may be used for the S-SSS. For example, a UE may use the S-PSS for initial signal detection and for synchronization acquisition. For example, the UE may use the S-PSS and the S-SSS for acquisition of detailed synchronization and for detection of a synchronization signal ID.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0100">A physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH) may be a (broadcast) channel for transmitting default (system) information which must be first known by the UE before SL signal transmission/reception. For example, the default information may be information related to SLSS, a duplex mode (DM), a time division duplex (TDD) uplink/downlink (UL/DL) configuration, information related to a resource pool, a type of an application related to the SLSS, a subframe offset, broadcast information, or the like.

For example, the S-SSB may have a bandwidth of 11 resource blocks (RBs). For example, the PSBCH may exist across 11 RBs. In addition, a frequency position of the S-SSB may be (pre-)configured. Accordingly, the UE does not have to perform hypothesis detection at frequency to discover the S-SSB in the carrier.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a UE performing V2X or SL communication, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.

In this case, since accuracy and/or uncertainty for each TOA measurement may be present, the estimated location of the UE may be known as a specific range based on measurement uncertainty.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0138">For example, RSTD for two TPs may be calculated based on Equation 1.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>RSTDi</mi>  <mo>,</mo>  <mrow>   <mn>1</mn>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <msqrt>      <mrow>       <msup>        <mrow>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <msub>           <mi>x</mi>           <mi>t</mi>          </msub>          <mo>-</mo>          <msub>           <mi>x</mi>           <mi>i</mi>          </msub>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mn>2</mn>       </msup>       <mo>+</mo>       <msup>        <mrow>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <msub>           <mi>y</mi>           <mi>t</mi>          </msub>          <mo>-</mo>          <msub>           <mi>y</mi>           <mi>i</mi>          </msub>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mn>2</mn>       </msup>      </mrow>     </msqrt>     <mi>c</mi>    </mfrac>    <mo>-</mo>    <mfrac>     <msqrt>      <mrow>       <msup>        <mrow>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <msub>           <mi>x</mi>           <mi>t</mi>          </msub>          <mo>-</mo>          <msub>           <mi>x</mi>           <mn>1</mn>          </msub>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mn>2</mn>       </msup>       <mo>+</mo>       <msup>        <mrow>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <msub>           <mi>y</mi>           <mi>t</mi>          </msub>          <mo>-</mo>          <msub>           <mi>y</mi>           <mn>1</mn>          </msub>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mn>2</mn>       </msup>      </mrow>     </msqrt>     <mi>c</mi>    </mfrac>    <mo>+</mo>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>T</mi>       <mi>i</mi>      </msub>      <mo>-</mo>      <msub>       <mi>T</mi>       <mn>1</mn>      </msub>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>+</mo>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>n</mi>       <mi>i</mi>      </msub>      <mo>-</mo>      <msub>       <mi>n</mi>       <mn>1</mn>      </msub>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">Herein, c may be the speed of light, {x<sub>t</sub>, y<sub>t</sub>} may be a (unknown) coordinate of a target UE, {x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>} may be a coordinate of a (known) TP, and {x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>} may be a coordinate of a reference TP (or another TP).

In order to obtain the absolute position and the shape/orientation information of the vehicle, a novel positioning and geometry detection technology by using multiple on-board antennas transmitting wireless signals and multiple backscatter-tags alongside the road which provides reflections is proposed below. The proposed technique can estimate the absolute positioning of the vehicle by detecting the distances from on-board antennas to the tags and reading the tags position information via the proposed backscatter communication (BackCom). This technique can efficiently compensate the drawback of existing autonomous driving sensing techniques, e.g., RADAR and LIDAR which can only support relative positioning with the absence of GPS, and further enhance the reliability and efficiency of autonomous vehicles as well as contribute to the development of future smart cities.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0154">Autonomous driving is widely envisioned to be a disruptive technology that will eliminate accidence, traffic congestion, and reduce greenhouse gas emission by enabling transportation a fully automatic process. The potential huge impact of the cross-disciplinary technology has attracted heavy R&#x26;D investments by leading car manufactures (e.g., Toyota, Tesla, BMW) and Internet companies (e.g., Google, Apple, Baidu). Specifically, vehicular positioning may play an important role in the autonomous driving scenario, as it enables the autonomous vehicles to accomplish lots of tasks, such as driving-path planning and navigation, to guarantee a safely driving in streets. Therefore, fast and reliable vehicular positioning (relative position &#x26; absolute position) will enhance the functionality of the autonomous vehicles.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0155">Hereinafter, the existing positioning technologies for autonomous driving will be described below. An autonomous vehicle has the capability of sensing its surroundings by distance detection and then navigating safely without human impact. Autonomous vehicle may leverage a variety of vehicle-mounted sensors, such as automotive Radar, camera, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Global Positioning System (GPS), to sense the environment and detect its own position, which is a critical function of autonomous driving, named as self-positioning. With the absence of GPS, relative positioning with respect to the surrounding environment or vehicles can be achieved, and absolute positioning may be also available after alignment with the information from GPS. As is well known, all of the self-positioning techniques have their specific characteristics. The existing key self-positioning techniques are introduced as follows.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0156">Automotive Radar: Automotive radar can localize vehicles as well as estimate their velocities via sending a special waveform (e.g., frequency modulated continuous waveform) and analyzing its reflection by the vehicles. Recent breakthroughs in millimeter wave (mmWave) radar, operating between 76 and 81 GHz frequencies, may contribute to the deployment of large-scale but highly impact arrays to achieve a much higher resolution than traditional radar operating at lower frequencies. It may work well in hostile weather conditions (e.g., heavy snow, rain, fog) or in an environment with poor lighting.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0157">LiDAR and Camera: LiDAR may apply narrow laser beams to scan surrounding environment, analyze the backscattered laser signal, and finally generate high resolution three-dimensional (3-D) digital images for safe navigation in dynamic environment. Moreover, the relative distance as well as geometrical shape of nearby vehicles can be detected based on the 3-D map. Camera can capture texture, color, and shape of nearby object by using computer vision techniques.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0158">On the other hand, cooperative positioning may be another main positioning approach aiming at supporting vehicular positioning in environments where GPS is ineffective such as dense urban cities or tunnels. By leveraging V2V communications or V2X connections to the infrastructures, cooperative positioning may allow a vehicle to receive and combine position-related data sent by a group of nearby vehicles, thereby inferring their positions using either statistical inference or geometric analysis of received signals. Furthermore, 5G mmWave communication techniques can be also applied to further enhance the performance of the cooperative positioning.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0159">Hereinafter, drawbacks of existing autonomous vehicle sensing technologies will be described below.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0160">Although the existing autonomous vehicle sensing technologies have been widely used in vehicle positioning and geometry detection, they still may have lots of drawbacks which impact the performance of autonomous driving. The details are shown as follows.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0161">Automotive Radar: The main disadvantage may be that radar can incorrectly recognize some harmless small metal object (e.g., a soda can) as a much larger object, leading to false alarms. Moreover, the radar may be constrained by line-of-sight (LoS) and cannot see through a larger vehicles such as a truck ahead. Therefore, the radar may be limited in relative positioning without offline maps for alignment and GPS signals.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0162">LiDAR and Camera: LiDAR may be constrained by LoS and inefficient under bad weather conditions due to the difficulty of light penetrating fog, snow or rain. In addition, LiDAR may be expensive with a typical price from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars and the huge amount of generated data may be challenging to be processed within a short time. Typically, camera may not have the intrinsic capabilities of positioning and its drawbacks also may include sensitivity to light, weather conditions, and increased computational cost.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0163">Cooperative Positioning: The cooperative technology has its own main drawback that it may suffer from hostile environment and extreme channel fadings. Specifically, its implementation in a dense vehicular network may incur high communication cost and suffer performance degradation due to communication latency, packet loss, limited link life time, inter-vehicle interference among other issues. Furthermore, efficient resource management and multi-access in vehicular networks pose open challenges due to the more complex protocols required for overlaying V2V communications and V2X radio access.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0164">Hereinafter, the motivation of the disclosure will be described will be described.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0165">The main drawback of the self-positioning technologies may be that only relative positioning is available. The on-board sensing system may not communicate with the outside, and thus the absolute position information may be unknown. The alignment may be time-consuming even if the offline map is available. For cooperative positioning technologies, it may fully depend on the V2V or V2X communications and may be thereby easily to be affected by hostile environment and extreme channel fadings. The high latency of communication delay can also be sensitive to the vehicular positioning.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0166">To fix the critical aforementioned issues, the backscatter tag may be exploited which can be deployed alongside the roads, and develop a positioning technique to obtain the vehicle's absolute position information with the absence of the GPS. By using the proposed technique of the present disclosure, the absolute positon of the vehicle in may be obtained in a fast and reliable manner with low-cost backscatter tags. The proposed technique is suitable for the scenario where the JFPM signals are used which differentiate signals from different antennas. To adopt signature sequences for the coding of the signals reflected from different backscatter tags is proposed. By using multiple on-board antennas and multiple backscatter tags, the vehicle's absolute position and orientation/moving direction can be uniquely determined by the algorithm provided in the technique part with the presence of noise. Moreover, the proposed technique is robust and works well under various challenging scenarios, where the offline maps, GPS, and road information are all unavailable. In summary, the pioneering technology developed here can be fused into and jointly used with all existing vehicle sensing techniques, which will fully unleash the potential of autonomous vehicles and have a huge impact on enhancing the reliability and efficiency of autonomous driving.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0167">Referring to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a technical solution will be proposed.

For example, by replacing the representation of Bit 1 with well-designed signature sequences (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>), the RX can recognize the signature sequence with the detected distance distribution along the time domain. Thus each detected distance may be connected to a unique signature sequence.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0180">For example, based on the design of BackCom, i.e., Bit 1 and Bit 0, orthogonal access can be achieved by exploiting the signature sequences of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>.

Note that the backscatter tags can be synchronized because they are static and close to each other.

Alternatively, the blocks <b>1010</b> to <b>1050</b> may be implemented by the processors <b>102</b> and <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> and the block <b>1060</b> may be implemented by the transceivers <b>106</b> and <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0227">Codewords may be converted into radio signals via the signal processing circuit <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>. Herein, the codewords are encoded bit sequences of information blocks. The information blocks may include transport blocks (e.g., a UL-SCH transport block, a DL-SCH transport block). The radio signals may be transmitted through various physical channels (e.g., a PUSCH and a PDSCH).</p><p id="p-0232" num="0228">Specifically, the codewords may be converted into scrambled bit sequences by the scramblers <b>1010</b>. Scramble sequences used for scrambling may be generated based on an initialization value, and the initialization value may include ID information of a wireless device. The scrambled bit sequences may be modulated to modulation symbol sequences by the modulators <b>1020</b>. A modulation scheme may include pi/2-Binary Phase Shift Keying (pi/2-BPSK), m-Phase Shift Keying (m-PSK), and m-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (m-QAM). Complex modulation symbol sequences may be mapped to one or more transport layers by the layer mapper <b>1030</b>. Modulation symbols of each transport layer may be mapped (precoded) to corresponding antenna port(s) by the precoder <b>1040</b>. Outputs z of the precoder <b>1040</b> may be obtained by multiplying outputs y of the layer mapper <b>1030</b> by an N*M precoding matrix W. Herein, N is the number of antenna ports and M is the number of transport layers. The precoder <b>1040</b> may perform precoding after performing transform precoding (e.g., DFT) for complex modulation symbols. Alternatively, the precoder <b>1040</b> may perform precoding without performing transform precoding.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0229">The resource mappers <b>1050</b> may map modulation symbols of each antenna port to time-frequency resources. The time-frequency resources may include a plurality of symbols (e.g., a CP-OFDMA symbols and DFT-s-OFDMA symbols) in the time domain and a plurality of subcarriers in the frequency domain. The signal generators <b>1060</b> may generate radio signals from the mapped modulation symbols and the generated radio signals may be transmitted to other devices through each antenna. For this purpose, the signal generators <b>1060</b> may include Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) modules, Cyclic Prefix (CP) inserters, Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs), and frequency up-converters.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0230">Signal processing procedures for a signal received in the wireless device may be configured in a reverse manner of the signal processing procedures <b>1010</b> to <b>1060</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>. For example, the wireless devices (e.g., <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>) may receive radio signals from the exterior through the antenna ports/transceivers. The received radio signals may be converted into baseband signals through signal restorers. To this end, the signal restorers may include frequency downlink converters, Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), CP remover, and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) modules. Next, the baseband signals may be restored to codewords through a resource demapping procedure, a postcoding procedure, a demodulation processor, and a descrambling procedure. The codewords may be restored to original information blocks through decoding. Therefore, a signal processing circuit (not illustrated) for a reception signal may include signal restorers, resource demappers, a postcoder, demodulators, descramblers, and decoders.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0231"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> shows another example of a wireless device, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.
