Such visual information is implemented by independently controlling light emission of sub-pixels arranged in a matrix. The sub-pixel refers to a minimum unit for implementing one color.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The flexible display unit <b>151</b> may be in a curved state (e.g., a vertically or horizontally curved state) rather than a flat state in the basic state.

Such deformation detection means may be included in the sensing unit <b>140</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The deformation detection means may be disposed in the flexible display unit <b>151</b> or a case (first to third frames <b>101</b> to <b>103</b> to be described later) to detect information related to the deformation of the flexible display unit <b>151</b>. In this connection, the information related to the deformation may include a direction in which the flexible display unit <b>151</b> is deformed, a degree of the deformation, a deformed position, a deformed time, an acceleration at which the deformed flexible display unit <b>151</b> is restored, and the like. In addition, the information related to the deformation may be various information that may be detected due to the bending of the flexible display unit <b>151</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In addition, the controller <b>180</b> may change information displayed on the flexible display unit <b>151</b> or generate a control signal for controlling a function of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> based on the information related to the deformation of the flexible display unit <b>151</b> detected by the deformation detection means.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The state conversion (first or second state) of the flexible display unit <b>151</b>, i.e., the size change at the front and rear faces of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> of the display unit <b>151</b> based on the size change of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be performed manually by a force applied by the user, but may be not limited to such manual scheme. For example, when the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the flexible display unit <b>151</b> is in the first state, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the flexible display unit <b>151</b> may be converted into the second state by the user or an application command without the external force applied by the user.

Thus, a portion of the display unit <b>151</b> is disposed on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> based on such side, and the other portion thereof is disposed on the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. A portion of the display unit <b>151</b> located on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be fixed to the front face so as not to move.

Accordingly, the portion disposed on the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> moves, so that the size of the portion disposed on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be adjusted. Since the area of the flexible display unit <b>151</b> is determined and the flexible display unit <b>151</b> is formed of one continuous body, an area of the portion on the rear face decreases as an area of the portion on the front face increases.

For this reason, the antenna may be implemented on the flexible display unit <b>151</b>. An antenna on display (AOD) is an antenna in which a transparent film is formed by stacking an electrode layer and a dielectric layer that have patterns engraved thereon, respectively. The antenna on display may be implemented thinner than an antenna implemented using a laser direct structuring (LDS) technology using a conventional copper nickel plating scheme, so that the antenna on display may not be exposed to the outside without affecting a thickness. In addition, the antenna on display may transmit and receive a signal directly to or from the display unit <b>151</b>. Accordingly, the antenna on display may be used in the mobile terminal <b>100</b> in which the display unit <b>151</b> is located on the both faces of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> as in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, a detailed configuration of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> of the present disclosure will be described in detail below.

The first frame <b>101</b> and the second frame <b>102</b> include front portions, a rear portions, and side portions, respectively, and are coupled to each other. Thus, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may have a hexahedral outer shape by such coupled first and second frames <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. In consideration of an illustrated configuration of the first to third frames <b>101</b> to <b>103</b>, movements of the second and third frames <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> may be a slide movement.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">First, the first frame <b>101</b> corresponds to a main body of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and may have a space therein for accommodating various components.

The variable portion in which the position or bending angle of the bent portion changes requires a structure for supporting a rear face of the variable portion in response to the change.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">A first region of the display unit <b>151</b> may be coupled to the first front portion <b>1011</b> corresponding to the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, various physical input units <b>120</b> for manipulation of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and sensing units <b>140</b> may be located on the first rear portion <b>1012</b>, and the display unit <b>151</b> may be disposed only on the second rear portion <b>1013</b>. Since the first rear portion <b>1012</b> does not overlap the flexible display unit <b>151</b> regardless of the state of the mobile terminal, and is always exposed to the outside, the input unit <b>120</b> such as various buttons, switches, the camera <b>121</b>, and a flash, and the sensing unit <b>140</b> such as a proximity sensor <b>141</b> may be arranged on the first rear portion <b>1012</b>. In a conventional bar-shaped terminal, a display unit is provided only on a front face of the terminal. Therefore, a main camera is placed on a rear face of the terminal in order for the user to capture an object at an opposite side while looking through the display unit. On the other hand, an additional auxiliary camera is required to be disposed on the front face of the terminal in order for the user to capture himself or herself while viewing himself or herself through the display unit.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">However, the display unit <b>151</b> is positioned both the front face and the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> of the present disclosure.

When containing a metal material, the side portion <b>1014</b> may serve as an antenna.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The second rear portion <b>1013</b> of the first frame <b>101</b> may be covered by the display unit, but may be disposed on the front face of the display unit using a transparent material.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The second frame <b>102</b> may include a second front portion <b>1021</b> disposed at the front portion of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and a third rear portion <b>1022</b> disposed at the rear portion of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. Like the first front portion <b>1011</b> and the first rear portion <b>1012</b> of the first frame <b>101</b>, the second front portion <b>1021</b> and the third rear portion <b>1023</b> may be formed of plate-shaped members that are generally flat. In addition, the second frame <b>102</b> also accommodates various components, and must not interfere with the components accommodated in the first frame <b>101</b> during the movement. Accordingly, the second front portion <b>1021</b> and the third rear portion <b>1022</b> may be coupled to each other in a state of being spaced apart from each other to define a predetermined space therebetween, and may have shapes that do not interfere with the components in the first frame <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In addition, the display unit <b>151</b> may be bent 180 degrees while being rolled in the second frame <b>102</b> to be disposed on both the front face and the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. For such an arrangement of the display unit <b>151</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> may include a roller <b>1028</b> rotatably disposed therein. The roller <b>1028</b> may be disposed at any position inside the second frame <b>102</b>. However, the display unit <b>151</b> should be spread flat on the front face and the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> to provide a good quality screen to the user. Further, for such spread, a proper tension must be provided on the display unit <b>151</b>. In order to provide the proper tension, the roller <b>1028</b> may be disposed at a first directional end of the second frame <b>102</b>. The roller <b>1028</b> may extend in the third direction, and may be rotatably coupled to the second frame <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The display unit <b>151</b> may be rolled around the roller <b>1028</b> while being gently bent with a predetermined curvature. The flexible display unit <b>151</b> may include a first face on which a video is output and exposed to the outside and an inner face facing the frame at the opposite side. The roller <b>1028</b> may be installed to rotate freely in the second frame <b>102</b> while being in contact with the inner face of the display unit <b>151</b>. Accordingly, the roller <b>1028</b> may actually move the display unit <b>151</b> in a lateral direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, that is, in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal direction. As will be described later, when the second frame <b>102</b> slides, because of the tension applied by the second frame <b>102</b>, the display unit <b>151</b> moves to the front face or the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> in different directions (i.e., the first direction D<b>1</b> or the second direction D<b>2</b>) relative to the second frame <b>102</b>. The roller <b>1028</b> may guide such movement while rotating.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition, the roller <b>1028</b> is disposed on a first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the second frame <b>102</b>, and the first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>actually corresponds to an outermost side portion of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. When the first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the second frame <b>102</b> is exposed, the display unit <b>151</b> rolled on the roller <b>1028</b> may be damaged. Accordingly, the second frame <b>102</b> may include a side frame <b>1024</b> disposed on the first side portion <b>102</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The side frame <b>1024</b> extends in the longitudinal direction of the second frame <b>102</b> to cover the first side portion <b>102</b><i>a</i>, thereby protecting the roller <b>1028</b> and the display unit <b>151</b> rolled thereon. That is, the side frame <b>1024</b> covers the side face of the display unit <b>151</b>, and the side face thereof is located in the third region. The first to third regions are at specified positions on the flexible display unit and do not change in size or position, but the sizes of the front face and the rear face, and the position of the side face are determined based on the state of the main frame. The first region and the second region correspond to the fixed portion described above, and the third region corresponds to the variable portion described above.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The third region may vary in position depending on the state of the mobile terminal.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Because the side face is rolled by the roller, the side face is bent with the predetermined curvature, and an inner face of the side frame may include a curved face corresponding to the curvature of the side face.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Because of the side frame <b>1024</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> may have the substantially closed first side portion <b>102</b><i>a</i>, and the side frame <b>1024</b> may substantially form the outer shape of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> together with the side face <b>1014</b> of the first frame <b>101</b>. In addition, the second frame <b>102</b> may include a second side portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>that is disposed opposite the first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>to minimize interference with the components within the first frame <b>101</b> during the movement, and is opened.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Such a second frame <b>102</b> is movably coupled to the first frame <b>101</b>, and thus may slide in the predetermined first or second direction D<b>1</b> or D<b>2</b> relative to the first frame <b>101</b>. More specifically, the second frame <b>102</b> may be movably coupled to the first frame <b>101</b> through the side portion of the first frame <b>101</b>, more precisely, through the opened second side portion <b>101</b><i>b</i>, as shown. More specifically, the second side portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the second frame is disposed relatively adjacent to the first side portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the first frame <b>101</b> which is closed. Accordingly, the first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the second frame may be disposed to be opposite to the first side portion <b>101</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the second side portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>is inserted into the first frame <b>101</b> through the side portion of the first frame, that is, the second side portion <b>101</b><i>b </i>thereof. The first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>is not inserted into the first frame <b>101</b> but is always located outside the first frame <b>101</b>, thereby forming the outer shape of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> as described above. However, when necessary, such first side portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the second frame <b>102</b> may also be inserted into the first frame <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Because of such positional relationship, the second frame <b>102</b> may extend from or contract to the first frame <b>101</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the first frame <b>101</b>. That is, the first and second directions D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> may basically be directions perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the first frame <b>101</b>. Further, the first and second directions D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> may also be described as the lateral direction or the horizontal direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the first frame <b>101</b>. In addition, during the movement in the first direction D<b>1</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> extends from the first frame <b>101</b>. Accordingly, the first direction D<b>1</b> may be a direction in which the second frame <b>102</b> moves away from the first frame <b>101</b>, that is, moves outwardly of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the first frame <b>101</b>. On the other hand, during the movement in the second direction D<b>2</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> contracts to the first frame <b>101</b>. Thus, the second direction D<b>2</b> is a direction opposite to the first direction D<b>1</b>, so that the second direction D<b>2</b> may be a direction in which the second frame <b>102</b> moves to become closer to the first frame <b>101</b>, that is, moves inwardly of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the first frame <b>101</b>. When being moved in the first direction D<b>1</b>, such second frame <b>102</b> extends and applies a force to the portion of the display unit <b>151</b> disposed on the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, so that the portion of the display unit <b>151</b> may be disposed on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and a region for such additional arrangement may be defined. Thus, the second frame <b>102</b> may convert the mobile terminal <b>100</b> into the second state with the display unit <b>151</b> with the relatively extended front face by moving in the first direction D<b>1</b>. On the other hand, when being moved in the second direction D<b>2</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> contracts into an original state thereof, and applies a force to the portion of the display unit <b>151</b> disposed on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> to return to the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> again. Thus, the second frame <b>102</b> may convert the mobile terminal <b>100</b> into the first state with the display unit <b>151</b> with the relatively contracted front face by moving in the second direction D<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the second frame <b>102</b> selectively exposes the display unit <b>151</b> to the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> depending on the moving direction (i.e., the first or second direction D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>). Accordingly, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be converted into the first or second state defined above.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">During the expansion and the contraction in such first and second directions D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> may overlap the first frame <b>101</b>, more precisely, the first front portion <b>1011</b> and the first rear portion <b>1012</b> thereof so as not to interfere with the first frame <b>101</b>. More specifically, the display unit <b>151</b> may be coupled to and supported by the first front portion <b>1011</b> of the first frame <b>101</b>, as described above. Accordingly, the display unit <b>151</b> does not need to be additionally supported by the second front portion <b>1021</b> of the second frame <b>102</b>. Rather, when the second front portion <b>1021</b> is interposed between the first front portion <b>1011</b> and the display unit <b>151</b>, the display unit <b>151</b> may be deformed or damaged because of friction with the second front portion <b>1021</b>, which is repeatedly moved. Thus, the second front portion <b>1021</b> may be disposed below the first front portion <b>1011</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. That is, a front face of the second front portion <b>1021</b> may face the rear face of the first front portion <b>1011</b>.

In addition, the rear face of the second rear portion <b>1013</b> may be in contact with the front face of the third rear portion <b>1022</b> to stably support the movement of the second frame <b>102</b>. Because of such arrangement, the third rear portion <b>1022</b> may be exposed to the outside of the first frame, more precisely, of the second rear portion <b>1013</b>, and may be coupled to the display unit <b>151</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Alternatively, when the second rear portion <b>1013</b> is made of a transparent material, the second rear portion <b>1013</b> may form an outer shape of the rear face of the mobile terminal. The second rear portion <b>1013</b> may be positioned rearward of the third rear portion <b>1022</b> of the second frame, and the flexible display unit may be disposed between the second rear portion <b>1013</b> and the third rear portion <b>1022</b> in the first state.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">When the second rear portion <b>1013</b> is made of a material such as a transparent glass to form the outer shape of the rear face of the mobile terminal, the first rear portion <b>1012</b> may be implemented using the same member as the second rear portion <b>1013</b>. That is, the camera <b>121</b>, the flash or the sensing unit <b>140</b>, and the like may be arranged by partially coating the plate-shaped member of the transparent glass material to not allow the internal components to be visible and by not coating only a required portion.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, the second frame <b>102</b> may expand and contract the size of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> itself, particularly the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> by the expansion and the contraction in the first and second directions D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>. Thus, the display unit <b>151</b> must move by such extended or reduced front face size to obtain the intended first and second states. However, when being fixed to the second frame <b>102</b>, the display unit <b>151</b> may not be moved smoothly to be adapted for the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> that is expanded or contracted. For this reason, the display unit <b>151</b> may be movably coupled to the second frame <b>102</b>. More specifically, the display unit <b>151</b> may include a first side edge (or side end) <b>151</b><i>d </i>disposed on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and a second side edge <b>151</b><i>e </i>opposite to the first side edge <b>151</b><i>d </i>and disposed on the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. The first side edge <b>151</b> may be disposed on the front face of the first frame <b>101</b>, that is, the front face of the first front portion <b>1011</b> thereof, and may be disposed adjacent to the side portion of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, that is, the first side portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the first frame. On the other hand, since the second side edge <b>151</b><i>e </i>is adjacent to the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and the third rear portion <b>1022</b> of the second frame <b>102</b>, the second side edge <b>151</b><i>e </i>may be coupled the third rear portion <b>1022</b> of the second frame <b>102</b> to be movable in the first and second directions D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>. In addition, since the display unit <b>151</b> is not structurally strong, a third frame <b>103</b> may be coupled to the second side edge <b>151</b><i>e</i>. The third frame <b>103</b> may be formed of a plate-shaped member extending in the longitudinal direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the third frame <b>103</b> may be coupled to the second frame, that is, the third rear portion <b>1022</b> thereof to be movable in the first and second directions D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> instead of the second side edge <b>151</b><i>e</i>. In addition, the second frame <b>102</b> may include a slot <b>1025</b> extending in the lateral direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the second frame <b>102</b>, that is, the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction thereof. Further, the third frame <b>103</b> may be stably moved while being guided by the slot <b>1025</b>. The third frame <b>103</b> may include, for example, a projection inserted into the slot <b>1025</b> for the movement along the slot <b>1025</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, in connection with such configuration of the first to third frames <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, and <b>103</b>, the display unit <b>151</b> may include a first region <b>1511</b> extending from one side thereof, that is, the first side edge <b>151</b><i>d </i>toward the second side edge <b>151</b><i>e </i>by a predetermined length, and a second region <b>1512</b> disposed opposite the first region <b>1511</b>, and extending from the second side edge <b>151</b><i>e </i>toward the first side edge <b>151</b><i>d </i>by a predetermined length.

The second region <b>1512</b> may be fixed by the third frame <b>103</b> disposed on the second frame (i.e., the third rear portion <b>1022</b>) and may be movably coupled to the second frame <b>1012</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In such first state, when the second frame <b>102</b> moves in the first direction D<b>1</b>, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be converted into the second state. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>B, and <b>5</b>B</figref>, the second frame <b>102</b> may extend from the first frame <b>101</b> by the movement in the first direction D<b>1</b>, and may increase the overall size of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, in particular, the front face thereof. During the movement in the first direction D<b>1</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> may apply a force, that is, a tension, to the display unit <b>151</b> in the first direction D<b>1</b>. The display unit <b>151</b> is fixed to the first frame <b>101</b> but is coupled to the second frame <b>102</b> so as to be movable using the third frame <b>103</b>, so that the force applied by the second frame <b>102</b> allows the third region <b>1513</b> to be rolled out from the roller <b>1028</b> of the second frame <b>102</b> to the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. That is, the third region <b>1513</b> may be withdrawn (or pulled out) from the second frame <b>102</b> or extend to (or move out of) the second frame <b>102</b>. At the same time, the third region <b>1513</b>, particularly, the portion located on the rear face of the third region <b>1513</b> may be rolled into the roller <b>1028</b> of the second frame <b>102</b> from the rear face, or may be inserted (or pushed in), retracted, or moved into the second frame <b>102</b>. Not an entirety of the third region <b>1513</b> is withdrawn from the second frame <b>102</b> to the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and a portion of the third region <b>1513</b> may be disposed in the second frame <b>102</b> while still being rolled on the roller <b>1028</b>. In addition, for the smooth movement of the third region <b>1513</b>, the second region <b>1512</b> may also move in the first direction D<b>1</b> with respect to the second frame <b>102</b> together with the third frame <b>103</b>. In addition, as described above, the second region <b>1512</b> and the third frame <b>103</b> may be constrained to the second frame <b>102</b> and move in the first direction D<b>1</b> with respect to the first frame <b>101</b> together with the second frame <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the second region <b>1512</b> and the third frame <b>103</b> may move in the first direction D<b>1</b> relative to the first frame <b>101</b> as well as the second frame <b>102</b>, and accordingly, move a distance longer than the moved distance of the second frame <b>102</b>. Thus, because of such long distance movement in the first direction D<b>1</b> of the second region <b>1512</b>, the third region <b>1513</b> may be smoothly extended to the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. Further, for the movement of the third region <b>1513</b>, which is proportional to the expansion of the second frame <b>102</b>, the movement of the second region <b>1512</b> and the third frame <b>103</b> in the first direction D<b>1</b> may be performed simultaneously with the movement of such third region <b>1512</b> and second frame <b>102</b> in the first direction D<b>1</b> so as to be proportional to the movement of third region <b>1513</b> and second frame <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">When the second frame <b>102</b> is fully extended in the first direction D<b>1</b>, the first and third regions <b>1511</b> and <b>1513</b> may be arranged on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and only the second region <b>1512</b> may be disposed on the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. Such first and third regions <b>1511</b> and <b>1513</b> may be supported by the first frame (i.e., the first front portion <b>1011</b> thereof) and the second frame (i.e., the second front portion <b>1021</b> thereof). In addition, the second frame <b>102</b>, i.e., the third rear portion <b>1022</b> thereof exposes the second rear portion <b>1013</b> of the first frame while extending in the first direction D<b>1</b>, and supports the moving third region <b>1513</b>. Therefore, in the second state, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may have the extended front face display unit <b>151</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">On the other hand, when the second frame <b>102</b> moves in the second direction D<b>2</b> in the second state, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may again return into the first state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>4</b>A, and <b>5</b>A</figref>. The second frame <b>102</b> may be contracted to the first frame <b>101</b> by the movement in the second direction D<b>2</b>, and may reduce the overall size of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, particularly the front face thereof. The movement of the display unit <b>151</b> during such movement of the second frame <b>102</b> may be performed in a reverse order of the movement in the first direction D<b>1</b> described above. In brief, the third region <b>1513</b> may be rolled from the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> into the roller <b>1028</b> of the second frame <b>102</b>, or may be inserted, retracted, or moved into the second frame <b>102</b>. At the same time, the third region <b>1513</b> may be rolled, withdrawn, extended, or moved out of the roller <b>1028</b> of the second frame <b>102</b> to the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. Not the entirety of the third region <b>1513</b> may be withdrawn from the second frame <b>102</b> to the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and the portion of the third region <b>1513</b> may still be placed in the second frame <b>102</b> while still being rolled on the roller <b>1028</b>. In addition, for such smooth movement of the third region <b>1513</b>, the second region <b>1512</b> may also move in the second direction D<b>2</b> with respect to the second frame <b>102</b> together with the third frame <b>103</b>. The second region <b>1512</b> and the third frame <b>103</b> may be constrained to the second frame <b>102</b> to move in the second direction D<b>2</b> with respect to the first frame <b>101</b> together with the second frame <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the second region <b>1512</b> and the third frame <b>103</b> may move relatively in the second direction D<b>2</b> with respect to not only the second frame <b>102</b> but also the first frame <b>101</b>. As a result, the second region <b>1512</b> and the third frame <b>103</b> may move in the second direction D<b>2</b> a distance larger than the moved distance of the second frame <b>102</b>. Thus, because of such long distance movement of the second region <b>1512</b>, the third region <b>1513</b> may be smoothly returned to the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. Further, for the movement of the third region <b>1513</b> proportional to the contraction of the second frame <b>102</b>, the movements of the second region <b>1512</b> and the third frame <b>103</b> in the second direction D<b>2</b> may be performed simultaneously with the movements of the third region <b>1512</b> and the second frame <b>102</b> in the second direction D<b>2</b> to be proportional to the movements of the third region <b>1513</b> and the second frame <b>102</b>. When the second frame <b>102</b> is completely contracted in the second direction D<b>2</b>, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be converted into the first state as described above, and may have the display unit <b>151</b> with the front face that is relatively reduced in comparison with the second state in the first state.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side view showing a partial configuration of a mobile terminal according to an embodiment viewed from one side.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The mobile terminal <b>100</b> according to an embodiment may include the first frame <b>101</b>, the second frame <b>102</b>, the third frame <b>103</b>, a flexible display panel <b>151</b>, the driving unit <b>200</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), and a side cover <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The first frame <b>101</b> may include: a first front portion <b>1011</b> disposed in the front; and a first rear portion <b>1012</b> and a second rear portion <b>1013</b> disposed in the rear.

Herein, the first plate <b>311</b> may include: the front portion <b>311</b><i>a </i>configured to press the front edge of the flexible display panel <b>151</b>; and the side portion <b>311</b><i>b </i>provided perpendicular to the front portion <b>311</b><i>a </i>in contact with the second plate <b>312</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">When the second frame <b>102</b> moves in the first direction A, the front portion <b>311</b><i>a </i>may also move in the first direction A. In this case, the edge of the flexible display panel <b>151</b> may be exposed from the front. To prevent this problem, the first flame <b>101</b> may include a spiral spring <b>322</b> that is connected to the end of the front portion <b>311</b><i>a </i>in the second direction B, released when the front portion <b>311</b><i>a </i>moves in the first direction A, and wound when the front portion <b>311</b><i>a </i>moves in the second direction B.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Specifically, the spiral spring <b>322</b> may be provided to be wound around or unwound from a fixed shaft <b>321</b> provided in the first frame <b>101</b>. An unwound part of the spiral spring <b>322</b> may be provided at the edge of the flexible display panel <b>151</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">In this case, the spiral spring <b>322</b> may be a constant force spring that provides a constant tension regardless of the degree of unwinding. The constant force spring may be a spring that provides a constant tension in the unwinding direction even when the spiral spring <b>322</b> is unwound or wound.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In this case, the spiral spring <b>322</b> may have the same width as the front portion <b>311</b><i>a</i>. When the front portion <b>311</b><i>a </i>moves in the first direction A or the second direction B, scratching may occur in the flexible display panel <b>151</b>. Accordingly, when the spiral spring <b>322</b> has the same width as the front portion <b>311</b><i>a</i>, it is possible to prevent the scratching of the flexible display panel <b>151</b> from being exposed.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The above-described details need to be construed as illustrative and not restrictive in all aspects.
