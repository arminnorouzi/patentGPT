The power switch for a flyback converter is on the primary-side of the transformer whereas the output voltage and output current for driving a load are produced at the secondary-side of the transformer. This isolation between the output voltage/current and the power switch results in two different control methodologies: primary-only feedback control and secondary-side control.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In primary-only feedback control, a primary-side controller regulates the output power delivery by modulating the switching of the power switch. Since the output voltage and output current are produced on the secondary-side of the transformer, the primary-side controller has no direct knowledge of these parameters. For example, the output voltage cannot be fed back to the primary-side controller through a wire or lead as the isolation is then destroyed. But the primary-side controller cannot regulate the output voltage without some means of measuring the output voltage. In primary-only feedback, the primary-side controller indirectly monitors the output voltage by measuring a reflected voltage such as produced on a primary-side auxiliary winding. Although primary-side feedback thus avoids the need for a secondary-side controller to measure the output voltage and transmit the measured output voltage through an isolating channel such as an optoisolator, the indirect output voltage measurement in primary-only feedback is not as accurate as compared to a secondary-side measurement of the output voltage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The imprecision in primary-only feedback may be problematic for direct-charging modes for modern smartphones. In such direct charging, the mobile device does not use a DC-DC power converter such as a buck converter to control its battery charging. Instead, it is the flyback converter that directly charges the mobile device's battery in a direct charging mode of operation. The output voltage must then be tightly regulated to avoid damage to the battery. But the imprecision of primary-only feedback may thwart this regulation. In contrast to primary-only feedback, secondary-side regulation directly senses the output voltage. This direct sensing is inherently more accurate than the indirect sensing of primary-only feedback. In addition, secondary-side control has improved loop stability and simplifies the implementation of synchronous rectification.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, a secondary-side controller for a flyback converter is provided that includes: a control logic circuit configured to generate a power switch transistor off signal responsive to feedback information; and an isolation capacitor driver configured to drive at least one isolation capacitor with the power switch transistor off signal to signal a primary-side controller to switch off a power switch transistor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a method of secondary-side control in a flyback converter is provided that includes: generating an emulated primary-winding current responsive to a difference between a drain voltage of a synchronous rectifier switch transistor and an output voltage; generating a power switch transistor off signal responsive to a comparison of the emulated primary-winding current to an error signal; and transmitting the power switch transistor off signal through at least one isolation capacitor to a primary-side controller.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with yet another aspect of the disclosure, a flyback converter with secondary-side control is provided that includes: a transformer having a primary winding and a secondary winding; a power switch transistor coupled to the primary winding; at least one isolation capacitor; a primary-side controller configured to switch on the power switch transistor responsive to an on signal received over the at least one isolation capacitor and further configured to switch off the power switch transistor responsive to an off signal received over the at least one isolation capacitor; and a secondary-side controller configured to generate the on signal and the off signal, the secondary-side controller being further configured to generate the off signal responsive to an emulated primary-winding current.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other aspects of the invention will become more fully understood upon a review of the detailed description, which follows.

The advantages include improved transient load response as well as improved integration with secondary functions such as synchronous rectification and zero-voltage switching. In addition, an improved secondary-to-primary communication is provided. The secondary-side controller regulates an output voltage by controlling the switching of a primary-side power switch responsive to both an error signal such as between the output voltage and a desired output voltage and an emulation of the primary-side current conducted through the primary winding of the transformer. The secondary-side controller controls both the power switch on time and the power switch off time through a control signaling through at least one isolation capacitor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An example flyback converter <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> includes a terminal coupled to an output voltage rail to sense an output voltage Vout. Secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> includes an emulation circuit <b>105</b> that emulates a primary-winding current conducted in a primary winding W<b>1</b> of a transformer T. The primary-winding current conducts to ground through a power switch transistor M<b>1</b>. A drain (D) of power switch transistor M<b>1</b> connects to a bottom terminal of primary winding W<b>1</b>. An upper terminal of primary winding W<b>1</b> connects to an input voltage rail that carriers a rectified input voltage. Secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> controls the cycling of power switch transistor M<b>1</b> through on and off control signaling conducted through at least one isolation capacitor CFB. A primary-side controller U<b>1</b> responds to a cycle-on control signal received over the isolation capacitor by switching on the power switch transistor M<b>1</b>. While the primary winding current conducts through the power switch transistor M<b>1</b>, secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> keeps a synchronous rectifier (SR) switch transistor off to prevent a secondary winding current from flowing through a secondary winding W<b>2</b> of the transformer T. The primary-side controller U<b>1</b> also responds to a cycle-off control signal received over the isolation capacitor CFB by switching off the power switch transistor M<b>1</b>. Secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> may then switch on the SR switch transistor so that the secondary-winding current may flow into the output voltage rail and charge an output capacitor Cout with the output voltage Vout.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> includes a source terminal (SR S) for sensing a source voltage Vsr_s of the SR switch transistor. This source voltage ideally is at the same potential as ground for secondary-side controller U<b>2</b>. In addition, secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> includes a gate (G) terminal for driving the gate of the SR switch transistor to control whether the SR switch transistor is switched on or off. Secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> also includes a SR D terminal to sense the drain voltage (Vsr_d) of the SR switch transistor. The emulation circuit <b>105</b> uses the output voltage Vout and the drain voltage Vds to emulate the primary winding current. Based on the error between the output voltage Vout and a desired Vout and also the emulated primary winding current, secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> determines the timing of the cycle-on and cycle-off control signals. In addition, secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> may sense the output current such as through terminals to a sense resistor Rsense to assist in the timing of the cycle-on- and cycle-off control signals. Secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> may control the cycling of the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> using any suitable modulation technique such a pulse-width modulation or pulse frequency modulation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The cycle-on and cycle-off control signaling from the secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> to the primary-side controller U<b>1</b> is further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> for an implementation using a single isolation capacitor CFB. On the secondary side, the secondary-side control and feedback functionality briefly pulses a secondary-side set signal (Sec_set) when it is desired to switch on the power switch transistor M<b>1</b>. This pulsing is shown occurring at a time t<b>0</b> in a signal plot shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In response to the secondary-side set signal, an isolation capacitor driver in the secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> pulses a voltage of a first plate (node A) of the isolation capacitor CFB. This pulsing of the node A voltage causes a voltage of a second plate (node B) of the isolation capacitor to briefly spike high at time t<b>0</b>. A CFB receiver in the primary-side controller U<b>1</b> detects this spiking of the node B voltage as the cycle-on control signal. In response to the spiking of the node B voltage, the CFB receiver asserts a primary-side set signal (Pri_set) that causes a gate driver in the primary-side controller U<b>1</b> to switch on the power switch transistor M<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The control and feedback functionality in the secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> then briefly pulses a secondary-side reset signal (Sec_reset) at a time t<b>1</b> in response to a determination that the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> should be cycled off. The isolation capacitor driver then discharges the node A voltage at time t<b>1</b>, which causes the node B voltage to briefly pulse negatively. The CFB receiver responds to this negative pulsing of the node B voltage by briefly pulsing a primary-side reset signal to cause the gate driver to discharge the gate voltage of the power switch transistor M<b>1</b>. The gate voltage (gate signal) of the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> thus stays charged from time t<b>0</b> to a time t<b>1</b>. An analogous signaling through the isolation capacitor CFB is then repeated so that the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> may be cycled on at a time t<b>2</b> to a time t<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To improve the noise immunity, a differential signaling may be used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The isolation capacitor CFB discussed with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is replaced by a positive isolation capacitor CFB_P and a negative isolation capacitor CFB_N. These isolation capacitors are then driven differentially in an analogous fashion as discussed with regard to the single-ended driving of isolation capacitor CFB.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An embodiment of the primary winding current emulation that uses a secondary-side sense resistor R_sec is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Referring again to flyback converter <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, note that the primary-side controller U<b>1</b> does not need an auxiliary winding to control the cycling of the power switch transistor due to the secondary-side control. Similarly, the primary-side controller does not need a sense resistor voltage from a primary-side sense resistor coupled between the source of the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> and ground to control the cycling of the power switch transistor due to the secondary-side control But these components are traditional in primary-side control of the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> and are thus shown for conceptual purposes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. With regard to this traditional primary-side control, it would be conventional for a primary-side controller to sense the primary-side sense resistor voltage to determine when to switch off the power switch transistor M<b>1</b>. The behavior of the primary-side sense resistor voltage depends upon whether discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) or continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation is active. In DCM, the primary-side sense resistor voltage rises from zero when the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> is switched on because there is no primary winding current flowing at that time. But in CCM, the primary winding current has a non-zero initial value (Iinitial) when the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> is switched on. The peak primary-side sense resistor voltage occurs when the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> is about to be turned off. The on-time period for the power switch transistor may be represented by a variable T. The peak primary-side sense resistor voltage for CCM operation may be shown to equal [(Vin/L)*T+Iinitial)]*Rsense, where Vin is the rectified input voltage, L is the magnetizing inductance of the primary winding, and Rsense is the resistance of the primary-side sense resistor. Note that this equation is also applicable to DCM since Iinitial is zero in that case.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The question thus becomes one of how to emulate this peak primary-side sense resistor voltage in the secondary-side controller U<b>2</b>. At the secondary-side before the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> is cycled on, the current through the secondary-side sense resistor R_sec and Iinitial are related through the turn ratio of the transformer, which in this embodiment is assumed to be N. To emulate this initial current Initial, the secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> may thus sample a voltage Vrsec across the secondary-side resistor R_sec just prior to switching on the power switch transistor M<b>1</b>. After scaling Vrsec by a factor &#x2212;m to account for the turn ratio, the secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> may pre-charge a capacitor C to a voltage of Vrsec*(&#x2212;m) to model the effects of the initial current Iinitial. For example, the secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> may include a switch S<b>1</b> that closes to couple the voltage Vrsec*(&#x2212;m) to the capacitor C and then opens prior to the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> on time.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">When the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> cycles on, a difference between the SR switch transistor drain voltage (Vsr_d) and the output voltage Vout is proportional to the input voltage Vin. This difference voltage may be impressed across a resistor R (not illustrated) to form a current K*(Vsr_d&#x2212;Vout)/R, where K is a proportionality factor. This current may then charge the capacitor C so that the current is integrated over time to emulate the peak primary winding current (which is proportional to the peak primary-side sense resistor voltage). A voltage Cramp across the capacitor C will thus ramp up according to the equation of Cramp=(K/RC)*Vin/T+(&#x2212;mVrsec). This Cramp voltage emulates or provides an equivalent of the primary-side sense resistor voltage. By monitoring the Cramp voltage, the secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> may thus determine when the desired peak primary winding current has been reached and command for the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> to be cycled off accordingly.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The secondary-side sense resistor R_sec introduces loss. To improve efficiency, it may be eliminated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In such an implementation, the voltage Vsr_ds across the SR switch transistor may be sampled during CCM operation just before the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> is switched on. In CCM operation, the primary winding initial current Iinitial is proportional to the voltage Vsr_ds at this sampling time. The voltage Vsr_ds may then be scaled by the factor &#x2212;m to pre-charge the capacitor C through switch S<b>1</b> as discussed with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. During DCM operation, the SR switch transistor is off prior to when the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> is cycled on. In response to the SR switch transistor being already switched off prior to the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> on time, the secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> may provide a zero initial voltage to the capacitor C. With Cramp set to the initial voltage, the capacitor C may integrate the current (Vsr_d&#x2212;Vout)/R as discussed with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The Cramp voltage to emulate the peak sense resistor voltage may thus be defined using the equation of Cramp=(K/RC)*Vin/T+(&#x2212;m)Vsr_ds for embodiments in which the current Initial is estimated without a secondary-side sense resistor. Note that the sampling of the Vsr_ds voltage may be implemented in a variety of fashions. For example, the Vsr_ds voltage may be sampled while the SR switch transistor is on, scaled with the factor (&#x2212;m) and held so as to be applied to the capacitor C after the SR switch transistor switches off. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are merely illustrative and that other implementations may be used to emulate the primary winding current. For example, the two components (K/RC)*Vin/T and (&#x2212;m)Vsr_ds need not be combined but may be applied separately to different nodes of the control loop to emulate the primary winding current.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A circuit implementation <b>600</b> for the emulation of the primary winding current without the use of a secondary-side sense resistor is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The output voltage Vout is converted to a current by a resistor R to drive the drain of a diode-connected NMOS transistor M<b>4</b> that is in a current-mirror configuration with an NMOS transistor M<b>3</b>. The gate of transistor M<b>3</b> is thus connected to the gate of the diode-connected transistor M<b>4</b>. Both the sources of transistors M<b>3</b> and M<b>4</b> are connected to ground. The transistor M<b>3</b> will thus conduct a mirrored version of the current (Vout)/R. A drain of transistor M<b>3</b> connects to a drain of a diode-connected transistor M<b>2</b> having a source connected to ground. The drain voltage Vsr_d of the SR switch transistor is converted into a current (Vsr_d)/R by another resistor R to drive the drain of diode-connected transistor M<b>2</b>. The transistor M<b>2</b> will thus conduct a difference current of (Vsr_d&#x2212;Vout)/R. Diode-connected transistor M<b>2</b> forms a current mirror with another NMOS transistor M<b>1</b> that has its source connected to ground and a gate connected to a drain/gate of diode-connected transistor M<b>2</b>. Transistor M<b>1</b> will thus conduct a mirrored version of the current (Vsr_d&#x2212;Vout)/R.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The drain of transistor M<b>1</b> connects to a drain of a diode-connected PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> having a source connected to a power supply voltage node. Transistor P<b>1</b> forms a current mirror with another PMOS transistor P<b>3</b> having a drain coupled to ground through a first plate of capacitor C. Transistor P<b>3</b> will thus conduct a mirrored version of the current (Vsr_d&#x2212;Vout)/R to charge capacitor C with the Cramp voltage as discussed earlier. To provide the initial charge on the capacitor C, a differential amplifier <b>605</b> amplifies the Vsr_ds voltage across the SR switch transistor to charge the first plate of capacitor C<b>1</b> by a coupling through an NMOS transistor M<b>6</b>. Transistor M<b>6</b> functions as discussed with regard to switch S<b>1</b>. To switch off transistor M<b>6</b>, diode-connected transistor P<b>1</b> also forms a current mirror with a PMOS transistor P<b>2</b>. When the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> is cycled on, transistor P<b>2</b> will thus conduct a mirrored version of the current (Vsr_d&#x2212;Vout)/R into a drain of an NMOS transistor M<b>5</b> that forms a current mirror with diode-connected transistor M<b>4</b>. Depending upon the relative sizes of transistors M<b>5</b> and P<b>2</b>, the drain voltage of transistor M<b>5</b> will thus begin to rise when the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> is cycled on. An inverter <b>601</b> couples between the drain of transistor M<b>5</b> and the gate of transistor M<b>6</b> so that transistor M<b>6</b> is cycled off when the power switch transistor M<b>1</b> is cycled on. Prior to being switched off, transistor M<b>6</b> will conduct responsive to the output of differential amplifier <b>605</b> such that the capacitor C is pre-charged with the initial (&#x2212;m)Vsr_ds voltage.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A flyback converter <b>700</b> with the secondary-side control disclosed herein is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Although not needed for the secondary-side regulation, a primary-side sense resistor Rpri is included so that primary-side controller U<b>1</b> may monitor for an overcurrent condition using an overcurrent protection circuit <b>750</b>. Depending upon the regulation scheme, secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> may include an oscillator (e.g., included within a control logic circuit <b>725</b>) that determines the on-time of the power switch transistor M<b>1</b>. A CFB driver <b>730</b> in secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> and a CFB receiver <b>735</b> in primary-side controller U<b>1</b> function as discussed regarding the differential signaling embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> includes a primary-winding current emulator <b>705</b> that emulates the primary winding current as discussed herein. In addition, secondary-side controller U<b>2</b> includes an error amplifier <b>715</b> that generates an error signal depending upon the whether a constant voltage (CV) or a constant current (CC) mode of operation is active. In CV, the error amplifier <b>715</b> compares the output voltage Vout to a reference or desired output voltage to generate the error signal. In CC, the error amplifier <b>715</b> compare the output current as sensed over a secondary-side sense resistor Rsns. Error amplifier <b>715</b> may be configured to integrate and/or filter the error signal so that it may be mapped into a threshold signal representing a threshold current. A comparator <b>720</b> compares an emulated signal representing the emulated primary winding current to the threshold signal representing the threshold current. When this comparison indicates that the emulated primary winding current has risen in amplitude to equal the threshold current, the control logic circuit <b>725</b> may generate the secondary-side reset signal so that CFB driver <b>730</b> may signal the primary-side controller U<b>1</b> accordingly to switch off the power switch transistor M<b>1</b>. The comparison in comparator <b>720</b> may also be adjusted according to a slope compensation <b>710</b> to suppress sub-harmonic oscillation and improve control loop stability. In primary-side controller U<b>1</b>, gate control logic <b>740</b> responds to the CFB receiver <b>735</b> to drive gate driver <b>711</b>.
