The exposure unit includes a light source such as a laser or a light emitting diode (LED). In this embodiment, the exposure unit <b>19</b> includes a laser and operates according to the control of the laser driver <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The fixing unit <b>30</b> fixes the visible image on the sheet by heating and pressurizing the visible image transferred onto the sheet. The paper ejection unit <b>40</b> ejects the sheet on which the visible image is fixed by the fixing unit <b>30</b> to the outside of the image forming device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">If the sheet is scanned and various image processes such as smoothing is applied to make an image file in PDF format, there are cases where a horizontal streak that is not included in the image before the image process is applied is slightly generated in the image in the file subjected to the image process. Smoothing functions and PDF specification versions are considered to be one of the causes of a horizontal streak.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A first embodiment for removing a horizontal streak will be described. Non-smoothing image data in which smoothing is not applied to image data obtained by scanning a sheet, and smoothing image data in which the smoothing is applied to the image data obtained by scanning the sheet are generated.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A comparison is made between the non-smoothing image data and the smoothing image data. The comparison is, for example, a density comparison. The density comparison is performed to figure out whether the density for each pixel differs by a value equal to or greater than a threshold value. Alternatively, it is compared whether or not the densities differ by a value equal to or greater than a threshold value in block units with a plurality of pixels as a block. Alternatively, it is compared whether or not an average density of the entire image data differs by a value equal to or greater than a threshold value. The comparison is, for example, a comparison by image recognition. It is compared whether there is an object such as a line and a drawing obtained by the image recognition, and whether positions, shapes, and postures differ by a value equal to or greater than a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">If no significant difference is found as a result of comparing the non-smoothing image data and the smoothing image data, the smoothing image data is adopted as the data to be converted into an image file. If a significant difference is found as a result of comparing the non-smoothing image data and the smoothing image data, the non-smoothing image data is adopted instead of the smoothing image data as the data to be converted into the image file. The non-smoothing image data of a pixel at a position where the significant difference is found and the smoothing image data of a pixel at a position where no significant difference is found may be selectively adopted in pixel units. The non-smoothing image data of a block at a position where the significant difference is found and the smoothing image data of a block at a position where no significant difference is found may be selectively adopted in pixel units.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The image file is created by applying a process to part or all of the adopted image data to reduce blurring of characters, adjust contrast, or the like. When only a part of the adopted image data is subjected to the process of reducing the blurring of characters, and adjusting contrast, or the like to create the image file, information indicating where the part locates may be included in the image file as text, images, or metadata. When only a part of the adopted image data is subjected to the process of reducing the blurring of characters, and adjusting contrast, or the like to create the image file, the information indicating where the part locates may be displayed on the display <b>203</b> of the operation panel <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A second embodiment for removing a horizontal streak will be described.

Allowing the user access to the file to be adopted is performed by, for example, displaying the PDF image file to be adopted or the non-PDF image file to be adopted as an option on the operation panel <b>200</b>. Allowing the user access to the file to be adopted is performed by, for example, attaching the file to be adopted to the Email transmitted in a so-called ScanToEmail operation.
