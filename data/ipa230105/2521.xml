Specifically, embodiments of this invention relate to controlling the height of a fluidized bed used during the production of polyolefins.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the gas phase process for the production of polyolefins, such as polyethylene, a gaseous alkene (e.g., ethylene), hydrogen, co-monomer (e.g., 1-hexene) and other raw materials are converted to a solid polyolefin product. Generally, gas phase reactors include a fluidized bed reactor, a compressor, and a cooler (heat exchanger). The reaction is maintained in a two-phase fluidized bed of granular polyethylene and gaseous reactants by a fluidizing gas which is passed through a distributor plate near the bottom of the reactor vessel. Catalyst is injected into the fluidized bed, while heat of reaction is transferred to the circulating gas stream. This gas stream is compressed and cooled in an external recycle line and then is reintroduced into the bottom of the reactor where it passes through the distributor plate. Make-up feedstreams are added to maintain the desired reactant concentrations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Operation of most reactor systems is critically dependent upon good mixing for uniform reactor conditions, heat removal, and effective catalyst performance. The process must be controllable and capable of a high production rate. In general, the higher the operating temperature, the greater the capability to achieve high production rate. Because polymerization reactions are typically exothermic, heat transfer out of the reactor is critical to avoid such problems as particle agglomeration and runaway reactions. However, as the operating temperature approaches and exceeds the melting point of the polyolefin product, the particles of polyolefin become tacky and melt. For example, non-uniform fluidization of the bed can create &#x201c;hot spots,&#x201d; which in turn can cause the newly-formed polymer particles to become tacky due to elevated temperatures in the hot spots.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An interplay of forces may result in particles agglomerating with adjacent particles, and may lead to sheeting and other forms of reactor fouling. In agglomeration, the particles stick together, forming agglomerated particles that affect fluid flow and may be difficult to remove from the system. In sheeting, tacky particles gather on a surface of the reactor system, such as the wall of the reactor vessel, forming a sheet of polymer particles. Progressive cycles in this process may eventually result in the growth of the sheet and its falling into the fluid bed. These sheets can interrupt fluidization, circulation of gas and withdrawal of the product from the reactor, and may require a reactor shutdown for removal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many factors influence the propensity for sheeting and other fouling phenomena, of which one is the type of catalyst. For example, metallocene catalysts allow the production of polyolefins with unique properties such as narrow molecular weight distributions and narrow chemical compositions. These properties in turn result in improved structural performance in products made with the polymers, such as greater impact strength and clarity in films. However, while metallocene catalysts have yielded polymers with improved characteristics, they have presented particular drawbacks when used in fluidized bed reactors, in particular in relation to sheeting and fouling in other portions of the reactor system, such as the distributor plate and the cooler. Thus, accurate control of many reaction parameters is vital in the fluid bed polymerization of olefins, especially using metallocene catalysts.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, fluidized bed level is one of the critical variables used for stable operation and control of a fluid bed olefin polymerization reactor. Bed level is directly related to the fluidization quality, reactor resin and catalyst inventory, and temperature distribution. It influences effective cooling, resin carry-over and compressor, cooler and plate fouling, and dome sheeting. Although operation at low or high bed levels is sometimes helpful in mitigating some reactor operability issues, very low or high levels need to be carefully avoided as they may result in severe reactor upsets and reactor shut down if not mitigated. For example, for metallocene runs in particular, deviation of more than 0.5 ft in fluid bed level is generally deemed unacceptable as there is evidence that this kind of offset can contribute to dome sheeting and plate fouling and other problems leading to premature shutdown and cleanup.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The currently used methods for calculating the bed level in fluidized-bed polyolefin reactors are based on using pressure drop measurements for different bed segments. Pressure drop in a fluidized bed increases as the fluidizing gas velocity increases in the fixed bed until the gas velocity is high enough to suspend the particles in a fluidized form. At this point, which is called minimum or incipient fluidization, the pressure drop across the bed is equal to the weight of the particle bed since the weight of the gas can be neglected. As the velocity increases beyond minimum fluidization, the pressure drop does not increase appreciably as the solid bed is already lifted and fluidized, and the extra drag by higher velocity is used to expand the fluidized bed and increase the bed level. Since the pressure drop is caused by particle suspension, the bulk density of the bed at each height is equal to the pressure drop gradient between two heights of the bed which can be directly measured. One or a weighted average of two or more bulk densities are then used to calculate the bed level. Relying on one or few specific pressure measurements with fixed weighted averaging makes these methods very sensitive in case of malfunction or drift of any of the used pressure monitoring devices. As the measurements are conducted at different heights, an expected value for the bulk density or pressure drop at each height is not available and it is usually confusing and difficult for the operators to detect the defective device. Moreover, the procedures that are typically used for the bed level cross-check are usually ineffective as they suffer from not having a baseline for comparison.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is therefore a need for an improved method of monitoring bed level in fluidized bed olefin polymerization reactors as well as detecting malfunctioning pressure sensors.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The method proposed in accordance with the present invention takes advantage of the linear or quasi-linear variation of the pressure drop across a fluidized bed. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the trend remains linear across the main part of the bed height and deviates from linearity only when approaching the bed surface. However, that deviation may have a crucial effect on the bed level calculation. By applying a linear or polynomial, for example 2<sup>nd </sup>degree polynomial, regression analysis on the pressure drop measurements, the model governing the variation of the pressure drop with height can be deduced. As the pressure drop approaches zero at the surface, where no particles are present to cause pressure drop, extrapolating the model to zero pressure drop will result in the bed level. This way all the measurements are used at once and no single defective measurement has a devastating effect on the level calculation. Furthermore, the profile of the pressure drop calculated in this way provides an expected value for the pressure drop between each two heights which can be used to detect any defective pressure transducers and/or transmitters (note that pressure transducer and pressure transmitter are used interchangeably herein to reference any device suitable for measuring pressure and converting such measurement to an electronic signal; and optionally further able to transmit and/or amplify such signal). The variation of the fluidized bulk density across the fluidized bed can also be calculated from the calculated pressure drop profile. A healthy bulk density profile across the bed height, slightly decreasing from bottom of the bed to the top, is a measure of reactor stability and good resin morphology. A very high or very low bulk density may cause operability problems such as poor catalyst distribution, and resin agglomeration.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, in one aspect, the present invention resides in a process of producing a polyolefin comprising:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(a1) contacting at least one olefin monomer under polymerization conditions with a fluidized bed of a polymerization catalyst on a particulate support, the bed having a bottom and a top;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">(a2) measuring the pressure at a plurality of different locations in the fluidized bed at increasing heights above the bottom, and below the top, of the bed;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">(a3) using the pressure measurements obtained in (a2) to calculate the pressure drop between adjacent locations in the bed;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">(a4) applying regression analysis to the calculations generated in (a3) to determine the variation in pressure drop with height above the bottom of the bed;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">(a5) extrapolating the variation in pressure drop with bed height to determine the total height of the bed; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(a6) using the total bed height determined in (a5) as a variable in controlling the polymerization conditions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a further aspect, the present invention resides in a process for producing a polyolefin comprising:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(b1) contacting at least one olefin monomer under polymerization conditions with a fluidized bed of a polymerization catalyst on a particulate support, the bed having a bottom and a top;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">(b2) measuring the pressure at a plurality of different locations in the fluidized bed at increasing heights above the bottom, and below the top, of the bed using pressure transducers;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">(b3) using the pressure measurements obtained in (b2) to calculate the pressure drop between adjacent locations in the bed;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">(b4) applying regression analysis to the calculations generated in (b3) to graph the variation in pressure drop with height above the bottom of the bed; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">(b5) using the deviation of an actual pressure drop calculation from the graph generated in (b4) to identify a malfunctioning pressure transducer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In yet a further aspect, the present invention resides in a process for producing a polyolefin comprising:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">(c1) contacting at least one olefin monomer under polymerization conditions with a fluidized bed of a polymerization catalyst on a particulate support, the bed having a bottom and a top;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">(c2) measuring the pressure at a plurality of different locations in the fluidized bed at increasing heights above the bottom, and below the top, of the bed using pressure transducers;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">(c3) using the pressure measurements obtained in (c2) to calculate the pressure drop between adjacent locations in the bed;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">(c4) applying regression analysis to the calculations generated in (c3) to graph the variation in pressure drop with height above the bottom of the bed; and</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">(c5) using the graph generated in (c4) to calculate the profile of fluidized bed bulk density (FBD) with height using the formula dp/dh=FBD*g, where dp is the pressure drop between two different locations in the fluidized bed, dh is the difference in height of the two different locations and g is gravitational acceleration.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the above-discussed process, the polymerization catalyst may include a metallocene.

The pressure is measured at a plurality of different locations in the fluidized bed at increasing heights above the bottom, and below the top, of the bed; and the measured pressures are used to calculate the pressure drop between adjacent locations in the bed. Regression analysis is applied to the calculated pressure drop between adjacent locations in the bed to determine the variation in pressure drop with height above the bottom of the bed and the variation in pressure drop with bed height is extrapolated to determine the total height of the bed. One can then control the polymerization conditions based at least in part upon the determined total bed height, e.g., such that the bed height is maintained within a desired range of values.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is to be appreciated that the pressure measurements and pressure drop calculations can be performed by a single device, without the individual pressure measurements being displayed and/or recorded.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another embodiment, a process is described for producing a polyolefin in which at least one olefin monomer is contacted under polymerization conditions with a fluidized bed of a polymerization catalyst on a particulate support, the bed having a bottom and a top. The pressure is measured at a plurality of different locations in the fluidized bed at increasing heights above the bottom, and below the top, of the bed using pressure transducers and the pressure measurements are used to calculate the pressure drop between adjacent locations in the bed. Regression analysis is then applied to the calculated pressure drops between adjacent locations in the bed to graph the variation in pressure drop with height above the bottom of the bed and the deviation of an actual pressure drop calculation from the graphed variation in pressure can be used to identify a malfunctioning pressure transducer.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another embodiment, a method is described of detecting a malfunction in a plurality of pressure transducers of a fluidized bed, such as that used to polymerize at least one olefin monomer. The method comprises measuring a plurality of pressures of the fluidized bed at a plurality of heights thereof via the plurality of pressure transducers. The measured pressures are then used to calculate a plurality of pressure drops between the plurality of locations and (a) linear regression analysis or (b) polynomial regression analysis is performed on the calculated pressure drops to graph the variation in pressure drop with bed height calculated. Using the pressure drop gradient from the linear or polynomial regression analysis it is possible to determine the variation of bulk density across the fluidized bed. As indicated above, the bulk density profile across the fluidized bed is a measure of reactor stability and resin morphology and can therefore also be used to monitor reactor operation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the above-discussed processes the polymerization catalyst may include a metallocene. In embodiments, the at least one olefin monomer includes ethylene. In embodiments, the regression analysis is linear. In embodiments, the regression analysis is polynomial. In embodiments, the regression analysis is second degree polynomial.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic representation of methods and systems illustrating typical operations in a fluidized bed polymerization reactor system. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a bulk material is present in a fluidized bed polymerization reactor vessel <b>100</b>. Such bulk material can be gaseous, liquid, and/or solid material. In a reactor system, illustrative bulk materials may include one or more of reaction raw materials such as feedstocks, reaction products such as polymer particles, reaction adjuncts such as catalysts, reaction byproducts, and the like, as well as other materials. A desired operating temperature for producing a polyolefin in the fluidized bed reactor system is selected. A metallocene catalyst may be selected based on one or more desired properties of the polyolefin achieved at the selected operating temperature. Monomers are contacted with the catalyst in the fluidized bed reactor vessel <b>100</b>. A recycle stream in a recycle line <b>122</b> of the fluidized bed reactor vessel <b>100</b> is cooled in order to maintain the desired operating temperature. Typically, fouling can be considered to be minimized if the reactor system can operate at least about 3 months without requiring opening of the reactor system for cleaning. In other cases, fouling is considered minimized if the reactor system can operate 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, or 2 years without requiring opening of the reactor system for cleaning.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A conventional fluidized bed polymerization process for producing resins and other types of polymers is typically conducted by passing a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers continuously through a fluidized bed reactor under reactive conditions and in the presence of catalyst at a velocity sufficient to maintain the bed of solid particles in a suspended condition. A continuous cycle is typically employed where the cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. The hot gaseous stream, also containing unreacted gaseous monomer, is continuously withdrawn from the reactor, compressed at compressor <b>130</b>, cooled at heat exchanger <b>124</b>, and recycled into the reactor vessel <b>100</b>. Monomer may be added to the system, e.g., into the recycle stream or reactor vessel, to replace polymerized monomer.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The reaction zone <b>112</b> typically includes a bed of growing polymer particles, formed polymer particles, and an amount of catalyst all fluidized by the continuous flow of polymerizable and modifying gaseous components, in the form of make-up feed and recycle fluid through the reaction zone <b>112</b>. To maintain a viable fluidized bed, it is advantageous that the superficial gas velocity through the bed exceeds the minimum flow required for fluidization. On start-up, the reactor is generally charged with a bed of polymer particles, seed bed, before gas flow is initiated. Such particles help to prevent the formation of localized &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; when catalyst feed is initiated. The particles may be the same as the polymer to be formed or different. When different, they are preferably withdrawn with the desired newly formed polymer particles as the first product. Eventually, a fluidized bed consisting of desired polymer particles supplants the start-up bed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The fluidized bed has the general appearance of dense mass of individually moving particles as created by the percolation of gas through the bed. The pressure drop through the bed is equal to or slightly greater than the weight of the bed divided by the cross-sectional area. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, make-up fluids can be fed via line <b>122</b> or other lines connecting to the reactor vessel <b>100</b>. The composition and amount of the make-up stream is adjusted accordingly to maintain an essentially steady state composition within the reaction zone <b>112</b>. To ensure complete fluidization, the recycle stream and, where desired, at least part of the make-up stream can be returned through recycle line <b>122</b> to the reactor, for example below the bed. There may be a gas distributor plate <b>128</b> downstream of the point of return to aid in uniformly fluidizing the bed and to support the solid particles prior to start-up or when the system is shut down. The stream passing upwardly through and out of the bed contributes to removing the heat of reaction generated by the exothermic polymerization reaction.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The portion of the gaseous stream flowing through the fluidized bed which did not react in the bed becomes the recycle stream which leaves the reaction zone <b>112</b> and passes into the velocity reduction zone <b>114</b> above the bed where a major portion of the entrained particles drop back onto the bed thereby reducing solid particle carryover. The recycle stream is then compressed in compressor <b>130</b> and passed through heat exchanger <b>124</b> where the heat of reaction is removed from the recycle stream before it is returned to the bed. The heat exchanger <b>124</b> may also be positioned before the compressor <b>130</b>. The recycle stream exiting the heat exchange zone is then returned to the reactor and thence to the fluidized bed through gas distributor plate <b>128</b>.

Typically, the pressure drop calculated across the vertical length, or height, of the bubbling fluidized bed decreases almost linearly from the bottom of the fluidized bed to the top of the fluidized bed. The pressure may deviate from linearity near the bed surface because of bubble expansion and eruption. The calculated pressure drop typically approaches zero at the surface of the fluidized bed. It is common for Gas Phase Polyethylene (GPPE) reactors to have at least three pressure drop calculations across the reactor, as schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. At least two (2) pressure measurements are needed to find a linear relationship between the calculated pressure drop and the height of the fluidized bed, but more measurements may result in an improved linear regression. In order to find a second-degree polynomial, at least three (3) pressure measurements are needed in order take into account the non-linearity of the pressure profile of the fluidized bed near the fluidized bed surface.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, pressure drops are calculated at three (3) different points: at 27 ft from the bottom (&#x201c;p<sub>3</sub>&#x201d;) of the bed, at 9 ft from the bottom (&#x201c;p<sub>2</sub>&#x201d;) and at 0.5 ft from the bottom (&#x201c;p<sub>1</sub>&#x201d;).

This incorrect reading may reveal itself as a deviation from linearity. Although small decreases of the bulk density with respect to height are typically expected, large decreases or increases of the bulk density may be a sign of a measurement failure. However, it is difficult to determine with certainty which measurements are wrong as typically there is no expected value of the pressure drop available. It is also advantageous in this case to rely on all of the measurements in order to decrease the contribution of any one failed measurement.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the calculated pressure drop in a fluidized bed with respect to the height of the fluidized bed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates three (3) scenarios that may happen when plotting the calculated pressure drop data versus the height of the fluidized bed, without taking into account the near surface region where the calculated pressure drops to near zero. The first scenario is when there is a constant density of the fluidized bed across the height of the fluidized bed, the graph is linear, as illustrated by the middle graph that includes black circles. The second scenario is when the bulk density of the fluidized bed decreases with height, thus resulting in a lower density of the upper fluidized bed, and as a result a concave curve will form, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> with the bottom straight line curve having a concave shape. The third scenario is when the bulk density of the fluidized bed increases with height, in which case the graph is a convex curve, as illustrated with the upper line including dashes and having a convex shape.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0059">Typically, while the concave curvature (bottom curve) can naturally occur because of axial size segregation and bubble growth, the convex curve typically occurs when a portion of the bed is defluidized, either because the contents of the bed adhere to the wall or aggregate on the distributor plate near the bottom of the reactor vessel such distributor plate <b>128</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and thus are no longer supported by the gas flow. In this case, the calculated pressure drop decreases, resulting in a lower bulk density and giving the impression that less material is present in the bed. As a result, the calculated pressure drop is greater compared to the case where the bed is not defluidized because of aggregation of adhesion to the wall.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">Typically, if the measurements are correct, using a polynomial model to predict the height of the fluidized bed yields a higher pressure measurement than using a linear model to predict the height of the fluidized bed. Because the polynomial model takes into account the curvature of the calculated pressure drop that is due to the bed density difference along the height of the bed, the bed level calculated using the polynomial model is typically lower than the bed level calculated using the linear models. However, in some cases, the linear model predicts a higher pressure value indicating that the bed density increases in the upper regions of the fluidized bed and resulting in a convex curve as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. This inconsistency is typically due to a pressure transducer malfunction. Accordingly, in order to avoid false predictions for the height of the fluidized bed, the polynomial model should be used as the primary model, and the linear model should only be used in case of pressure transducer malfunction. If the transducer readings are trusted, this will give a quick warning of a serious issue such as partial de-fluidization, as discussed before, in the bed.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of producing a polymer via fluidized bed, according to example embodiments.
