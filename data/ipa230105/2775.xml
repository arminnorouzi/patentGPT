Med., </i>364(11): 1046-1060 (2011), and Lonial et al., <i>Clinical Cancer Res., </i>17(6): 1264-1277 (2011)). Current therapies for MM often cause remissions, but nearly all patients eventually relapse and die (see, e.g., Lonial et al., supra, and Rajkumar, <i>Nature Rev. Clinical Oncol., </i>8(8): 479-491 (2011)). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been shown to induce immune-mediated elimination of myeloma cells; however, the toxicity of this approach is high, and few patients are cured (see, e.g., Lonial et al., supra, and Salit et al., <i>Clin. Lymphoma, Myeloma, and Leukemia, </i>11(3): 247-252 (2011)). Currently, there are no clinically effective, FDA-approved monoclonal antibody or autologous T-cell therapies for MM (see, e.g., Richardson et al., <i>British J. Haematology, </i>154(6): 745-754 (2011), and Yi, <i>Cancer Journal, </i>15(6): 502-510 (2009)).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Adoptive transfer of T-cells genetically modified to recognize malignancy-associated antigens is showing promise as a new approach to treating cancer (see, e.g., Morgan et al., <i>Science, </i>314(5796): 126-129 (2006); Brenner et al., <i>Current Opinion in Immunology, </i>22(2): 251-257 (2010); Rosenberg et al., <i>Nature Reviews Cancer, </i>8(4): 299-308 (2008), Kershaw et al., <i>Nature Reviews Immunology, </i>5(12): 928-940 (2005); and Pule et al., <i>Nature Medicine, </i>14(11): 1264-1270 (2008)). T-cells can be genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which are fusion proteins comprised of an antigen recognition moiety and T-cell activation domains (see, e.g., Kershaw et al., supra, Eshhar et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>90(2): 720-724 (1993), and Sadelain et al., <i>Curr. Opin. Immunol., </i>21(2): 215-223 (2009)).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For B-cell lineage malignancies, extensive progress has been made in developing adoptive T-cell approaches that utilize anti-CD19 CARs (see, e.g., Jensen et al., <i>Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, </i>16: 1245-1256 (2010); Kochenderfer et al., <i>Blood, </i>116(20): 4099-4102 (2010); Porter et al., <i>The New England Journal of Medicine, </i>365(8): 725-733 (2011); Savoldo et al., <i>Journal of Clinical Investigation, </i>121(5): 1822-1826 (2011), Cooper et al., <i>Blood, </i>101(4): 1637-1644 (2003); Brentjens et al., <i>Nature Medicine, </i>9(3): 279-286 (2003); and Kalos et al., <i>Science Translational Medicine, </i>3(95): 95ra73 (2011)). Adoptively transferred anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T-cells have cured leukemia and lymphoma in mice (see, e.g., Cheadle et al., <i>Journal of Immunology, </i>184(4): 1885-1896 (2010); Brentjens et al., <i>Clinical Cancer Research, </i>13(18 Pt 1): 5426-5435 (2007); and Kochenderfer et al., <i>Blood, </i>116(19): 3875-3886 (2010)). In early clinical trials, adoptively transferred T-cells transduced with anti-CD19 CARs eradicated normal and malignant B-cells in patients with leukemia and lymphoma (see, e.g., Kochenderfer et al., <i>Blood, </i>116(20): 4099-4102 (2010); Porter et al., supra, Brentjens et al., <i>Blood, </i>118(18): 4817-4828 (2011); and Kochenderfer et al., <i>Blood, Dec. </i>8, 2011 (epublication ahead of print (2012)). CD19, however, is only rarely expressed on the malignant plasma cells of multiple myeloma (see, e.g., Gupta et al., <i>Amer. J. Clin. Pathology, </i>132(5): 728-732 (2009); and Lin et al., <i>Amer. J. Clin. Pathology, </i>121(4): 482-488 (2004)).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there remains a need for compositions that can be used in methods to treat multiple myeloma.

A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is an artificially constructed hybrid protein or polypeptide containing an antigen binding domain of an antibody (e.g., a single chain variable fragment (scFv)) linked to T-cell signaling or T-cell activation domains. CARs have the ability to redirect T-cell specificity and reactivity toward a selected target in a non-MHC-restricted manner, exploiting the antigen-binding properties of monoclonal antibodies. The non-MHC-restricted antigen recognition gives T-cells expressing CARs the ability to recognize an antigen independent of antigen processing, thus bypassing a major mechanism of tumor escape. Moreover, when expressed in T-cells, CARs advantageously do not dimerize with endogenous T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">&#x201c;Nucleic acid sequence&#x201d; is intended to encompass a polymer of DNA or RNA, i.e., a polynucleotide, which can be single-stranded or double-stranded and which can contain non-natural or altered nucleotides. The terms &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; and &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; as used herein refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either ribonucleotides (RNA) or deoxyribonucleotides (DNA). These terms refer to the primary structure of the molecule, and thus include double- and single-stranded DNA, and double- and single-stranded RNA. The terms include, as equivalents, analogs of either RNA or DNA made from nucleotide analogs and modified polynucleotides such as, though not limited to methylated and/or capped polynucleotides.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">By &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; is meant the removal of a nucleic acid from its natural environment. By &#x201c;purified&#x201d; is meant that a given nucleic acid, whether one that has been removed from nature (including genomic DNA and mRNA) or synthesized (including cDNA) and/or amplified under laboratory conditions, has been increased in purity, wherein &#x201c;purity&#x201d; is a relative term, not &#x201c;absolute purity.&#x201d; It is to be understood, however, that nucleic acids and proteins may be formulated with diluents or adjuvants and still for practical purposes be isolated. For example, nucleic acids typically are mixed with an acceptable carrier or diluent when used for introduction into cells.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The inventive nucleic acid sequence encodes a CAR which comprises an antigen recognition moiety that is directed against B-cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA, also known as CD269). BCMA is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (see, e.g., Thompson et al., <i>J Exp. Medicine, </i>192(1): 129-135 (2000), and Mackay et al., <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol., </i>21: 231-264 (2003)). BCMA binds B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL) (see, e.g., Mackay et al., supra, and Kalled et al., <i>Immunological Reviews, </i>204: 43-54 (2005)). Among nonmalignant cells, BCMA has been reported to be expressed mostly in plasma cells and subsets of mature B-cells (see, e.g., Laabi et al., <i>EMBO J., </i>11(11): 3897-3904 (1992); Laabi et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res., </i>22(7): 1147-1154 (1994); Kalled et al., supra; O'Connor et al., <i>J. Exp. Medicine, </i>199(1): 91-97 (2004); and Ng et al., <i>J. Immunol., </i>173(2): 807-817 (2004)). Mice deficient in BCMA are healthy and have normal numbers of B-cells, but the survival of long-lived plasma cells is impaired (see, e.g., O'Connor et al, supra; Xu et al., <i>Mol. Cell. Biol., </i>21(12): 4067-4074 (2001); and Schiemann et al., <i>Science, </i>293(5537): 2111-2114 (2001)). BCMA RNA has been detected universally in multiple myeloma cells, and BCMA protein has been detected on the surface of plasma cells from multiple myeloma patients by several investigators (see, e.g., Novak et al., <i>Blood, </i>103(2): 689-694 (2004); Neri et al., <i>Clinical Cancer Research, </i>13(19): 5903-5909 (2007); Bellucci et al., <i>Blood, </i>105(10): 3945-3950 (2005); and Moreaux et al., <i>Blood, </i>103(8): 3148-3157 (2004)).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The inventive nucleic acid sequence encodes a CAR which comprises an antigen recognition moiety that contains a monoclonal antibody directed against BCMA, or an antigen-binding portion thereof. The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibodies,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to antibodies that are produced by a single clone of B-cells and bind to the same epitope. In contrast, &#x201c;polyclonal antibodies&#x201d; refer to a population of antibodies that are produced by different B-cells and bind to different epitopes of the same antigen. The antigen recognition moiety of the CAR encoded by the inventive nucleic acid sequence can be a whole antibody or an antibody fragment. A whole antibody typically consists of four polypeptides: two identical copies of a heavy (H) chain polypeptide and two identical copies of a light (L) chain polypeptide. Each of the heavy chains contains one N-terminal variable (VH) region and three C-terminal constant (CH1, CH2 and CH3) regions, and each light chain contains one N-terminal variable (VL) region and one C-terminal constant (CL) region. The variable regions of each pair of light and heavy chains form the antigen binding site of an antibody. The VH and VL regions have the same general structure, with each region comprising four framework regions, whose sequences are relatively conserved. The framework regions are connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The three CDRs, known as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, form the &#x201c;hypervariable region&#x201d; of an antibody, which is responsible for antigen binding.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The terms &#x201c;fragment of an antibody,&#x201d; &#x201c;antibody fragment,&#x201d; &#x201c;functional fragment of an antibody,&#x201d; and &#x201c;antigen-binding portion&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein to mean one or more fragments or portions of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (see, generally, Holliger et al., <i>Nat. Biotech., </i>23(9): 1126-1129 (2005)). The antigen recognition moiety of the CAR encoded by the inventive nucleic acid sequence can contain any BCMA-binding antibody fragment. The antibody fragment desirably comprises, for example, one or more CDRs, the variable region (or portions thereof), the constant region (or portions thereof), or combinations thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, (i) a Fab fragment, which is a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL, and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragment, which is a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; (iv) a single chain Fv (scFv), which is a monovalent molecule consisting of the two domains of the Fv fragment (i.e., VL and VH) joined by a synthetic linker which enables the two domains to be synthesized as a single polypeptide chain (see, e.g., Bird et al., <i>Science, </i>242: 423-426 (1988); Huston et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>85: 5879-5883 (1988); and Osbourn et al., <i>Nat. Biotechnol., </i>16: 778 (1998)) and (v) a diabody, which is a dimer of polypeptide chains, wherein each polypeptide chain comprises a VH connected to a VL by a peptide linker that is too short to allow pairing between the VH and VL on the same polypeptide chain, thereby driving the pairing between the complementary domains on different VH-VL polypeptide chains to generate a dimeric molecule having two functional antigen binding sites. Antibody fragments are known in the art and are described in more detail in, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009/0093024 A1. In a preferred embodiment, the antigen recognition moiety of the CAR encoded by the inventive nucleic acid sequence comprises an anti-BCMA single chain Fv (scFv).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An antigen-binding portion or fragment of a monoclonal antibody can be of any size so long as the portion binds to BCMA. In this respect, an antigen binding portion or fragment of the monoclonal antibody directed against BCMA (also referred to herein as an &#x201c;anti-BCMA monoclonal antibody&#x201d;) desirably comprises between about 5 and 18 amino acids (e.g., about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or a range defined by any two of the foregoing values).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, the inventive nucleic acid sequence encodes an antigen recognition moiety that comprises a variable region of an anti-BCMA monoclonal antibody. In this respect, the antigen recognition moiety comprises a light chain variable region, a heavy chain variable region, or both a light chain variable region and a heavy chain variable region of an anti-BCMA monoclonal antibody. Preferably, the antigen recognition moiety of the CAR encoded by the inventive nucleic acid sequence comprises a light chain variable region and a heavy chain variable region of an anti-BCMA monoclonal antibody. Heavy and light chain monoclonal antibody amino acid sequences that bind to BCMA are disclosed in, e.g., International Patent Application Publication WO 2010/104949.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, the inventive nucleic acid sequence encodes a CAR which comprises a signal sequence. The signal sequence may be positioned at the amino terminus of the antigen recognition moiety (e.g., the variable region of the anti-BCMA antibody). The signal sequence may comprise any suitable signal sequence. In one embodiment, the signal sequence is a human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor sequence or a CD8&#x3b1; signal sequence.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another embodiment, the CAR comprises a hinge sequence. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a hinge sequence is a short sequence of amino acids that facilitates antibody flexibility (see, e.g., Woof et al., <i>Nat. Rev. Immunol., </i>4(2): 89-99 (2004)). The hinge sequence may be positioned between the antigen recognition moiety (e.g., an anti-BCMA scFv) and the T-cell activation moiety. The hinge sequence can be any suitable sequence derived or obtained from any suitable molecule. In one embodiment, for example, the hinge sequence is derived from the human CD8&#x3b1; molecule or a CD28 molecule.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The inventive nucleic acid sequence encodes a CAR comprising a T-cell activation moiety. The T-cell activation moiety can be any suitable moiety derived or obtained from any suitable molecule. In one embodiment, for example, the T-cell activation moiety comprises a transmembrane domain. The transmembrane domain can be any transmembrane domain derived or obtained from any molecule known in the art. For example, the transmembrane domain can be obtained or derived from a CD8&#x3b1; molecule or a CD28 molecule. CD8 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a co-receptor for the T-cell receptor (TCR), and is expressed primarily on the surface of cytotoxic T-cells. The most common form of CD8 exists as a dimer composed of a CD8&#x3b1; and CD8&#x3b2; chain. CD28 is expressed on T-cells and provides co-stimulatory signals required for T-cell activation. CD28 is the receptor for CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2). In a preferred embodiment, the CD8&#x3b1; and CD28 are human.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to the transmembrane domain, the T-cell activation moiety further comprises an intracellular (i.e., cytoplasmic) T-cell signaling domain. The intercellular T-cell signaling domain can be obtained or derived from a CD28 molecule, a CD3 zeta (&#x3b6;) molecule or modified versions thereof, a human Fc receptor gamma (FcR&#x3b3;) chain, a CD27 molecule, an OX40 molecule, a 4-1BB molecule, or other intracellular signaling molecules known in the art. As discussed above, CD28 is a T-cell marker important in T-cell co-stimulation. CD3 associates with TCRs to produce a signal and contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). 4-1BB, also known as CD137, transmits a potent costimulatory signal to T-cells, promoting differentiation and enhancing long-term survival of T lymphocytes. In a preferred embodiment, the CD28, CD3 zeta, 4-1BB, OX40, and CD27 are human.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The T-cell activation domain of the CAR encoded by the inventive nucleic acid sequence can comprise any one of aforementioned transmembrane domains and any one or more of the aforementioned intercellular T-cell signaling domains in any combination. For example, the inventive nucleic acid sequence can encode a CAR comprising a CD28 transmembrane domain and intracellular T-cell signaling domains of CD28 and CD3 zeta. Alternatively, for example, the inventive nucleic acid sequence can encode a CAR comprising a CD8&#x3b1; transmembrane domain and intracellular T-cell signaling domains of CD28, CD3 zeta, the Fc receptor gamma (FcR&#x3b3;) chain, and/or 4-1BB.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the inventive nucleic acid sequence encodes a CAR which comprises, from 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;, a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSF receptor) signal sequence, an anti-BCMA scFv, the hinge and transmembrane regions of the human CD8&#x3b1; molecule, the cytoplasmic T-cell signaling domain of the human CD28 molecule, and T-cell signaling domain of the human CD3&#x3b6; molecule. In another embodiment, the inventive nucleic acid sequence encodes a CAR which comprises, from 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;, a human CD8&#x3b1; signal sequence, an anti-BCMA scFv, the hinge and transmembrane regions of the human CD8&#x3b1; molecule, the cytoplasmic T-cell signaling domain of the human CD28 molecule, and T-cell signaling domain of the human CD3&#x3b6; molecule. In another embodiment, the inventive nucleic acid sequence encodes a CAR which comprises, from 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;, a human CD8&#x3b1; signal sequence, an anti-BCMA scFv, the hinge and transmembrane regions of the human CD8&#x3b1; molecule, the cytoplasmic T-cell signaling domain of the human 4-1BB molecule and/or the cytoplasmic T-cell signaling domain of the human OX40 molecule, and T-cell signaling domain of the human CD3&#x3b6; molecule. For example, the inventive nucleic acid sequence comprises or consists of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, or SEQ ID NO: 3.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The invention further provides an isolated or purified chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) encoded by the inventive nucleic acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The nucleic acid sequence of the invention can encode a CAR of any length, i.e., the CAR can comprise any number of amino acids, provided that the CAR retains its biological activity, e.g., the ability to specifically bind to antigen, detect diseased cells in a mammal, or treat or prevent disease in a mammal, etc. For example, the CAR can comprise 50 or more (e.g., 60 or more, 100 or more, or 500 or more) amino acids, but less than 1,000 (e.g., 900 or less, 800 or less, 700 or less, or 600 or less) amino acids. Preferably, the CAR is about 50 to about 700 amino acids (e.g., about 70, about 80, about 90, about 150, about 200, about 300, about 400, about 550, or about 650 amino acids), about 100 to about 500 amino acids (e.g., about 125, about 175, about 225, about 250, about 275, about 325, about 350, about 375, about 425, about 450, or about 475 amino acids), or a range defined by any two of the foregoing values.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Included in the scope of the invention are nucleic acid sequences that encode functional portions of the CAR described herein. The term &#x201c;functional portion,&#x201d; when used in reference to a CAR, refers to any part or fragment of the CAR of the invention, which part or fragment retains the biological activity of the CAR of which it is a part (the parent CAR). Functional portions encompass, for example, those parts of a CAR that retain the ability to recognize target cells, or detect, treat, or prevent a disease, to a similar extent, the same extent, or to a higher extent, as the parent CAR. In reference to a nucleic acid sequence encoding the parent CAR, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a functional portion of the CAR can encode a protein comprising, for example, about 10%, 25%, 30%, 50%, 68%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or more, of the parent CAR.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The inventive nucleic acid sequence can encode a functional portion of a CAR that contains additional amino acids at the amino or carboxy terminus of the portion, or at both termini, which additional amino acids are not found in the amino acid sequence of the parent CAR. Desirably, the additional amino acids do not interfere with the biological function of the functional portion, e.g., recognize target cells, detect cancer, treat or prevent cancer, etc. More desirably, the additional amino acids enhance the biological activity of the CAR, as compared to the biological activity of the parent CAR.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The invention also provides nucleic acid sequences encoding functional variants of the aforementioned CAR. The term &#x201c;functional variant,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a CAR, a polypeptide, or a protein having substantial or significant sequence identity or similarity to the CAR encoded by the inventive nucleic acid sequence, which functional variant retains the biological activity of the CAR of which it is a variant. Functional variants encompass, for example, those variants of the CAR described herein (the parent CAR) that retain the ability to recognize target cells to a similar extent, the same extent, or to a higher extent, as the parent CAR. In reference to a nucleic acid sequence encoding the parent CAR, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a functional variant of the CAR can be for example, about 10% identical, about 25% identical, about 30% identical, about 50% identical, about 65% identical, about 80% identical, about 90% identical, about 95% identical, or about 99% identical to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the parent CAR.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A functional variant can, for example, comprise the amino acid sequence of the CAR encoded by the inventive nucleic acid sequence with at least one conservative amino acid substitution. The phrase &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; or &#x201c;conservative mutation&#x201d; refers to the replacement of one amino acid by another amino acid with a common property. A functional way to define common properties between individual amino acids is to analyze the normalized frequencies of amino acid changes between corresponding proteins of homologous organisms (Schulz, G. E. and Schirmer, R. H., <i>Principles of Protein Structure</i>, Springer-Verlag, New York (1979)). According to such analyses, groups of amino acids may be defined where amino acids within a group exchange preferentially with each other, and therefore resemble each other most in their impact on the overall protein structure (Schulz, G. E. and Schirmer, R. H., supra). Examples of conservative mutations include amino acid substitutions of amino acids within the sub-groups above, for example, lysine for arginine and vice versa such that a positive charge may be maintained; glutamic acid for aspartic acid and vice versa such that a negative charge may be maintained; serine for threonine such that a free &#x2014;OH can be maintained; and glutamine for asparagine such that a free &#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>can be maintained.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Alternatively or additionally, the functional variants can comprise the amino acid sequence of the parent CAR with at least one non-conservative amino acid substitution. &#x201c;Non-conservative mutations&#x201d; involve amino acid substitutions between different groups, for example, lysine for tryptophan, or phenylalanine for serine, etc. In this case, it is preferable for the non-conservative amino acid substitution to not interfere with, or inhibit the biological activity of, the functional variant. The non-conservative amino acid substitution may enhance the biological activity of the functional variant, such that the biological activity of the functional variant is increased as compared to the parent CAR.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The inventive nucleic acid sequence can encode a CAR (including functional portions and functional variants thereof) that comprises synthetic amino acids in place of one or more naturally-occurring amino acids. Such synthetic amino acids are known in the art, and include, for example, aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid, norleucine, &#x3b1;-amino n-decanoic acid, homoserine, S-acetylaminomethyl-cysteine, trans-3- and trans-4-hydroxyproline, 4-aminophenylalanine, 4- nitrophenylalanine, 4-chlorophenylalanine, 4-carboxyphenylalanine, &#x3b2;-phenylserine &#x3b2;-hydroxyphenylalanine, phenylglycine, &#x3b1;-naphthylalanine, cyclohexylalanine, cyclohexylglycine, indoline-2-carboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, aminomalonic acid, aminomalonic acid monoamide, N&#x2032;-benzyl-N&#x2032;-methyl-lysine, N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-dibenzyl-lysine, 6-hydroxylysine, ornithine, &#x3b1;-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid, &#x3b1;-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid, &#x3b1;-aminocycloheptane carboxylic acid, &#x3b1;-(2-amino-2-norbornane)-carboxylic acid, &#x3b1;,&#x3b3;-diaminobutyric acid, &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-diaminopropionic acid, homophenylalanine, and &#x3b1;-tert-butylglycine.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The inventive nucleic acid sequence can encode a CAR (including functional portions and functional variants thereof) which is glycosylated, amidated, carboxylated, phosphorylated, esterified, N-acylated, cyclized via, e.g., a disulfide bridge, or converted into an acid addition salt and/or optionally dimerized or polymerized, or conjugated.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a preferred embodiment, the inventive nucleic acid sequence encodes a CAR that comprises or consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, or SEQ ID NO: 12.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The inventive nucleic acid sequence can be generated using methods known in the art. For example, nucleic acid sequences, polypeptides, and proteins can be recombinantly produced using standard recombinant DNA methodology (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, </i>3<sup>rd </sup>ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. 2001; and Ausubel et al., <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, </i>Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley &#x26; Sons, NY, 1994). Further, a synthetically produced nucleic acid sequence encoding the CAR can be isolated and/or purified from a source, such as a plant, a bacterium, an insect, or a mammal, e.g., a rat, a human, etc. Methods of isolation and purification are well-known in the art. Alternatively, the nucleic acid sequences described herein can be commercially synthesized. In this respect, the inventive nucleic acid sequence can be synthetic, recombinant, isolated, and/or purified.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The invention also provides a vector comprising the nucleic acid sequence encoding the inventive CAR.

Representative sources of promoters include for example, virus, mammal, insect, plant, yeast, and bacteria, and suitable promoters from these sources are readily available, or can be made synthetically, based on sequences publicly available, for example, from depositories such as the ATCC as well as other commercial or individual sources. Promoters can be unidirectional (i.e., initiate transcription in one direction) or bi-directional (i.e., initiate transcription in either a 3&#x2032; or 5&#x2032; direction). Non-limiting examples of promoters include, for example, the T7 bacterial expression system, pBAD (araA) bacterial expression system, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, the SV40 promoter, and the RSV promoter. Inducible promoters include, for example, the Tet system (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,464,758 and 5,814,618), the Ecdysone inducible system (No et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad.

Enhancers can be located many kilobases away from the coding region of the nucleic acid sequence and can mediate the binding of regulatory factors, patterns of DNA methylation, or changes in DNA structure. A large number of enhancers from a variety of different sources are well known in the art and are available as or within cloned polynucleotides (from, e.g., depositories such as the ATCC as well as other commercial or individual sources).

Preferred host cells are those that can be easily and reliably grown, have reasonably fast growth rates, have well characterized expression systems, and can be transformed or transfected easily and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As used herein, the term &#x201c;host cell&#x201d; refers to any type of cell that can contain the expression vector. The host cell can be a eukaryotic cell, e.g., plant, animal, fungi, or algae, or can be a prokaryotic cell, e.g., bacteria or protozoa. The host cell can be a cultured cell or a primary cell, i.e., isolated directly from an organism, e.g., a human. The host cell can be an adherent cell or a suspended cell, i.e., a cell that grows in suspension. Suitable host cells are known in the art and include, for instance, DH5<i>&#x3b1; E. coli </i>cells, Chinese hamster ovarian cells, monkey VERO cells, COS cells, HEK293 cells, and the like.

For purposes of producing a recombinant CAR, the host cell can be a mammalian cell. The host cell preferably is a human cell. The host cell can be of any cell type, can originate from any type of tissue, and can be of any developmental stage. In one embodiment, the host cell can be a peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL), a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), or a natural killer (NK).

Methods for selecting suitable mammalian host cells and methods for transformation, culture, amplification, screening, and purification of cells are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The invention provides an isolated host cell which expresses the inventive nucleic acid sequence encoding the CAR described herein. In one embodiment, the host cell is a T-cell. The T-cell of the invention can be any T-cell, such as a cultured T-cell, e.g., a primary T-cell, or a T-cell from a cultured T-cell line, or a T-cell obtained from a mammal. If obtained from a mammal, the T-cell can be obtained from numerous sources, including but not limited to blood, bone marrow, lymph node, the thymus, or other tissues or fluids. T-cells can also be enriched for or purified. The T-cell preferably is a human T-cell (e.g., isolated from a human).

NK cells are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte that plays a role in the innate immune system. NK cells are defined as large granular lymphocytes and constitute the third kind of cells differentiated from the common lymphoid progenitor which also gives rise to B and T lymphocytes (see, e.g., <i>Immunobiology, </i>5<sup>th </sup>ed., Janeway et al., eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (2001)). NK cells differentiate and mature in the bone marrow, lymph node, spleen, tonsils, and thymus. Following maturation, NK cells enter into the circulation as large lymphocytes with distinctive cytotoxic granules. NK cells are able to recognize and kill some abnormal cells, such as, for example, some tumor cells and virus-infected cells, and are thought to be important in the innate immune defense against intracellular pathogens. As described above with respect to T-cells, the NK cell can be any NK cell, such as a cultured NK cell, e.g., a primary NK cell, or an NK cell from a cultured NK cell line, or an NK cell obtained from a mammal. If obtained from a mammal, the NK cell can be obtained from numerous sources, including but not limited to blood, bone marrow, lymph node, the thymus, or other tissues or fluids. NK cells can also be enriched for or purified. The NK cell preferably is a human NK cell (e.g., isolated from a human). NK cell lines are available from, e.g., the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) and include, for example, NK-92 cells (ATCC CRL-2407), NK92MI cells (ATCC CRL-2408), and derivatives thereof.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The inventive nucleic acid sequence encoding a CAR may be introduced into a cell by &#x201c;transfection,&#x201d; &#x201c;transformation,&#x201d; or &#x201c;transduction.&#x201d; &#x201c;Transfection,&#x201d; &#x201c;transformation,&#x201d; or &#x201c;transduction,&#x201d; as used herein, refer to the introduction of one or more exogenous polynucleotides into a host cell by using physical or chemical methods.

Phage or viral vectors can be introduced into host cells, after growth of infectious particles in suitable packaging cells, many of which are commercially available.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Without being bound to a particular theory or mechanism, it is believed that by eliciting an antigen-specific response against BCMA, the CARs encoded by the inventive nucleic acid sequence provide for one or more of the following: targeting and destroying BCMA-expressing cancer cells, reducing or eliminating cancer cells, facilitating infiltration of immune cells to tumor site(s), and enhancing/extending anti-cancer responses. Thus, the invention provides a method of destroying multiple myeloma cells, which comprises contacting one or more of the aforementioned isolated T-cells or natural killer cells with a population of multiple myeloma cells that express BCMA, whereby the CAR is produced and binds to BCMA on the multiple myeloma cells and the multiple myeloma cells are destroyed. As discussed herein, multiple myeloma, also known as plasma cell myeloma or Kahler's disease, is a cancer of plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell normally responsible for the production of antibodies (Raab et al., <i>Lancet, </i>374: 324-329 (2009)). Multiple myeloma affects 1-4 per 100,000 people per year. The disease is more common in men, and for yet unknown reasons is twice as common in African Americans as it is in Caucasian Americans. Multiple myeloma is the least common hematological malignancy (14%) and constitutes 1% of all cancers (Raab et al., supra). Treatment of multiple myeloma typically involves high-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allogenic or autologous); however, a high rate of relapse is common in multiple myeloma patients that have undergone such treatment. As discussed above, BCMA is highly expressed by multiple myeloma cells (see, e.g., Novak et al., supra; Neri et al., supra; Bellucci et al., supra; and Moreaux et al., supra).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">One or more isolated T-cells expressing the inventive nucleic acid sequence encoding the anti-BCMA CAR described herein can be contacted with a population of multiple myeloma cells that express BCMA ex vivo, in vivo, or in vitro. &#x201c;Ex vivo&#x201d; refers to methods conducted within or on cells or tissue in an artificial environment outside an organism with minimum alteration of natural conditions. In contrast, the term &#x201c;in vivo&#x201d; refers to a method that is conducted within living organisms in their normal, intact state, while an &#x201c;in vitro&#x201d; method is conducted using components of an organism that have been isolated from its usual biological context. The inventive method preferably involves ex vivo and in vivo components. In this regard, for example, the isolated T-cells described above can be cultured ex vivo under conditions to express the inventive nucleic acid sequence encoding the anti-BCMA CAR, and then directly transferred into a mammal (preferably a human) affected by multiple myeloma. Such a cell transfer method is referred to in the art as &#x201c;adoptive cell transfer (ACT),&#x201d; in which immune-derived cells are passively transferred into a new recipient host to transfer the functionality of the donor immune-derived cells to the new host. Adoptive cell transfer methods to treat various types of cancers, including hematological cancers such as myeloma, are known in the art and disclosed in, for example, Gattinoni et al., <i>Nat. Rev. Immunol., </i>6(5): 383-393 (2006); June, C H, <i>J. Clin. Invest., </i>117(6): 1466-76 (2007); Rapoport et al., <i>Blood, </i>117(3): 788-797 (2011); and Barber et al., <i>Gene Therapy, </i>18: 509-516 (2011)).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The invention also provides a method of destroying Hodgkin's lymphoma cells. Hodgkin's lymphoma (formerly known as Hodgkin's disease) is a cancer of the immune system that is marked by the presence of a multinucleated cell type called Reed-Sternberg cells. The two major types of Hodgkin's lymphoma include classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma currently is treated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with the choice of treatment depending on the age and sex of the patient and the stage, bulk, and histological subtype of the disease. BCMA expression has been detected on the surface of Hodgkin's lymphoma cells (see, e.g., Chiu et al., <i>Blood, </i>109(2): 729-739 (2007)).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">When T-cells or NK cells are administered to a mammal, the cells can be allogeneic or autologous to the mammal. In &#x201c;autologous&#x201d; administration methods, cells (e.g., blood-forming stem cells or lymphocytes) are removed from a mammal, stored (and optionally modified), and returned back to the same mammal. In &#x201c;allogeneic&#x201d; administration methods, a mammal receives cells (e.g., blood-forming stem cells or lymphocytes) from a genetically similar, but not identical, donor. Preferably, the cells are autologous to the mammal.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The T-cells or NK cells desirably are administered to a human in the form of a composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively, the inventive nucleic acid sequence encoding the CAR, or a vector comprising the CAR-encoding nucleic acid sequence, can be formulated into a composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition, and administered to a human. The inventive pharmaceutical composition can comprise a population of T-cells of NK cells that express the inventive CAR. In addition to the inventive nucleic acid sequence, or host cells which express the inventive CAR, the pharmaceutical composition can comprise other pharmaceutically active agents or drugs, such as chemotherapeutic agents, e.g., asparaginase, busulfan, carboplatin, cisplatin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, gemcitabine, hydroxyurea, methotrexate, paclitaxel, rituximab, vinblastine, vincristine, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an isolated T-cell or NK cell which expresses the inventive CAR, more preferably a population of T-cells or NK cells which express the inventive CAR.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The inventive T-cells or NK cells can be provided in the form of a salt, e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from mineral acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric, and sulphuric acids, and organic acids, such as tartaric, acetic, citric, malic, lactic, fumaric, benzoic, glycolic, gluconic, succinic, and arylsulphonic acids, for example, p-toluenesulphonic acid.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The choice of carrier will be determined in part by the particular inventive nucleic acid sequence, vector, or host cells expressing the CAR, as well as by the particular method used to administer the inventive nucleic acid sequence, vector, or host cells expressing the CAR. Accordingly, there are a variety of suitable formulations of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention. For example, the pharmaceutical composition can contain preservatives. Suitable preservatives may include, for example, methylparaben, propylparaben, sodium benzoate, and benzalkonium chloride. A mixture of two or more preservatives optionally may be used. The preservative or mixtures thereof are typically present in an amount of about 0.0001% to about 2% by weight of the total composition.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, buffering agents may be used in the composition. Suitable buffering agents include, for example, citric acid, sodium citrate, phosphoric acid, potassium phosphate, and various other acids and salts.

Liposomes can serve to target the host cells (e.g., T-cells or NK cells) or the inventive nucleic acid sequence to a particular tissue. Liposomes also can be used to increase the half-life of the inventive nucleic acid sequence. Many methods are available for preparing liposomes, such as those described in, for example, Szoka et al., <i>Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng., </i>9: 467 (1980), and U.S. Pat.

Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the composition, thereby increasing convenience to the subject and the physician, and may be particularly suitable for certain composition embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The composition desirably comprises the host cells expressing the inventive nucleic acid sequence encoding a CAR, or a vector comprising the inventive nucleic acid sequence, in an amount that is effective to treat or prevent multiple myeloma or Hodgkin's lymphoma. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;treatment,&#x201d; &#x201c;treating,&#x201d; and the like refer to obtaining a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect.

To this end, the inventive method comprises administering a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; of the composition comprising the host cells expressing the inventive nucleic acid sequence encoding a CAR, or a vector comprising the inventive nucleic acid sequence. A &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve a desired therapeutic result. The therapeutically effective amount may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the CAR to elicit a desired response in the individual. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of CAR of the invention is an amount which binds to BCMA on multiple myeloma cells and destroys them.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Alternatively, the pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect may be prophylactic, i.e., the effect completely or partially prevents a disease or symptom thereof.

For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is repeated until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful and are within the scope of the invention. The desired dosage can be delivered by a single bolus administration of the composition, by multiple bolus administrations of the composition, or by continuous infusion administration of the composition.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The composition comprising the host cells expressing the inventive CAR-encoding nucleic acid sequence, or a vector comprising the inventive CAR-encoding nucleic acid sequence, can be administered to a mammal using standard administration techniques, including oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, pulmonary, transdermal, intramuscular, intranasal, buccal, sublingual, or suppository administration. The composition preferably is suitable for parenteral administration. The term &#x201c;parenteral,&#x201d; as used herein, includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, vaginal, and intraperitoneal administration.

Binding of the CAR to BCMA on the surface of multiple myeloma cells can be assayed using any suitable method known in the art, including, for example, ELISA and flow cytometry. The ability of the CAR to destroy multiple myeloma cells can be measured using any suitable method known in the art, such as cytotoxicity assays described in, for example, Kochenderfer et al., <i>J.

For instance, the CAR can be conjugated either directly or indirectly through a linker to a targeting moiety. The practice of conjugating compounds, e.g., the CAR, to targeting moieties is known in the art. See, for instance, Wadwa et al., <i>J. Drug Targeting </i>3: 111 (1995), and U.S. Pat.

RNA was extracted from the plasmacytoma cells with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, Calif.), and cDNA was synthesized using standard methods. A standard curve for the BCMA qPCR was created by diluting a plasmid that encoded the full-length BCMA cDNA (Origine Technologies, Rockville, Md.) in carrier DNA. The qPCR accurately detected copy numbers from 10<sup>2 </sup>to 10<sup>9 </sup>copies of BCMA per reaction. The number of &#x3b2;-actin cDNA copies in the same tissues was quantitated with a Taqman &#x3b2;-actin primer and probe kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.). A &#x3b2;-actin standard curve was created by amplifying serial dilutions of a &#x3b2;-actin plasmid.

BCMA cDNA was detected in several hematologic tissues, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, and tonsil. Low levels of BCMA cDNA were detected in most gastrointestinal organs, such as duodenum, rectum, and stomach. BCMA expression in gastrointestinal organs may be the result of plasma cells and B-cells present in gut-associated lymphoid tissues such as the lamina propria and Peyer's Patches (see, e.g., Brandtzaeg, <i>Immunological Investigations, </i>39(4-5): 303-355 (2010)). Low levels of BCMA cDNA also were detected in the testis and the trachea. The low levels of BCMA cDNA detected in the trachea may be due to the presence of plasma cells in the lamina propria of the trachea (see, e.g., Soutar, <i>Thorax, </i>31(2):158-166 (1976)).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The expression of BCMA on the surface of various cell types was further characterized using flow cytometry (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>L</figref>), including multiple myeloma cell lines H929, U266, and RPMI8226.

In contrast, T-cells from Myeloma Patient 1 expressing the SP6 CAR exhibited low levels of cytotoxicity against autologous plasmacytoma cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0127">The results of this example demonstrate that the inventive anti-BCMA CAR can be used in a method of destroying primary multiple myeloma cells.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 6</heading><p id="p-0134" num="0128">This example demonstrates that T-cells expressing the inventive anti-BCMA CARs can destroy established tumors in mice.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0129">Immunodeficient NSG mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, Jackson Laboratory) were injected intradermally with 8&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>RPMI8226 cells. Tumors were allowed to grow for 17 to 19 days, and then the mice received intravenous infusions of 8&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>human T-cells that were transduced with either the anti-bcma2 CAR or the SP6 CAR. Tumors were measured with calipers every 3 days. The longest length and the length perpendicular to the longest length were multiplied to obtain the tumor size (area) in mm<sup>2</sup>. When the longest length reached 15 mm, mice were sacrificed.
