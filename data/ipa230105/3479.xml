No. 16/899,265 by Turnblom, entitled &#x201c;WIPE-CUTTING TOOL&#x201d; filed Jun. 11, 2020, assigned to the assignee hereof, and is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to a cutting tool integrated into a firearm. More particularly, the disclosure relates to a cutting tool configured to cut wipes from a substrate for field-replacement.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wipe elements or &#x201c;wipes,&#x201d; are replaceable baffles used in sound suppressors. Early wipes were manufactured disks made of a penetrable membranes made of soft material, such as rubber or felt. During their manufacturing a series of disks separated by annular spacers were placed transversely to the shooting axis. The suppressor was mounted on a muzzle and when fired, the projectile passed through the wipes, creating a hole of the same caliber as the projectile. The wipe formed a seal around each projectile as it passed through the wipe so as to inhibit the escape of propellant gases from the suppressor. As a result, the wipe dissipates acoustic energy to reduce the sound level of the report.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Later, as suppressor technology improved to non-replaceable baffles, wipes were placed generally closer to the exit point of the suppressor where gases are at a lower temperature and pressure. However, wipe installment and replacement remained with the factory. Other wipe manufactures encourage a user to replace a wipe on a 1-to-1 basis as a wipe is degraded.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Each wipe has a limited life and must be replaced after it becomes ineffective due to wear, and can last as few as 10-20 rounds, depending on the material used for the wipe as well as the shape and speed of the bullet. As a result, wipes need to be regularly replaced. It would be advantageous to permit a shooter to easily cut wipes of the proper size from a substrate of wipe material.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The general purpose of the systems and methods disclosed herein is to provide an improved wipe-cutting tool. Specifically, the invention describes a wipe-cutting tool integrated into the body, accessory, or accessory components of a firearm that permits the shooter to replace used wipes in the field. The overall apparatus contains a cutting blade configured to cut a wipe from a wipe substrate. This apparatus is designed to work in conjunction with a variety of existing firearms and firearm accessories, but it could also be included in conjunction with a cutting tool that is separate from a firearm.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one non-limiting embodiment, the apparatus comprises a cutting tool configured to cut a wipe from a substrate. In some embodiments the cutting tool comprises a plate. In some embodiments the cutting tool comprises a skirt extending from the plate. In some embodiments the skirt is welded to the plate, while in some embodiments the skirt is milled. In some embodiments the distal edge of the skirt comprises a cutting blade.

The cutting tool comprises a cutting blade <b>52</b>. In some embodiments the cutting blade <b>52</b> is configured to cut a wipe. In some embodiments the cutting blade <b>52</b> cuts the wipe from a substrate. In some embodiments the sheet of wipe material comprises a sheet of the wipe material which may be rolled or stored in other ways. In some embodiments the sheet is laid flat and the cutting tool is positioned against and then pressed through the substrate to cut a piece of the substrate in the shape of the cutting tool. In some embodiments the substrate is polyurethane, rubber, in other embodiments the wipe substrate is a corrugated fiber. In other embodiments the wipe substrate material is a composite of natural fibers and synthetic fibers engineered to allow penetration in the center but slow the degradation of the wipe to allow its use for a longer time. In some embodiments the wipe is a round shape. In some embodiments the wipe is a polygon. In some embodiments the cutting tool is in the shape of the baffles with which the cutting tool is going to cut.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments the cutting tool comprises a plate which runs transversely the firing axis. In some embodiments the plate is annular. In some embodiments the plate is a polygon. In some embodiments the plate is milled into the body of a firearm. In some embodiments the plate is a portion of a firearm accessory, such as a magazine. In some embodiments the plate is a muzzle accessory. In some embodiments the plate is a component of a muzzle accessory. In some embodiments a skirt is a component of a muzzle accessory. In some embodiments a baffle is a component of a muzzle accessory. In some embodiments a cover is a component of a muzzle accessory. A cutting blade may be incorporated into a muzzle accessory or a component of a muzzle accessory, or into the barrel, stock, grip or other parts of the firearm.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments a skirt extends from the plate. In some embodiments the skirt is orthogonal the plate. In some embodiments the skirt extends from the plate at an angle, widening as it extends from the plate. In some embodiments the skirt narrows as it extends from the plate. In some embodiments the skirt is retractable. In some embodiments the skirt forms the leading edge of the cutting tool. In some embodiments the distal edge of the skirt comprises a cutting blade.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments the cutting tool comprises a wipe-receiving member. In some embodiments the wipe-receiving member comprises a shoulder that is proportionally smaller than the wipe-receiving member whereby the wipe may be pressed over the shoulder to settle and be retained in the wipe-receiving member. In some embodiments the wipe-receiving member is angled so as to narrow moving from the distal cutting blade toward the plate. In some embodiments the wipe-receiving member is substantially straight from the distal end of the skirt until the plate.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments the cutting blade is configured to be manually pressed against the substrate so as to cut a portion of the substrate into the shape of a wipe. In some embodiments the skirt is shaped in a polygon. In some embodiments the skirt is shaped to cut the wipe in the shape of a suppressor baffle. In some embodiments the skirt is shaped to cut the wipe into the shape of the muzzle accessory. In some embodiments the wipe cut as an annular circular. In some embodiments the wipe is cut in the shape of an oval. In some embodiments the cutting tool is configured to cut the substrate in the field, thus allowing the shooter to replace consumed wipes without removing all muzzle accessories.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments the distal edge, or the edge away from the plate, of the skirt comprises a cutting blade configured to cut a wipe from a substrate. In some embodiments the wipe is cut to a pre-determined size, such as the size of a receiving member positioned transversely to the firing axis.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Selection of wipe material is based on tradeoffs&#x2014;thick wipes may provide improved durability, but reduce accuracy, while other materials interfere less with the bullet, but do not maintain a tight seal with passing bullets. Selecting the optimal wipe material also depends on bullet shapes and speeds. In some embodiments the wipes of differing materials can be selectively exchanged to achieve the desired affects based on the selected material. In some embodiments the wipe can be selectively exchanged based on the ammunition, such as overpressure loads, or bullet characteristics (Lead Round Nose, Wad Cutter, Semi Wad Cutter, Semi-Jacketed, Full Metal Jacket, Semi-Jacketed Hollow Point, Jacketed Hollow Point, Special, as well as others).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The wipe is secured in position in a receiving member formed in a muzzle device or a muzzle accessory. A muzzle accessory may comprise a suppressor, a flash suppressor, a compensator, a muzzle brake, flash hider, wiped suppressor, wiped flash suppressor, wiped compensator, wiped muzzle brake or wiped flash hider. A muzzle accessory component may comprise any member of a muzzle accessory including a baffle, a plate, a skirt a vent or a combination of components making up an accessory. In some embodiments the cutting tool is incorporated into the end of a barrel. In some embodiments, the wipe is used in connection with a flash suppressor by improving the mixture of gasses escaping from the muzzle. In some embodiments the wipe improves the performance of the accessory, such as a compensator. In some embodiments the compensator redirects the burnt powder gasses created upwards when the bullet is fired to counter muzzle rise or muzzle flip. In some embodiments the muzzle accessory comprises a muzzle brake. Muzzle brakes direct the air to slow the burn of powder escaping from the muzzle. A wipe used in conjunction with a brake forces more of the gases through the vents, improving the mixture of the gases. In some embodiments the wipe, used in conjunction with a muzzle device or muzzle accessory improves the disbursement of the muzzle flash, changing the firearm's flash signature and increasing or concealing the shooter's possible position. In some embodiments the wipe in these (non-suppressor) applications restricts the amount of gas pressure able to exit forward (in line with the bore which is essentially wasted flow in terms of activating a braking/compensating effect) thus forcing an increased amount of gas to exit out of the ports in the sides or above instead which create the braking/compensating effect. Therefore increasing the effectiveness of the muzzle accessory, brake or compensator.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments the wipe is configured to be manually placed in a receiving member. Wipe replacement is configured to be simple, without requiring additional tools or involve sending the muzzle accessory to the manufacturer or a factory. In some embodiments a single person can replace the wipe. In some embodiments the wipe can be replaced in the field. In some embodiments a user, such as a shooter, may take a weapon with a spent or consumed wipe disposed in a muzzle accessory, disassemble the muzzle accessory to expose the cutting tool and cut a new wipe from a substrate, such as a sheet of rubber approximately 2-5 mm thick. The substrate is placed next to the cutting blade and the cutting blade is pressed through the substrate the distance of the skirt. The cutting tool is a template for cutting wipes the correct dimension and the substrate is a predetermined thickness configured to fit within the receiving member. In some embodiments the receiving member is proximal the plate so that the wipe is pressed into the receiving member and the wipe is secured when the muzzle accessory is reassembled and attached to the muzzle.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments the plate of the cutting tool is integrated into the body of the firearm. In some embodiments the plate is configured to be removed from the end of a muzzle accessory. In some embodiments the plate is configured to extend from the distal end of a muzzle accessory. In some embodiments the cutting blade comprises the distal end of the cutting tool. In some embodiments the cutting tool comprises a sound suppressor having a plurality of baffles wherein the shape of the skirt matches the shape of at least one of the baffles. In some embodiments the shape of the baffle is round. In some embodiments the shape of the baffle is a polygon. In some embodiments the end of the accessory is secured with a nut, which is selectively removed. In some embodiments the end of the accessory comprises a plate which may comprise a skirt with a cutting blade. In some embodiments the baffle shape progresses along the bore from a first shape at the proximal end to a second shape at the distal end, in which case the wipe is generally cut to match the baffle on the distal end closest to the firing end of the muzzle.

In an example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the suppressor <b>10</b> comprises a tube <b>14</b> defining a bore <b>16</b>. The tube <b>14</b> has a barrel mounting end <b>18</b> and a muzzle end <b>20</b>. A mounting cap <b>22</b> is affixed to the barrel mounting end <b>18</b> of the tube <b>14</b>. The mounting cap <b>22</b> is adapted to receive a barrel <b>24</b> of the firearm <b>12</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and may take one of many forms and cross-sectional shapes. Example mounting caps include simple threaded fittings which engage threads on the barrel, a piston mount (aka booster, nielsen device, L.I.D), bayonet-type fittings, as well as quick disconnect fittings as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,555,765; 8,714,301 and 8,950,546, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Some embodiments utilize mountings more common for handguns, (such as handguns) where a threaded body which moves inside of the suppressor is attached to the firearm barrel, but is not the cap itself, rather it is retained from sliding out of the suppressor by a separate threaded cap with a hole allowing it to reciprocate through. In some embodiments this portion threaded to the barrel has a section inside with a larger diameter shoulder than the retaining cap which allows a spring to return it into position and keeps it from coming out of the suppressor. A muzzle cap <b>26</b> is affixed to the muzzle end <b>20</b> of the tube <b>14</b>. The muzzle cap <b>26</b> defines an opening <b>28</b> aligned with the barrel <b>24</b> of the firearm <b>12</b> to permit egress of a projectile. A plurality of baffles <b>30</b> are positioned within the bore <b>16</b> between the mounting cap <b>22</b> and the muzzle cap <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the invention also encompasses a wiped compensator <b>32</b> for firearm <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the wiped compensator example embodiment <b>32</b>, which comprises a tube <b>34</b> defining a bore <b>36</b>. A plurality of vent holes <b>38</b> extend through the tube <b>34</b>. Tube <b>34</b> has a barrel mounting end <b>40</b> and a muzzle end <b>42</b>. A mounting cap <b>44</b> <b>40</b> is affixed to the barrel mounting end <b>36</b> of tube <b>30</b>. The mounting cap <b>40</b> is adapted to receive the barrel <b>24</b> of the firearm <b>12</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), and, similar to the suppressor described above, example mounting caps <b>40</b> include simple threaded fittings which engage threads on the barrel, bayonet-type fittings, as well as quick disconnect fittings as disclosed in the US patents incorporated by reference herein. A muzzle cap <b>46</b> is affixed to the muzzle end <b>42</b> of the tube <b>34</b>. The muzzle cap <b>46</b> defines an opening <b>48</b> aligned with the barrel <b>24</b> of the firearm <b>12</b> to permit projectile egress.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, so called &#x201c;wipes&#x201d; <b>50</b> are positioned muzzle accessories including muzzle brakes, flash suppressors, in both the suppressor <b>10</b> and the wiped compensator <b>32</b> according to the invention. While a wipe may be positioned anywhere along the firing axis, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>Aa</figref> wipe <b>50</b> is positioned within the distal end of the muzzle accessory, suppressor tube <b>14</b> adjacent to the muzzle cap <b>26</b>. In some embodiments the assembly housing the wipe <b>50</b> is configured to be selectively disassembled, embodiments of which are described in more detail below. A wipe <b>50</b> is similarly positioned within the distal end of the compensator tube <b>34</b> adjacent to the muzzle cap <b>46</b>. Wipes are elements which further reduce the acoustic intensity of the firearm's report due to high velocity gases behind the projectile escaping the muzzle. High speed photographs of wipe equipped compensators further show that the presence of a wipe in a compensator causes a greater portion of muzzle blast gases to be diverted through the vent holes <b>38</b> as opposed to escaping through the opening <b>48</b> in the muzzle cap <b>46</b>, thereby also improving the effectiveness of the compensator.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Wipes are cut from a substrate of soft, pliant damping material such as, but not limited to polypropylene, neoprene, polyurethane and rubber. Wipe material is selected for its ability to permit a projectile to pass through without significant resistance while forming a seal around the projectile to inhibit the escape of propellant gases, thereby further dissipating acoustic energy and decreasing felt recoil. Wipes deteriorate with each round fired and are thus a consumable item which must be replaced after a finite number of rounds have passed through. It is thus advantageous to provide a cutting blade mounted to the muzzle accessory, such as on one of the suppressor tube, the compensator tube, or the muzzle cap of a suppressor or a compensator. Having a cutting blade as part of the suppressor or compensator allows wipes of the proper dimensions to be readily formed as long as a substrate of wipe material is available.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example embodiment wherein a cutting blade <b>52</b> is mounted on the muzzle end <b>20</b> of a suppressor tube <b>14</b>.
