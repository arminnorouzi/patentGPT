When ends of two pneumatic lines or ends of two fuel lines must be connected, it is common to employ what is known as a &#x201c;Wiggins&#x201d; fitting to create the necessary sealed connection between two lines. Since the integrity of pneumatic lines and fuel lines is critical for aircraft, proper Wiggins fitting installations are essential in aircraft maintenance. Briefly, a Wiggins fitting consists of an open-ended, rigid cylindrical sleeve and a cylindrical clamp. When properly positioned, the sleeve fits snugly over both ends of two lines that are to be connected and the clamp holds the sleeve in place.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During installation of a Wiggins fitting, the critical and tedious portion of the installation operation involves proper positioning of the sleeve without damaging the sleeve. The manipulation and proper placement of the sleeve can take multiple attempts spanning hours for four reasons. First, there is an extremely tight diametric mating tolerance between a sleeve and the portions of the two lines that the sleeve engages. Second, the sleeve's structural integrity must be pristine as any dimensional distortions, dents, and/or nicks in the sleeve can render the sleeve useless. Three, in order to properly position a sleeve to achieve the proper seal with the connected lines, an installation technician currently uses conventional tools (e.g., screwdrivers, hammers, wrenches, etc.) to apply a motive force to the sleeve during its manipulation and placement that frequently introduces unwanted dimensional distortions, dents, and/or nicks in the sleeve. Fourth, the locations of many of these line connecting operations are difficult for the installation technician to reach and/or see. As a result, the critical installation of a Wiggins-fitting sleeve is frequently difficult, time consuming, and frustrating.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a tool for use in manipulation and placement of a Wiggins-fitting sleeve over ends of two lines that are to be connected and sealed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object of the present invention is to provide a tool that ensures mechanical and structural integrity of a Wiggins-fitting sleeve during its installation over the ends of two lines that are to be connected and sealed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the present invention, a tool satisfying the above objects is provided. The tool is an open-ended cylinder having a first half-cylinder and a second half-cylinder. The first half-cylinder and second half-cylinder are hingedly coupled to one another at first circumferential ends thereof. A retainer couples the first half-cylinder to the second half-cylinder at second circumferential ends thereof. A first axial end of the open-ended cylinder is configured to slidingly receive an open-ended sleeve therein wherein the open-ended sleeve is fully encased by the open-ended cylinder. A second axial end of the open-ended cylinder has an annular ledge at an internal region of the open-ended cylinder. The annular ledge prevents the open-ended sleeve from passing axially through the second axial end.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the ends of two conventional pneumatic lines or two conventional fuel lines that are to be connected and sealed by a Wiggins fitting;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the ends of the two lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with a conventional Wiggins-fitting sleeve properly positioned thereon;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a sleeve manipulator and placement tool illustrated in its closed position in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an end view of the tool taken along line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrating its sleeve-receiving end thereof;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an end view of the tool in its open position as viewed from the sleeve-retaining end thereof;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the tool taken along line <b>6</b>-<b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an isolated side view of a tool closure retainer in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a side view of a portion of a sleeve manipulator and placement tool employing an integrated detent-type tool closure retainer in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view of a sleeve manipulator and placement tool having two fixed manipulator posts coupled to the sleeve-retaining end of the tool in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view of a sleeve manipulator and placement tool illustrated in its closed position and having through holes in radial walls thereof in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a tool further including a cushion material disposed on the tool's annular ledge in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the drawings, simultaneous reference will be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> where cross-sectional views of the ends of two pneumatic conduits/lines or fuel conduits/lines of the type that are generally connected using a Wiggins fitting. As is known in the art, a Wiggins fitting includes a cylindrical sleeve and a cylindrical clamp. The cylindrical sleeve and cylindrical clamp are not part of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates two conventional cylindrical lines <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> prior to the joining thereof by a cylindrical sleeve of a Wiggins fitting. As is known in the art, lines <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> are typically in axial alignment with one another (as shown) prior to the installation of a Wiggins-fitting sleeve. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates lines <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> after a Wiggins-fitting sleeve <b>200</b> (hereinafter referred to simply as sleeve <b>200</b>) has been properly manipulated and placed such that a portion of each line <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> is fitted in sleeve <b>200</b>. It is critical that sleeve <b>200</b> be properly positioned without incurring any damage.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As is known in the art, lines <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> are configured identically in terms of their end structure. That is, the outboard end of line <b>100</b> has two spaced-apart annular ferrules <b>102</b>/<b>104</b> with an O-ring <b>106</b> captured there between. Similarly, the outboard end of line <b>110</b> has two spaced-apart annular ferrules <b>112</b>/<b>114</b> with an O-ring <b>116</b> captured there between. Sleeve <b>200</b> has a smooth inside surface <b>202</b> that sealingly engages O-rings <b>106</b>/<b>116</b> when sleeve <b>200</b> is properly positioned over the ends of lines <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The axial ends of sleeve <b>200</b> at inside surface <b>202</b> are tapered radially outward at <b>204</b> to facilitate manipulation of sleeve <b>200</b> during a placement operation. Sleeve <b>200</b> is configured such that its axial length causes all annular ferrules <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> to be encased within sleeve <b>200</b> when sleeve <b>200</b> is properly positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Outer surface <b>206</b> of sleeve <b>200</b> has multiple annular grooves <b>208</b> that mate with portions of a conventional Wiggins clamp (not shown) once sleeve <b>200</b> is properly positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Installation of a conventional Wiggins clamp on a properly positioned sleeve <b>200</b> is a straightforward and well-known operation that is not a limitation of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As mentioned previously herein, the tight tolerances between lines <b>100</b>/<b>110</b> and sleeve <b>200</b> make the manipulation and placement of sleeve <b>200</b> a difficult task without applying some type of mechanical pressure or force to an axial end of sleeve <b>200</b> and/or an external radial face of sleeve <b>200</b>. Unfortunately, the need to maintain shape/size integrity of sleeve <b>200</b> to ensure a perfect seal with O-rings <b>106</b>/<b>116</b> makes it extremely difficult to apply non-damaging axial or radial forces to sleeve <b>200</b> using conventional aircraft maintenance tools such as screwdrivers, hammers, wrenches, etc.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention is a tool that provides for manipulation of sleeve <b>200</b>, assures proper placement of sleeve <b>200</b>, protects and guarantees shape/size integrity of sleeve <b>200</b>, and drastically reduces the time required for proper/safe manipulation/placement of sleeve <b>200</b>. Referring now simultaneously to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, a sleeve manipulation tool in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown in a perspective view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), in two axial end views thereof (i.e., tool is closed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and open in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), and in a cross-sectional view thereof (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The tool is referenced generally by numeral <b>10</b>. It is to be understood that some features of tool <b>10</b> to be described herein will not be visible in all views thereof. Tool <b>10</b> can be made of a rigid material(s) typically used in the manufacture of machine tools and can include stainless steel. In some embodiments of the present invention, tool <b>10</b> can be made from a magnetic material (e.g., a tool steel such as 304 stainless steel) to facilitate the retrieval of the tool if it is dropped in an area that is difficult to access by hand.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Tool <b>10</b> has two sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, each of which is a half-cylinder as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. One circumferential end <b>12</b>A of section <b>12</b> is hingedly coupled to one circumferential end <b>14</b>A of section <b>14</b> at a hinge joint <b>16</b> that can be configured as a finger joint hinge. As would be understood in the art, a hinge pin <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) passes through finger joint hinge <b>16</b> such that sections <b>12</b>/<b>14</b> can rotate about hinge pin <b>18</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention, finger joint hinge <b>16</b> can be configured such that sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can experience relative rotation of at least 90&#xb0; as indicated by two-headed arrow <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) such that each of half-cylinder sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> is unencumbered by the other half-cylinder section when tool <b>10</b> is fully opened as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In this way, either half-cylinder section <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> is readily positioned about a Wiggins fitting sleeve as will be explained further below.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are separably coupled to one another at their respective second circumferential ends <b>12</b>B and <b>14</b>B. More specifically, circumferential end <b>12</b>B of section <b>12</b> has finger joint features <b>22</b> that are interlaced with finger joint features <b>24</b> provided on circumferential end <b>14</b>B of section <b>14</b> when tool <b>10</b> is in its closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, each of finger joint features <b>22</b>/<b>24</b> has a hole <b>26</b> there through such that all holes <b>26</b> are axially aligned with each other when tool <b>10</b> is in its closed position thereby allowing tool <b>10</b> to assume an open-ended cylinder configuration in its closed position. A shaft or pin <b>32</b> of a retainer <b>30</b> engages aligned holes <b>26</b> (as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) thereby retaining tool <b>10</b> in its closed position.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, retainer <b>30</b> has its pin <b>32</b> with a diameter sized to slidingly fit in aligned holes <b>26</b>. Pin <b>32</b> terminates in a larger diameter head or post <b>34</b> whose outer surface can be knurled. Post <b>34</b> is readily grasped by an installation technician and used to place/remove retainer <b>30</b>, but can also be used to help manipulate tool <b>10</b> when it is being used to properly position a sleeve <b>200</b> about two lines as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and as described above. Retainer <b>30</b> can be, but need not be, tethered to one of sections <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> so that retainer <b>30</b> remains with tool <b>10</b> even when not coupling circumferential ends <b>12</b>B and <b>14</b>B.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When in its closed position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, one open axial end <b>40</b> of tool <b>10</b> has a diameter &#x201c;D<sub>1</sub>&#x201d; sized to slidingly receive the entirety of a Wiggins-fitting sleeve such as the above-described sleeve <b>200</b>. That is, the entirety of a Wiggins-fitting sleeve will fit axially within tool <b>10</b> to be encased thereby. The other open axial end <b>42</b> of tool <b>10</b> in its closed position is configured to define an interior annular ledge <b>44</b> that extends partially and radially into tool <b>10</b> to form a stop for the sleeve fitted in tool <b>10</b> thereby preventing an encased sleeve from exiting open axial end <b>42</b>. The interior axial length &#x201c;L&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of tool <b>10</b> measured from open axial end <b>40</b> to interior annular ledge <b>44</b> is equal to or greater than the axial length of a sleeve that tool <b>10</b> will be used to manipulate and position thereby ensuring that the sleeve is protected. When tool <b>10</b> is in its closed position, the inside diameter &#x201c;D<sub>2</sub>&#x201d; defined by annular ledge <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) is larger than the outside diameter of a line it will be disposed about, but smaller than the outside diameter of the pneumatic or fuel lines' annular ferrules (e.g., previously-described annular ferrules <b>102</b>/<b>104</b> or <b>112</b>/<b>114</b>). The axial external end face of end <b>42</b> (formed when sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are joined together at circumferential ends <b>12</b>B and <b>14</b>B, respectively, as described above) can include indentations for cooperation with a conventional or specialized tool used to apply force to axial end <b>42</b> as will be explained further below. In the illustrated example, the indentations comprise a plurality of radially-extending grooves <b>46</b>. Grooves <b>46</b> define a plurality of circumferential placement points for engagement with, for example, a flat-head screwdriver (not shown) that can be used to safely apply axial pressure to tool <b>10</b> when manipulating/placing a sleeve as will be described further below.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To use tool <b>10</b>, a sleeve (e.g., sleeve <b>200</b>) is positioned on a first line that is to be joined but away from its ferrule/O-ring end. For example, the first line's O-ring can be temporarily removed thereby allowing the sleeve to be readily slid over the line's annular ferrules. The O-ring is then re-installed between the first line's annular ferrules. Tool <b>10</b> is opened and one of half-cylinder sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> is placed about the sleeve with its open axial end <b>40</b> located closest to or facing the first line's ferrule/O-ring end. Tool <b>10</b> is closed about the sleeve and is retained in its closed position about the sleeve and line by retainer <b>30</b> as described above. At this point, tool <b>10</b> completely encases and protects the sleeve. With the sleeve fully protected, forces can be applied to axial end <b>42</b>. To facilitate the application of force to tool <b>10</b>, indentations can be provided in the axial external end face of end <b>42</b> as mentioned above. For example and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the indentations can be configured as radially-extending grooves <b>46</b> for ready engagement with a conventional tool such as a flat-head screwdriver. Axial pressure can be applied to end <b>42</b> in increments at different circumferential locations on axial end <b>42</b>. The axial pressure applied to tool <b>10</b> is distributed evenly about the axial end of the sleeve by annular ledge <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The manipulation of tool <b>10</b> along with the encased/protected sleeve proceeds over the first line's ferrule/O-ring end and, subsequently, over the ferrule/O-ring end of the to-be-joined second line. The inside diameter D<sub>2 </sub>defined by the interior of annular ledge <b>44</b> causes annular ledge <b>44</b> to engage with the first of two annular ferrules on the first line to prevent further axial movement of tool <b>10</b> and the sleeve encased thereby. When this occurs, the sleeve is properly positioned over both lines (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and tool <b>10</b> can be opened and removed. All such manipulation and placement of the sleeve occurs while the sleeve is completely encased and protected by tool <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments of the present invention, the separable circumferential ends <b>12</b>B and <b>14</b>B of sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, respectively, can include an integrated closure retainer that eliminates the need for the above-described removable retainer <b>30</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates the circumferential ends <b>12</b>B and <b>14</b>B of sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, respectively, with their corresponding finger joint sections <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> employing detent-type retention features. More specifically, some or all of finger joint sections <b>22</b> include a protrusion <b>23</b> that provides a detent engagement with a corresponding depression <b>25</b> provided in corresponding finger joint sections <b>24</b> when sections <b>12</b>/<b>14</b> are pivoted into engagement with one another. The engagement of each protrusion <b>23</b> with a corresponding depression <b>25</b> serves to retain sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in the closed position of tool <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments of the present invention, one or more fixed-position knobs or posts can be provided on and coupled to axial end <b>42</b> where grooves <b>46</b> are located as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. For example, round or otherwise-shaped knobs or posts <b>50</b> can be coupled to axial end <b>42</b> at diametrically-opposed locations. Posts <b>50</b> can have knurled surfaces to improve one's grip therewith. Posts <b>50</b> could also be configured for engagement by a socket-type of tool that can, in turn, be used to apply axial pressure to the tool.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments of the present invention and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a plurality of radially-extending through holes <b>60</b> can be provided in the radial walls of each of sections <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Holes <b>60</b> serve as hooking locations should tool <b>10</b> be dropped in a location that is difficult to access for purposes of retrieval. The presence of holes <b>60</b> also serves to reduce the overall weight of tool <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The advantages of the present invention are numerous. The above-described tool provides for the safe manipulation and correct placement of a Wiggins-fitting sleeve on two pneumatic lines or fuel lines when the lines are placed end-to-end. The tool provides the means to drastically reduce the time it takes for an aircraft maintenance task that must be performed on a regular basis. The tool protects the Wiggins-fitting sleeve from damage to ensure the integrity of the ultimate line connection.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although the invention has been described relative to specific embodiments thereof, there are numerous variations and modifications that will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. For example, the above-described axial end <b>42</b> with grooves <b>46</b> could additionally or alternatively have several indentations in the form of &#x201c;sockets&#x201d; for engagement with a rigid rod to facilitate application of axial pressure to the tool during a sleeve manipulation and placement. In some embodiments of the present invention and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a cushion material <b>48</b> (e.g., rubber) can be disposed on interior annular ledge <b>44</b> for further protection of the axial end of a sleeve during an installation operation. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced other than as specifically described.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed as new and desired to be secured by Letters Patent of the United States is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
