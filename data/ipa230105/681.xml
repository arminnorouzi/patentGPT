Commonly, such surgery is called for when a patient develops cataracts, a condition in which a portion of the eye lens becomes hard and cloudy or opaque. Unless the damaged lens is removed and replaced with a properly selected artificial lens, blindness or severely impaired vision will result.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Phacoemulsification is the use of ultrasonic energy to emulsify the damaged lens and aspirate the resulting lens particles from the eye. One of the most significant advantages of the use of phacoemulsification is that the apparatus itself is small and can fit through a relatively small incision, e.g., 0.5-3.0 mm, resulting in less fluid leakage from the eye capsule and shorter patient recovery times. Multiple incisions of varying sizes are typically made in the cornea to accommodate the different surgical instruments used in the surgery, such as forceps, irrigation/aspiration needle, nucleus chopper, intraocular lens (hereinafter &#x201c;IOL&#x201d;) injector, etc. In some surgeries, a larger incision or main port of about 1.8 mm is made to accommodate the implantation of a folded intraocular lens, which will expand and unfold in the eye, while one or two side ports or incisions of about 0.5 mm are made to accommodate irrigation sources or sustainers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is desirable to limit the trauma to the eye, by reducing the size of the incision, to minimize the risk of long-term damage to eye tissue and complications arising from surgery. Minimizing the size of the incision also helps to maintain intraocular pressure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known designs for ophthalmological knives to make corneal incisions generally have a beveled, natural diamond material blade with a triangular or trapezoidal shape to make a path through the cornea and into the anterior chamber of the eye. U.S. Pat. No. 6,547,802, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, discloses a surgical knife for making incisions in the cornea. Additional ophthalmological knives are sold by American Surgical Instruments Corporation having offices located at 26 Plaza Drive, Westmont, Ill. 60559, U.S.A. under the product serial nos. AE-8190, AE-8192, and AE-8121.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">At present there remains a need in the art for the development of simple, inexpensive, and durable instruments useable to perform the procedure of creating one or more ports or incisions in the eye to minimize the likelihood of developing complications during the healing process.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to an improved construction for an ophthalmic surgical blade, which may be incorporated into a knife, which addresses one or more of the above-discussed problems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with one form of the present invention, a surgical blade is disclosed for being combined with an elongate handle to form a cutting instrument for ophthalmic surgery includes a proximal portion for being attached to an elongate handle, an operative, distal portion, and a central portion extending therebetween.

The invention is not intended to be limited to only the embodiments so described, and the scope of the invention will be pointed out in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A first embodiment of a surgical instrument of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, wherein only the blade <b>10</b> of the instrument is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the blade <b>10</b> would be assembled with a handle <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) to form an instrument in the form of a knife for ophthalmic surgery. The handle of the instrument is elongated for being gripped by a user of the instrument, and can be provided with either a rounded cross-sectional configuration or with a flattened, polygonal, or irregular cross-sectional configuration. The handle has a proximal end, and a distal end to which the blade <b>10</b> is secured by either conventional or special means. The blade <b>10</b> may be sold to a user separately from the handle <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the blade <b>10</b> defines a central longitudinal axis <b>11</b> and includes a proximal portion <b>12</b> and distal portion <b>14</b>. The proximal portion <b>12</b> is configured for being attached to the distal end of a handle <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) and has a pair of circular apertures <b>16</b> for receiving mating protrusions in the handle to securely clamp and retain the blade <b>10</b> in the handle <b>50</b>. Other means may be used for securing the blade <b>10</b> to the handle <b>50</b>, such as friction fitting, welding, adhesive, overmolding, or forming the blade <b>10</b> as a unitary part of the handle <b>50</b> etc. A central portion <b>20</b> of the blade <b>10</b> extends between the proximal portion <b>12</b> and the distal portion <b>14</b> and has a trapezoidal configuration that tapers from the proximal portion <b>12</b> to the distal portion <b>14</b> and has a pair of sharpened lateral edges <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. In one presently preferred form of the blade <b>10</b>, the central portion has a length, direction along the axis <b>11</b>, of about 4 mm with a width, direction normal to the axis <b>11</b>, of about 2.4 mm at the proximal portion <b>12</b> (wider end) and a width of about 2 mm at the distal portion <b>14</b> (narrower end).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the distal portion <b>14</b> of the blade <b>10</b> is further defined by discrete sections or sub-portions, which will now be discussed. A first tapered section <b>23</b> extends axially away (distally) along axis <b>11</b> from the narrower end of the central portion <b>20</b> toward a straight section <b>26</b>. The first tapered section <b>23</b> defines a pair of sharpened lateral edges <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>. In one presently preferred form of the blade <b>10</b>, the first tapered section <b>23</b> has a length of about 1.5 mm with a width of about 2.0 mm at the central portion <b>20</b> and a width of about 0.6 mm at the straight section <b>26</b>, and the lateral edges <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> define an interior angle &#x3b1; of about 50 degrees.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The straight section <b>26</b> of the distal portion <b>14</b> of the blade <b>10</b> extends along the central axis <b>11</b> distally away from the first tapered section <b>23</b> and has a substantially constant width between two sharpened lateral edges <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>. In one presently preferred form of the blade <b>10</b>, the straight section <b>26</b> has a length of about 0.3 mm with a width of about 0.6 mm.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the straight section <b>26</b> of the distal portion <b>14</b> of the blade <b>10</b> terminates at a second tapered section <b>30</b>. The second tapered section <b>30</b> extends axially away (distally) along axis <b>11</b> from the straight section <b>26</b>. The second tapered section <b>30</b> defines a pair of sharpened lateral edges <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> that terminate in a point or tip <b>36</b>. In one presently preferred form of the blade <b>10</b>, the second tapered section <b>30</b> has a length of about 0.6 mm, and the lateral edges <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> define an interior angle &#x3b2; of about 50 degrees. It can be seen that the lateral edges <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> define a bevel <b>38</b> to form cutting edges around the entire perimeter of the middle portion <b>20</b> and distal portion <b>14</b> of the blade <b>10</b>. In one presently preferred form of the blade <b>10</b>, the blade <b>10</b> has a nominal thickness of between 100 &#x3bc;m and 150 &#x3bc;m, and the bevel <b>38</b> is between about 15-45 degrees, and more preferably 30 degrees between the sides <b>37</b> (only the top side being visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the understanding that the bottom side is substantially flat) of the blade <b>10</b>. In some forms, the bottom side could be a mirror image of the top side and could have a matching bevel.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The blade <b>10</b> is preferably formed from black diamond (carbon), but could be formed from natural diamond, sapphire, ruby, or stainless steel. In some applications, the blade may have a coating applied to one or more of the above-discussed materials functioning as a substrate to improve wear resistance, reflectivity, etc. In one preferred form, the coating is a chemical vapor deposition &#x201c;CVD&#x201d; or a diamond-like deposit on the substrate. The blade <b>10</b> or coating on a substrate of the blade <b>10</b> may be formed with hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic surfaces to enhance the gliding of the blade <b>10</b>. The inventors have found that artificial diamond carbon material is surprisingly suitable for this application in the blade <b>10</b> and may result in a reduction in the material cost of the blade of about 10&#xd7; compared to the cost of natural diamond. The black diamond (carbon) may also greatly improve visibility of the blade within the eye during surgery when compared to blades made from natural diamond.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The inventors of the present invention have found that using the blade <b>10</b> in a knife as described above performs surprisingly well for the formation of the main port or incision in the cornea and one or more side ports or incisions. This reduces the number of knives that may be required for the ophthalmic surgery, which would reduce the number of instruments needing sterilization post-surgery. Furthermore, the ability of the user to make the main and side ports with a single instrument can improve the speed and efficiency of surgery.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The handle <b>50</b> of the knife that is assembled with the blade <b>10</b> could be a rigid elongate metal such as aluminum or titanium and may be provided with mechanisms to facilitate movement of the blade <b>10</b> along the axis <b>11</b> relative to the handle, such as a spring, slide or screw threading.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one preferred method of operation of a knife utilizing the blade <b>10</b>, the user would create at least two incisions or ports within the eye (<b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). The main port in the cornea (<b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) would be made by extending the blade <b>10</b> into the eye <b>100</b> up to, or near, the 2.0 mm wide portion of the blade <b>10</b> (near the boundary of the middle portion <b>20</b> and the distal portion <b>14</b>). The side port or ports in the cornea <b>104</b> would be made by extending the blade <b>10</b> to or near 0.6 mm wide portion of the blade <b>10</b> (near the boundary of the second tapered section <b>30</b> and the straight section <b>26</b> of the distal portion <b>14</b>). The main port may be used to accommodate the insertion of 2 mm or sub-2 mm micro-coaxial cataract instruments.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is believed that the blade <b>10</b> is well suited for performing the clear corneal surgical technique to make an incision that seals itself and does not require sutures to prevent leakage of fluid from the anterior chamber of the eye.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A second embodiment of a surgical instrument of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, wherein only the blade <b>10</b>A of the instrument is illustrated. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the blade <b>10</b>A would be assembled with a handle (such as the handle <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) to form a knife for ophthalmic surgery. The numbered features of the second embodiment of the blade <b>10</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are designated generally with the suffix letter &#x201c;A&#x201d; and are analogous to features of the first embodiment of the blade <b>10</b> that share the same number (without the suffix letter &#x201c;A&#x201d;).
