Distillate based marine fuel both MGO and MDO, comprises petroleum middle distillate fractions separated from crude oil in a refinery via a distillation process. Gasoil (also known as medium diesel) is a petroleum middle distillate in boiling range and viscosity between kerosene (light distillate) and lubricating oil (heavy distillate) containing a mixture of C<sub>10 </sub>to C<sub>19 </sub>hydrocarbons. Gasoil (a heavy distillate) is used to heat homes and is used blending with lighter middle distillates as a fuel for heavy equipment such as cranes, bulldozers, generators, bobcats, tractors and combine harvesters. Generally maximizing middle distillate recovery from heavy distillates mixed with petroleum residues is the most economic use of these materials by refiners because they can crack gas oils into valuable gasoline and distillates in a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. Diesel oils for road use are very similar to gas oils with road use diesel containing predominantly contain a middle distillate mixture of C<sub>10 </sub>through C<sub>19 </sub>hydrocarbons, which include approximately 64% aliphatic hydrocarbons, 1-2% olefinic hydrocarbons, and 35% aromatic hydrocarbons. Distillate based marine fuels (MDO and MGO) are essentially road diesel or gas oil fractions blended with up to 15% residual process streams, and optionally up to 5% volume of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (asphaltenes). The residual and asphaltene materials are blended into the middle distillate to form MDO and MGO as a way to both swell volume and productively use these low value materials.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Asphaltenes are large and complex polycyclic hydrocarbons with a propensity to form complex and waxy precipitates, especially in the presence of aliphatic (paraffinic) hydrocarbons that are the primary component of Marine Diesel. Once asphaltenes have precipitated out, they are notoriously difficult to re-dissolve and are described as fuel tank sludge in the marine shipping industry and marine bunker fueling industry. One of skill in the art will appreciate that mixing Marine Diesel with asphaltenes and process residues is limited by the compatibility of the materials and formation of asphaltene precipitates and the minimum Cetane number required for such fuels.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Residual based fuels or Heavy Marine Fuel Oil (HMFO) are used by large ocean-going ships as fuel for large two stroke diesel engines for over 50 years. HMFO is a blend of the residues generated throughout the crude oil refinery process. Typical refinery streams combined to from HMFO may include, but are not limited to: atmospheric tower bottoms (i.e. atmospheric residues), vacuum tower bottoms (i.e. vacuum residues) visbreaker residue, FCC Light Cycle Oil (LCO), FCC Heavy Cycle Oil (HCO) also known as FCC bottoms, FCC Slurry Oil, heavy gas oils and delayed cracker oil (DCO), deasphalted oils (DAO); heavy aromatic residues and mixtures of polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons, reclaimed land transport motor oils; pyrolysis oils and tars; aspahltene solids and tars; and minor portions (often less than 20% vol.) of middle distillate materials such as cutter oil, kerosene or diesel to achieve a desired viscosity. HMFO has a higher aromatic content (especially polynuclear aromatics and asphaltenes) than the marine distillate fuels noted above. The HMFO component mixture varies widely depending upon the crude slate (i.e. source of crude oil) processed by a refinery and the processes utilized within that refinery to extract the most value out of a barrel of crude oil. The HMFO is generally characterized as being highly viscous, high in sulfur and metal content (up to 5 wt %), and high in asphaltenes making HMFO the one product of the refining process that has historically had a per barrel value less than feedstock crude oil.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Industry statistics indicate that about 90% of the HMFO sold contains 3.5 weight % sulfur. With an estimated total worldwide consumption of HMFO of approximately 300 million tons per year, the annual production of sulfur dioxide by the shipping industry is estimated to be over 21 million tons per year. Emissions from HMFO burning in ships contribute significantly to both global marine air pollution and local marine air pollution levels. 006. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, also known as the MARPOL convention or just MARPOL, as administered by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was enacted to prevent marine pollution (i.e. marpol) from ships. In 1997, a new annex was added to the MARPOL convention; the Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships&#x2014;Annex VI to minimize airborne emissions from ships (SO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, ODS, VOC) and their contribution to global air pollution. A revised Annex VI with tightened emissions limits was adopted in October 2008 and effective 1 Jul. 2010 (hereafter called Annex VI (revised) or simply Annex VI).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">MARPOL Annex VI (revised) adopted in 2008 established a set of stringent air emissions limits for all vessel and designated Emission Control Areas (ECAs). The ECAs under MARPOL Annex VI are: i) Baltic Sea area&#x2014;as defined in Annex I of MARPOL&#x2014;SO<sub>x </sub>only; ii) North Sea area&#x2014;as defined in Annex V of MARPOL&#x2014;SO<sub>x </sub>only; iii) North American&#x2014;as defined in Appendix VII of Annex VI of MARPOL&#x2014;SO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>x </sub>and PM; and, iv) United States Caribbean Sea area&#x2014;as defined in Appendix VII of Annex VI of MARPOL&#x2014;SO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>x </sub>and PM.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Annex VI (revised) was codified in the United States by the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS). Under the authority of APPS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA), in consultation with the United States Coast Guard (USCG), promulgated regulations which incorporate by reference the full text of Annex VI. See 40 C.F.R. &#xa7; 1043.100(a)(1). On Aug. 1, 2012 the maximum sulfur content of all marine fuel oils used onboard ships operating in US waters/ECA was reduced from 3.5% wt. to 1.00% wt. (10,000 ppm) and on Jan. 1, 2015 the maximum sulfur content of all marine fuel oils used in the North American ECA was lowered to 0.10% wt. (1,000 ppm). At the time of implementation, the United States government indicated that vessel operators must vigorously prepare to comply with the 0.10% wt. (1,000 ppm) US ECA marine fuel oil sulfur standard. To encourage compliance, the EPA and USCG refused to consider the cost of compliant low sulfur fuel oil to be a valid basis for claiming that compliant fuel oil was not available for purchase. For over five years there has been a very strong economic incentive to meet the marine industry demands for low sulfur HMFO, however technically viable solutions have not been realized and a premium price has been commanded by refiners to supply a low sulfur HMFO compliant with Annex VI sulfur emissions requirements in the ECA areas.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since enactment in 2010, the global sulfur cap for HMFO outside of the ECA areas was set by Annex VI at 3.50% wt. effective 1 Jan. 2012; with a further reduction to 0.50% wt, effective 1 Jan. 2020. The global cap on sulfur content in HMFO has been the subject of much discussion in both the marine shipping and marine fuel bunkering industry. There has been and continues to be a very strong economic incentive to meet the international marine industry demands for low sulfur HMFO (i.e. HMFO with a sulfur content less than 0.50 wt. %. Notwithstanding this global demand, solutions for transforming high sulfur HMFO into low sulfur HMFO have not been realized or brought to market. There is an on-going and urgent demand for processes and methods for making a low sulfur HMFO compliant with MARPOL Annex VI emissions requirements.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Replacement of heavy marine fuel oil with marine gas oil or marine diesel: One primary solution to the demand for low sulfur HMFO to simply replace high sulfur HMFO with marine gas oil (MGO) or marine diesel (MDO). The first major difficulty is the constraint in global supply of middle distillate materials that make up 85-90% vol of MGO and MDO. It is reported that the effective spare capacity to produce MGO is less than 100 million metric tons per year resulting in an annual shortfall in marine fuel of over 200 million metric tons per year. Refiners not only lack the capacity to increase the production of MGO, but they have no economic motivation because higher value and higher margins can be obtained from using middle distillate fractions for low sulfur diesel fuel for land-based transportation systems (i.e. trucks, trains, mass transit systems, heavy construction equipment, etc.).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Blending: Another primary solution is the blending of high sulfur HMFO with lower sulfur containing fuels such as MGO or MDO low sulfur marine diesel (0.1% wt. sulfur) to achieve a Product HMFO with a sulfur content of 0.5% wt. In a straight blending approach (based on linear blending) every 1 ton of high sulfur HSFO (3.5% sulfur) requires 7.5 tons of MGO or MDO material with 0.1% wt. S to achieve a sulfur level of 0.5% wt. HMFO. One of skill in the art of fuel blending will immediately understand that blending hurts key properties of the HMFO, specifically lubricity, fuel density, CCAI, viscosity, flash point and other important physical bulk properties. Blending a mostly paraffinic-type distillate fuel (MGO or MDO) with a HMFO having a high poly aromatic content often correlates with poor solubility of asphaltenes. A blended fuel is likely to result in the precipitation of asphaltenes and/or waxing out of highly paraffinic materials from the distillate material forming an intractable fuel tank sludge. Fuel tank sludge causes clogging of filters and separators, transfer pumps and lines, build-up of sludge in storage tanks, sticking of fuel injection pumps, and plugged fuel nozzles. Such a risk to the primary propulsion system is not acceptable for a ship in the open ocean.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It should further be noted that blending of HMFO with marine distillate products (MGO or MDO) is not economically viable. A blender will be taking a high value product (0.1% S marine gas oil (MGO) or marine diesel (MDO)) and blending it 7.5 to 1 with a low value high sulfur HMFO to create a final IMO/MARPOL compliant HMFO (i.e. 0.5% wt. S Low Sulfur Heavy Marine Fuel Oil&#x2014;LSHMFO) which will sell at a discount to the value of the principle ingredient (i.e. MGO or MDO).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Processing of residual oils. For the past several decades, the focus of refining industry research efforts related to the processing of heavy oils (crude oils, distressed oils, or residual oils) has been on upgrading the properties of these low value refinery process oils to create middle distillate and lighter oils with greater value. The challenge has been that crude oil, distressed oil and residues contain high levels of sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorous, metals (especially vanadium and nickel); asphaltenes and exhibit a propensity to form carbon or coke on the catalyst. The sulfur and nitrogen molecules are highly refractory and aromatically stable and difficult and expensive to crack or remove. Vanadium and nickel porphyrins and other metal organic compounds are responsible for catalyst contamination and corrosion problems in the refinery. The sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorous, must be removed because they are well-known poisons for the precious metal (platinum and palladium) catalysts utilized in the processes downstream of the atmospheric or vacuum distillation towers.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The difficulties treating atmospheric or vacuum residual streams has been known for many years and has been the subject of considerable research and investigation. Numerous residue-oil conversion processes have been developed in which the goals are same: 1) create a more valuable, preferably middle distillate range hydrocarbons; and 2) concentrate the contaminates such as sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorous, metals and asphaltenes into a form (coke, heavy coker residue, FCC slurry oil) for removal from the refinery stream. Well known and accepted practice in the refining industry is to increase the reaction severity (elevated temperature and pressure) to produce hydrocarbon products that are lighter and more purified, increase catalyst life times and remove sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorous, metals and asphaltenes from the refinery stream.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In summary, since the announcement of the MARPOL Annex VI standards reducing the global levels of sulfur in HMFO, refiners of crude oil have had modest success in their technical efforts to create a process for the production of a low sulfur substitute for high sulfur HMFO. Despite the strong governmental and economic incentives and needs of the international marine shipping industry, refiners have little economic reason to address the removal of environmental contaminates from high sulfur HMFOs. The global refining industry has been focused upon generating greater value from each barrel of oil by creating middle distillate hydrocarbons (i.e. diesel) and concentrating the environmental contaminates into increasingly lower value streams (i.e. residues) and products (petroleum coke, HMFO). Shipping companies have focused on short term solutions, such as the installation of scrubbing units, or adopting the limited use of more expensive low sulfur marine diesel and marine gas oils as a substitute for HMFO. On the open seas, most if not all major shipping companies continue to utilize the most economically viable fuel, that is HMFO. There remains a long standing and unmet need for processes and devices that remove the environmental contaminants (i.e. sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorous, metals especially vanadium and nickel) from HMFO without altering the qualities and properties that make HMFO the most economic and practical means of powering ocean going vessels.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is a general objective to reduce the environmental contaminates from a Heavy Marine Fuel Oil (HMFO) in a multi stage device implementing a core process that minimizes the changes in the desirable properties of the HMFO and minimizes the production of by-product hydrocarbons (i.e. light hydrocarbons having C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>and wild naphtha (C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>)).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A first aspect and illustrative embodiment encompasses a multi-stage device for the production of a Heavy Marine Fuel Oil, the device comprising: means for mixing a quantity of Feedstock Heavy Marine Fuel Oil with a quantity of Activating Gas mixture to give a Feedstock Mixture; means for heating the Feedstock mixture, wherein the means for mixing and means for heating communicate with each other; a Reaction System in fluid communication with the means for heating, wherein the Reaction System comprises one or more reactor vessels selected from the group consisting of: dense packed fixed bed trickle reactor; dense packed fixed bed up-flow reactor; ebulliated bed three phase up-flow reactor; fixed bed divided wall reactor; fixed bed three phase bubble reactor; fixed bed liquid full reactor, fixed bed high flux reactor; fixed bed structured catalyst bed reactor; fixed bed reactive distillation reactor and combinations thereof, and wherein said one or more reactor vessels contains one or more reaction sections configured to promote the transformation of the Feedstock Mixture to a Process Mixture; means for receiving said Process Mixture and separating the liquid components of the Process Mixture from the bulk gaseous components of the Process Mixture, said means for receiving in fluid communication with the reaction System; and means for separating any residual gaseous components and by-product hydrocarbon components from the Process Mixture to form a Product Heavy Marine Fuel Oil.

Control valves and isolation valves may also prevent feed from entering one reactor vessel but not another reactor vessel. In this way one reactor can be by-passed and placed off-line for maintenance and reloading of catalyst while the remaining reactors continues to receive heated Feedstock Mixture (D&#x2032;). It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art this arrangement of reactor vessels in parallel is not limited in number to three, but multiple additional reactor vessels can be added as shown by dashed line reactor.

In such a configuration, the reactors are loaded with catalyst in substantially the same manner. One of skill in the art will also appreciate that closing of an individual reactor inlet valve and corresponding reactor outlet valve (for example closing reactor inlet vale <b>60</b> and closing reactor outlet valve <b>62</b>) effectively isolates the reactor vessel <b>11</b>. This will allow for the isolated reactor vessel <b>11</b> to be brought off line and serviced and or reloaded with catalyst while the remaining reactors continue to transform Feedstock HMFO into Product HMFO.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A second illustrative configuration of the control valves allows for the reactors to work in series as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> by using the by-pass lines.

As noted, an advantage of this illustrative embodiment of the Reactor Section is that it allows for any one reactor to be taken off-line, serviced and brought back on line without disrupting the transformation of Feedstock HMFO to Product HMFO. It will also allow a plant to adjust the configuration so that as the composition of the feedstock HMFO changes, the reactor configuration (number of stages) and catalyst types can be adjusted. For example a high metal containing Feedstock HMFO, such as a Ural residual based HMFO, may require two or three reactors (i.e. reactors <b>11</b>, <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>) loaded with demetallization catalyst and working in series while reactor <b>12</b><i>c </i>is loaded with transition catalyst and reactor <b>12</b><i>d </i>is loaded with desulfurization catalyst. Many permutations and variations can be achieved by opening and closing control valves as needed and adjusting the catalyst loadings in each of the reactor vessels by one of skill in the art and only for brevity need not be described.

As with the prior example, the nature of the Feedstock HSFO and the catalyst loaded in each reactor may be optimized and adjusted to achieve the desired Product HSFO properties, however for brevity of disclose all such variations will be apparent to one of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">One benefit of having a multi-reactor Reactor System is that it allows for a reactor experiencing decreased activity or plugging because of coke formation can be isolated and taken off line for turn-around (i.e. deactivated, catalyst and internals replaced, etc. . . . ) without the entire plant having to shut down. Another benefit as noted above is that it allows one to vary the catalyst loading in the Reactor System so the overall process can be optimized for a specific Feedstock HSFO. A further benefit is that one can design the piping, pumps, heaters/heat exchangers, etc. . . . to have excess capacity so that when an increase in capacity is desired, additional reactors can be quickly brought on-line. Conversely, it allows an operator to take capacity off line, or turn down a plant output without having a concern about turn down and minimum flow through a reactor. While the above matrix Reactor System is described referring to a fixed bed or packed bed trickle flow reactor, one of skill in the art will appreciate that other reactor types may be utilized. For example, one or more reactors may be configured to be ebullated bed up flow reactors or three phase upflow bubble reactors, or counter-current reactors, or reactive distillation reactors the configuration of which will be known to one of skill in the art. It is anticipated that many other operational and logistical benefits will be realized by one of skill in the art from the Reactor Systems configurations disclosed.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Modular Reactor The Reactor System may be field constructed or modularized. A significant advantage of a modularized Reactor System will be the ability to change-out entire reactor vessels; as opposed to changing out or revamping the internals of a conventional fixed in place reactor. When the active reactor must be shut down for servicing (i.e. change catalyst, replace internals, etc. . . . ); the entire reactor (reactor vessel and internal components) may be changed out at rather than conventionally changing out catalyst beds and internals on-site. Changing out of the reactor vessels will dramatically decrease time plant down time by eliminating the on-site process of catalyst unloading, loading and conditioning, minimize field construction/change out activities, reduce safety risks and improve Plant operating efficiency.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a modular Reactor System as contemplated by the present invention may comprise a continuous tubular reactor vessel <b>102</b> defined by an outer wall surrounding an internal space. One or more inlet flanges <b>104</b> and one or more outlet flanges <b>106</b> flange are in fluid communication with each other via the interior to the reactor vessel. The outer wall of the reactor vessel is sized so it will be contained within a standard ISO 20 ft container (i.e. 2.43 m&#xd7;2.59 m&#xd7;6.06 m) or a standard ISO 40 ft container (i.e. 2.43 m&#xd7;2.59 m&#xd7;12.2 m) framework structure <b>108</b>. The outer wall of the reactor vessel will be supported and braced within the ISO container framework in a conventional manner known to one of skill in that art, but not shown in the drawing so the framework and reactor vessel can be lifted and transported via truck or heavy cargo vehicles. The one or more flanged inlets and outlets are sized and positioned to accommodate the corresponding feedstock provision piping and product outlet piping of the Plant. One or both of the reactor vessel head pieces can be flanged and removable using a suitably sized head flange <b>110</b>. A removable reactor vessel head piece may be desirable because it may facilitate the loading and unloading of the internal structures, including but not limited to trays, perforated support plates, catalyst beds, structured catalyst beds, Raschig rings, Dixon rings, targeted absorbant materials such as sulfur absorbants or metal absorbants, and combinations of these, at a location away from the active plant (i.e. in a warehouse or other controlled environment). Modular Reactor Systems such as the one described above within an ISO 40 ft. container frame have been modeled in the process to have a name plate capacity between 1600 bpd and 2400 bpd of HSFO. When utilized in combinations together in a matrix of reactors (as disclosed herein) expansion of capacity become simply a matter of having pre-designed the supporting utilities (i.e. piping, pumps, controls, etc. to accommodate the addition of new reactors to the Plant. For example, a set of three rectors set in series, the first reactor containing HDM catalyst loading, the second reactor containing HDT catalyst loading and the third reactor containing HDS catalyst loading, is expected to have an overall throughput of approximately 2000 bpd. Doubling the capacity of the plant can be achieved by adding a second series of three reactors. In this way additional capacity can be quickly brought on-line or take off-line as needed.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">To change out reactor vessels, the plant should be designed with a compliant safety zone around each modular reactor, so the plant can continue operations while the modular Reactor System to be replaced is brought out of service and replaced with a second Modular Reactor System. Within the processes of the present invention, the modular Reactor System to be changed out will be hydrocarbon freed, placed under nitrogen and passivated. Passivation may be by conventional means or it may be with a material that will harden at ambient conditions to allow for safely disconnecting and removal of the reactor vessel. A modular Reactor System filled with preconditioned catalyst will replace the removed reactor and conditioned and brought back on-line. Reactor vessel internals, decommissioned catalyst and the like in the replaced modular Reactor System can then be unloaded and recycled off-site or at a location more suitable for such activities. Replacement internals, thermal couple replacement, insulation material patching or replacement and other services can be performed, and catalyst materials can be loaded in the revamped modular Reactor System, under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity (and if necessary under nitrogen or other inert atmosphere) into the modular Reactor System prior to transport back to the Plant site. The refurbished modular Reactor System may be filled with a material that will harden at ambient conditions and melt when heated to secure and protect the catalyst and vessel internals during transportation, which is described below in greater detail. The encapsulation/solidification of the reactor internals will allow the modular Reactor System to be more easily transported via truck or rail and lifted into position and reconnected at the plant. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the flanges must be sealed off with blind flange covers whenever the modular Reactor System is transported to and from the Plant or stored in reserve on-site. One of skill in the art will appreciate that disconnecting, removal, replacement and reconnecting a modular Reactor System may be facilitated by hydraulic lifts or platforms or frameworks designed to securely receive the modular Reactor System and then lift, reorient and appropriately align and reposition of the modular Reactor System to fit the piping within the Plant. It is within the scope of this invention to have a hydrotreating plant in which the primary hydrotreating reactors are removable and replaceable with a modular Reactor System such as that described herein.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Hydrotreatment catalysts utilized in the modular Reactor System generally comprise an amorphous or crystalline oxide support such as an alumina, a silica, a silica alumina, or a zeolite, on which at least one element from groups VIII and VI of the periodic table or a combination of a plurality of elements from these same groups is deposited, for example solids designated CoMo/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, NiMo/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or NiW/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. They may be sulfided in advance to endow them with catalytic performances for hydrocarbon hydroconversion reactions, and in particular hydrotreatment such as hydrodesulfurization, and, demetallization) and certain hydrogenation reactions. This sulfurization step carried out prior to the catalytic step can be carried out in two manners. In situ sulfurization is characterized in that the catalyst in its oxide form is initially charged into the hydrocarbon conversion reactor for sulfurizing. Ex situ pre-sulfurization, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,719,195; 5,397,756; 7,582,587 incorporated by reference) pre-sulfurization of the catalyst is carried out in a location different from the location in which the catalyst operates. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the catalyst can be pre-sulfided and passivated ex situ prior to loading into the transportable reactor, or after it has been loaded to prevent self-heating which may lead to spontaneous combustion. The processes of pre-sulfiding and passivation have been described in the technical and patent literature, and are well known to one of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">For this disclosure, the term &#x201c;sulfided metal particles&#x201d; refers to metal oxide particles converted to the sulfide form.

The word &#x201c;coating&#x201d; or &#x201c;coated&#x201d; does not rule out some reaction leading to passivation of the catalyst surfaces.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The passivation step involves the controlled contacting of the pre-sulfided catalyst with a surface active oxidizing agent, such as oxygen and/or an oxygen-containing hydrocarbon having at least 12 carbon atoms, for a sufficient time so a sulfurized catalyst is made less spontaneously combustible.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">When the first passivation step is a treatment in the presence of a gas (or gas stream) containing oxygen (for example deriving from dry or moist air) which can advantageously be carried out at ambient temperature. The reaction of oxygen adsorption onto the catalyst causes an exothermic effect preferably controlled so the temperature of the product remains below 50&#xb0; C. One possibility is to control the partial pressures of oxygen admitted to the catalyst. Then, a preferred manner of carrying out the invention is to initially treat the catalyst with a gas at a partial pressure of less than 8 kPa of oxygen, and secondly with a gas at a partial pressure of over 8 kPa of oxygen. It is also possible to carry out the oxidizing passivation process directly with one or more gas streams having a partial pressure of oxygen of over 8 kPa. This first stage preferably ends when the exothermic effect has all but disappeared (i.e. when the temperature of the solid no longer increases or only increases slightly) or, if the operator has means for limiting the temperature increase, the second stage of coating can then be started earlier.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">When using an oxygen containing hydrocarbon in the first passivation step, the contact temperature is greater than about 0&#xb0; C. and typically will range from about 15&#xb0; C. to about 350&#xb0; C., preferably from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C. The contact temperature will vary depending on the melting point or sublimation temperature of the oxygen-containing hydrocarbon. For example, when the oxygen-containing hydrocarbon is a solid or a semi-solid such as lard, the oxygen-containing hydrocarbon process temperature should preferably be at least at a temperature of the melting point of the solid or semi-solid for a time sufficient for the catalyst to flow freely (appear &#x201c;dry&#x201d; and not stick or clump). In a specific example of lard as the oxygen-containing hydrocarbon, the lard is preferably contacted at a initial temperature of about 80&#xb0; C. The process temperature for contacting the oxygen-containing hydrocarbon and catalyst can be readily determined by the melting point of the solid or semi-solid at a given pressure environment or visually by checking if the oxygen-containing hydrocarbon flows. Contact times will depend on temperature and the viscosity of the oxygen-containing hydrocarbon, higher temperatures requiring shorter times and higher viscosity requiring longer times. Times will range from about 2 minutes to about 2 hours, although longer contact times can also be used.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Preferably the oxygen-containing hydrocarbon is sufficiently flowable to give a sufficient contact with the catalyst. An oxygen-containing hydrocarbon which is liquid at the elevated temperature of contact is more preferred for ease of handling. It is preferred that the oxygen-containing hydrocarbon is a higher hydrocarbon, i.e., one having a carbon number greater than twelve, preferably greater than sixteen, more preferably greater than twenty. The upper carbon number of useful oxygen-containing hydrocarbon is determined by the melting point, solidification point, or smoke point of this oxygen-containing hydrocarbon. While solid fatty oxygen-containing hydrocarbon having carbon numbers greater than 100 can be used, they are inconvenient since they must be heated to such a high temperature to be converted into a liquid, although they can be used with a solvent to put them in liquid form. Oxygen-containing hydrocarbons with carbon numbers within the range from about 12 to about 100, preferably from about 16 to about 80 are found most useful.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The term &#x201c;oxygen-containing hydrocarbon&#x201d; refers to hydrocarbon molecules containing at least one oxygen atom, which includes, for example, acids, acid esters, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and ethers. The oxygen-containing hydrocarbon may be mixtures such as acid esters and alcohols, different acid esters and the like. The oxygen-containing hydrocarbon can be primary, secondary or tertiary. The hydrocarbon moiety can be straight or branched chain carbon atom linkages, cyclic, acyclic or aromatic. The hydrocarbon moiety can further be saturated or unsaturated. Oxygen-containing hydrocarbons include, for example, higher alcohols having at least 12, preferably 16, more preferably 20 carbon atoms such as dodecanol, hexadecanol, farnesol, hexestrol, oleyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, hexacosanol, triacontanol, cocceryl alcohol and octacosanol; higher ethers having at least 12, preferably 16, more preferably 20 carbon atoms such as dicetyl ether; higher ketones having at least 12 carbon atoms, preferably 16 carbon atoms, more preferably 20 carbon atoms such as palmitone, 10-hydroxypalmitone and 3-octadecanone; higher aldehydes having at least 12 carbon atoms, preferably 16, more preferably 20 carbon atoms such as palmitaldehyde and olealdehyde; higher acids having at least 12, preferably 16, more preferably 20 carbon atoms such as saturated acids such as lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, and docosanoic acids for example, or unsaturated higher acids such as palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, eleostearic, ricinoleic, eicosenoic, docosenoic, eicosatetraenoic, eicosapentaenoic, decosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic; higher acid esters having at least 12, preferably 16, more preferably 20 carbon atoms including mono-, di-, tri- and poly-fatty acid esters including alkyl and aryl esters of the above acids (e.g. benzyl oleate and butyl oleate) and esters of the above acids with mono-glyceride, di-glycerides and triglycerides and mixtures thereof. These glyceride fatty acid esters having from 16 to 100, more preferably 18 to 90, most preferably 20 to 80 carbon atoms are preferred. Some examples of commercial glyceride fatty acid esters include soybean oil, linseed oil, safflower oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, olive oil, tung oil, castor oil, rapeseed oil, tall oil, peanut oil, coconut oil, palm oil, canbra oil, perilla oil, lard, tallow, marine fat or oil such as fish fat or oil (e.g. herring and sardine), vegetable residues and mixtures thereof. Some examples of commercial higher alcohols includes alkanol mixtures such as NEODOL&#x2122; alcohols from Shell Chemical Company, including mixtures of C<sub>9</sub>, C<sub>10 </sub>and C<sub>11 </sub>alkanols (NEODOL&#x2122; 91 Alcohol), mixtures of C<sub>12 </sub>and C<sub>13 </sub>alkanols (NEODOL&#x2122; 23 Alcohol), mixtures of C<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>13</sub>, C<sub>14 </sub>and C<sub>15 </sub>alkanols (NEODOL&#x2122; 25 Alcohol), and mixtures of C<sub>14 </sub>and C<sub>15 </sub>alkanols (NEODOL&#x2122; 45 Alcohol); the ALFOL&#x2122; Alcohols from Vista Chemical Company, including mixtures of C<sub>10 </sub>and C<sub>12 </sub>alkanols (ALFOL&#x2122; 1012 Alcohol), mixtures of C<sub>12 </sub>and C<sub>14 </sub>alkanols (ALFOL&#x2122; 1214 Alcohol), mixtures of C<sub>16 </sub>and C<sub>18 </sub>alkanols (ALFOL&#x2122; 1618 Alcohol) and mixtures of C<sub>16</sub>, C<sub>18</sub>, and C<sub>20 </sub>alkanols (ALFOL&#x2122; 1620 Alcohol); the EPAL&#x2122; Alcohols from Ethyl Chemical Company, including mixtures of C<sub>10 </sub>and C<sub>12 </sub>alkanols (EPAL&#x2122; 1012 Alcohol), mixtures of C<sub>12 </sub>and C<sub>14 </sub>alkanols (EPAL&#x2122; 1214 Alcohol) and mixtures of C<sub>14</sub>, C<sub>16</sub>, and C<sub>18 </sub>alkanols (EPAL&#x2122; 1418 Alcohol); and the TERGITOL-&#x2122; Alcohols from Union Carbide Corporation, including mixtures of C<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>13</sub>, C<sub>14 </sub>and C<sub>15 </sub>alkanols (TERGITOL-L&#x2122; 125 Alcohols). Suitable commercially available alkanols prepared by the reduction of naturally occurring fatty acid esters includes for example, the CO and TA products of Procter and Gamble Company and the TA alcohols of Ashland Oil Company. Higher oligomers and polymers of polyols such as alkylene glycols are also suitable as higher alcohols.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The optional coating treatment will involve the treatment of the passivated catalyst material with a long chain waxy hydrocarbon or polymer material to further protect the sulfided catalyst from deactivation. The coating agent should have a melting point no less than the maximum ambient air temperature (i.e. greater than about 60&#xb0; C.) and more preferably will have a melting point of over 80&#xb0; C. to facilitate transportation without premature melting. Waxy hydrocarbons should be sufficiently hard (or crystalline) so the coated catalyst particles can be formed into a solid mass. However not so hard that the solid mass becomes brittle or subject to cracking during transport. Waxes made from higher alkanes having a C<sub>15</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>chain lengths should be sufficient, with some limited branching. Waxes made from lipids or fatty acids or primary or secondary long chain alcohols will also be useful. Long chain alcohols may also serve as the passivating agent disclosed above. Ideally, the wax material will have a melting point above 100&#xb0; C., but lower than the lowest desired operating temperatures for the process (i.e. lower than 260&#xb0; C.) to facilitate removal from the catalyst materials. Generally upon exposure of the wax materials to elevated temperatures and a partial pressure of hydrogen, they are thermally hydrocracked and rapidly removed from the active sulfided catalyst materials. In an alternative embodiment, the coating material may be polymeric, preferably a heat sensitive polymer such thermoplastics examples of which include polyethylene, polypropylene or poly butylene. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the chain length and structure (iso-tactic v. syn-tactic v atactic) nature of the polymer chain will directly affect the properties and can be adjusted systematically to obtain the desired properties.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one embodiment of the invention, the passivation step is completed and the catalyst will be sufficiently passivated for handling and loading of the catalyst under controlled conditions of temperature, oxygen content (i.e. under an oxygen depleted atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon) and humidity. In such instances, the passivated (but not coated) catalyst will be loaded into the transportable reactor to form catalyst beds and/or will be loaded into the support structures of the pre-structured catalyst bed. This will allow the second step of coating to take place in the fully catalyst loaded transportable reactor itself or (with structured supports) the coating process will be performed on the catalyst loaded structured supports outside of the transportable reactor so they can be loaded into the transportable reactor.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Activation of the ex-situ pre-sulfided catalyst takes place in the transportable reactor once the transportable reactor is connected to the process infrastructure. The activation step may involve heating the reactor first to a temperature to melt or liquify the coating materials. The heating step will be performed under inert atmosphere (such as nitrogen or argon) which might have a measurable partial pressure of hydrogen. The heating step continues until the desired operating conditions of temperature and pressure are reached. This may require the introduction of a hydrocarbon (such as low sulfur diesel, marine gas oil, low sulfur residual materials in the presence of hydrogen and optionally a hydrocarbon. This process of pre-conditioning the catalyst and the transportable reactor prior to introducing Feedstock HMFO material.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Structured Catalyst Bed Turning now to the structured catalyst bed, similar beds have been disclosed in the prior art in relation to many catalyst promoted reactions. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,731,229; 5,073,236; 5,266,546; 5,431,890; 5,730,843; USUS2002068026; US20020038066; US20020068026; US20030012711; US20060065578; US20070209966; US20090188837; US2010063334; US2010228063; US20110214979; US20120048778; US20150166908; US20150275105; 20160074824; 20170101592 and US20170226433, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. However these disclosures involve the product being distilled from heavier bottoms or feedstock materials. For example heavy and light naphtha streams are desulfurized with the desired light naphtha being the desired product for the gasoline pool and the heavy naphtha either recycled or sent to a FCC cracker for further upgrading. The process of the current invention utilized the distillation separation process to remove undesired by-product hydrocarbons and gases produced by the catalytic reaction (i.e. ammonia and hydrogen sulfide) and the desired product is the bottoms stream that is catalytically treated, but not distilled. The structured catalyst beds as described above balance the catalyst density load, the catalyst activity load and the desired liquid space velocity through the reactor so an effective separation or distillation of purified lighter products can be produced. In contrast the present process functionally combines the functioning of a reactor with a stripper column or knock down drum. A further problem solved by the structured catalyst bed is to reduce the pressure drop through the catalyst beds and provision of sufficient contact of the Feedstock Mixture with the catalyst and mixing with the Activating Gas.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">A first illustrative embodiment of the structured catalyst beds is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> in a side view. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a catalyst retention composed of a pair of fluid permeable corrugated metal sheets (<b>202</b> and <b>204</b>), wherein the pair of the fluid permeable corrugated metal sheets are aligned so the corrugations are sinusoidal, have the same wave length and amplitude, but are out of phase and defining a catalyst rich space (<b>206</b>) and a catalyst lean space (<b>208</b>). The catalyst rich space will be loaded with one or more catalyst materials and optionally inert packing materials. The catalyst lean space (<b>208</b>) may be left empty or it may be loaded with inert packing such as ceramic beads, inactive (non-metal containing) catalyst support, glass beads, rings, wire or plastic balls and the like. These inert packing materials may serve the role of assisting in the mixing of the Activating Gas with the Feedstock HMFO, facilitate the removal or separation of gaseous by products (i.e. hydrogen sulfide or ammonia) from the process mixture or facilitate the separation of any hydrocarbon by-products.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows in side perspective a plurality of catalyst retention structures (<b>210</b>, <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>) formed into a structured catalyst bed (<b>216</b>). Structural supports (<b>218</b>) may be optionally incorporated into the structured catalyst bed to lend rigidity as needed. As shown the catalyst rich spaces are radially aligned so the catalyst rich spaces of one catalyst retention structure is aligned with the catalyst rich structure of the adjacent layers. In the illustrated configuration, the radial angle between adjacent layers is 0&#xb0; (or 180&#xb0;). One of skill in the art will appreciate that the angle of radial alignment between adjacent layers may be varied from 0&#xb0; to 180&#xb0;, preferably between 20&#xb0; and 160&#xb0; and more preferably 90&#xb0; so the catalyst rich areas in one layer are perpendicular to the adjacent layers. It will be further appreciated that the alignment of a particular set of three or more layers need not be the same. A first layer may be aligned along and define the 0&#xb0; axis relative to the other two layers; a second adjacent layer may be radially aligned along a 45&#xb0; angle relative to the first layer; and the third layer aligned along a 90&#xb0; angle relative to the first layer. This pattern of alignment may be continued until the desired number of layers is achieved. It also should be appreciated that it may be desirable to angle of the catalyst rich spaces (ie. the plane of the catalyst retention structure), relative to the flow of Feedstock HMFO and Activating Gas within the reaction vessel. This relative angle is referred to herein as the inclination angle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the inclination angel is perpendicular (90&#xb0;) to the flow of Feedstock HMFO and Activating Gas through the reactor vessel. However, it will be appreciated that the inclination level may be varied between 0&#xb0;, in which case the catalyst rich spaces are vertically aligned with the side walls of the reactor vessel and 90&#xb0; in which case the catalyst rich spaces are perpendicular to the side walls of the reactor vessel. By varying both the radial alignment and the inclination angle of the catalyst rich spaces, one will be able to achieve a wide variety and be able to optimize the flow of Feedstock HMFO though the reactor vessel with minimal plugging/coking.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">A second illustrative embodiment of the structured catalyst beds is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> in a side view. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, catalyst retention structure (<b>300</b>) comprises a flat fluid permeable metal sheet (<b>302</b>) and a corrugated fluid permeable metal sheet (<b>304</b>) aligned to be co-planar and defining a catalyst rich space (<b>306</b>) and a catalyst lean space (<b>308</b>). As with the prior illustrative embodiment, the catalyst rich space will contain one or more catalyst materials and optionally inert packing materials and the catalyst leans pace will be empty or optionally contain inert packing materials. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows in side perspective a plurality of catalyst retention structures (<b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b>) formed into a structured catalyst bed (<b>316</b>). Structural supports (<b>318</b>) may be optionally incorporated into the structured catalyst bed to lend rigidity as needed. As shown the catalyst rich spaces are radially aligned so the catalyst rich spaces of one catalyst retention structure is perpendicular with the catalyst rich structure of the adjacent layers. In the illustrated configuration, the radial angle between adjacent layers is 90&#xb0;. The same considerations of radial alignment and inclination of the catalyst retention structures described above will apply to this embodiment. The principle benefit of the illustrated structured catalyst bed is that the manufacturing process because affixing the flat fluid permeable sheet and the corrugated fluid permeable sheet will be greatly simplified. Further as illustrated, if the corrugated sheet is constructed using 90&#xb0; angle corrugations, each catalyst retention structure can withstand much greater weight loadings than if the corrugations are sinusoidal.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The loading of the catalyst structures will depend upon the particle size of the catalyst materials and the activity level of the catalyst. The structures should be loaded so the open space will be at least 10 volume % of the overall structural volume, and preferably will be up to about 65% of the overall structural volume. Active catalyst materials should be loaded in the catalyst support structure at a level dependent upon the catalyst activity level and the desired level of treatment. For example a catalyst material highly active for desulfurization may be loaded at a lower density than a less active desulfurization catalyst material and yet still achieve the same overall balance of catalyst activity per volume. One of skill in the art will appreciate that by systematically varying the catalyst loaded per volume and the catalyst activity level one may optimize the activity level and fluid permeability levels of the structured catalyst bed. In one such example, the catalyst density is so over 50% of the open space in the catalyst rich space, which may occupy only have of the over space within the structured catalyst bed. In another example catalyst rich space is fully loaded (i.e. dense packed into each catalyst rich space), however the catalyst rich space may occupy only 30 volume % of the overall structured catalyst bed. It will be appreciated that the catalyst density in the catalyst rich space may vary between 30 vol % and 100 vol % of the catalyst rich space. It will be further appreciated that that catalyst rich space may occupy as little as 10 vol % of the overall structured catalyst bed or it may occupy as much as 80 vol % of the overall structured catalyst bed.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The liquid hourly space velocity within the structured catalyst beds should be between 0.05 oil/hour/m<sup>3 </sup>catalyst and 10.0 oil/hour/m<sup>3 </sup>catalyst; preferably between 0.08 oil/hour/m<sup>3 </sup>catalyst and 5.0 oil/hour/m<sup>3 </sup>catalyst and more preferably between 0.1 oil/hour/m<sup>3 </sup>catalyst and 3.0 oil/hour/m<sup>3 </sup>catalyst to achieve deep desulfurization using a highly active desulfurization catalyst and this will achieve a product with sulfur levels below 0.1 ppmw. However, it will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that when there is lower catalyst density, it may be desirable to adjust the space velocity to value outside of the values disclosed.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">One of skill in the art will appreciate that the above described structured catalyst beds can serve as a direct substitute for dense packed beds that include inert materials, such as glass beads and the like. An important criteria is the catalyst density within the beds themselves. The structured catalyst beds can be loaded with a catalyst density comparable to that of a dense loaded bed with a mixture of catalyst and inert materials or a bed with layers of catalyst and inert materials. Determining the optimized catalyst density will be a simple matter of systematically adjusting the catalyst density (for a set of reaction conditions in a pilot plant. A fixed density catalyst structure will be made and the reaction parameters of space velocity and reactor temperature and bed depth will be systematically varied and optimized.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Reactive Distillation Reactor As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a reactive Reactor System as contemplated by the present invention will comprise a reactor vessel (<b>400</b>) within which one or more structured beds are provided (<b>402</b>, <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>). One of skill in the art will note that heated Feedstock Mixture (D&#x2032;) enters the reactor vessel in the upper portion of the reactor via line (<b>9</b><i>b</i>) above the structured catalyst beds (<b>402</b>, <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>). When elements are the same as those disclosed, the same reference number is utilized for continuity within the disclosure. Entry of the heated Feedstock Mixture (D&#x2032;) above the structured catalyst beds (<b>402</b>, <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>) may be facilitated by a distribution tray or similar device not shown. It will also be noted that each of the structured catalyst beds is different in appears, the reason for this will now described. The upper most structured catalyst bed (<b>402</b>) will be preferably loaded with a demetallization catalyst and in a structure optimized for the demetallization of the Feedstock mixture. The middle structured catalyst bed (<b>404</b>) will preferably be loaded with a transition catalyst material or a mixture of demetallization and low activity desulfurization catalyst. The lower most structured catalyst bed will be preferably loaded with a desulfurization catalyst of moderate to high activity. A gas sparger or separation tray (<b>408</b>) is below structured catalyst tray <b>406</b>. In this way, the Feedstock Mixture flows from the upper portion of the reactor to the lower portion of the reactor and will be transformed into Reaction Mixture (E) which exits the bottom of the reactor via line <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As shown, make up Activating Gas C&#x2032;&#x2033; will be provided via line <b>414</b> to both quench and create within the reactor a counter-current flow of Activating gas within the reactor. One of skill in the art will appreciate this flow may also be connected to the reactor so make up Activating gas is also injected between structured catalyst beds <b>406</b> and <b>404</b> and <b>404</b> and <b>402</b>. In the upper portion of the reactor, inert distillation packing beds (<b>410</b> and <b>412</b>) may be located. It may be desirably and optionally it is preferable for the lower most of these upper beds (<b>410</b>) to be a structured catalyst bed as well with catalyst for the desulfurization of the distillate materials. In such an instance a down comber tray or similar liquid diversion tray (<b>414</b>) is inserted so a flow of middle to heavy distillate (G&#x2032;) can be removed from the upper portion of the reactor via line (<b>426</b>). Light hydrocarbons (i.e. lighter than middle distillate exits the top of the reactor via line (<b>416</b>) and passes through heat exchanger (<b>7</b>) to help with heat recovery. This stream is then directed to the reflux drum (<b>418</b>) in which liquids are collected for use as reflux materials. The reflux loop to the upper reactor is completed via reflux pump (<b>422</b>) and reflux line (<b>424</b>). That portion of the lights not utilized in the reflux are combined with similar flows (F and G) via lines <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>respectively.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">One of skill in the art of reactor design will note that unlike the prior art reactive distillation processes and reactor designs, the present invention presents multiple novel and non-obvious (i.e. inventive step) features. One such aspect, as noted above, the Feedstock Mixture enters the upper portion of the reactor above the structured catalytic beds. In doing so it is transformed into Reaction Mixture that exits the bottom of the reactor. One of skill in the art will appreciate that by this flow, the majority of HMFO material (which is characterized as being residual in nature) will not be volatile or distilled, but any byproduct gases, distillate hydrocarbons or light hydrocarbons are volatilized into the upper portion of the reactor. The reactor will be hydraulically designed so the majority of the volume of the liquid components having residual properties in the Feedstock Mixture will exit the lower portion of the reactor, preferably over 75% vol. of the volume of the liquid components having residual properties in the Feedstock Mixture will exit the lower portion of the reactor and even more preferably over 90% vol. of the volume of the liquid components having residual properties in the Feedstock Mixture will exit the lower portion of the reactor. This is in contract with the prior art where the majority of the desired products exit the upper portion of the reactor via distillation and the residual bottoms portions are recycled or sent to another refinery unit for further processing.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In a variation of the above illustrative embodiment, one or more fixed bed reactor(s) containing, solid particle filtering media such as inactive catalyst support, inert packing materials, selective absorption materials such as sulfur absorption media, demetallization catalyst or combinations and mixtures of these may be located upstream of the Reactive distillation reactor. In one alternative embodiment a reactor with a mixture of hydrodemetallization catalyst, decarbonization catalysts and inert materials will act as a guard bed, protecting the Reactive distillation reactor from high levels of metals, concarbon (CCR) and other contaminants that can reduce the run length of the Reactive distillation reactor. In another embodiment, the upstream reactors are loaded within inert packing materials and deactivated catalyst to remove solids followed by a reactor loaded within hydrodemetallization catalyst. One of skill in the art will appreciate these upstream reactors may allow the upstream reactors to be taken out of service and catalysts changed out without shutting down or affecting operation of the Reactive distillation reactor.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In another variation of the above illustrative embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a fired reboiler can be added to the lower portion of the reactive distillation reactor. Such a configuration would take a portion of the Reaction Mixture from the bottom of the reactor prior to its exit via line <b>11</b><i>a</i>, pass it through a pump and optionally a heater, and reintroduce the material into the reactor above tray <b>408</b> and preferably above the lowermost structured catalyst bed (<b>406</b>). The purpose of the reboiler will be to add or remove heat within the reactive distillation reactor, and will increase column traffic, because of this reboiler loop a temperature profile in the reactive distillation reactor will be controlled and more distillate product(s) may be taken. We assume severity in the column could be increased to increase the hydrocracking activity within the reactive distillation reactor increasing the distillate production. Because of the washing effect caused by refluxing Reaction Mixture back into the reactive distillation reactor, coking and fouling of catalysts should be minimized, allowing for extending run lengths.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Bubble Reactor: <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a packed bubble reactor configuration as an alternative embodiment for the primary reactor. Bubble reactors are characterized by having a high heat and mass transfer rates, compactness and low operating and maintenance costs. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the reactor (<b>502</b>) will contain a packed catalyst bed (<b>504</b>) of heterogenous transition metal catalyst materials. The packed bed may be a partially expanded bed or more preferably a structured bed in which the active catalyst material are dispersed by inert packing (glass beads) or metal structures such as those described in U.S. and co-pending patent applications. Catalyst supporting structures (<b>506</b> and <b>508</b>) may be helpful in ensuring that the catalyst materials remain in the desired locations within the reactor. The illustrative packed bubble reactor will have a con-current configuration with Feedstock HSFO (<b>510</b>) being introduced into the reactor at a point below the catalyst bed. Activating Gas (<b>512</b>) will be so bubble are formed in the Feedstock HSFO, preferably using spargers or gas diffusion devices (<b>514</b>) know to one of skill in the art. Treated HSFO (<b>516</b>) exits the reactor at a point above the catalyst bed.
