Because the electric vehicle emits no carbon dioxide, generates low noise, and uses the motor with energy efficiency higher than energy efficiency of an engine, the electric vehicle is in the limelight as an environmentally friendly vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A key technology for implementing the electric vehicle is related to a battery module. Recently, studies have been actively conducted on a reduction in weight of a battery, a reduction in size of the battery, and a reduction in time taken to charge the battery. The battery module needs to be used in an optimal temperature environment to maintain an optimal performance and a long lifespan. However, the battery module is difficult to use in the optimal temperature environment because of a change in outside temperature and heat generated while the battery module operates.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, because the electric vehicle emits no waste heat, which is generated during combustion in a separate internal combustion engine, the electric vehicle uses an electric heating device to heat the vehicle interior in the winter season. Further, because the electric vehicle needs to be warmed up, under a cold weather condition, to improve the performance of charging and discharging battery, the electric vehicle uses a separate electric heater that heats a coolant. That is, there is a technology that uses a cooling/heating system for adjusting a temperature of the battery module to maintain the optimal temperature environment for the battery module separately from a cooling/heating system for air conditioning of the vehicle interior.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this case, the air conditioning system for air conditioning of the interior performs heat management by utilizing a refrigerant and a coolant. However, there is a problem in that the number of packages increases and the structure of the package is complicated because the number of components to be subjected to the heat management increases.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for a method of unifying the heat source. However, if the heat source uses only the coolant, there is a problem in that cooling/heating performance deteriorates.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-mentioned matters described as the background art are provided merely to aid understanding of the background of the present disclosure, and should not be construed to admit that the matters correspond to the technologies already known

<b>200</b>, and the coolant line <b>200</b> connects the heater <b>20</b>, the cooler <b>40</b>, the first air conditioning heat exchanger <b>51</b>, and the second air conditioning heat exchanger <b>52</b>. In addition, one or more water pumps are provided in the coolant line <b>200</b>, and the water pump operates to circulate the coolant.
