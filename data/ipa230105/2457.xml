More specifically, this invention relates to medicaments for treatment and medical treatment of Alzheimer's disease in a mammal such as man.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common causes of dementia in man. It is a chronic and fatal disease associated with neural cell degeneration in the brain of the affected individual, characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques consisting of extracellular deposits of amyloid &#x3b2;-peptide (A&#x3b2;-peptide).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Proteolytic processing of the the A&#x3b2; precursor protein (A&#x3b2;PP) generates A&#x3b2; peptides of different lengths, whereof A&#x3b2;42 is the most aggregation prone and toxic. The kinetics of A&#x3b2;42 aggregation follows recently defined nucleation-dependent microscopic events. During primary nucleation A&#x3b2;42 monomers associate and form a nucleus, from which a fibril can start to elongate. During secondary nucleation, monomers attach to the surface of a fibril, which catalyzes the formation of a new nucleus, leading to exponential fibril growth. This monomer dependent secondary nucleation autocatalytic pathway is the predominant source of toxic A&#x3b2;42 species. Key challenges in finding a treatment of AD is to specifically reduce A&#x3b2;42 neurotoxicity, rather than focusing on overall aggregation and plaque formation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One strategy to prevent aggregation has been to utilize molecules that are functionally defined as chaperones. Chaperones play an important role by aiding the correct folding of proteins in the complex intracellular milieu. A number of molecular chaperones, such as heat-shock proteins (Hsp), are known to be important in the folding process and have been extensively studied. Some of these chaperones are apparently able to interact with and have an impact on the amyloid fibril formation of certain polypeptides.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The BRICHOS domain has been found in several human precursor proteins, initially in Bri2, Chondromodulin-1 and prosurfactant protein C (proSP-C). Sanchez-Pulido et al., Trends Biochem Sci 27(7): 329-332,2002 provides a review of BRICHOS domains. The BRICHOS domain has been suggested to prevent amyloid formation of aggregation prone regions (clients) of the respective proprotein during biosynthesis. Recombinant human (rh) BRICHOS domains from proSP-C and Bri2 are efficient inhibitors also of amyloid formation of non-client proteins such as medin, islet amyloid polypeptide, A&#x3b2;40 and A&#x3b2;42.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">WO 2011/162655 discloses that the BRICHOS domain of Bri2 decreases amyloid fibril formation and aggregation of A&#x3b2; peptide and ABri/ADan peptides.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Bri2 is produced in the central nervous system (CNS), with expression in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex in humans, and colocalizes with senile plaques in AD patients. Known sequences of Bri2 include sequences derived from Erpetoichtys <i>calabaricus </i>(NCBI accession no. XP_028655526) and <i>Acipenser ruthenus </i>(UniProt/TrEMBL accession no. A0A444U9X2). Under physiological conditions, the BRICHOS domain is released by proteolysis from the Bri2 precursor protein. Recombinant human (rh) Bri2 BRICHOS is efficient in inhibiting A&#x3b2;42 fibril formation in vitro and in alleviating the related neurotoxicity to hippocampal slice preparations and in <i>Drosophila </i>models. Rh proSP-C BRICHOS specifically impedes the secondary nucleation step in A&#x3b2;42 fibril formation. Rh Bri2 BRICHOS modulates both elongation and secondary nucleation events, but different assembly states of Bri2 BRICHOS affect A&#x3b2; fibril formation in different ways. Bri2 BRICHOS monomers are most potent in preventing A&#x3b2;42 induced disruption of neuronal network activity, while dimers most efficiently suppress A&#x3b2;42 overall fibril formation and oligomers inhibit non-fibrillar protein aggregation (Chen et al., Nat. Commun., 8: 2081 (2017)). The Bri2 BRICHOS monomers are not long-term stable and form high molecular weight oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner in phosphate buffer or in mouse serum in vitro, which is accompanied by reduced potency against A&#x3b2;42 fibril formation. Conversion of Bri2 BRICHOS monomers to high molecular weight oligomers may be relevant for AD, as increased amounts of different Bri2 forms were found in AD brain compared with healthy controls. These observations imply that modulating the distribution of Bri2 BRICHOS assembly states so that the amount of monomers is increased is a concept to combat A&#x3b2;42 neurotoxicity, see e.g. WO 2012/138284.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Despite these advances in the art, there is a strong need of improved and alternative therapies for treatment of conditions associated with formation of amyloid protein fibrils in a mammal, such as man.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object to decrease the tendency of proteins that are prone to fibrillate to aggregate into amyloid fibrils, or even prevent proteins that are prone to fibrillate from aggregating into amyloid fibrils.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also an object to decrease formation of amyloid plaques consisting of extracellular deposits in the brain of a mammal of proteins that are prone to fibrillate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is also an object to provide a new treatment option for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is yet another object to provide compounds, combinations of compounds and pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is an object to modulate the distribution of Bri2 BRICHOS assembly states so that the amount of monomers is increased in order to combat A&#x3b2;42 neurotoxicity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is generally based on the insight that monomers of chaperone proteins which have a high identity to the BRICHOS domains of Bri2 from human are useful for medical treatment Alzheimer's disease.

In this study, we designed the R221E Bri2 BRICHOS mutant that forms stable monomers and make rh wt Bri2 BRICHOS oligomers release monomers. Rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E monomers efficiently alleviate A&#x3b2;42 induced neurotoxicity by selectively blocking secondary nucleation, which has previously been shown to constitute a main source of toxic species during A&#x3b2;42 aggregation. Moreover, the capacity of rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E monomers to disassemble wt oligomers results in improved ability to delay A&#x3b2;42 fibrillization and, importantly, reduces A&#x3b2;42 toxicity to hippocampal slice preparations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Means of counteracting proteotoxicity include chaperone-mediated prevention of amyloid formation, disaggregation of pre-existing aggregates, and aggregate sequestration. We rationalized our results in a schematic model to visualize the inhibition efficiencies of the small Bri2 BRICHOS R221E species on specific nucleation events during A&#x3b2;42 fibrillization and potential sequestrations of the toxic species (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. provides a model for potentiation of chaperone activity against A&#x3b2;42 neurotoxicity by shifting the Bri2 BRICHOS assembly state:</p><p id="p-0055" num="0000">(A) A&#x3b2;42 forms fibrils via primary nucleation, elongation, and secondary nucleation, with rate constants k<sub>n</sub>, k<sub>+</sub>, and k<sub>2</sub>, respectively. While the Bri2 BRICHOS R221E dimer (solid arrows) attenuates both k<sub>+</sub> and k<sub>2</sub>, the monomer (dotted arrows) predominantly reduces k<sub>2</sub>. Secondary nucleation catalyses the formation of new nucleation units, which acts as a positive feedback loop (curved arrow) for fibril formation, and this mechanism may be linked to enhanced generation of neurotoxic A&#x3b2;42 species. Furthermore, the molecular size of the Bri2 BRICHOS monomer fits well to a single layer of &#x3b2;-structured A&#x3b2;42 molecules, which might be the structural element of neurotoxic A&#x3b2;42 species. On the contrary, the size of the dimer matches well the area of the cross-section of fibril-ends (PDB accession code 5KK3), potentially promoting attenuation of the fibril-end elongation rate. The structural properties together with the specific reduction of k<sub>2 </sub>may thus make the Bri2 BRICHOS monomer most efficient in prevention of A&#x3b2;42-associated neurotoxicity.<br/>(B) Rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E predominately forms monomers and smaller amounts of oligomers (hypothetical model in dashed circle), while rh wt Bri2 BRICHOS mainly assembles into high molecular weight oligomers (electron microscopy data bank accession code EMD-3918) in equilibrium with monomers. Incubation of rh wt Bri2 BRICHOS oligomers with rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E monomers destabilizes the oligomers and shifts the kinetic equilibrium toward the monomeric state, leading to an overall increased potency in preventing A&#x3b2;42 neurotoxicity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). This model provides thus a basis for understanding how the single point mutation R221E modulates the assembly state of Bri2 BRICHOS and thereby modulates its effects on A&#x3b2;42 fibril formation and enhances activities against A&#x3b2;42-associated neurotoxicity.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">The generation of new nucleation units promoted by secondary nucleation has been suggested to be linked to formation of small neurotoxic A342 species and thus a specific prevention of secondary nucleation events may be beneficial against A&#x3b2;42-induced neurotoxicity. Yet, a recent study indicated that also agents that result in an increase in the overall aggregation rate, predominantly caused by an enhanced secondary nucleation rate, can be beneficial to suppress A&#x3b2;42 toxicity provided that additional interactions take place. While the detailed mechanism of A&#x3b2;42 caused toxicity is still under investigation, efficient toxicity modulators may be especially suited to specifically interact with neurotoxic oligomeric A&#x3b2;42 species to shield surfaces that are available for aberrant interactions. These interactions may then hinder the underlying neurotoxic mechanism(s), such as direct binding to receptors or membrane destruction. Interestingly, it has been shown that both intra- and extracellular chaperones, including clusterin, Hsp70 and &#x3b1;B-crystallin, can bind to oligomers of several different amyloidogenic peptides, including A&#x3b2;, and thereby induce their assembly into larger species that shield reactive surfaces. It remains to be studied whether this mechanism apply to the BRICHOS domain as well, but electron microscopy data suggest that rh Bri2 BRICHOS monomers interact with oligomeric A&#x3b2;42 species.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">In the current study, we found that the Bri2 BRICHOS R221E monomer predominantly attenuates the secondary nucleation rate, while the dimer substantially affects both the elongation and secondary nucleation rate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>6</b>A</figref>). This causes a reduction of the generated number of nucleation units in the presence of Bri2 BRICHOS R221E monomers, but not dimers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). The molecular size of the Bri2 BRICHOS R221E dimer matches well the surface of the cross-sectional area of recently published A&#x3b2;42 fibril structures, providing a possible explanation why the Bri2 BRICHOS dimer, besides the secondary nucleation rate k<sub>2</sub>, also efficiently attenuates the elongation rate k<sub>+</sub>. The different specificity of the Bri2 BRICHOS dimer compared to the monomer also support that secondary nucleation and elongation events occur at distinct sites on A&#x3b2;42 aggregates. While structural details about the soluble neurotoxic A&#x3b2;42 species are still missing, a &#x3b2;-structure state of toxic A&#x3b2;42 species/oligomers has been reported. We observed that the molecular size of the Bri2 BRICHOS monomer fits well a single layer of &#x3b2;-structured A&#x3b2;42 molecules, which may build up neurotoxic A&#x3b2;42 species (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). Hence, the ability to efficiently reduce the generation of new nucleation units together with the well-matched molecular size for interactions with putative neurotoxic A&#x3b2;42 species potentially makes the Bri2 BRICHOS monomer most efficient in preventing A&#x3b2;42-induced neurotoxicity to hippocampal &#x3b3; oscillations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">For AD aging is the main risk factor, but detailed underlying mechanisms are missing. Chaperone network decline during aging is considered to affect many aging-associated diseases. In aging organisms, the balance between misfolded proteins and functional chaperones is disturbed. Increased amounts of different Bri2 forms were observed in AD brains compared to the healthy controls. Improved chaperone activity could be achieved by increasing the local concentration, but since chaperones are precisely balanced, overproduction of certain chaperone may result in disease. Hence, the concept to augment the capacity of certain chaperone networks holds potential for preventing and treating pathologies associated with proteome deterioration. In our current study, augmentation of rh Bri2 BRICHOS activity against A&#x3b2;42-induced neurotoxicity is shown to occur as a result of formation of monomeric species from larger oligomers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).

As used herein, the term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; is defined as the application or administration of the isolated protein to a patient, or application or administration of the isolated protein to an isolated tissue or cell line from a patient, who has Alzheimer's disease, a symptom of disease or a predisposition toward disease, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the disease, the symptoms of disease or the predisposition toward disease.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">In one aspect, there is provided a method for preventing a disease or condition (i.e. decreasing the risk of contracting, or decreasing the rate at which symptoms appear that are associated with a disease or condition) associated with fibril formation caused by A&#x3b2; peptide by administering to the subject the isolated protein that reduces aggregation of the polypeptide. Subjects at risk for Alzheimer's disease can be identified by, for example, any or a combination of appropriate diagnostic or prognostic assays known in the art. Administration of a prophylactic agent can occur prior to the manifestation of symptoms characteristic of the disease, such that the disease is prevented or, alternatively, delayed in its progression.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">The isolated protein can be administered to a patient at therapeutically effective doses to prevent, treat or ameliorate disorders involving fibril formation associated with Alzheimer's disease. A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of the compound sufficient to result in amelioration of symptoms of the disorders. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures as described above.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">It is also contemplated that the protein can be administrated by gene therapy, such as by using expression vectors, plasm ids or viruses to transfect cells in the neural system, preferably brain, such that the isolated protein is expressed by these cells in the central neural system. This is useful for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">The present invention will now be further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Materials and Methods</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Bri2 BRICHOS R221E and AU1 Tagged Bri2 BRICHOS Wt Preparation</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0086">For generating rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E (SEQ ID NO: 4), the primers 5&#x2032;-CACCTGGGTTTCTTTATTTATGAACTGTGTCATGACAAGGAAAC-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO: 14) and 5&#x2032;-GTTTCCTTGTCATGACACAGTTCATAAATAAAGAAACCCAGGTG-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO: 15) were synthesized.

Mice were caged in groups of three to five individuals and the light-dark condition was 12-h:12-h (lights on 8:00). Mice were randomly divided for PBS or rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E administration with n=10/group.

After a gap of 2 h, mice were placed in same open box with two similar sample objects (Lego) placed diagonally near the corners of the box and allowed to explore them freely. Next day, one of the objects was replaced with a novel object (egg timer) and mice were allowed to explore the two objects for 5 min. The behavior of each mouse was video-monitored and analyzed using EthoVision&#xae; XT software, Noldus (Wageningen, The Netherlands). The arena was cleaned with 70% alcohol after each session.

Mice were trained in a circular pool (1.2 m diameter, 60 cm height) (Ugobasile, Italy) to locate a hidden escape platform (10 cm diameter, 30 cm height). The pool was virtually divided into four equal quadrants identified as northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest. The tank was filled with tap water at a temperature of 21&#xb1;2.0 up to 1 cm above the top of the platform and the water was made opaque with milk. The tank was illuminated with 4 lights near the bottom of the tank. The platform was placed in the tank in a fixed position (in the middle of the northwest quadrant). The pool was placed in a large room with diffuse lighting and curtains to hide the experimenter and with a number of extra-maze visual cues. During the acquisition phase, each mouse was trained for 4 trials per day, for four consecutive days with an inter-trial interval of 30 min. Mice were released facing the wall of the pool from one of following starting points: North, East, South, or West and allowed to search the platform for 60 s. During each day the starting position remained constant. If a mouse could not find the platform after 60s, it was gently guided towards the platform and allowed to stay for 15s. During the probe trial, reference memory was assessed by removing the platform on the fifth day, 24 h after the last acquisition trial, using same release point for all the mice. A video camera was placed above the center of the pool and connected to a EthoVision&#xae; XT video-tracking system, Noldus (Wageningen, The Netherlands).

On the conditioning day, each mouse was individually placed in the conditioning chamber and allowed to explore freely for 2 min, followed by 30s sound (65 dB) and mild foot shock (0.5 mA, 2 s). One more session of sound and footshock were presented with an inter-stimulus interval of 1 min, and the mice were returned to their home cage 30 s after the last footshock. The chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol to remove any odor cues between each session. One day after the conditioning, mice were placed in the same chamber and allowed to explore freely for 3 min without footshock administration for context based freezing. On 3rd day, mice were placed in a black square chamber placed inside the sound-attenuating white chest and allowed to explore freely for 2 min, followed by 2 min sound during which the freezing response was assessed for cue-based fear conditioning. In each test, freezing time was calculated using Motor Monitor software (Kinder Scientific, USA).

In a structural model of Bri2 BRICHOS subunit based on the proSP-C BRICHOS structure, Arg221 is surface-exposed in helix 2 and can point into the pocket of a neighbouring subunit. It is believed that the Arg221Glu mutation introduces opposite surface electrostatic potential, destabilizes the oligomer and generates a stable subunit monomer.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0135">Rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E was produced in fusion with a solubility tag, NT*, that was recently developed based on the N-terminal domain of spider silk proteins. Purified NT*-Bri2 BRICHOS R221E was separated into oligomers, dimers and monomers by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). In contrast to wt protein, the mutant forms to a large extent monomer, suggesting that Arg221 indeed contributes to Bri2 BRICHOS oligomerization. After proteolytic release of the NT*tag, isolated rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E oligomers are partially linked by intersubunit disulfide bonds, and the dimers are disulfide dependent. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) confirmed the quaternary structure of rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E monomers isolated by SEC. The mass determined by ESI-MS, 14050.2 Da, is in perfect agreement with the calculated mass, 14050.1 Da, of a monomer in which the two conserved Cys form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed that the overall secondary structure of monomeric rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E is similar to wt monomers. In association with formation of oligomers, the negative CD peak around 205-210 nm shifts to the right, indicative of structural stabilisation which is comparable to the pattern observed for rh wt Bri2 BRICHOS. Isolated rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E monomers, dimers and oligomers bind bis-ANS, evidenced by a marked increase in fluorescence emission intensity compared with free bis-ANS, and a blue shift of the emission maximum from about 533 nm to 480-490 nm. This shows that all rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E species expose hydrophobic surfaces, which is similar to the situation for the wt species. The abilities of different assembly states of rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E to prevent non-fibrillar protein aggregation were assessed against thermo-denatured citrate synthase (CS). The dimers and monomers were comparatively inefficient in suppressing CS aggregation, while the oligomers efficiently reduce aggregation of CS, like the case for wt species.

The final ThT fluorescence intensity, which is an indicator of the mass of mature fibrils, shows a linear increase against A&#x3b2;42 concentration, and does not change significantly in the presence of different concentrations of rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E species.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0144">A&#x3b2;42 fibrillization kinetics are described by a set of microscopic rate constants, i.e. for primary (k<sub>n</sub>) and secondary (monomer-dependent k<sub>2 </sub>and monomer-independent k<sub>&#x2212;</sub>) nucleation as well as elongation (k<sub>+</sub>). To identify microscopic processes in the fibrillization pathways of A&#x3b2;42 that are most affected by different rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E species, we determined the combined rate constants &#x221a;(k<sub>n</sub>k<sub>+</sub>) for primary and &#x221a;(k<sub>+</sub>k<sub>2</sub>) for secondary nucleation events, respectively. We fitted the kinetic model globally at different A&#x3b2;42 concentrations and a constant rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E concentration, where &#x221a;(k<sub>n</sub>k<sub>+</sub>) and &#x221a;(k<sub>+</sub>k<sub>2</sub>) are constrained to the same value across all concentrations. We found that the fitting parameter &#x221a;(k<sub>n</sub>k<sub>+</sub>) is similar in the presence of either rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E species as for A&#x3b2;42 alone, suggesting that mainly secondary pathways are modulated by rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E. The results also show that the rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E dimer is more efficient than the monomer in inhibiting nucleation events related to k<sub>+</sub>k<sub>2</sub>, i.e. fibril elongation or/and secondary nucleation. To quantitatively elucidate the effects of rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E on A&#x3b2;42 fibrillization, we subsequently fitted the kinetic model individually to a dataset obtained with a constant A&#x3b2;42 concentration and different rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E concentrations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-C</figref>). The analysis revealed that &#x221a;(k<sub>+</sub>k<sub>2</sub>) was changed significantly by rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E while &#x221a;(k<sub>n</sub>k<sub>+</sub>) was not (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>,B, insets), again suggesting that the secondary nucleation is the main pathway affected. The individual fitting also showed that the dimers are more potent in reducing &#x221a;(k<sub>+</sub>k<sub>2</sub>) than the monomer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>,B, insets).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0145">Perturbations of the individual microscopic rate constants k<sub>+</sub>, k<sub>n </sub>and k<sub>2 </sub>are most relevant since their relative contributions determine the number of newly formed nucleation units, which might be linked to the generation of neurotoxic A&#x3b2;42 oligomeric species. To evaluate the effects on individual microscopic processes, we performed global fits of the kinetic data set at constant A&#x3b2;42 and different rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E concentrations, where the fits were constrained such that only one single rate constant, i.e. k<sub>n</sub>, k<sub>+</sub> or k<sub>2</sub>, is the fitting parameter. The primary nucleation rate k<sub>n </sub>or elongation k<sub>+</sub> as the sole fitting parameter gave rise to insufficient fits for both rh Bri2 BRICHOS species, which is further confirmed by NMR data showing that neither monomers nor dimers of rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E interact with A&#x3b2;40 monomers. With k<sub>2 </sub>as the sole free fitting parameter the kinetics were adequately described for rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E monomers, but not for the dimers. We conclude hence that the rh Bri2 R221E monomer mainly inhibits the secondary nucleation during A&#x3b2;42 fibril formation.

Under these conditions the fibrillization traces typically follow a concave aggregation behaviour (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>,E), where the initial slope is directly proportional to the elongation rate k<sub>+</sub>. These seeding experiments revealed that the rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E dimer significantly decreases the elongation rate in a dose dependent manner, and already at low concentrations fibril-end elongation is noticeably retarded (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>,F). The rh Bri2 R221E monomer, in contrast, showed only slight effects on fibril-end elongation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>,F). This shows that both rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E species reduce A&#x3b2;42 fibrillization via effects on surface catalysed secondary nucleation, while fibril-end elongation is only substantially affected by the rh Bri2 BRICHOS dimers.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0147">The different effects implicate that monomers and dimers associate differently to the fibril ends. To study this, we used anti-Bri2 BRICHOS immunogold-staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Further, the numbers of rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E dimers that bind to A&#x3b2;42 fibril ends are significantly higher than for monomers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>), which corroborates the results from kinetic analyses that predominantly the dimer modulates fibril-end elongation.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="2">Bri2 BRICHOS R221E Monomers Efficiently Prevent A&#x3b2;42 Neurotoxicity</heading><p id="p-0162" num="0148">Relative inhibition of A&#x3b2;42 secondary nucleation and elongation may be linked to reduction of formation of toxic low-molecular weight species, as the number of new nucleation units is decreased by inhibiting secondary nucleation but increased by inhibiting elongation.

We therefore pair-wise correlated plaque load (A&#x3b2; immunostaining), amyloid plaque count (Thioflavin S staining), astrogliosis (GFAP immunostaining), microgliosis (Iba1 immunostaining), and colocalization (A&#x3b2; and GFAP immunostaining) in cortex and hippocampus for mice in the PBS treated control group and in the rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E treated group, respectively.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0168">In both PBS and rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E treated mice, GFAP and Iba1 staining correlate positively in cortex and hippocampus (based on data presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). This is expected since both these markers report on insults to the central nervous system and supports that relevant correlations can be found in our study in spite of the relatively few mice used. This observation also shows that rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E treatment does not generally suppress correlations compared to PBS controls (see further below). In PBS treated mice, the area of A&#x3b2; positive plaques (plaque load) tends to correlate positively with GFAP and Iba1 staining, as well as with A&#x3b2; and GFAP colocalization, in particular in cortex (based on data presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>B-C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>).

Further, rh Bri2 BRICHOS blocks A&#x3b2;42 induced reduction of &#x3b3; oscillations in hippocampal slices ex vivo and has emerged as a model compound in molecular studies of A&#x3b2;42 fibrillation. In order to investigate whether the treatment effects now observed after rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E administration in vivo can be mediated by the molecular mechanisms determined for BRICHOS in vitro, we asked if there is a quantitative agreement between the degrees of reduction of generation of A&#x3b2;42 oligomers, in terms of attenuation of new nucleation units, and reduction of A&#x3b2;42 induced deterioration of &#x3b3; oscillations by rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E measured in vitro and ex vivo, respectively, and the effects seen here in App<sup>NL-F </sup>mice.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0171">To this end, we estimated the amounts of rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E in the brains of the treated App<sup>NL-F </sup>mice from the extent of BBB passage of wildtype rh Bri2 BRICHOS measured in wildtype mice [Tambaro et al., J Biol Chem. 294, 2606-2615 (2019)] and used the measured levels of A&#x3b2;42 in App<sup>NL-F </sup>brain homogenates to determine the potential in vivo rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E/A&#x3b2;42 ratio. We then estimated, using previously published data [Chen et al., Nat. Commun. 8, 2081, (2017); Chen, et al. Commun Biol. 3, 32 (2020)], what degrees of reduction of nucleation unit generation in vitro and lowering of A&#x3b2;42 induced effects on &#x3b3; oscillations in hippocampal slices ex vivo, respectively, this rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E/A&#x3b2;42 ratio corresponds to. Remarkably, the predicted reduction of oligomer generation in vitro and lowering of A&#x3b2;42 mediated neurotoxicity ex vivo that correspond to the estimated in vivo rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E/A&#x3b2;42 ratio agree well with the reductions of A&#x3b2; positive and Thioflavin S positive plaques, GFAP staining, Iba1 levels in cortex by western blots, as well as increased physical activity observed in App<sup>NL-F </sup>mice after rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E. For the degree of colocalization of A&#x3b2; and GFAP staining as well as Iba1 staining, the reductions in vivo are seemingly more pronounced than expected from the in vitro data, which possibly is related to that amplifying cascades are involved in astroglial and microglial activation in vivo.</p><heading id="h-0034" level="1">CONCLUSIONS</heading><p id="p-0194" num="0172">Our results show that physical activity, A&#x3b2; plaque burden and astrocyte and microglia activation in App<sup>NL-F </sup>knock-in mice can be significantly improved by intravenous administration of rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0173">In particular, our results support that generation of new nucleation units by surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation pathways can cause toxic effects, as indicated by the A&#x3b2; induced astrocyte and microglia activation observed in App<sup>NL-F </sup>mice, and that intravenous treatment with rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E efficiently reduces neurotoxic pathways in vivo.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0174">Our observations support that intravenous treatment of App<sup>NL-F </sup>knock-in mice with rh Bri2 BRICHOS R221E affects both A&#x3b2; antibody and Thioflavin S positive plaques and results in reduced activation of astrocytes as well as microglia.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230002458A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230002458A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="8.13mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002458A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230002458A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="16.26mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002458A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
