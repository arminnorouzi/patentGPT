Current processes of electrically insulating these components include powder coating or the use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film coatings. While powder coating is a common process, it typically requires high temperatures and a longer cure time. Since batteries are not generally compatible with these high temperatures, powder coating is traditionally limited to non-battery hardware within the battery pack.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, battery cells (e.g., prismatic, pouch, and cylindrical battery cells) used inside electric vehicles are typically wrapped in PET film/tape for dielectric protection. Cooling plates utilized within battery boxes are also typically wrapped or laminated with PET or powder-coated for similar dielectric protection. Battery cells are also often bonded to one another and to the cooling plate with thermally conductive, electrically insulative adhesives/potting materials. It is desirable that these materials not debond to form a gap between the thermally conductive adhesive/potting material and the cell. When a gap forms, the potential for greater thermal impedance, and, therefore, thermal runaway exists.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">More particularly, PET films for use in insulating battery cells can include a PET layer and a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) layer. In battery packs, the PSA layer can be in contact with a battery cell wall/substrate (e.g., aluminum, steel, a composite, etc.) of one battery cell and the PET layer can be in contact with a thermal management adhesive/potting material, which can itself be positioned directly adjacent to the PET layer of a second PET film coated battery cell. The use of PET films to insulate battery cells can involve semi-manual installation and can result in poor adhesion at high temperatures/humidity. Additionally, the low surface energy of PET makes it difficult to bond reliably. Conventionally, adhesive and potting material manufacturers try to enhance their adhesives to bond better to PET-wrapped cells. However, automobiles are subject to a number of shock events (e.g., potholes, speed bumps, accidents, etc.), and thus have numerous opportunities for poorly bonded battery cell components to debond and remove heat from the system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is an ongoing need for additional dielectric coatings that can be used for coating/insulating battery cells and battery pack components, particularly those that can also make the manufacturing/assembly process faster and/or simpler.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This summary lists several embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, and in many cases lists variations and permutations of these embodiments.

Thus, in some embodiments, the filler comprises or consists of untreated hydrophilic fumed silica, treated hydrophobic silica, and/or nepheline syenite.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The curable coating can be coated on a substrate of interest (e.g., a surface of a metal or composite substrate) using any suitable technique, e.g., spray coating, roll-coating or dip coating. In some embodiments, the curable coating is coated on a substrate using spray coating. In some embodiments, the curable coating can be coated on a substrate to a thickness of about 25 microns to about 200 microns (e.g., about 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 130, 140, 150, 175, or about 200 microns).

Curing of the curable coating can be performed by exposing the curable coating to UV or visible radiation. In some embodiments the curable coating is exposed to UV radiation using a mercury lamp (e.g., using 1500 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>of energy).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the curable coating is a 100% solids coating, which as used herein, refers to a coating that has essentially the same thickness before curing as after coating. In some embodiments, the cured coating is free from pin-holes, bubbles and comprises good edge coverage to the substrate upon which it is coated, e.g., a battery pack component.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed curable coating cures to form a dielectric coating that electrically insulates the substrate to which it is applied, for example a component of a battery pack. Because the chemistry is UV-cured, it can be sprayed, roll-coated, dipped, and cured in a matter of seconds, thereby ensuring it is a cost-effective means of manufacturing battery cells which are commonly made in high volumes. Unlike PET films, which are adhered via a pressure sensitive adhesive tape, the present UV cured coating chemically bonds to the surface of the battery component, providing better adhesion and therefore reduced threat of thermal impedance, while providing similar or better dielectric properties. Additionally, the present coating provides for surrounding chemistries, such as those of thermal gap fillers, to bond to the UV-cured coating more robustly, also reducing or eliminating the risk of delamination and minimizing the threat of thermal impedance between the various layers of materials.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Thus, the UV curable coating of the presently disclosed subject matter has several advantages, particularly when used for insulating and protecting battery pack components. For example, the one-part (1K) 100% solids coating can be spray applied and provides good edge coverage for coated components, good adhesion after aging in wet conditions (85 C, 85% RH for 100, 250, 500, or 1000 hours). In some embodiments, the cured coating remains adhesive (e.g., has average Class <b>1</b> adhesion according to ISO 2409) after aging at 85&#xb0; C. and 85% relative humidity for up to 1000 hours. Additionally, the coatings of the embodiments of the present invention provide good voltage breakdown protection. In some embodiments, the cured coating has a breakdown voltage at about 100 microns thickness of about 5 kilovolts (kV) to about 10 kV. In some embodiments, the cured coating has a breakdown voltage at about 100 microns thickness of about 8 kV to about 10 kV.
