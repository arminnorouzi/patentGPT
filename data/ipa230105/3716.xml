BD has a global incidence of over 1% and 15% of the patients suicided due to absence of instant intervention. Therefore, BD is listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the diseases with top morbidity and loss of labor. By genome-wide association analysis, clinical studies have found a series of susceptibility genes for BD that have been thought to be involved in the inheritance and pathogenesis of BD. However, genetic animal models based on such susceptibility genes did not reveal the clinical characteristics of BD, especially the core symptoms of spontaneous alternating cycles of mania and depression. Therefore, a hypothesis has been raised those neuropsychiatric diseases including BD are polygenic genetic diseases, and a joint effort of genetic defects in multiple genes may contribute to the clinical symptoms of the disease. However, patients with a variety of different susceptibility genes can exhibit similar clinical behavioral symptoms as they share common biological defects. Finding and repairing such defects are keys to understanding the pathogenesis of BD and exploring clinical treatment of BD. Thus, identifying the defects of the critical molecular signaling pathways in BD patients is the most important task for biologists and medical professionals studying BD.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Clinical studies have identified several susceptibility genes that may be involved in the inheritance and pathogenesis of BD. For example, a mutant of the CLOCK gene, which was found in a group of BD patients, when expressing in mice, will lead to abnormal behaviors similar to human mania. However, these genes represent only a small fraction of the clinical cases; moreover, genetic animal models based on these genes did not exhibit the spontaneous emotional cycle of mania and depression, which is a core symptom in BD patients.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, further improvement is required for the research on bipolar disorder.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is intended to solving, at least in part, one of the technical problems in the related art. To this end, one purpose of the present invention is to propose use of synaptotagmin-7 (abbreviated as Syt7 in the diagnosing and treating of bipolar disorder.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inventor found that Syt7 gene expression in hippocampal neurons differentiated from the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of patients with bipolar disorder demonstrated significant defects; Syt7 gene-deleted mice exhibited spontaneous mania/depression cycling symptom of bipolar disorder; the transcription level of Syt7 mRNA in the plasma of patients with BD was significantly reduced as compared with that of a healthy control group; the Syt7 mRNA levels in blood cells were also reduced, similar to the measurements in plasma. Associated signaling pathway with the Syt7 gene and the expression product thereof are critical to the emotional cycle of bipolar disorder. Molecules targeting the signaling pathway associated with the Syt7 gene can facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Specifically, the present invention provides the following technical scheme:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a first aspect, the present invention provides a biomarker for bipolar disorder, comprising Syt7 gene and/or an expression product thereof.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a second aspect, the present invention provides use of Syt7 gene and/or an expression product thereof in preparing a medicament for treating bipolar disorder and/or a complication thereof. According to embodiments of the present invention, the expression product of the Syt7 gene can be used as a protein medicament. By administering a proper amount of the protein medicament to a patient with bipolar disorder or a complication thereof, the content of the Syt7 gene expression product in vivo may be elevated. As such, the Syt7 gene expression product can be used for treating bipolar disorder or the complication thereof.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to embodiments of the present invention, the medicament can increase the expression level of the Syt7 gene.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a third aspect, the present invention provides a bipolar disorder cell model, comprising a reduced amount of Syt7 gene and/or an expression product thereof as compared to a wild-type cell.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides a bipolar disorder animal model, comprising a reduced amount of Syt7 gene or an expression product thereof as compared to a wild-type animal. The expression of Syt7 gene is inhibited in the provided bipolar disorder model animal. According to embodiments of the present invention, the provided bipolar disorder model animal may be a mouse, wherein a C2A domain of the Syt7 gene is replaced with a neomycin gene fragment to achieve the purpose of inactivating the Syt7. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the inactivated Syt7 may also be obtained by substitution or knock-out of other active regions on the Syt7 gene when acquiring the bipolar disorder model animal. The common means may be gene recombination or CRISPR that is conventionally used in the art, and the model animal may be a mouse, a rat, or a non-human primate such as a monkey and the like.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to embodiments of the present invention, the animal includes at least one selected from a mouse, a rat and a primate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a fifth aspect, the present invention provides a method for screening a medicament for treating bipolar disorder, comprising: administering medicament candidates to the bipolar disorder cell model according to the third aspect of the present invention or the bipolar disorder animal model according to the fourth aspect of the present invention; selecting a medicament candidate causing an increase in an amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof, or selecting a medicament candidate causing alleviation in symptoms of bipolar disorder, as the medicament for treating bipolar disorder. By administering the medicament candidates to the bipolar disorder model animal and monitoring behaviors of the model animal, a medicament candidate is determined effective if symptoms of the bipolar disorder are alleviated or if Syt7 gene expression or Syt7 protein activity is elevated. According to embodiments of the present invention, the bipolar disorder model animal may be a mouse with inhibited Syt7 gene expression or inhibited Syt7 protein activity. The medicament candidates may also be administered to a non-human mammalian cell. A medicament candidate is determined effective if Syt7 gene expression level or Syt7 protein activity is up-regulated in the non-human mammal or cell.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a sixth aspect, the present invention provides a kit comprising a reagent specifically detecting Syt7 gene and/or an expression product thereof. The kit comprising the reagent specifically detecting the Syt7 gene and/or the expression product thereof can be used for real-time detection and monitoring of bipolar disorder. According to embodiments of the present invention, the reagent comprises a primer and/or a probe. The specific probe or primer can be used for detecting the expression level of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof. Certainly, other conventional reagents than primers and probes for gene or protein expression, such as a buffer for polymerase chain reaction, a solution for SDS-PAGE detection for detecting protein expression and the like, may be incorporated.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a seventh aspect, the present invention provides a system for diagnosing bipolar disorder or determining a prognostic outcome for bipolar disorder, comprising: an acquisition device for acquiring an amount of Syt7 gene or an expression product thereof in a biological sample; and a determination device connected with the acquisition device for diagnosing bipolar disorder or determining the prognostic outcome for bipolar disorder based on the amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in the biological sample.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to embodiments of the present invention, the determination device further comprises: the amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in the biological sample being lower than an amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in a normal sample, is an indication that the biological sample has bipolar disorder; or the amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in the biological sample being at least not lower than the amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in the normal sample, is an indication of good prognostic outcome in a patient with bipolar disorder.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an eighth aspect, the present invention provides a method for diagnosing bipolar disorder in a subject, comprising: detecting Syt7 gene and/or an expression product thereof in a biological sample from the subject.

As used herein, &#x201c;biomarker&#x201d; has a general meaning in the art, and refers to a biological molecule and/or a detectable portion thereof, which can be assessed qualitatively or quantitatively to acquire predictive or diagnostic information or the like. For example, the status of a subject with respect to a given disease or condition can be characterized by detecting the corresponding biomarker in the subject. The biomarker may be a gene, a protein, a polypeptide, or the like.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention further provides use of Syt7 gene and/or an expression product thereof in preparing a medicament for treating bipolar disorder and/or a complication thereof. According to embodiments of the present invention, the expression product of the Syt7 gene can be used as a protein medicament. By administering a proper amount of the protein medicament to a patient with bipolar disorder or a complication thereof, the content of the Syt7 gene expression product in vivo may be elevated. As such, the Syt7 gene expression product can be used for treating bipolar disorder or the complication thereof.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention further provides a method for diagnosing bipolar disorder in a subject, comprising: detecting Syt7 gene and/or an expression product thereof in a biological sample from the subject.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, reference to a subject or a patient is generally to a human, and may certainly include, as desired, non-human animals, preferably warm-blooded animals, more preferably viviparous animals, more preferably mammals, for example, non-human primates, rodents, canines, felines, equines, sheep, pigs, and the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another aspect, the present invention further provides a system for diagnosing bipolar disorder or determining a prognostic outcome for bipolar disorder, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, comprising: an acquisition device for acquiring an amount of Syt7 gene or an expression product thereof in a biological sample; and a determination device connected with the acquisition device for diagnosing bipolar disorder or determining the prognostic outcome for bipolar disorder based on the amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in the biological sample.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to embodiments of the present invention, the determination device further comprises: the amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in the biological sample being lower than an amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in a normal sample, is an indication that the biological sample has bipolar disorder; or the amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in the biological sample being at least not lower than the amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in the normal sample, is an indication of good prognostic outcome in a patient with bipolar disorder. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in the biological sample being at least lower than 0.5 folds, preferably 1-fold the amount of the Syt7 gene or the expression product thereof in a normal sample, is an indication that the biological sample has bipolar disorder.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein, a &#x201c;sample&#x201d; or &#x201c;biological sample&#x201d; may encompass any biological sample from a subject, including, but not limited to, whole blood, plasma, serum, red blood cells, white blood cells (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells), saliva, urine, stool (i.e., feces), tear, sweat, sebum, nipple aspirate, catheter lavage, tumor exudate, synovial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, lymphoid fluid, fine needle aspirate, amniotic fluid, any other body fluid, cell lysate, secretion of cells and inflammatory fluid, preferably, plasma, serum or cell pellet.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;bipolar disorder&#x201d; is previously known as bipolar disorder in the art. The described bipolar disorder includes bipolar disorder Type I (also referred to as BD-I), bipolar disorder Type II (also referred to as BD-II) and a mixed subtype. Preferably, the Syt7 gene and the expression product thereof can be used as the biomarker of bipolar disorder Type I, and for indicating the presence of bipolar disorder Type I and the prognostic outcome of the medication and the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this context, bipolar disorder Type I is typically characterized by severe mania and severe depression, i.e., similar severities of severe depression and severe mania. Bipolar disorder Type II is typically characterized by hypomania and severe depression, i.e., hypomania with a significantly lower severity than the depressive episode. The mixed subtype mainly refers to an episode during which symptoms of both mania and depression occur simultaneously, and is less common in clinical settings.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, reference to a complication of bipolar disorder is a disease that results from the development of bipolar disorder, and such a complication may manifest itself as an association with bipolar disorder or as a condition distinct from bipolar disorder, for example, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with bipolar disorder Type I, which is often accompanied by social fear, anxious (avoidant) personality disorders, rare psychotic symptoms and the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The scheme of the present invention will be explained with reference to the following examples.

Also considered was an important feature in BD patients that about 40% of BD patients have disorders of insulin/glucose metabolism (see Ruzickova M, Slaney C, Garnham J, &#x26; Alda M, (2003) Clinical Features of Bipolar Disorder with and without Comorbid Diabetes Mellitus, <i>Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, </i>48(7):458-461; Hajek T, McIntyre R, &#x26; Alda M, (2016) Bipolar Disorders, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and the Brain, <i>Current Opinion in Psychiatry, </i>29(1):1-6; and Wysokinski A, Strzelecki D, &#x26; Kloszewska I, (2015) Levels of Triglycerides, Cholesterol, LDL, HDL and Glucose in Patients with Schizophrenia, Unipolar Depression and Bipolar Disorder, <i>Diabetes </i>&#x26; <i>Metabolic Syndrome, </i>9(3):168-176). We supposed, considering that defects in key molecular pathways in the brain will lead to behavioral symptoms, that such defects present in the pancreatic islets may probably cause disorders of insulin metabolism, thereby causing complications of the two.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Based on the above hypothesis, the GeneCards database was searched for keywords insulin (diabetes) and synapse, and 97 genes were retrieved simultaneous participation in insulin metabolism and synaptic function. By searching the NCBI literature (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), 18 out of the 97 genes that may act in the two symptoms above were selected.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Using previously established iPSCs and corresponding differentiated neurons from 6 BD patients (see Mertens J, et al. (2015) Differential Responses to Lithium in Hyperexcitable Neurons from Patients with Bipolar Disorder, <i>Nature, </i>527(7576):95-99), 11 of the 18 genes in the iPSC-differentiated neurons from the patients exhibited more than 1.5-fold changes in mRNA expression levels by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR approaches (as shown in panels A and B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, wherein the change may be an increase or a decrease). Panel A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) result of the 18 candidate genes in hippocampal neurons differentiated from the iPSCs of the BD patients; panel B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the fluorescence-based quantitative RT-PCR result of the 18 candidate genes in hippocampal neurons differentiated from the iPSCs of the BD patients. In panels A and B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, HC denotes healthy controls (n=4), and BD-I denotes patients with bipolar I disorder (n=6); the two columns corresponding to each gene along the abscissa respectively denote data for health controls and BD-I patients.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The 11 genes in the DG region of the mice were knocked down using shRNA virus. The mice were subject to a forced swim test (FST), and the immobility time of the mice was analyzed. The immobility time is an indicator that reflects the feeling of despair of the mice, and a longer immobility time indicates a more serious feeling of despair. The result is shown in panel C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, panel C shows the results of immobility time of mice in FST test with the candidate genes being knocked-down (KD), wherein n=10 and a t-test was employed (Student's t-test; *P&#x3c;0.05; error bars , s.e.m.).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The results showed that the immobility time of the Syt7-knockdown mice was significantly reduced as compared to the wild-type group, and the knockdowns of other genes did not exhibit similar significant changes. Thus, it was presumed that Syt7 may be a possible candidate risk factor for behavioral abnormalities.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Syt7 Defect Inducing Fluctuating Behavioral Abnormalities in Mice</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">To systematically investigate the role of Syt7 in neuropsychiatric disorder-associated behaviors, the expression of Syt7 in BD patients was studied in two independent iPSC-differentiated neurons of different sources. Panels A and B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> show the expression of Syt7 in hippocampal neurons from patients with LR and NR in Mertens J, et al. (2015) Differential Responses to Lithium in Hyperexcitable Neurons from Patients with Bipolar Disorder, <i>Nature, </i>527(7576):95-99, wherein LR denotes iPSC-differentiated neurons responsive to lithium (lithium salt) and NR denotes iPSC-differentiated neurons non-responsive to lithium. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, panel C shows Syt7 expression in iPSC-differentiated hippocampal neurons described in Stern S, et al., (2017) Neurons Derived from Patients with Bipolar Disorder Divide into Intrinsically Different Sub-Populations of Neurons, Predicting the Patients' Responsiveness to Lithium, <i>Molecular Psychiatry. </i>The results showed that in the two neurons, comparisons with qRT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis detecting the difference from healthy controls demonstrated a reduction in Syt7 expression. This confirmed the presence of Syt7 in BD patients of different subpopulations.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The behaviors of Syt7 KO mice (i.e., Syt7-knockout mice) were then examined in the FST test. It is found that almost 30% of the Syt7 KO mice exhibited shorter immobility time (as the sustained mania results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) compared to littermate wild-type mice, whether in the night phase (ZT 12-24) or the day phase (ZT 0-12). Interestingly, over 60% of KO mice exhibited a fluctuating behavioral abnormality phenotype, i.e., a shorter immobility time in the night phase and a longer immobility time in the day phase (as the fluctuation results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Subsequent behavioral experiments focused on Syt7 KO mice exhibiting the circadian phenotype. In the tail suspension (TS) test, the immobility time of the mice was analyzed. The immobility time is an indicator that reflects the feeling of despair of the mice, and a longer immobility time indicates a more serious feeling of despair. The experimental results showed that the Syt7 KO mice exhibited a significantly shorter immobility time in the night phase and a longer immobility time in the day phase as compared to the wild-type, as shown in panel A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (in the figures, the gray background denotes the night phase, and the white background denotes the day phase, unless otherwise stated).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Considering that the FST/TS tests can not represent all the characterizations of human disease, a learned helplessness (LH) test and a sucrose preference test (SPT) were conducted. LH is associated with depression. In the LH test, the escape failure number of mice is an indicator for determining the depression of animal due to external pressure. A higher escape failure number indicates a more significant depression. SPT is associated with anhedonia. The proportion of sucrose preference of the mice can serve as an indicator for determining the anhedonia severity of the mice. A higher proportion of sweet preference indicates an enhancement in hedonic feeling. As shown in panels B and C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, Syt7 KO mice were more manic in the night phase (represented by less escape failures in the LH test) and demonstrated higher hedonic feeling in the SPT test compared to wild-type mice; in the day phase, Syt7 KO mice always exhibited the opposite behaviors.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Since BD patients often had clinical symptoms of anxiety, a light-dark box (LDB) test was conducted to observe anxiety-like behaviors in the Syt7 KO mice. The results showed that Syt7 KO mice exhibited reduced anxious behaviors in the night phase and enhanced anxiety in the day phase compared to the wild-type mice, as shown in panel D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Meanwhile, in order to confirm whether the behavioral abnormality in Syt7 KO mice is permanent or occurs only in a specific time period, the mice were monitored for 24 h in an open field experiment. As a result, it was found that Syt7 KO mice exhibited an increase in night phase activity but a decrease in day phase activity, which was in correspondence to the results obtained in the FST test and the tail suspension test. Importantly, the changes in activity of the Syt7 KO mice were persistent in the night phase and the day phase, indicating that the emotional abnormalities are persistent.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, since it was found in clinical studies that BD patients often showed symptoms of psychosis, the Syt7 KO mice were observed for psychosis-associated behaviors in a PPI (pre-pulse inhibition) test. The PPI test is a classic behavioral paradigm for determining psychosis in animals. In a PPI test, a lower PPI ratio indicates a more severe psychosis in mice. As shown in panel E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, Syt7 KO mice always showed a lower PPI ratio compared to the wild-type mice either in the night phase or the day phase, indicating a persistent psychotropic behavior in Syt7 KO mice irresponsive to light; furthermore, the Syt7 KO mice showed an audiogenic seizure-like reaction.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In summary, the results showed that the iPSC-differentiated neurons derived from patients with LR and NR have Syt7 defect; more importantly, the Syt7 KO mice exhibited behavioral abnormalities, and exhibited circadian characteristics are unique to the behavioral abnormal fluctuation for bipolar-associated behaviors.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLE 3</heading><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Mood Stabilizer Treating Syt7 KO Mice</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">To further determine the relationship between behavioral abnormalities and BD characterization in Syt7 KO mice, two drugs, olanzapine (OLZ) and lithium, for clinical and pre-clinical treatment of BD were used to treat Syt7 KO mice and the animal behaviors were observed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Syt7 KO mice were first treated with the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (OLZ) and observed for the dose dependence (administered with doses of 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg) (using ANOVA statistical method). As shown in panels A and B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a medium dose of olanzapine was sufficient for altering the behavioral abnormalities in the FST test (i.e., the shorter immobility time in the night phase was reversed) of the Syt7 KO mice in the treated groups as compared to the untreated group; furthermore, the high-dose olanzapine treatment extended the immobility time in the day phase. In addition, treatment with a low dose of olanzapine reduced the immobility time of Syt7 KO mice in the day phase, which was different from the result of the high dose group. Without being limited by theory, this may be associated with an antidepressant effect of olanzapine in treating BD patients.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, the LH/SPT/LDB behavioral paradigms were adopted for detecting the effect of high-dose olanzapine treatment (1.0 mg/kg) on abnormal behaviors of the Syt7 KO mice. As shown in panels A, B and C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, high-dose olanzapine treatment alleviated the depressive state of Syt7 KO mice either in the night phase or in the day phase, represented by the significantly increased number of escapes in the LH test, the reduced sucrose preference, and reduced time spent in the light compartment in the LDB test compared to KO mice in the untreated group. In addition, olanzapine treated WT mice showed similar results to the Syt7 KO mice.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The effect of clinical BD treatment lithium on behavioral abnormalities in Syt7 KO mice was then tested. In the FST test for immobility time, the treatment with 30 mg/kg of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>demonstrated no effect on WT and Syt7 KO mice, either in the night phase or in the day phase, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. However, in both LH and SPT tests, Li-treated WT and Syt7 mice showed improved antidepressant effects, i.e., increased escape numbers and decreased sucrose preference compared to the untreated control group, either in the night phase or in the day phase, as shown in panels B and C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Furthermore, in the LDB test, the Li treatment had no effect on WT, but altered the behaviors of Syt7 KO mice by reducing the time spent in the light compartment, either in the night phase or in the day phase, as shown in panel D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In summary, the results show that the clinical treatments for BD patients have significant efficacies on the behavioral abnormalities of the Syt7 KO mice.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">EXAMPLE 4</heading><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Diagnosis Based on Syt7 Expression in Plasma of BD Patients</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0060">To explore if the status of Syt7 in BD patients matches defects in iPSC-differentiated neurons, mRNA level in plasma of BD patients was analyzed. Samples from 20 patients with BD and 11 healthy controls (HCs) matched in age and sex were collected and the plasma was separated. The expression level of Syt7 mRNA in plasma was then analyzed by qRT-PCR. The results showed that Syt7 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the BD group compared to the HC group (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), indicating the presence of Syt7 defect in BD patients.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">BD patients were then grouped according to age, sex and severity of the pathological course. Overall, most BD patients showed a decreasing tendency in Syt7 mRNA levels compared to the HC group; it was also noted that the decrease in Syt7 mRNA levels was insignificant in patients aged over 30. Despite the small sample size, the results still suggested that the defect of Syt7 may be more significant in young adults. BD patients were further stratified by type, family BD history, previous treatment and presence of psychosis and analyzed. It was found that the plasma Syt7 mRNA level was significantly reduced in both BD-I and BD-II patients compared to the HC group (as shown in panel A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, the decrease in Syt7 mRNA level was significant in patients without psychosis and family BD history compared to the HC group, whereas those with symptoms of psychosis or family BD history had a decreasing tendency in Syt7 mRNA (as shown in panels B and C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). It should be noted that patients in the previously untreated group showed a significant decrease in Syt7 mRNA levels despite the small sample size; the previously treated group showed a recovered but still reduced Syt7 mRNA level compared to HC group (as shown in panel D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The above experimental results showed that the Syt7 signaling pathway plays a key role in the mood cycling of BD, and developing a diagnostic or treatment method targeting Syt7 upstream and downstream signaling molecules will bring prospect to diagnosis and treatment of BD.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition, the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; are used herein for descriptive purposes only and should not be construed as indicating or implying relative importance or to implicitly indicate the number of technical features described.
