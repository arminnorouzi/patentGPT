No. 17/232,228, filed Apr. 16, 2021, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/011,422, filed Apr. 17, 2020, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Refuse vehicles are often used to pick up and remove waste from customers' property. To promote efficiency, refuse vehicles typically operate on scheduled waste removal days, where each vehicle can collect waste from several locations along a route. Customers position waste containers in some predetermined and accessible location on their property (or onto the nearby street or sidewalk) so that the contents of the waste containers can be readily transferred into the refuse vehicle. Refuse vehicles often have a lifting mechanism to engage and raise the waste container off the ground surface, to a position where the waste container is inverted or angled downward toward an on-board waste receptacle. Aided by gravity, waste falls out of the waste container into the on-board receptacle. The lifting mechanism then lowers the waste container back to the ground surface below. Significant amounts of time can be spent trying to align the waste container relative to the lifting mechanism for waste removal.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One embodiment relates to a refuse vehicle. The refuse vehicle includes a chassis, a vehicle body supported by the chassis, a lift assembly, and a projector. The vehicle body defines a receptacle for storing refuse. The lift assembly is configured to selectively engage a waste container. The lift assembly is movable between a first position and a second position. The projector is positioned to emit light outwardly away from the refuse vehicle and proximate the lift assembly to define a target area.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another embodiment relates to a refuse vehicle. The refuse vehicle includes a chassis, a body coupled to the chassis, a lift assembly coupled to at least one of the body or the chassis, and a refuse container detection system. The body defines a receptacle for storing refuse. The lift assembly is coupled to at least one of the body or the chassis. The refuse container detection system is configured to facilitate detecting when a refuse container is positioned within a target area for engagement by the lift assembly. The refuse container detection system includes a projector emitting light outward from one of (i) the body or (ii) a carry can coupled to the lift assembly. The emitted light from the projector defines a boundary of the target area with light.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Still another embodiment relates to a refuse vehicle. The refuse vehicle includes a chassis, a vehicle body supported by the chassis, a lift assembly, a projector, a camera, and a display. The vehicle body defines a receptacle for storing refuse. The lift assembly is configured to selectively engage a waste container. The lift assembly is movable between a first position and a second position. The projector is positioned to emit light outwardly away from the refuse vehicle and proximate the lift assembly. The light defines a target area. The camera is positioned to monitor a field of view outward from the refuse vehicle. The camera is configured to detect the light emitted by the projector. The field of view includes the target area. The display is positioned within the vehicle body and in communication with the camera.

It should also be understood that the terminology is for the purpose of description only and should not be regarded as limiting.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to the FIGURES generally, the various exemplary embodiments disclosed herein relate to refuse vehicles and methods of operating and controlling refuse vehicles. Because residences are typically provided with standardized waste containers (often referred to as &#x201c;toters&#x201d;) to store waste (e.g., rubbish, recyclables), refuse vehicles are likewise designed with a lifting system that is adapted to engage, lift, and empty material from within the standardized waste container into an on-board receptacle on the refuse vehicle. Because the lift system may have limited lateral mobility relative to refuse vehicle, the waste container should be properly positioned relative to the lifting system before engagement. Operators using traditional refuse vehicles lose time maneuvering the refuse vehicle relative to the waste container or vice versa by either visually attempting to align the refuse vehicle relative to the waste container (often with an imperfect line of sight) or by exiting the cab of the refuse vehicle to physically adjust the position of the waste container relative to the refuse vehicle so that the lifting system can properly engage the waste container. The time, money, and efficiency lost by improperly positioning the refuse vehicle relative to waste containers is avoided by the refuse vehicles according to the disclosure by incorporating different types of vehicle positioning systems.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The refuse vehicles shown in the FIGURES are equipped with a projector (e.g., lighting assembly) that emits light downwardly and outwardly away from the refuse vehicle. The emitted light defines a target area or target zone that corresponds to a range of locations relative to the lifting system of the refuse vehicle where a waste container should be placed before engagement. If the waste container is positioned within the target area, the lifting system on the refuse vehicle can theoretically engage, lift, and empty the waste container without needing additional relative movement (e.g., lateral movement, fore-aft movement) between the refuse vehicle and the waste container. The light emitted from the projector can be visible light (e.g., within the visible spectrum) so that an operator can readily see the target area from within the cab of the refuse vehicle and can stop the refuse vehicle when a waste container is visually confirmed to be positioned within the target area. In some examples, the cab of the refuse vehicle can be equipped with a display that presents visual data from a camera positioned proximate the projector. The camera monitors a field of view, which includes the target area, and presents the data received from the camera onto the display. Using the display, the operator within the cab of the refuse vehicle can reposition the refuse vehicle until the display shows the waste container is present within the target area. Once the waste container is positioned within the target area, the operator can initiate a collection sequence by moving the lifting system to engage and lift the waste container so that the contents can be emptied into the on-board receptacle. By removing the guesswork and subsequent correction normally involved in aligning the refuse vehicle relative to the waste container, the process of collecting waste during a route is streamlined. Significant cost savings are realized by maximizing the amount of time that an operator spends within the cab of the refuse vehicle and limiting time spent outside the cab moving waste containers. Both goals are accomplished by the vehicle positioning systems disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a refuse vehicle <b>20</b> is adapted for retrieving and hauling refuse from waste containers. The refuse vehicle <b>20</b> can be a side loader, front end loader, or rear end loader, for example, that is arranged to lift and transfer contents of a waste container into an on-board receptacle <b>22</b>. The refuse vehicle <b>20</b> has a vehicle chassis <b>24</b> that generally supports wheels <b>26</b>, a vehicle body <b>28</b>, and the receptacle <b>22</b>. The vehicle body <b>28</b> can include a cab <b>30</b> and a motor housing <b>32</b> that receives a prime mover, shown as a motor <b>34</b>. The motor <b>34</b> can be an electric motor, an internal combustion engine, hybrid engine, or other suitable rotational power producing device. The motor <b>34</b> produces rotational power that is transmitted to the wheels <b>26</b> to drive the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The on-board receptacle <b>22</b> is sized to receive the contents of multiple waste containers so that the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> can execute an extended route that may include several stops. Upon arriving at each site, a lifting system <b>36</b> (e.g., a hydraulic arm assembly, can tipper assembly, grabber arm assembly) can engage and raise a waste container until it is inverted or angled downward toward the on-board receptacle <b>22</b>. The waste container can then be lowered to the ground and disengaged from the lifting system <b>36</b> so that the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> can drive to another location along its route and repeat the waste removal process.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, the lifting system <b>36</b> includes an arm <b>38</b> coupled to the vehicle body <b>28</b> and/or chassis <b>24</b>. The arm <b>38</b> has a selectively movable jaw assembly <b>40</b> extending outwardly away from a distal end of the arm <b>38</b>. The arm <b>38</b> moves laterally away from the vehicle body <b>28</b> to approach a waste container (e.g., the waste container <b>100</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). When the arm <b>38</b> and jaw assembly <b>40</b> reach a position proximate the waste container, an operator can prompt the jaws <b>42</b> of the jaw assembly <b>40</b> to close around the waste container <b>100</b>. Closing the jaws <b>42</b> around the waste container <b>100</b> engages the waste container <b>100</b> so that the arm <b>38</b> and lifting system <b>36</b>, more generally, can manipulate the waste container <b>100</b> to collect waste positioned within the waste container <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once the waste container <b>100</b> is secured within the jaws <b>42</b> of the jaw assembly <b>40</b>, the waste container <b>100</b> can be raised off the ground surface, toward the on-board receptacle <b>22</b>. In some examples, the arm <b>38</b> includes an elevator track <b>44</b> to facilitate the waste container lifting process. The jaw assembly <b>40</b> is coupled to the elevator track <b>44</b>, which defines a pathway for the jaw assembly <b>40</b> to travel relative to the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> and on-board receptacle <b>22</b>. Once the jaw assembly <b>40</b> has secured the waste container <b>100</b> and the arm <b>38</b> has retracted inward, to its stowed position relative to the vehicle body <b>28</b>, the jaw assembly <b>40</b> and waste container <b>100</b> can be lifted. In some examples, the jaw assembly <b>40</b> includes a carriage assembly <b>46</b> that interfaces with the elevator track <b>44</b>. The carriage assembly <b>46</b> includes a motor <b>48</b> that can activate to drive one or more wheels or gears (not shown) to initiate upward movement of the jaw assembly <b>40</b> and waste container <b>100</b> relative to the elevator track <b>44</b>. The wheels or gears of the carriage assembly <b>46</b> interface with steps <b>50</b> spaced along the elevator track <b>44</b>. The steps <b>50</b> can be formed as a series of undulating peaks and valleys that mesh with the wheels or gears of the carriage assembly <b>46</b>, so that the elevator track <b>44</b> and carriage assembly <b>46</b> are arranged in a rack-and-pinion style arrangement.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The elevator track <b>44</b> includes a lifting segment <b>52</b> and a dumping segment <b>54</b>. The lifting segment <b>52</b> extends upwardly and approximately perpendicular to the ground surface below the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>. The dumping segment <b>54</b> curves away from the lifting segment <b>52</b>, toward the on-board receptacle <b>22</b>. The dumping segment <b>54</b> can be defined by an arc of approximately 180 degrees, and is designed to invert the jaw assembly <b>40</b> and waste container <b>100</b> secured within the jaw assembly <b>40</b> above the on-board receptacle <b>22</b>. As the carriage assembly <b>46</b>, jaw assembly <b>40</b>, and waste container <b>100</b> travel upward along the lifting segment <b>52</b>, the waste container <b>100</b> remains substantially upright (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>), which may prevent or inhibit waste received within the waste container <b>100</b> from falling out prematurely. As the carriage assembly <b>46</b> traverses the dumping segment <b>54</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>), the carriage assembly <b>46</b> initially travels upwardly and laterally, and turns inward toward the vehicle body <b>28</b> and on-board receptacle <b>22</b>. The rotation of the carriage assembly <b>46</b> caused by the arcing elevator track <b>44</b> within the dumping segment <b>54</b> rotates the carriage assembly <b>46</b> and, as a result, the waste container <b>100</b> received within the jaw assembly <b>40</b>. As the carriage assembly <b>46</b> continues along the dumping segment <b>54</b> of the elevator track <b>44</b>, the carriage assembly <b>46</b> continues to rotate until the carriage assembly <b>46</b> and waste container <b>100</b> within the jaw assembly <b>40</b> are facing and traveling downward toward the on-board receptacle <b>22</b>. With the open end of the waste container <b>100</b> now facing downward and into the on-board receptacle <b>22</b>, gravity causes a lid of the waste container <b>100</b> to open and the contents of the waste container <b>100</b> to fall out, into the on-board receptacle <b>22</b> below. Once the contents of the waste container <b>100</b> have been emptied and collected, the motor <b>48</b> on the carriage assembly <b>46</b> can reverse direction and move the carriage assembly backwards through the dumping segment <b>54</b> and downward along the lifting segment <b>52</b>, until the waste container <b>100</b> is once again positioned on the ground below (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). The jaw assembly <b>40</b> can disengage from the waste container <b>100</b> and repeat a similar process with another waste container positioned along a route.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The lifting system <b>36</b> has limited lateral mobility to engage and secure waste containers <b>100</b>, which may create delay in the waste collection process if the arm <b>38</b> and jaw assembly <b>40</b> are not properly aligned relative to a waste container <b>100</b> that should be emptied. When open, the jaws <b>42</b> may be spread apart from one another by a distance that corresponds to about 3 or 4 times the width defining a standard-sized waste container <b>100</b>. For example, the jaws <b>42</b> can be spread apart by a distance of about 3 meters in the open position. If a waste container <b>100</b> is positioned partially or entirely outside of the two jaws <b>42</b>, the jaws <b>42</b> may not be able to engage the waste container <b>100</b> without first moving one of the waste container or the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> to adjust the position of the lifting system <b>36</b> and, as a result, the jaws <b>42</b> relative to the waste container <b>100</b>. Once a waste container <b>100</b> is positioned laterally between the jaws <b>42</b>, the arm <b>38</b> and jaw assembly <b>40</b> can extend outward, toward the waste container <b>100</b>. Once the arm <b>38</b> and jaw assembly <b>40</b> are within a predetermined range from the waste container <b>100</b> (e.g., 0.25 meters, 1 meter, etc.), the jaws <b>42</b> can be closed around the waste container <b>100</b>. As the jaws <b>42</b> transition to a closed position, the jaws <b>42</b> at least partially surround and engage the waste container <b>100</b> so that the lifting and emptying process can be performed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The refuse vehicle <b>20</b> streamlines the refuse collection process by providing significantly better visual cues to identify if and when a waste container <b>100</b> is positioned within a target zone or area, which corresponds to the range of locations positioned laterally between the jaws <b>42</b>. The visual cues help an operator know with certainty that a waste container <b>100</b> is positioned laterally between the jaws <b>42</b> of the lifting system <b>36</b> and, as a result, able to be engaged and emptied by the lifting system <b>36</b> without any additional relative movement (e.g., forward or backward vehicle travel) between the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> and the waste container <b>100</b>. The visual cues provided by the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> allow an operator to more efficiently execute the waste collection process from a waste container <b>100</b> along a route without leaving the cab <b>30</b> of the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>. The visual cues also prevent mistakes from operators outside the cab <b>30</b>, which can properly position waste containers relative to the lifting system <b>36</b> using the visual cues provided by the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>. Similarly, the visual cues can be used to alert operators where the range of the lifting system <b>36</b> is positioned, and can allow operators to move outwardly away from the lifting system <b>36</b> to avoid unwanted contact.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> includes a projector <b>60</b>. The projector <b>60</b> can include one or more lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to generate light. In some examples, lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are positioned on opposite sides of the elevator track <b>44</b> and the lifting system <b>36</b>. The lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are each arranged to emit light downward and outward toward the ground below and outward from the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>. The lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> can include one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs) or lamps, for example, that generate visible light (i.e., light within the visible spectrum, having a wavelength between about 400 nm and 700 nm). In some examples, the lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are configured to emit light outside of the visible spectrum (e.g., infrared light, ultraviolet light) onto the ground surface below and outward from the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The light emitted by the projector <b>60</b> defines a target area <b>70</b> below and outward from the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>. The target area <b>70</b> can be configured to correspond directly to the lateral distance or area between the two jaws <b>42</b> of the jaw assembly <b>40</b>. Accordingly, the target area <b>70</b> corresponds to a range of locations in which, if a waste container <b>100</b> is positioned, the jaw assembly <b>40</b> will be able to properly engage the waste container <b>100</b> without requiring additional movement between the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> and the waste container <b>100</b>. Stated otherwise, if the waste container <b>100</b> is positioned within the target area <b>70</b> defined by the projector <b>60</b>, the lifting system <b>36</b> can engage the waste container <b>100</b> and collect waste from the waste container <b>100</b> without requiring the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> to drive in any direction.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The target area <b>70</b> generated by the projector <b>60</b> can be visible both externally and internally. By projecting the target area <b>70</b> in visible light, operators outside the refuse vehicle can easily identify the location in which the refuse containers <b>100</b> should be positioned for the lifting system <b>36</b> to successfully complete the waste collection process, while also being able to recognize areas to avoid standing while the lifting system <b>36</b> is operating. Simultaneously, the target area <b>70</b> can be seen from within the cab <b>30</b> of the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>. As demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the cab <b>30</b> of the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> can include a control system <b>72</b> including a series of inputs, along with a display <b>74</b>. The display <b>74</b> is in communication with one or more cameras <b>76</b> positioned along the vehicle body <b>28</b> of the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>. The cameras <b>76</b> each have a field of view extending outwardly away from the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>. The cameras <b>76</b> are arranged so that their respective field of view overlaps with and includes the target area <b>70</b>. Media (i.e., images or video) monitored and collected by the cameras <b>76</b> is provided to a processing unit <b>78</b> within the control system <b>72</b>, which subsequently provides the media to the display <b>74</b> so that the media can be presented and viewed within the cab <b>30</b>. By presenting the media on the display <b>74</b>, an operator can view the target area <b>70</b> and waste container <b>100</b> simultaneously. Accordingly, the operator can verify whether the waste container <b>100</b> is present within the target area <b>70</b>. If the waste container <b>100</b> is not positioned within the target area <b>70</b>, the operator can use the display to determine which direction to drive the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> so that the waste container <b>100</b> will be positioned within the target area <b>70</b>. Once the waste container <b>100</b> is verified to be present within the target area <b>70</b>, the operator can initiate the waste collection process (e.g., using inputs within the control system <b>70</b>) described above. In instances where the projector <b>60</b> emits light outside the visible spectrum, the cameras <b>76</b> are configured to detect and capture the light emitted from the projector <b>60</b> so that the target area <b>70</b> is visible on the display <b>74</b> but invisible to the naked eye externally from the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The target area <b>70</b> generated by the projector <b>60</b> can take on a variety of different formats. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref> and with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the projector <b>60</b> can produce a rectangular target area <b>70</b>. The lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> straddling the lifting system <b>36</b> emit light having different wavelengths (e.g., yellow, green, red) depending upon a detected location of the waste container <b>100</b> relative to the target area <b>70</b>. A sensor <b>80</b> (which can also be a camera or imaging device) positioned along the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> can continuously monitor the target area for obstacles, such as waste containers <b>100</b>, present within the target area <b>70</b>. The sensor <b>80</b> can be in communication with the processing unit <b>78</b> and an image analyzer <b>81</b>, for example, which analyzes data taken by the sensor and determines whether and where a waste container <b>100</b> is located relative to the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> initially approaches a waste container <b>100</b>, the waste container <b>100</b> may be positioned partially or entirely outside of the target area <b>70</b> generated by the projector <b>60</b>. If the sensor <b>80</b> detects that a waste container <b>100</b> is present within a sensor field of view but outside of the target area <b>70</b> generated by the projector <b>60</b>, the sensor <b>80</b> can relay a signal to the processing unit <b>78</b>. Upon receiving a signal that a waste container <b>100</b> is present within the sensor field of view but at least partially outside the target area <b>70</b>, the processing unit can prompt the projector <b>60</b> to adjust a parameter of the light being emitted. For example, and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the processing unit <b>78</b> can control the projector <b>60</b> to emit a red light. The red light can provide a visual cue to the operator that the waste collection process for the waste container <b>100</b> is not yet ready to be initiated because the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> is not properly aligned relative to the waste container <b>100</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the processing unit <b>78</b> can control the projector <b>60</b> to pulse or otherwise modulate the light emitted from the projector <b>60</b> when the waste container <b>100</b> is detected to be outside the target area <b>70</b>. Audio alarms can be generated by the processing unit <b>78</b> to further inform the operator within the cab <b>30</b> not to initiate the lifting system <b>36</b> to attempt to engage the waste container <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The audio and visual cues provided to the operator can communicate both a direction and magnitude that the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> should be moved in order to properly position the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> relative to the waste container <b>100</b> for waste removal. Using the display <b>74</b> within the cab <b>30</b>, the operator can continuously monitor the position of the waste container <b>100</b> relative to the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> as the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> drives. When the sensor <b>80</b> detects that the waste container <b>100</b> is present within the target area <b>70</b> but positioned off-centered from the lifting system <b>36</b>, the sensor <b>80</b> can once again convey a signal to the processing unit <b>78</b>. The processing unit <b>78</b> can once again control the projector <b>60</b> to adjust a parameter of the emitted light. For example, the projector <b>60</b> can be controlled to emit yellow light when the waste container <b>100</b> is detected within the target area <b>70</b> but within a less preferred region (e.g., near a boundary of the target area <b>70</b>), as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Upon receiving visual confirmation that the waste container <b>100</b> is present within the target area <b>70</b>, the operator can initiate a waste removal procedure similar to that described above. Alternatively, the operator can continue to move the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> relative to the waste container <b>100</b>. Once the sensor <b>80</b> detects the waste container is present within a preferred region of the target area <b>70</b> (e.g., centered), the sensor <b>80</b> can pass along a signal to the processing unit <b>78</b> indicating the same. The processing unit <b>78</b> can then control the projector <b>60</b> to once again adjust a parameter of the light being emitted. For example, and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the projector can emit a green light to indicate that the waste container <b>100</b> is positioned in a desired location within the target area <b>70</b> and is ready to be engaged by the lifting system <b>36</b>. With this visual confirmation, the operator can initiate the waste collection process from within the cab <b>30</b>. Alternatively, the waste collection process can be initiated automatically when the processing unit <b>78</b> detects that a parking or service brake of the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> is engaged and a waste container <b>100</b> is detected within the target area <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In other examples and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, the projector <b>60</b> emits only the boundaries of the target area <b>70</b>. For example, each of the lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are arranged to emit light in a generally straight line downwardly and outwardly from the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>. The generally straight lines emitted by the lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> can collectively define the lateral boundaries of the target area <b>70</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, for example, the lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, each emit a solid and continuous (or dashed) line. The lines emitted by the lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are once again visible to the operator either directly or via the display <b>74</b>, and can be used to move the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> relative to the waste container <b>100</b> until the operator can verify that the waste container <b>100</b> is present between both boundaries emitted by the lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and, accordingly, within the target area <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, the projector <b>60</b> can once again emit the boundaries of the target area <b>70</b> but can indicate whether an obstacle (e.g., a waste container <b>100</b>) is detected within the pathway of the boundary. If the sensor <b>80</b> detects an obstacle impeding the light emitted from one of the lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>, <b>10</b></figref>), the sensor <b>80</b> can relay a signal indicating the same to the processing unit <b>78</b>. The processing unit <b>78</b> can communicate with the projector <b>60</b> to adjust a parameter of the light being emitted. For example, the processing unit <b>78</b> can control the projector <b>60</b> to adjust a color of the light being emitted by the lighting assembly <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> associated with the location where an obstacle was detected. For example, the lighting assembly <b>62</b> can be adjusted to emit red light if an obstacle is impeding the light from the lighting assembly <b>62</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). The red light indicates that a waste container <b>100</b> is at least partially outside the target area <b>70</b> and not properly positioned for waste collection. If the light emitted from both lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the projector <b>60</b> is uninterrupted (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), the processing unit <b>78</b> can control the lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to each emit green light, which indicates to an operator that the waste collection process can be initiated, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Using the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> and projector <b>60</b> described above and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, a method of operating a refuse vehicle <b>200</b> can be performed. The method for operating the refuse vehicle <b>200</b> begins at block <b>202</b>, where the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> approaches a waste receptacle, such as the waste container <b>100</b>. When the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> is driving or operating in situations where waste collection is not being attempted (e.g., the refuse vehicle is traveling at speeds exceeding 20 mph, for example), the processing unit <b>78</b> may control the projector <b>60</b> to power down or otherwise cease from emitting light and/or the target area <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once the vehicle slows down to a threshold speed (e.g., below 20 mph or below 10 mph) and at block <b>204</b>, the processing unit <b>78</b> can initiate a command to the projector <b>60</b> to begin emitting a receptacle target zone or target area <b>70</b>. The target zone or target area <b>70</b> can take the form of any of the target areas <b>70</b> discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, for example.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At block <b>206</b>, the processing unit <b>78</b> and/or the operator determines whether a waste receptacle (e.g., the waste container <b>100</b>) is present within the target area <b>70</b>. The relative position of the waste receptacle relative to the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> can be monitored by any of the sensors <b>80</b> or cameras <b>76</b> (and the operator by way of the display <b>74</b>), for example. As explained above, the sensor <b>80</b> can monitor the location of the waste receptacle relative to the target area <b>70</b> and can communicate signals to the processing unit <b>78</b> indicating the detected relative position between the waste receptacle and the target area <b>70</b>. In response, the processing unit <b>78</b> can control the projector <b>60</b> to adjust parameters of the light emitted from the lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, for example, including light color or wavelength, as well as pulse frequency or duty cycle. If the processing unit <b>78</b> and operator determine that the waste receptacle is not present within the target area <b>70</b> generated by the projector <b>60</b>, the operator can move the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> at block <b>210</b> and return to step <b>206</b> until the waste receptacle is detected and visually confirmed to be within the target area <b>70</b>. In some examples, the processing unit <b>78</b> can automatically and/or autonomously adjust a position of the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> relative to the waste receptacle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the waste receptacle is detected to be wholly within the target area at step <b>206</b> (e.g., as shown within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), the lifting sequence can be initiated at block <b>208</b>. In some examples, the operator initiates and controls the lifting sequence from within the cab <b>30</b> using a joystick <b>82</b> or other buttons within the control system <b>72</b> to direct the lifting system <b>36</b>, arm <b>38</b>, and jaw assembly <b>40</b> outward toward the waste receptacle. In other examples, and as explained above, the processing unit <b>78</b> automatically initiates the lifting sequence and directs the lifting system <b>36</b>, arm <b>38</b>, and jaw assembly <b>40</b> outward toward the waste receptacle upon receiving a signal from the sensor <b>80</b> that the waste receptacle is present within the target area <b>70</b> and receiving an indication from a component within the control system <b>72</b> that a parking or service brake of the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> is engaged. The arm <b>38</b> and jaw assembly <b>40</b> can then extend outwardly away from the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>, toward the waste receptacle, until a detected distance between the jaw assembly <b>40</b> and the waste receptacle is within a predetermined threshold distance (e.g., 0.25 m, 1.0 m) that will allow the jaws <b>42</b> to at least partially surround and engage the waste receptacle.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Once the waste receptacle has been engaged, the operator (or the processing unit <b>78</b>) can prompt the arm <b>38</b> to retract toward the vehicle body <b>28</b> and on-board receptacle <b>22</b> of the refuse vehicle. Once the arm <b>38</b> of the lifting system <b>36</b> returns to its fully retracted position, the processing unit <b>78</b> can activate the motor <b>48</b> to drive the carriage <b>46</b>, jaw assembly <b>40</b>, and waste receptacle engaged by the jaw assembly <b>40</b> upward, along the elevator track <b>44</b>. The carriage <b>46</b> can be driven upward along the elevator track <b>44</b> along the lifting segment <b>52</b> to the dumping segment <b>54</b>, where the carriage <b>46</b> and waste receptacle received within the jaw assembly <b>40</b> are inverted, and angled downward toward the on-board receptacle <b>22</b>. Aided by gravity, waste from within the waste receptacle is directed downward and into the on-board receptacle <b>22</b>. Once emptied, the waste receptacle can be returned to the ground below the refuse vehicle <b>20</b> by reversing the motor <b>48</b> and lowering the carriage <b>46</b> along the elevator track <b>44</b>. Once the waste receptacle is received on the ground surface, the jaws <b>42</b> can disengage the waste receptacle and the process <b>200</b> can be repeated.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Using the foregoing systems and methods described herein, refuse can be collected along routes in a much faster and economical manner. Operators receive visual cues and certainty that a waste receptacle is within the area where the lifting system can properly engage the waste receptacle and complete refuse collection without having to leave the cab. The aggregate impact of achieving correct vehicle alignment relative to the waste receptacles being emptied is significant, given the high volume of stops typically performed on a given route. Substantial cost savings are realized by minimizing or eliminating failed attempts to engage waste receptacles with the lifting system due to improper alignment. Similarly, operators working outside of the vehicle are provided with visual information that allows successful engagement by the lifting system along each stop within a route. The elimination of error reduces the time spent along a collection route, decreases the costs of performing a collection route, and improves the safety of the workers by allowing the workers to stay within the vehicle in more scenarios. Safety is further promoted by providing a visual indication of an area to avoid by operators outside the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although shown in the context of a side-loading refuse vehicle <b>20</b> throughout the disclosure, the concepts described herein are similarly applicable to front-loading and rear-loading refuse vehicles as well. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, another refuse vehicle <b>320</b> is depicted. The front-loading refuse vehicle <b>320</b>, like the refuse vehicle <b>20</b>, can include a similar projector <b>60</b> having lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> positioned along a front of the cab <b>30</b> or on the lifting system <b>36</b> itself. The front-loading refuse vehicle <b>320</b> have a lifting system <b>36</b> that includes rotatable arms <b>322</b> and articulating forks <b>324</b> that work together to engage, lift, and empty refuse containers. The arms <b>322</b> and articulating forks <b>324</b> extend forward from the cab <b>30</b> to interact with refuse containers (e.g., a commercial dumpster <b>500</b>).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The projector <b>60</b> can operate in the same manner as described above to help an operator within the cab <b>30</b> steer the refuse vehicle <b>320</b> into position relative to a refuse container for waste removal. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the two lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> project light downward and forward of the cab <b>30</b>, and illuminate an area that corresponds with a location of the forks <b>324</b>. Once again, the illuminated area can correspond with a &#x201c;target area&#x201d; or work zone <b>70</b> where the forks <b>324</b> can engage the interface upon the refuse container <b>500</b> without additional lateral movement. Similarly, the target area or work zone <b>70</b> can alert a worker where to avoid standing during vehicle operation. In some examples, the lighting assemblies <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are positioned directly on the forks <b>324</b> or the rotatable arms <b>322</b>. Accordingly, the target zone <b>70</b> can help direct the lifting system <b>36</b> into engagement with a refuse container along multiple axes. The light emitted by the projector <b>60</b> will adjust as the lifting system <b>36</b> is moved vertically, which allows a user to see and observe a specific height of the forks <b>324</b>. The light from the projector <b>60</b> can shine onto the refuse container <b>500</b>, and into the interface of the refuse container <b>500</b> for engagement and lifting. As discussed above, the refuse vehicle <b>320</b> can also include one or more sensors <b>80</b> that detect a combination of the light from the projector <b>60</b> and the refuse container <b>500</b>. The sensors <b>80</b> can be used, with a processing unit <b>78</b>, to manually, automatically, semi-automatically, autonomously, or otherwise adjust a position of the refuse vehicle <b>320</b> relative to the refuse container <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The projector <b>60</b> can also be used on refuse truck accessories. For examples, and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the refuse truck <b>320</b> supports a carry can device <b>340</b>. The carry can device <b>340</b> is supported by the forks <b>324</b> and can be used to empty residential refuse containers <b>100</b> into the receptacle formed by the carry can device <b>340</b>. Once again, the projector <b>60</b> emits light that defines a visible target zone or work zone <b>70</b> that can help to position the refuse vehicle <b>320</b> relative to the refuse container <b>100</b> to be emptied. The carry can device <b>340</b> can be placed in communication with the processing unit <b>78</b> and/or the sensor <b>80</b> to automate a portion of the positioning process as well.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In still other examples, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the alignment systems can be incorporated into rear-loading refuse vehicles, such as the rear-loading refuse vehicle <b>420</b>. The projector <b>60</b> can project light rearward and downward to define a target zone <b>70</b> that is positioned behind the lifting system <b>36</b>. Using the projected light from the projector <b>60</b>, a worker can position the refuse containers <b>100</b> within a defined target zone <b>70</b> which corresponds with a location where the refuse container <b>100</b> can be engaged and emptied by the lifting system <b>36</b>. Similarly, the worker can avoid the target area to avoid unwanted accidental contact with the lifting system <b>36</b> or refuse vehicle <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Additional control schemes can be used to operate the projector <b>60</b> and refuse vehicles <b>20</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>420</b> more generally. For example, the type of illumination or position of illumination can be adjusted based upon a selected refuse mode. The selected refuse mode can be a variety of different modes, include residential, commercial, cold weather, industrial, etc., and can be selected manually or automatically by the refuse truck <b>20</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>420</b> (e.g., upon detection of a location of the vehicle by a global positioning system). The projector <b>60</b> may illuminate a different target for commercial or industrial mode (e.g., wider, because refuse containers tend to be wider along these routes) than the residential mode, for example. Various other refuse mode type controls that can be incorporated into the refuse vehicles <b>20</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>420</b> are shown and described in commonly-owned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2020/0346657, filed Apr. 17, 2020, and entitled, &#x201c;Operational Modes for a Refuse Vehicle,&#x201d; the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although this description may discuss a specific order of method steps, the order of the steps may differ from what is outlined.
