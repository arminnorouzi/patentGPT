Consumers expect dependable function, uninterrupted long-term use, and cost effectiveness. As a result, conformal coatings and encapsulation materials have been developed to meet the needs of most electronic devices. Without these critical materials, the printed circuit boards (PCBs), which are arguably the foundation of all consumer electronics, would be susceptible to failure due to corrosion, high temperatures, moisture, vibration, and other environmental hazards. Conformal coating materials protect PCBs and advanced substrates from thermal shock, moisture, corrosive liquids, and other adverse environmental conditions. Shielding electronic function from external influences ensures long product lives for harsh marine, automotive, medical, and consumer electronics applications.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of conformal coatings is wide-spread in the electronics industry. However, many materials used in the field have a low surface tension and the edges of the components are not covered well because of a drift of the materials away from the edges of the components to its respective centers. Conventional deposition techniques will not result in a covering of the edges unless a thick coating of material is used. But, a thick coating increases the overall temperature the component is exposed to during operation and thereby shortens the component's life.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of the foregoing shortcomings of conventional deposition techniques for conformal coating, the present inventor has recognized the need for a solution that provides both deposition of the conformal coating at a high resolution and that exposes the coating to ultraviolet (UV) curing gradually, beginning at the edges of the component first and proceeding to the rest of the coating material thereafter. The present invention provides, in various embodiments, a novel deposition technique for conformal coatings at a high resolution, initially directly on edges of a component and thereafter on remaining portions of the component, with optional UV curing of the deposited coating material performed between the deposition steps.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment of the invention, a conventional dispenser is used for the edge deposition. In other embodiments, for example where height difference between components on a PCB provide difficulties when using a conventional dispenser, the conformal material is dispensed by way of laser-induced jetting or laser-induced spraying. Conventional dispensers may not be able to penetrate close enough to each component's edges and, as a result, a thicker conformal coating may be needed to ensure that the edges are adequately coated. To avoid the need for such a thicker coat, laser-induced jetting and/or spraying allows the coating material to be transferred at a very high resolution from a relatively high distance above the PCB (up to several mm) to the edges of the component. One example of a laser-induced jetting approach suitable for use in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 10,144,034 by the present inventor and assigned to the present applicant.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In various embodiments of the invention, a material (e.g., a highly viscous material, a wax material, a polymer material, a mix of a polymer and a monomer material, a heat or light sensitive low viscosity material, a material that can be cured by UV light or by heating, or a material that can be dried) is printed (e.g., using a laser-based system) on edges of an electronic component to create a polymeric layer thereon and the material so printed is thereafter cured (e.g., by UV light, heat, or both). Following curing of the material printed on the edges of the electronic component, a second printing of the material over remaining portions of the component and curing of the material applied during the second printing takes place. In either or both of the printing steps, printing may be performed using laser-induced jetting, laser-induced spraying, or both. For example, the material may be printed as droplets jetted or sprayed from a layer of the material coated on a transparent or semi-transparent substrate.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The layer of the material may be coated on the transparent or semi-transparent substrate by a coating system, for example one that uses a well-defined gap between rollers or knifes to leave a uniform layer of material on the substrate with a thickness that is defined by the gap. Or, the coating system may be one that includes a screen-printing module, a dispenser or an ink jet head, a gravure or micro-gravure system, a slot-die system, a roller coating system, etc. In some cases, the coating system may be located inside a closed cell with a controlled environment to prolong the pot life of the material. Also, the coating system may be configured to contain more than one material and to print a plurality materials onto the substrate in a controlled sequence. During printing, the bottom surface of the substrate may be disposed at an acute angle with respect to a top surface of the electronic component, and the electronic component may be inspected after each printing step (e.g., using a separate inspection module or one that is integrated with the laser-based printing system). The droplets of material may vary in volume between the printing steps and/or during individual ones of the printing steps.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is illustrated by way of example, and not limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrate the use of a laser deposition system and a contact gap printing system, respectively, to print materials on component edges, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>illustrates aspects of a coating system, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of incomplete edge covering by conformal materials printed using conventional, low resolution deposition techniques.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>e </i></figref>illustrate steps in a process of printing conformal materials at edges of a component in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, in which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates an example of a component affixed to a PCB, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>c </i></figref>illustrate material deposition on the component's edges and subsequent curing of the material so deposited, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>d </i>and <b>3</b><i>e </i></figref>illustrate material deposition on remaining areas of the component and subsequent curing of the material so deposited.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>i </i></figref>illustrate steps in a process of printing conformal materials, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates aspects of laser induced spraying versus laser induced jetting, either or both of which techniques may be employed in processes for printing conformal materials, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates aspects of a system for printing conformal materials, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates aspects of an in-line inspection module, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts components of a computer system in which computer readable instructions instantiating the methods of the present invention may be stored and executed.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention provides systems and methods for printing conformal materials (e.g., a polymeric material) <b>16</b> and other waterproof coating materials at high resolution.

While the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> does not clearly show areas of edges <b>13</b> that are incompletely covered, it is understood that, in a cross-sectional view, there may be areas of edges <b>13</b> that are incompletely covered.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In contrast, the present invention provides very high resolution printing at the edges <b>13</b> of components <b>18</b>, either through laser-assisted deposition, as shown in the laser-based printing system <b>11</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, or by use of a conventional high-resolution conformal material dispenser <b>24</b> (e.g., an ink jet or other deposition system), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>.

To avoid the need for such a thicker coat, laser-induced jetting and/or laser-induced spraying (provided by the laser-based printing system <b>11</b>) allows the coating material to be transferred at a very high resolution from a relatively high distance above the PCB <b>22</b> (e.g., up to several mm) to the edges <b>13</b> of the component <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, laser-based printing system <b>11</b> may include a coating system <b>15</b> for applying a layer <b>14</b> of the material <b>16</b> with uniform thickness on a transparent or semi-transparent substrate <b>12</b>.

In one embodiment of the invention, the coating system <b>15</b> may include a syringe <b>64</b> of the material <b>16</b> to be printed and an air or mechanical pump that drives the material <b>16</b> onto the substrate <b>12</b>. The substrate <b>12</b> is then moved (e.g., using motors and gears/rollers <b>66</b>) toward a well-defined gap <b>70</b> between rollers or knifes <b>72</b> of a coater <b>50</b> to remove excess material and create a uniform layer <b>14</b> of the material <b>16</b> with a thickness that is defined by the gap <b>70</b>. The material <b>16</b> is then transferred from the substrate <b>12</b> to the component <b>18</b>, e.g., using laser-assisted deposition (e.g., using laser <b>10</b> of laser module <b>54</b> to jet/spray portions of the material <b>16</b> from the substrate <b>12</b> towards component <b>18</b>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment of the invention, the coating system <b>15</b> includes a screen-printing module wherein the material <b>16</b> is coated on a screen or stencil of film with well-defined holes and transferred to the substrate <b>12</b> using a blade or a squeegee in a soft or hard engage. In one embodiment of the invention, the coating system <b>15</b> includes a dispenser or an ink jet head to print the material <b>16</b> directly onto a carrier substrate <b>12</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, the coating system <b>15</b> is a gravure or micro-gravure system that coats a substrate <b>12</b> with a highly uniform layer <b>14</b>, and the material <b>16</b> is then transferred from the substrate <b>12</b> to the component <b>18</b>, as described above.

In the side and top views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, a transparent or semi-transparent substrate <b>12</b> has been coated with a material <b>16</b> (e.g., a polymeric material) or other waterproof coating material, that is to be applied as a conformal coating to a component <b>18</b> located on a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>22</b>. The material <b>16</b> to be printed may be applied to the transparent or semi-transparent substrate <b>12</b> in any of the manners described above. Once so applied, the substrate <b>12</b> with the coated layer <b>14</b> of material is brought into proximity of the component <b>18</b> with a laser printing head (depicted later in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>), and the laser <b>10</b> is operated (e.g., in a pulsed fashion) to jet droplets of the material <b>16</b> from the coated substrate <b>12</b> onto the edges <b>13</b> of the component <b>18</b>. In the view at right, a top view of the component <b>18</b> on the PCB <b>22</b> is shown, with printed droplets of the waterproof coating material <b>16</b> around the edges of the component <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The volume of the droplets so printed may be determined by the energy of the laser <b>10</b> used for the jetting process, the thickness of the film <b>14</b> of material coated on the transparent or semi-transparent substrate <b>12</b>, or a combination of these parameters. In general, the size of the printed droplet on the component <b>18</b> will be determined by its volume and the vertical distance between the coated substrate <b>12</b> and the surface on which the droplets are printed. By controlling these parameters (e.g., by varying the thickness of the coated layer <b>14</b>, controlling the pulse width, pulse frequency, and/or number of pulses of the laser <b>10</b>, and the spacing of the distance between the coated substrate <b>12</b> and the surface on which the droplets are printed), droplets of a desired size can be printed on the component <b>18</b>. Preferably, the droplet volume is controlled so as to ensure an even distribution of the coating material <b>16</b> on the component <b>18</b>. This may be easiest with droplets of common volume throughout the jetting process, but in some cases the droplet volume may be varied during the jetting process, for example, when component features demand or would benefit from the application of droplets of different volumes.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in the present discussion and in the illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>4</b><i>i, </i>laser-induced jetting is assumed. However, in some embodiments, laser induced spraying of the material <b>16</b> from the coated substrate <b>12</b> may be used. With laser- induced spraying, a plurality of small droplets of the material <b>16</b> (versus a single, larger volume droplet as is produced in laser-induced jetting) are scattered from the coated substrate <b>12</b> towards the component <b>18</b> on the PCB <b>22</b>. Spraying in this fashion may be desirable in some instances. In some cases, a waterproof coating material <b>16</b> may be applied to a single component <b>18</b> and/or its associated PCB <b>22</b> using either or both of laser-inducted jetting and laser-induced spraying. For example, laser-induced spraying may be employed when the waterproof coating material <b>16</b> is applied to the edges <b>13</b> of the component <b>18</b>, while laser-induced jetting may be employed when the waterproof coating material <b>16</b> is applied elsewhere on the component <b>18</b> and/or the PCB <b>22</b>. Jetting versus spraying of a waterproof coating material <b>16</b> may be controlled or selected through variation of the pulse width, spot size, spot shape, pulse frequency, and/or number of pulses of the laser <b>10</b>, the thickness of the layer <b>14</b> of coated material <b>16</b> on the transparent or semi-transparent substrate <b>12</b>, or a combination of these parameters. Therefore, throughout the present discussion, reference to laser-induced jetting, or illustration thereof, should be understood as including the possibility of using laser-induced jetting alone, laser-induced spraying alone, or a combination of laser-induced jetting and laser-induced spraying both in a single process step or between process steps.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, once the edge or perimeter (or a desired portion of the perimeter) of the component <b>18</b> has been coated with the droplets of the waterproof coating material <b>16</b>, these droplets may be cured into cured droplets <b>38</b>, as shown in the side and top views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>. In some embodiments, the curing may be performed via photopolymerization of the coated material using ultraviolet (UV) light <b>36</b> provided by a UV curing module <b>34</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, curing may be performed using thermal radiation (heat), for example by placing the component <b>18</b> and PCB <b>22</b> in an oven or under one or more heating (e.g., infrared) lamps, and/or using hot air flow from a blower. Still further, in some instances, curing may be effected chemically, or by other means. This curing step following the application of the waterproof coating material <b>16</b> to the edges <b>13</b> of the component <b>18</b> is preferred, but is optional. Employing such a curing step has been found to enhance the overall conformal coating process. However, the use of such a curing step does increase the overall time to complete the coating process, so, in some cases, such curing step may be omitted in the interest of reduced overall process time.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Following the curing of the waterproof coating material being applied to the edges <b>13</b> of the component <b>18</b> (if such a step is employed), the component <b>18</b> and PCB <b>22</b> are returned to the vicinity of the laser printing head (depicted later in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>) and, as shown in the side and top views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>, any gaps in the coated edge areas <b>13</b> of the component <b>18</b> are printed in the same fashion as discussed above. That is, the substrate <b>12</b> with the coated layer <b>14</b> of waterproof material <b>16</b> is brought into proximity of the laser printing head, and the laser <b>10</b> is operated (e.g., in a pulsed fashion) to jet droplets of the material <b>16</b> from the coated substrate <b>12</b> onto the edges <b>13</b> of the component <b>18</b> to fill in any gaps in coverage from the first printing step, and/or to apply an additional coat of the waterproof material <b>16</b> to the edges <b>13</b> of the component <b>18</b>. Then, as shown in the side and top views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>, another optional curing step may be employed to solidify (or cure) these newly printed droplets of the waterproof material <b>16</b> into a layer of cured material <b>38</b> over the edge <b>13</b> of the component <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>, a block diagram of a system <b>46</b> configured for printing conformal materials in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown. As illustrated, the component <b>18</b> and PCB <b>22</b> may be located on a moveable stage <b>42</b> (e.g., moveable in three dimensions) so as to be positionable and relocatable between the laser printing head <b>45</b> and the curing module <b>34</b>. It is understood that laser printing head <b>45</b> may include the previously-described laser <b>10</b>, substrate <b>12</b> and layer <b>14</b>, in addition to mechanical components (e.g., tracks, motors, etc.) which allow the printing head <b>45</b> to be translated in the XYZ dimensions with respect to the component <b>18</b> during the printing steps/operations.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">By being adjustable in three dimensions, the stage <b>42</b> can translate the component <b>18</b> and PCB <b>22</b> between the laser printing head <b>45</b> and curing module <b>34</b>, and also adjust the displacements between and with respect to the printing head <b>45</b> and the component <b>18</b>, and between the curing module <b>34</b> and the component <b>18</b>. In addition, an inspection module <b>40</b> may be included in the system <b>46</b>, and the stage <b>42</b> may be operable to position the component <b>18</b> and PCB <b>22</b> under the inspection module <b>40</b> prior to and between the printing and curing steps. For example, prior to a printing step, the component <b>18</b> and PCB <b>22</b> can be inspected to aid in alignment of the printing head <b>45</b> with respect to the component <b>18</b> and PCB <b>22</b>. Following a printing and/or curing step, the component <b>18</b> and PCB <b>22</b> can be inspected to determine whether any repair of a prior printing step is needed.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The inspection module <b>40</b> may be configured to image and/or to measure the topography of the component <b>18</b> and PCB <b>22</b> and/or may include optical components to permit real-time inspection by machine and/or human operators. The optical or other imaging inspection may reveal that while many of the droplets have been suitably printed on the component <b>18</b> and/or PCB <b>22</b>, some of the droplets are out of position or are otherwise unsuitable. A controller <b>44</b> having access to this data may then operate the system <b>46</b> so as to remediate the situation (e.g., removing improperly printed material and having it reprinted, or having additional droplets printed to cover a gap, etc.). Imaging may be performed before and/or after the material transfer by the laser printing head <b>45</b> and may capture intermediate images during a printing step.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment of the invention, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>, the inspection module <b>40</b> is positioned coincident with the printing head <b>45</b> and a mirror <b>88</b> or other optical element (not depicted) may be employed to obtain images of the surface of the component <b>18</b> and/or PCB <b>22</b> during the jetting of the waterproof material <b>16</b>. That is, the printing head <b>45</b> may include a laser module <b>54</b> with an in-line inspection module <b>40</b>. As the coated substrate <b>12</b> and/or component <b>18</b> is/are moved to a target area in the vicinity of the laser printing head <b>45</b>, the laser module <b>54</b> is activated to emit a laser beam <b>10</b> incident on the coated substrate <b>12</b> in order to deliver the waterproof material <b>16</b> to the component <b>18</b>. The images of the surface of the component <b>18</b> (obtained from the inspection module <b>40</b>) may be used to assist in alignment of the component <b>18</b> in the target printing area via the stage <b>42</b>, as well as to help synchronize the pulsing of the laser module <b>54</b>. In some embodiments of the invention, the laser module <b>54</b> of the printing head <b>45</b> may be configured to scan the laser beam <b>10</b> in a raster-like pattern over the coated substrate <b>12</b>, releasing droplets of waterproof material <b>16</b> onto the component <b>18</b>. As indicated above, UV curing and/or drying can be performed after the material <b>16</b> has been printed on the component <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Now referring to the side and top views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>e</i></figref>, once the printing of the waterproof material <b>16</b> at the edges <b>13</b> of the component <b>18</b> has been completed, and that material <b>16</b> has been cured (if so desired), printing of the material <b>16</b> at other areas may commence. As shown, this entails jetting (and/or spraying) droplets of the waterproof material <b>16</b> from the coated substrate <b>12</b> to other areas of the component <b>18</b> that have not been previously printed. In this example, the waterproof material <b>16</b> is applied to the top surface of the component <b>18</b> (e.g., top surface excluding the perimeter of the top surface).
