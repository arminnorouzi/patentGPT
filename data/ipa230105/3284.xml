They lock in the return path of the force and have a high locking effect even in the case of forces, as they occur in particular in the event of accidents, and maintain said locking effect. Currently, the demands are that the mechanism can absorb torques of greater than or equal to 200 Nm.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of such high torques, it has to in particular be ensured that the toothings, which engage, cannot become disengaged. This is where the disclosure starts.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure has the object of avoiding the disadvantages of the known mechanisms and to further develop these mechanisms to the effect that they also withstand high torques acting in the return path of the force, and thus stresses due to accidents.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This object is solved by means of a wobble mechanism for adjusting devices, in particular of motor vehicle seats, having a housing; an outer part, which has an internal toothing, which is concentric with a joint axis; an inner part, which has an external toothing, which is concentric with an eccentric axis, which runs offset in parallel by an off-center distance e to the joint axis; an engagement region, in which the external toothing engages with the internal toothing and which is intersected centrally by a straight line, which in each case intersects the joint axis and the eccentric axis at a right angle, wherein on this straight line the eccentric axis lies between the joint axis and the engagement region; and a free space, which is located 180&#xb0; opposite the engagement region and which is likewise intersected centrally by the straight line and in which the external toothing is disengaged and at a distance from the internal toothing, a locking part is provided, which has a locking region, which is located in the free space, thus engages with the latter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of this mechanism, the locking part is located with its locking region between the tip circles of the two toothings, namely in the free space, which is present between the internal toothing and the external toothing. This free space is limited by the two tip circles. It is essentially crescent-shaped. When the internal toothing wants to move away from the external toothing in the engagement region by means of external forces, this is not possible without reducing the free space. A reduction of this type, however, is blocked by the locking part. In the region of the free space, the teeth of the internal toothing and of the external toothing cannot approach one another to the extent that would be necessary, so that there is no longer an engagement in the engagement region. It is avoided by means of the locking part that the teeth in the free space can approach one another to such a sufficient extent or that the free space is radially decreased to such an extent, respectively, that the engagement as a whole is lost.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The locking part thus comes into operation in an accident situation. It should generally not be noticeable, for example should not rattle or negatively impact the actuation in some way.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The internal toothing has a smaller number of teeth than the external toothing. The difference preferably equals one or two.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a manner known per se, the inner part has a circular recess, which is concentric with the eccentric axis and which is limited by a sliding surface. The wobble mechanism further has a wobble pin, which abuts on this sliding surface, is rotatably received in the recess, and is concentric with the eccentric axis. Due to the fact that the respective rotational position of the wobble pin determines the position of the free space, it is advantageous to connect the locking part to the wobble plate. Even though there are also other options for controlling the locking part so that the locking region thereof is always located in the free space, the connection to the wobble plate represents a particularly simple solution. A sliding movement between recess and wobble pin can also be replaced with a rolling friction, e.g. ball bearing. The mechanism can be manually or motor driven.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is advantageous when the locking part has a main body, which, viewed in the direction of the joint axis, is arranged above or below the inner part.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the plane of the toothings, the locking region can have an extension in the circumferential direction, so that it covers two to five teeth of the internal toothing and external toothing, in particular covers three or four teeth. It is ensured with this length that the teeth of the external toothing cannot engage with the internal toothing beyond the tip circle of the teeth of the internal toothing in the free space. The locking region covers at least one intermediate tooth space, which preferably lies on both sides of the straight line. It is prevented thereby that a tooth of the other toothing can enter into this intermediate space of the toothing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">When an air gap is in each case located in an advantageous manner between the locking region and the internal toothing as well as between the locking region and the external toothing, this has the advantage that a rattling of the locking part is prevented.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is advantageous to form the locking region in a similar form as the crescent shape of the free space. It is advantageous when the locking region has tapering end regions in the plane of the internal toothing. In the axial direction, the locking region preferably extends over the axial thickness of the teeth of the internal toothing or of the external toothing, respectively.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The disclosure makes it possible that the housing and/or the wobble pin and/or mechanism parts are made of a plastic, in particular of a reinforced plastic, for example of glass fiber-reinforced plastic. The housing is relieved by means of the locking part. Housing and wobble pin (plus a drive wheel connected thereto) can deform elastically, the tolerances occurring thereby could have the result that, without locking part, the toothings become disengaged. This is now prevented by means of the locking part. The wobble pin preferably protrudes integrally from the drive wheel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Measured in the free space and on the straight line, the distance between the tip circles of the two toothings is preferably larger than 1 mm. The free space should be sufficiently large so that the locking part can be accommodated there. It should be sufficiently small to attain a high translation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Advantageously, the diameter of the tip circle of the internal toothing is maximally 5% larger than the diameter of the tip circle of the external toothing, the diameter of the tip circle of the internal toothing is in particular not larger than the diameter of the tip circle of the external toothing. A translation, which is as large as possible, is desired by means of the fitting. This is attained when the number of teeth of the toothings differ only by one. The translation, which is a large as possible, is also promoted in that the diameters of the two tip circles are approximately identical.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In preferred embodiment, the locking part is L-shaped. The locking region thereby represents a leg, which runs essentially parallel to the joint axis. The other leg is formed by a main body. A possible connection region between both of them forms the angle of 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A single-stage wobble mechanism has been described so far. The disclosure can also be used in the case of a two-stage wobble mechanism, wherein only one wobble mechanism has a locking part or both wobble mechanisms have a common locking part.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further advantages and features follow from the claims as well as from the following description of an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure, which is not to be understood to be limiting.

In the known manner, the wobble pin <b>32</b> engages with a recess <b>36</b> of an inner part <b>38</b> comprising external toothing <b>40</b>. Said external toothing <b>40</b> engages with the internal toothing <b>30</b>. In response to rotation of the drive wheel <b>20</b>, the eccentric axis <b>34</b> runs on a circular arc with the radius e about the joint axis <b>24</b>. The inner part <b>38</b> is thus driven to perform a wobbling movement. In an engagement region <b>42</b>, said inner part engages with the teeth of the internal toothing <b>30</b>.

Mutually cooperating actuators <b>56</b> are present, so that the main body <b>50</b> is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the drive wheel <b>20</b>.
