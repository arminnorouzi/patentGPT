Said patent claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/244,588 filed on Oct. 21, 2015. The above applications and patent are incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to low caliber firearm bullets, that is, .50 caliber and less, and more specifically, to cartridges and rifle bullets.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Rifle bullets have a conventional elongate shape with pointed tip. The elongate shape adds stability during flight and increases the kinetic energy for a particular bullet size. The elongate shape also increases metal surface area contacting the metal barrel during firing and the metal to metal, barrel to bullet, friction can reduce the muzzle velocity of the bullet. Bullets are known having rearward ends with a boat tail and circumferential grooves, both of which have the effect of reducing the surface area of elongate bullet and the metal to metal engagement and friction. Such grooves in rifle bullets have previously been filled with grease for lubrication between the barrel and bullet. Bullets with grooves filled with grease are not commercially feasible in today's market.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Innovations providing even incremental improved performance of bullets would be welcome in the marketplace. Such improved performance would certainly include increasing the muzzle velocity of a bullet without effecting its ballistic coefficient. Providing such improved performance with minimal increase in manufacturing cost would be very advantageous.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Adding grooves to a low caliber bullet can result in greater muzzle velocity. Such grooves provide less surface area of metal to metal contact between bullet and rifled barrel and can also reduce the needed energy to deform the bullet surface by the barrel rifling, both of which can provide an increase in muzzle velocity. However, providing such grooves can increase the bullet drag in air. Bullets are designed to have minimal decrease in velocity as they travel down range as quantified by a &#x201c;ballistic coefficient&#x201d;. The higher the ballistic coefficient the less drag a bullet has traveling down range. It is estimated that each circumferential groove decreases the ballistic coefficient of a rifle bullet by about 3.5%.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the invention include an elongate rifle bullet with a plurality of circumferential grooves having overmolded polymer therein defining embedded polymer rings. Embodiments of the invention include cartridges with propellant and such bullets. In one or more embodiments, the bullet has a body portion and a converging nose portion, the nose and body being monolithic. In one or more embodiments the nose may be hollow and the body solid. The polymer rings have an outer surface that is flush with, that is, conforming to the outer surface of the body with the same or substantially the same radius. A feature and advantage of embodiments is that the metal to metal contact between the bullet and the barrel is reduced while not diminishing the ballistic coefficient of the bullet.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In embodiments the outer surface of the polymer rings may have a slight concavity such that when the bullet is deformed by the rifling of the barrel, the polymer flows to an extent to level the concavity when the bullet exits the muzzle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The overmolding polymer may be formed of various known polymers such as polyamides, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyetherketone (PEK), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyoxymethylene plastic (POM/Acetal), ultra-high-molecular-weight poly-ethylene (UHMWPE/UHMW), various fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The bullet may be heated before the overmolding to increase the adhesion between the polymer and the bullet. The polymer may be chosen to provide a minimal coefficient of friction with respect to the steel barrel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one or more embodiments, the bullet may have a polymer tip inserted in a forward interior cavity of the bullet. The polymer may include a main portion forward of the opening and a tip retention portion filling the interior cavity and having a shape corresponding to the interior cavity to retain the polymer tip in place. In some embodiments, the bullet includes a more steeply tapered forward portion that defines a forward facing annular ridge. The tip retention portion may include an exterior portion which encloses the forward portion of the bullet and fills the forward facing annular ridge to retain the polymer tip in place.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the invention provide benefits from a rifle bullet with polymer rings and a polymer tip with improved retention characteristics. A feature and advantage of embodiments is that bands may be adhered by the adhesion created during overmolding as well as by the lock provided by the loop, as well as by a mechanical lock in certain embodiments. For example, the groove may include an undercut on the rearward side of the groove, the forward side of the groove, or both.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the invention are directed to manufacturing bullet by insert-molding bands in circumferential grooves. In one or more embodiments an overmolded tip may also be provided. In one or more embodiments, the bands and tip may be molded in a single operation. In one or more embodiments, the polymer tips may include portions filling external jacket skives reducing external-ballistics drag penalties.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A feature and advantage of one or more embodiments is a projectile that addresses environmental concerns regarding lead by providing a projectile that includes reduced amount of lead or is free of lead.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A feature and advantage of one or more embodiments is a projectile that forms an entrance wound when entering a body (such as the body of a game animal or a block of ballistic gel) and forms an exit wound that is larger than the entrance wound upon exiting the body. The relatively large exit wound may cause greater blood loss leading to a faster kill. The increased blood loss may also create a blood trail useful for tracking a wounded animal.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A feature and advantage of one or more embodiments is a projectile that deforms to an expanded or mushroomed shape while passing through a body (such as the body of a game animal or a block of ballistic gel). In an embodiment, the expanded or mushroomed shape has an overall lateral width and a surface area that is greater than the overall lateral width and the surface are of the undeformed projectile.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A feature and advantage of one or more embodiments is a projectile that forms multiple pedals while passing through a body (such as the body of a game animal or a block of ballistic gel). In an embodiment, the pedals provide enhanced cutting action. In an embodiment, the pedals increase the overall lateral width and the surface area of the projectile compared to the shape of the projectile before the multiple pedals are formed. A feature and advantage of one or more embodiments is a projectile that folds along localized area of weakness to assume a deformed shape.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A projectile in accordance with one or more example embodiments comprises a projectile body, a plurality of polymer bands and a polymer tip member. In one or more embodiments, the projectile body includes a tail portion, a nose portion and a barrel engaging portion extending rearwardly between the nose portion and the tail portion. In one or more embodiments, the portions of the projectile body are arranged along a central longitudinal axis. In one or more embodiments, the tail portion has a rearward facing surface defining an XY plane. In these embodiments, the tail portion extends forwardly along the central longitudinal axis of the projectile body between the rearward facing surface and the barrel engaging portion. In one or more embodiments, the central longitudinal axis is orthogonal to the XY plane. In one or more embodiments, the tail portion has a tail radius extending between the central longitudinal axis and an outer tail surface of the tail portion. In one or more embodiments, the tail radius increases as the tail portion extends forwardly along the central longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one or more embodiments, the barrel engaging portion of the projectile body extends forwardly along the central longitudinal axis between the tail portion and the nose portion. The barrel engaging portion has a barrel engaging radius extending between the central longitudinal axis and a barrel engaging surface of the barrel engaging portion. In one or more embodiments, the barrel engaging portion defines a plurality of circumferential grooves. In one or more embodiments, the projectile comprising a plurality of polymer bands with each polymer band being disposed in one of the circumferential grooves defined by the barrel engaging portion.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one or more embodiments, the nose portion of the projectile body comprising a forward facing edge defining an opening. In one or more embodiments, the nose portion extends forwardly along the central longitudinal axis between the barrel engaging portion and the forward facing edge. In one or more embodiments, the nose portion has a nose radius extending between the central longitudinal axis and an outer nose surface of the nose portion. In one or more embodiments, the nose radius decreases as the nose portion extends forwardly along the central longitudinal axis. In one or more embodiments, the nose portion has a shape generally corresponding to the shape of an ogive.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one or more embodiments, the projectile body comprises a body wall extending between an interior wall surface and an exterior wall surface. Said body wall constitutes a jacket with respect to core material, such as lead in the cavity defined by the jacket. In one or more embodiments, the interior wall surface defines an interior cavity and the interior cavity fluidly communicates with the opening defined by the forward facing edge of the nose portion. In one or more embodiments, the interior cavity extends rearwardly from the opening to a cavity end point within the projectile body.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one or more embodiments, core material comprising a core member is disposed inside the interior cavity. In one or more embodiments, the core member comprises a forward facing surface and the core member extends rearward from the forward facing surface to the interior cavity end point within the projectile body. In one or more embodiments, the forward facing surface of the core member and the interior wall surface define a forward portion of the interior cavity. In one or more embodiments, the forward portion of the interior cavity has a cavity radius that decreases as the forward portion of the interior cavity extends forward from the forward facing surface of the core member to the opening.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one or more embodiments, the projectile includes a tip member extending through the opening.
