It should be understood, however, that the particular embodiments described are not to be taken in a limiting sense. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention relates generally to the field of honeypot systems, and more particularly, to dynamically executing honeypot accounts based on contextual information.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the present invention recognize that advances in skimming prevention technologies have resulted in an increase in people being accosted, coerced, and/or forced to withdraw funds from automatic teller machines (ATMs). Unfortunately, this problem has become even more prevalent with the advent of cardless ATMs. Cardless ATMs provide access to an account and allows an account holder or authorized users of an account to withdraw money without the need for a physical card. Instead, cardless ATMs rely on account verification via text message or a banking app on your smartphone. Similarly, the increase in the number and frequency of mobile payment services also renders anyone with a mobile device vulnerable to theft of funds. Accordingly, any person with a mobile device can be a potential target for theft of funds, regardless of whether the person has their purse or wallet.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the present invention further recognize that a person under duress can be presented with equally problematic scenarios regardless of whether a person inputs the correct account information. If a person divulges the correct account access information to an unauthorized user, all of the money in the persons bank account will be revealed and accessible to the unauthorized user. On the other hand, if the person provides invalid account access information to the unauthorized user, causing the account to freeze or become inaccessible, the account holder may be prone to increased harm or danger.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present invention recognize the need to set up one or more ghost (i.e. alternate) bank accounts linked to a primary bank account that have a relatively small amount of money in them so as to not tip off an unauthorized user that they are using a ghost bank account. Embodiments of the present invention create one or more ghost accounts indicating a small amount of money based on contextual information, including one or more of the PIN entered, location that the PIN was entered, time of transaction, and number of times the user has previously used their PIN at or within a particular location. In an embodiment, the amount of funds in a ghost account is dynamically changed based on the particular PIN/account access information entered at a particular location or the amount of times or frequency in which the user has entered their PIN/account access information at a particular location.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention may be a system, a method, and/or a computer program product at any possible technical detail level of integration. The computer program product may include a computer readable storage medium (or media) having computer readable program instructions thereon for causing a processor to carry out aspects of the present.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The computer readable storage medium can be a tangible device that can retain and store instructions for use by an instruction execution device. The computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but is not limited to, an electronic storage device, a magnetic storage device, an optical storage device, an electromagnetic storage device, a semiconductor storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. A non-exhaustive list of more specific examples of the computer readable storage medium includes the following: a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a static random access memory (SRAM), a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a memory stick, a floppy disk, a mechanically encoded device such as punch-cards or raised structures in a groove having instructions recorded thereon, and any suit-able combination of the foregoing. A computer readable storage medium, as used herein, is not to be construed as being transitory signals per se, such as radio waves or other freely propagating electromagnetic waves, electromagnetic waves propagating through a waveguide or other transmission media (e.g., light pulses passing through a fiber-optic cable), or electrical signals transmitted through a wire.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Computer readable program instructions described herein can be downloaded to respective computing/processing devices from a computer readable storage medium or to an external computer or external storage device via a network, for example, the Internet, a local area network, a wide area network and/or a wireless network. The network may comprise copper transmission cables, optical transmission fibers, wireless transmission, routers, firewalls, switches, gateway computers and/or edge servers. A network adapter card or network interface in each computing/processing device receives computer readable program instructions from the network and forwards the computer readable program instructions for storage in a computer readable storage medium within the respective computing/processing device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Computer readable program instructions for carrying out operations of the present invention may be assembler instructions, instruction-set-architecture (ISA) instructions, machine instructions, machine dependent instructions, microcode, firmware instructions, state-setting data, or either source code or object code written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Smalltalk, C++ or the like, and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the &#x201c;C&#x201d; programming language or similar programming languages. The computer readable program instructions may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider). In some embodiments, electronic circuitry including, for example, programmable logic circuitry, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), or programmable logic arrays (PLA) may execute the computer readable program instructions by utilizing state information of the computer readable program instructions to personalize the electronic circuitry, in order to perform aspects of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Aspects of the present invention are described herein with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems), and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer readable program instructions.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">These computer readable program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general-purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks. These computer readable program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable storage medium that can direct a computer, a programmable data processing apparatus, and/or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the computer readable storage medium having instructions stored therein comprises an article of manufacture including instructions which implement aspects of the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The computer readable program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other device to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other device to produce a computer implemented process, such that the instructions which execute on the computer, other programmable apparatus, or other device implement the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods, and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of instructions, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s).

Storage device <b>130</b> may be implemented using any volatile or non-volatile storage media known in the art for storing data. For example, storage device <b>130</b> may be implemented with a tape library, optical library, one or more independent hard disk drives, multiple hard disk drives in a redundant array of independent disks (RAID), solid-state drives (SSD), random-access memory (RAM), and any possible combination thereof. Similarly, storage device <b>130</b> may be implemented with any suitable storage architecture known in the art, such as a relational database, an object-oriented database, or one or more tables.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Storage device <b>130</b> includes account configuration database <b>132</b>, account transaction database <b>134</b>, account PIN database <b>136</b>, ghost PIN database <b>138</b>, and PIN policies database <b>139</b>. In an embodiment, account configuration database <b>132</b> includes various online banking account information associated with a user, including the account numbers associated with a particular user, account owners, account co-owners, and authorized users of a particular banking account. In an embodiment, account transaction database <b>134</b> includes a transaction history associated with user banking accounts, including account balances, account transaction amounts, number of transactions related to a particular account, frequency of transactions for a particular account, third party account information in those instances where a user transfers funds to another parties account, location of transactions utilizing a particular account, and the point of sale device or application used to make a transaction. In an embodiment, account transaction database <b>134</b> includes information on when and where a banking card, such as a debit or credit card, linked to the account is used. For example, if a user uses their debit card for a $20 ATM withdrawal at a gas station in Boston, Mass., dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> will store the location of the transaction, the time of the transaction, and the amount of the transaction in account transaction database <b>134</b>. In an embodiment, account transaction database <b>134</b> includes information on the number of times or frequency the user uses their banking card, such as a debit or credit card, at certain locations. For example, if a user makes a transaction with their debit card twice a week at an ATM at gas station A in Boston, Mass. and once a week at a restaurant in Somerville, Mass., dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> will store this information in account transaction database <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, account PIN database <b>136</b> includes various account access information (i.e., information to login or access a particular account), including primary account numbers, and primary account PINs or passwords. The account PIN or password can include any information such as a QR code, numerical, or alphabetical code required to gain access to the bank account. In an embodiment, ghost PIN database <b>138</b> includes various ghost account access information (i.e., information to login or access a particular account), including ghost account numbers, and ghost account PINs or passwords. In an embodiment, a ghost account PIN is an alternate PIN associated with an alternate account linked to a primary account.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein, a ghost account shall mean an alternate account linked to a primary account and a ghost PIN shall mean an alternate PIN used to access an alternate account linked to a primary account. As used herein, the terms ghost account and ghost PIN may be used interchangeably with the terms alternate account and alternate PIN. Each ghost account is accessible via a unique PIN and includes a subset or percentage of the funds included in a user's primary account. In an embodiment, the balance of a ghost account can be dynamically altered to include a greater or lesser percentage of the funds included in a user's primary account. For example, a user's primary account may include $10,000 and is accessible by entering the PIN <b>123</b>. Similarly, a first ghost account linked to the user's primary account may include $1,000 (10% of the balance of the primary account) and is accessible by entering the PIN <b>456</b>, and a second ghost account linked to the user's primary account may include $100 (1% of the balance of the primary account) and is accessible by entering the PN <b>789</b>. However, the first ghost account may be altered to reflect a $2,000 balance (20% of the balance of the primary account) and the second ghost account may be altered to reflect a $10 balance (0.1% of the balance of the primary account). In an embodiment, if money is withdrawn from a ghost account, the primary account is updated to reflect the current balance amount. For example, if the primary account balance is $10,000 and $1,000 is withdrawn from the first ghost account, then the primary account balance is updated to $9,000.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment, PIN policies database <b>139</b> includes a dynamic set of rules for automatically determining an optimized decision or action(s) with respect to a user's online banking accounts. In an embodiment, PIN policies database <b>139</b> includes a dynamic set of rules learned from a reinforcement learning algorithm. In an embodiment, PIN policies database <b>139</b> includes information describing different decision-making actions that dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> should take based on contextual information associated with a user. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> determines if a transaction is valid or invalid based on one or more PIN policies corresponding to the received PIN. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> may include a different set of rules for when and where a PIN for accessing an account can be received. For example, PIN policies database <b>139</b> may include one set of rules for if a PIN is received in Boston, Mass. versus Los Angeles, Calif. Continuing with this example, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> may display 100% of a user's bank account balance when the user is in Boston, Mass., but a ghost account that displays only 10% of the user's total bank account balance when the user is in Los Angeles, Calif.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment, a separate PIN policy is created for each PIN used to access a primary account and one or more ghost accounts. In an embodiment, a PIN policy includes one or more rules for dynamically altering a ghost account balance based on a time of day. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> determines that a transaction request is invalid based, at least in part, on determining that a time at which the transaction was initiated is outside of a predetermined allowable time period indicated by the PIN policy. For example, if a rule states that the first ghost account may include $1,000 from 9 am-5 pm, but only $100 from 5 pm-9 am, then dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> dynamically alters the balance of the first ghost account based on the time of day and the particular amount specified by the rule. In an embodiment, a PIN policy includes one or more rules for dynamically altering a ghost account balance based on a location of a user device used to initiate an online banking transaction. For example, if a rule states that the second ghost account may include $100 if the user is in Buffalo, N.Y., $200 if the user is in Rochester, N.Y., and $300 if the user is in Syracuse, N.Y., then dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> dynamically alters the balance of the second ghost account based on a determined location of the user and the particular amounts for particular locations specified by the rule. In an embodiment, an account balance of a ghost account is dynamically altered based on a number of transactions initiated within a particular geographic location or at a particular point of sale device. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> determines a transaction request is invalid if based, at least in part, on determining that a number of transaction requests utilizing the alternate PIN associated with the alternate account linked to the primary account exceeds a predetermined number of transaction requests within a predetermined period of time indicated by the PIN policy. For example, if a rule states that if two transactions are initiated using the first ghost account within a 2 minute period, then dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> automatically changes the account balance of the first ghost account to zero based on detecting two transactions for the same account initiated within a 2 minute period. In another example, if a rule states that if two transactions are initiated using the second ghost account on the same ATM within 24 hours, then dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> automatically changes the balance of the second ghost account to 1% of the total balance of the user's primary account if two transactions are initiated on the same ATM within 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an embodiment, point of sale device <b>140</b> is any device where a transaction or withdrawal is attempted. In an embodiment, point of sale device <b>140</b> is the device which the PIN number or password is entered on or transmitted to. For example, point of sale device <b>140</b> can include an ATM, cardless ATM, a bank, a store, a stationary terminal, a point of sale terminal, an online or mobile banking platform or banking application, or a mobile device, such as user device <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, a cardless ATM includes a device which provides access to a user's account or the ability to withdraw funds or deposit funds without the need for a physical card. Instead, cardless ATM's rely on account verification via a two factor verification system, such as a one-time password, PIN, or QR code received via a mobile banking application, text message or email of a user device, such as user device <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> may determine that a request is invalid and generate a message indicating insufficient funds. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> displays the message indicating insufficient funds on user device <b>110</b> and/or point of sale device <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> determines whether a transaction request associated with a primary account or a ghost account is valid based on a PIN policy associated with the account. In an embodiment, whether a transaction request is valid is based, at least in part, on one or more of: (i) the particular PIN or account password received, (ii) a location at which the PIN or account password is received from, (iii) a time at which the PIN or account password is received, (iv) a location at which a transaction is made using a particular account and PIN/password combination, (v) the particular point of sale device that the transaction request was initiated on, and (vi) a number of times the user previously has used their PIN/password at a particular location and/or on a particular point of sale device to initiate a transaction request.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> identifies that a PIN has been entered by a user. In an embodiment, the PIN is received by a mobile banking application platform, mobile payment service platform, or point of sale device, such as an ATM or cardless ATM. In an embodiment, the PIN is representative of a PIN, password, code, or QR code. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> determines one or more PIN policies for respective online banking accounts of a user. In an embodiment, the PIN policy is selected based on the PIN, password, code or QR code received. In an embodiment, the PIN policy is selected based on one or more of the locations that a PIN is received from, the time of receipt of a PIN, and a number of times the user previously has used their PIN at the same location or on the same point of sale device. For example, if a ghost PIN is received from an ATM that the user has never visited before, the PIN policy may include a rule to display a ghost account amount of 10% of a primary bank account linked to the ghost account. In another example, if a PIN is received from a cardless ATM that the user typically visits three times a week, the PIN policy may include a rule to determine that the transaction is valid and display the full bank account balance to the user. In another example, if two ghost PINs are received from the same or different location within a predetermined amount of time, the PIN policy may include a rule to shut down all bank accounts associated with the user.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> determines if an online banking transaction is valid. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> determines if the online banking transaction is valid based on the PIN received. For example, if 0333 is a ghost PIN and 0529 is the primary account PIN, if dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> receives PIN 0333, it will determine the transaction is invalid. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> determines if the transaction request is valid based on the amount requested. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> determines if a transaction request is invalid based on the location of a device that initiated the transaction request being outside of a predetermined allowable geographic area indicated by the PIN policy. For example, if the user typically requests $100 from an ATM in Boston, Mass., but then is requesting $1000 from an ATM in Austin, Tex., dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> may determine the transaction is invalid. In an embodiment, if it is determined that a transaction for a ghost account is valid, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> authorizes the transaction request and updates the primary account balance based on the transaction amount associated with the ghost account.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> shuts down the primary bank account based on the PIN policy. In an embodiment, if the PIN policy determines the primary bank account needs to be shut down, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> shuts down or freezes the primary bank account for a predetermined period of time.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> dynamically adjusts a ghost account balance based on the PIN policy. For example, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> dynamically adjusts the ghost account based on one or more of the time of day the PIN is used, the location the PIN is used, and the frequency the PIN has been used at a particular location or device in the past. For example, a PIN received from an ATM the user frequents almost every Friday at 5 pm will trigger dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> to adjust the ghost account balance to a higher amount than a PIN received from an ATM in a city a PIN has never been received from for a user. For example, if a PIN is received from an ATM in Buffalo, N.Y. where dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> has never received a PIN from for this account, the PIN policy includes a rule to adjust the ghost account balance to 10% of the normal bank account balance. Typically, when a PIN is received from a location the user has never provided a PIN from before, the higher probability that the transaction request is suspicious. In this example, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> adjusts the balance of the ghost account to reflect 10% of the normal bank account balance. In this example, if there is $10,800 in the normal bank account, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> adjust the balance of the ghost account to $1080. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> generates a message indicating the dynamically altered allowable transaction limit. In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> displays the message indicating the dynamically altered allowable transaction limit on user device <b>110</b> and/or point of sale device <b>140</b>. In this example, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> displays the message indicating the dynamically altered allowable transaction limit on point of sale device <b>140</b> is $1080.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another embodiment, if the PIN received is from an ATM in Austin, Tex. the user frequents one or twice a week at 5 pm, and the PIN policy includes a rule to adjust the ghost account balance to 50% of the normal bank account balance, then dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> adjusts the balance of the ghost account to reflect 50% of the normal bank account balance. In this example, if there is $10,800 in the normal bank account, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> adjusts the balance of the ghost account to $5400. However, in this same example, if a PIN is received from the same ATM in Austin, Tex. at 3 am on a Sunday, it is more likely that the transaction request is suspicious, and thus, dynamic online banking honeypot system may be triggered to adjust the ghost account balance by a greater amount (e.g., 20% of the primary account balance).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an embodiment, dynamic online banking honeypot system <b>101</b> displays the ghost account balance.

Rather, embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, network bandwidth, servers, processing, memory, storage, applications, virtual machines, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics, at least three service models, and at least four deployment models.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Characteristics are as follows:</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">On-demand self-service: a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service's provider.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Broad network access: capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Resource pooling: the provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Rapid elasticity: capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned, in some cases automatically, to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Measured service: cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Service Models are as follows:</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Software as a Service (SaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based e-mail). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Platform as a Service (PaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Deployment Models are as follows:</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Private cloud: the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on-premises or off-premises.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Community cloud: the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on-premises or off-premises.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Public cloud: the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Hybrid cloud: the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness, low coupling, modularity, and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure that includes a network of interconnected nodes.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram depicting a cloud computing environment <b>50</b> in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention.
