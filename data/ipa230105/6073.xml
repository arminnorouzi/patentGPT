These embodiments may provide a mechanism to achieve easy access directly to the PV cells, without having the electronics (e.g., capacitance of a DC-DC converter) obstruct various critical measurements such as measurements of the PV modules. In certain embodiments, flash testing of the PV modules requires a quick response time and elimination of capacitance to achieve consistent measurements. Thus, it has been found that flash tests are impacted negatively where there is a delay in measuring the results and/or where capacitance is disposed between the test points and the PV modules. Hence, it has been found in many embodiments that flash testing of the PV module requires a bypass that does not increase response time and/or is negatively impacted by capacitance. As part of the production process, many PV module manufacturers perform a &#x201c;flash test&#x201d; of modules, in which the module is exposed to a short intense flash of light, and the output of the PV cells is measured. One of the purposes of such a test is to verify that the cells are all connected and measure at the actual power rating of the module (since there may be, at times, a large variance in performance between seemingly-identical modules). It has been determined that capacitance and delays in the measurement impact accuracy of the flash test results. Hence, a bypass mechanism is needed to accurately measure these modules without degradations in the measurements. For example, a parallel connection of the PV cells and electronics may hinder and skew the test results when the impedance of the electronics interferes with the measurement. Further, embodiments have also encountered problems when flash testing is performed prior to connecting the junction box with the electronics. It has been found in some embodiments that testing the module with its final electronics installed often provides improved test parameters and reliability.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to some aspects as described herein, a method may be provided that comprises bypassing electronics of a photovoltaic module by switching out the electronics and switching in a bypass circuit. The photovoltaic module may comprise a first plurality of terminals, the bypass circuit may comprise a bypass module that comprises a second plurality of terminals, and the bypassing may comprise electrically coupling at least some of the first plurality of terminals with the second plurality of terminals. The bypass module may further comprise a third plurality of terminals, and the bypassing may comprise removing the third plurality of terminals from being electrically coupled with the first plurality of terminals prior to the electrically coupling of the at least some of the first plurality of terminals with the second plurality of terminals. In some aspects, the photovoltaic module may comprise a first plurality of terminals, the bypass circuit may comprise a structure that, when physically coupled with the first plurality of terminals, causes at least some of the first plurality of terminals to be electrically shorted to one another in order to perform the bypassing. Prior to the bypassing, the electronics may be electrically coupled to a circuit node configured to be coupled to a string of photovoltaic cells, and the bypassing may comprise electrically disconnecting the electronics from the circuit node. Additionally or alternatively, prior to the bypassing, the electronics may be coupled in series between a first circuit node and a second circuit node (the first circuit node may be configured to be coupled to a string of photovoltaic cells), and the bypassing may comprise disconnecting the electronics from the first circuit node and the second circuit node and electrically coupling the bypass circuit so as to electrically couple the first circuit node with the second circuit node.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to further aspects, an apparatus may be provided that comprises a first circuit node configured to be electrically coupled to a string of photovoltaic cells, a second circuit node, a third circuit node, a fourth circuit node, and electronics electrically coupled in series between the third terminal and the fourth circuit nodes.

The bypass circuit may be additionally or alternatively configured such that, in the first state, the third circuit node is electrically disconnected from the first circuit node and the fourth circuit node is electrically disconnected from the second circuit node, and/or in the second state, the first circuit node is electrically disconnected from the second circuit node. In some embodiment, the bypass circuit may comprise a first switch configured to selectively electrically couple together the first and second circuit nodes in the first state, a second switch configured to selectively electrically couple together the first and third circuit nodes in the second state, and a third switch configured to selectively electrically couple together the second and fourth circuit nodes in the second state.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still further aspects are directed to a method, comprising bypassing electronics of a photovoltaic module using a bypass circuit, flash testing photovoltaic cells of (e.g., that are part of and/or electrically coupled to) the photovoltaic module while the electronics are bypassed, and reconnecting the electronics by switching in the electronics and switching out the bypass circuit.

In such a case, the reconnecting (e.g., reconnecting the electronics with the photovoltaic cells) may comprise disconnecting the second plurality of terminals from the at least some of the first plurality of terminals and electrically coupling the third plurality of terminals with the first plurality of terminals. In some cases, bypass circuit may alternatively comprise at least one switch that is in a first state during the bypassing and a second state during the reconnecting.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As noted above, this summary is merely a summary of some of the features described herein.

The bypass may be a physical jumper and/or disconnect, an electronic switch such as a relay and/or transistor.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exemplary embodiment where the bypass is activated disconnecting the electronics altogether and bypassing the electronic module. The physical wire represents the bypass of the electronics and the connection of circuit nodes VIN+ to VOUT+. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an exemplary embodiment where the electronics are in-line without the bypass being enabled.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an exemplary embodiment where the bypass mechanism (e.g., a switch) is in normal operating mode with the electronics engaged.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref> it can be seen that the capacitive and/or impedance coupling to VOUT+ may be avoided in this embodiment because the capacitance and/or impedance associated with the electronics may be disconnected from VOUT+, hence allowing for proper testing of the solar cells.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, two different single pole, double throw (or triple throw) switches may be utilized for the bypass. In this example, the negative impacts from the electronics and any associated impedance and/or inductance may be minimized and/or avoided. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be implemented via a diode, physical switch, relay, and/or manual connector. In some embodiments, a manual connector may be more reliable and produce better bypass and testing results.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, in a manual configuration, a worker on a production line and/or a technician in the field may decide to place the PV module in a bypass mode for testing and/or for other operations such as a non-smart mode operation. The worker and/or technician may simply plug in a manual bypass connector to implement manual configuration. This avoids the added costs associated with additional components and the reliability issues that arise with these components.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Of course other embodiments are also contemplated. For example, embodiments may use any combination of manual, automatic and/or semi-automatic implementations. In one exemplary embodiment, the electronics may be configured to wake up (e.g., with auxiliary power supply from PV cells or from internal energy source such as a capacitor or battery) with the connector in bypass (e.g., so the output is routed directly to PV cells), may then perform a self-test to make sure the PV module and all electronics are fully operational, may then pause for a predetermined certain time, and only then switch the bypass to allow power to flow through the electronics. Embodiments with this configuration may have a number of benefits such as during flash testing the cells are directly connected to output (since the wait time is longer than flash test length) and if the electronics are faulty, the bypass stays in its (normally-closed) condition and the PV module may continue to function as a &#x201c;stupid&#x201d; module. The relay/switch may also be semi manual&#x2014;e.g. magnetic reed-relay which may allow a technician or worker to activate or deactivate the bypass from outside the PV module without opening the junction box enclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In still further embodiments, the electronics and/or string diodes may be built directly into the PV module <b>1000</b>. Including these in the PV module allows for greater reliability since the PV module need not be opened for the bypass operation to be implemented. Further, the bypass may be implemented with minimal and/or almost no capacitance and/or impedance interference.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments herein further increase the reliability and testing accuracy by disconnecting the output of the electronics in bypass mode. These embodiments may reduce or eliminate the output capacitance of the electronics which may interfere with the measurements. Some embodiments herein disconnect the DC+ of the electronics output and/or connect the DC+PV cells output to the cable&#x2212;. If both the electronics are connected and the electronics are bypassed, they would both be connected to the DC+ line and in many cases the measurements won't work even if the embedded electronics aren't operating (e.g., it is shorted).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example of an open junction box with an embedded optimizer, where the optimizer may be, for instance, the electronics <b>1004</b>. The junction box may include, be part of, and/or be coupled to solar cell strings <b>1001</b> for passing and/or controlling power provided to solar cell strings <b>1001</b>. The junction box of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> contains an electronics compartment <b>101</b> containing the optimizer, connection compartment <b>102</b> (to the left of reference designator <b>100</b>) containing the input connections to the PV module cells, and output conductors <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>, and ports for a manual and/or electronic bypass mechanism as discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example of the junction box <b>100</b>, further showing the electronics compartment (in this example containing optimizer <b>220</b>). The junction box <b>100</b> may be variously configured such as containing connections <b>210</b>-<b>213</b> from the PV module to the input of the electronics. In this example, at least two terminals <b>210</b> and <b>213</b> (for DC+ and DC&#x2212;) may be used. In certain examples such as in the case of a PV module which uses bypass diodes for its substrings, additional terminals (such as <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>) may be provided and string diodes (e.g., bypass diodes) <b>230</b>-<b>233</b> may be used. Bypass connector terminals <b>201</b>-<b>204</b> may be provided. In this example, there is a DC+ input <b>204</b> from the PV cells, DC+ input <b>203</b> to the optimizer, DC+ output <b>202</b> from the optimizer, and DC+ output <b>201</b> to output cable <b>110</b>, as indicated by reference numbers <b>201</b>-<b>204</b> also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>.

In this example, the electronics compartment may be sealed with a cover <b>301</b>, so the module manufacturer has no access to the electronics and could only connect the module terminals (busbars) through hole <b>302</b>. Cover <b>301</b> may include foam strips <b>750</b> as shown. In this manner, the warranty is not voided and the manufacturer of the PV module can still bypass the electronics for testing of the solar cells directly during manufacturing and/or later in the field.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an example of a junction box as it may be mounted on a module. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> may be configured to have a junction box from the side attached to a module. Busbars from the module may be variously configured such as to come through hole <b>302</b> and connect to terminals <b>210</b>-<b>213</b>. Bypass connector <b>401</b> may also be provided. For example, it may connect the electronics to the output cables, or bypass the electronics and connect (e.g., directly connect) the PV cells to the output cables.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> show an example of a wiring compartment and an implementation of the bypass connector <b>401</b>. In this implementation, the connector may be two sided.

In alternate embodiments, the PV module may be connected in bypass mode&#x2014;in which junction box terminals <b>201</b> and <b>204</b> connect to connector terminals <b>422</b> and <b>421</b> respectively, which may short between terminals <b>201</b> and <b>204</b> (for example, configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and in this manner pass the PV cells' current directly to the output cable.

In this embodiment, the bypass connector may be variously configured. For example, rather than a single two-sided connector, the connector may include either a connector which passes through the electronics (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> with terminals <b>611</b>-<b>614</b>), and/or a connector which bypasses the electronics (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> with terminals <b>621</b>-<b>622</b>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows yet other embodiments of the implementation of the electronics <b>1004</b>. The top implementation shows an exemplary system such as some of the ones discussed herein, in which the negative DC terminal is passed-through and therefore the bypass was performed on the DC+ terminal, while in the bottom implementation the DC&#x2212; isn't just a pass-through connection, so it may also be bypassed in the same manner demonstrated above for the DC+ connection. This is of course an alternate embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> above as well. Further, the same concepts used in these embodiments for DC+ may be used in other embodiments for DC&#x2212; (or may even be used for AC output connections, as might be the case for AC modules in which the embedded electronics convert the DC input from the PV cells to AC output).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of one example of a junction box which may be utilized, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>10</b></figref>.
