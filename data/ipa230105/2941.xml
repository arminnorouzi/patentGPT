The bale net wrap is mainly used for bundling and packaging forage, straw and the like.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The bale net wrap is a kind of knotless net, which is named for bundling straw and forage, and may also be referred to as a wrapping net. It is knitted by a warp knitting machine with high production efficiency. The bale net is characterized by large mesh, and has the functional requirement of a certain bearing strength.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the specific structure of the existing baling net includes a plurality of warp chains <b>1</b> parallel along a warp direction. Each warp chain <b>1</b> consists of a plurality of groups of warp-knitted loop links <b>2</b> connected in series. Insertion wefts <b>3</b> are provided between two adjacent warp chains <b>1</b> along a weft direction to form a net structure. Because of the warp-knitted structure, there are looping structures between the loop links <b>2</b> in each warp chain <b>1</b> and between the insertion weft <b>3</b> and the loop link <b>2</b>. Therefore, there is no knot in the whole net structure, forming a knotless mesh.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the bundling function of the baling net, it is required to have a certain strength along the wrap direction. In actual use, for the existing baling net and the baling nets involved in patents CN202131464U, CN206512385U and CN206376082U, the external force after bundling straw, forage and the like is mainly born by the warp chains <b>1</b>. Therefore, in order to enhance the bearing capacity of the baling net, the bearing capacity of the warp chains <b>1</b> should be increased as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For each warp chain <b>1</b>, it is formed by looping a bundle of looping fibers <b>4</b>. The bundle of looping fibers <b>4</b> may be a single filament or formed by arranging and combining a plurality of filaments in parallel. After warp knitting (looping), loop links <b>2</b> (the structure in the dashed box in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) are formed. The looping fibers <b>4</b> after looping are bent (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), so that the strength is lower than that of the original plain and straight fiber. With the structure characteristics of the warp-knitted loop links, the fineness (denier) of each warp chain <b>1</b> is three times that of the bundle of looping fibers <b>4</b>, but its strength is three times less than that of the bundle of looping fibers <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to improve the bearing capacity of each wrap chain <b>1</b>, two methods may be adopted. One is to improve the strength of each bundle of looping fibers <b>4</b>. The other is to improve the toughness of looping fibers <b>4</b> and reduce the weakening of the strength of looping fibers <b>4</b> caused by bending into loops during warp knitting. In the prior art, the improvement of fiber strength has a certain technical bottleneck, and the weakening of fiber strength caused by looping during warp knitting cannot be avoided.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the &#x201c;baling net&#x201d; disclosed in patent CN205295657U, knitted net yarns are warp-knitted to form net body wefts and net body warps. It further includes knitting insertion yarns, the direction of the knitting insertion yarns is the same as that of the net body wefts and/or net body warps, and the length of the net body warps and/or net body wefts is less than or equal to the length of the corresponding knitting insertion yarns. The purpose of providing the knitting insertion yarns is to use the knitting insertion yarns to adapt to the size of the bale after the net body is broken, so as to effectively realize the function of wrapping the bale again. By inserting the knitting insertion yarns in the directions of wefts and warps, the bale is prevented from scattering after the wefts and warps are broken. In the baling net involved in this application, there is no cooperation between the insertion yarns and the wefts or warps during wrapping, and the insertion yarns only work after the wefts or warps are broken. In fact, when the wefts or warps are broken, the insertion yarns need to be used to prevent the bale from scattering, which requires that the strength of the insertion yarns is higher than that of the wefts or warps, that is, insertion yarns with higher strength need to be used, so that it will inevitably and greatly increases the weight and production cost of the baling net. Obviously, it cannot solve the problem of weakened fiber strength caused by looping during warp knitting.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As found in search, there is no technical solution at home and abroad to improve the overall structural strength of the baling net by reducing the weakening of the fiber strength caused by looping during warp knitting without increasing the strength of a single bundle of looping fibers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">1. Technical Problems to be Resolved by the Present Invention</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Aiming at solving the problem that the existing warp-knitted looped chain structure reduces the bearing capacity of the knitted chain of the baling net due to weakening of the fiber strength, the present invention is directed to provide a warp-inserted warp chain knitted chain structure for a knitted net and a baling net using the same.

The warp-inserted warp chain knitted chain structure is formed by combining two parts, i.e., a warp-knitted chain L and an insertion warp <b>5</b> plainly and straightly inserted into the warp-knitted chain L. The warp-knitted chain L is formed by serially connecting loop links <b>2</b> formed through warp knitting of looping fibers <b>4</b>.

Compared with the existing warp-knitted looped chain structure, under the same knitted chain denier, the plain and straight insertion warp and the warp-knitted chain are used to jointly bear the load born by the warp chain, the insertion warp does not have the problems of bending and weakened strength, and the strength of the knitted chain is improved, thus improving the overall strength of the baling net with the warp-inserted warp chain knitted chain structure. In addition, under the condition that the fineness (denier) of warp chains is certain, the overall strength of the knitted chain can be maximized to consider the performance and price of the baling net at the same time by optimizing the ratio of the denier of the looping fibers to the denier of the insertion warp fibers. Besides, the use of the connecting knots avoids the relative movement between the insertion warp and the loops in the warp direction, and improves the stability of the warp chain knitted chain and the baling net.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0083">The terms &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d;, and &#x201c;straight&#x201d; and similar expressions used in this specification are merely used for the purpose of description.
