While the production facility performs production activities, the dedicated controller controls the production facility by repeatedly executing a control program for production activity, which is stored in the dedicated controller in advance. Further, the dedicated controller sometimes controls the production facility by executing a dedicated control program stored in the dedicated controller in advance in a case where the production facility fails an operation, where changeover for changing the product type to he produced by the production facility is performed, or the like case.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, in order to manage a series of production activities performed by a plurality of production facilities in cooperation, in sonic cases, adopted is a manufacturing execution system (MES) which transmits a manufacturing instruction to the dedicated controller which controls each of the production facilities. The series of production activities include the changeover. In many cases, the dedicated controller for controlling each of the production facilities, which is controlled by the MES, also controls each production facility by executing the control program stored in the dedicated controller in advance.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">On the other hand, in recent years, the techniques on action plans have advanced markedly. For example, since both an algorithm and an information equipment for making and managing an action plan have advanced, in various fields such as image recognition, voice recognition, parameter adjustment, combinatorial optimization, anomaly detection, and the like, it is becoming possible to make and manage an action plan for solving the problems by using artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data, or the like. For this reason, it is desired that the techniques on action plans should he used in a production system.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, there are increasing cases where the destination to which a function of making and managing the action plan is given is changed from the dedicated controller provided in the production facility, a personal computer (PC), or the like to an information equipment having high computational processing power, such as a server installed inside a plant where the production facility is located, an edge located inside the plant, a cloud set up outside the plant, or the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the use of advanced techniques on action plans in an actual production system, however, there remains a problem that a high integration cost is needed therefor. This is because there are a limited number of engineers familiar with developments in various platforms where the techniques on action plans are developed. Further, this is also because there are a limited number of engineers who can design a production system since data communicated with the dedicated controller which controls the production facility are different depending on the maker which manufactures the dedicated controller or the use of the dedicated controller. Furthermore, this is still also because there are a limited number of engineers familiar with both the techniques on action plans and the data communicated with the dedicated controller which controls the production facility though this familiarity is needed in order to design a. production system having both a function of making and managing an action plan and a function of communicating with the dedicated controller which controls the production facility.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Then, a technique will be disclosed below, which makes it possible to fill a gap between an engineer who constructs a system on an action plan and another engineer who constructs a production facility, to achieve bridging between the action plan and a production system, and to easily construct the production system in which the system on the action plan and the production facility are coordinated with each other.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">1.2 Outline of Production System</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram schematically showing a production system in accordance with the first preferred embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a. view schematically showing a database included in the production system in accordance with the first preferred embodiment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A production system <b>1</b> of the first preferred embodiment r is a system for performing a prod u c don.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the production system <b>1</b> includes a plurality of production facilities <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>and <b>10</b><i>c, </i>a database <b>12</b>, a control coordination apparatus <b>14</b>, and an action plan generation apparatus <b>16</b>.

For this reason, the controller for controlling the production facility is a dedicated controller in general. The data to be communicated with the dedicated controller are generally different depending on the use of the dedicated controller.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Considered will be a case, for example, where the dedicated controller is a programmable logic controller (PLC). In many cases, the PLC controls many input-output devices to preside over the control of a production device. In many cases. the PLC has a plurality of functions of communicating data with external devices such as other controllers, a personal computer (PC), a server, and the like. In many cases, the data to be communicated is a value of variable in the control program described by a user. For this reason, in a case where the dedicated controller is the PLC, the data to be communicated with the dedicated controller include a value of variable in the control program described by the user in many cases.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, considered will be a case where the dedicated controller is a servo system controller. The servo system controller controls a servo motor. In many cases, the servo system controller communicates a value of a parameter of the servo motor which is set in advance in the servo system controller and a value indicating a control state of the servo motor. For this reason, in the case where the dedicated controller is the servo system controller, the data to be communicated with the dedicated controller include the value of the parameter of the servo motor which is set in advance in the servo system controller and the value indicating the control state of the servo motor in many cases.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Furthermore, considered will be a case where the dedicated controller is a robot controller. The robot controller controls a robot. Further, in order to cause the robot to perform one operation, a plurality of operation commands must be issued to the robot in many cases. Then, in many cases, the robot controller performs the control program to issue the plurality of operation commands to the robot. For this reason, in the case where the dedicated controller is the servo system controller, the data to be communicated with the dedicated controller include an instruction for starting up the control program in many cases.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Moreover, the data to be communicated with the dedicated controller is different depending on the maker which manufactures the dedicated controller. This is because even in a case where the dedicated controllers have the same use, when the makers which manufacture the dedicated controllers are different, parameters used by the dedicated l controllers and specifications of the operations of the dedicated controllers are different.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Still moreover, in a case where the control program to be executed by the dedicated controller is a user program which is generated by the user, the data to be communicated with the dedicated controller are different depending on the specification of the data defined by the user in the user program.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">From these circumstances, it is difficult for engineers other than the production facility designer who perform the design and adjustment of the control program to be executed for controlling the production facility, to grasp the data to be communicated with the dedicated controller in order to perform a desired control of the production facility. In a case, for example, where the control program to be executed by the servo system controller in order to change the value of the parameter of a specific servo motor includes a user program, it is difficult for engineers other than the production facility designer who understands the user program to grasp the control data which must be transmitted to the dedicated controller in order to change the value of the parameter of the specific servo motor.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, in many cases, the production facility designer performs generation and adjustment of the control program of the production facility by using dedicated configuration software provided for each use of the dedicated controller. Furthermore, in many cases, the production facility designer is an engineer in the technical field of machinery or electricity. For this reason, in many cases, the production facility designer does not sufficiently have the ability of software development such as creating of an original software tool, or the like, by using a communication driver used for communicating with the dedicated controller, which is provided by a maker that manufactures the dedicated controller. Therefore, when the software for communicating the data with the dedicated controller is provided, the production facility designer can easily set the parameter by using the software in accordance with the design of the production facility. It is difficult, however, for the production facility designer to develop an original software for each production system.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Subsequently, described will be a program to be executed in the action plan generation apparatus which makes an action plan,</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The techniques on the action plan generation apparatus for making an action plan have advanced markedly, and methods for achieving the software for making an action plan are diversified.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">A software library for operating software of recent years which is used to make an action plan is widely used by research institutes such as universities or the like. For this reason, the operating system (OS) that the software library is adaptable to is open source base Linux (registered trademark) in many cases. On the other hand, the OS that the dedicated configuration software provided for each use of the dedicated controller and the communication driver used for communicating with the dedicated controller, which is provided by the maker which manufactures the dedicated controller, is adaptable to is Windows (registered trademark) manufactured by Microsoft (registered trademark) Corporation in many cases. Therefore, in many cases, the OS that the software library is adaptable to is different from the OS that the configuration software and the communication driver are adaptable to,</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further, the software library for operating the software of recent years which is used to make an action plan is described by a programming language suitable for description of matrix operation in many cases. The programming language is MATLAB (registered trademark), Simulink (registered trademark), Python (registered trademark), or the like. On the other hand, the dedicated configuration software provided for each use of the dedicated controller and the communication driver used for communicating with the dedicated controller, which is provided by the maker which manufactures the dedicated controller are described by C language in many cases. Therefore, in many cases, the programming language describing the software library is different from the programming language describing the configuration software and the communication driver.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">For this reason, in order to achieve the function of making an action plan and the function of communicating with the dedicated controller for controlling the production facility by one software, needed are an operation of redescribing the software library described by the programming language suitable for description of matrix operation, by C language, and another operation of causing the software library adaptable to Linux to be adaptable to Windows. For this reason, the integration cost needed to achieve the function of making an action plan and the function of communicating with the dedicated controller for controlling the production facility by one software becomes high.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to the first preferred embodiment, the action plan calculation unit <b>180</b> can be operated on the software library which is widely used by the research institutes, and it is thereby possible to achieve the production system <b>1</b> which cars communicate with the plurality of production facilities. <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>and <b>10</b><i>c </i>by using simple parameters.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, according to the first preferred embodiment, it is possible to construct the control coordination apparatus <b>14</b> in the development environment of the software that the communication driver used for communicating with the plurality of controllers <b>18</b><i>a, </i><b>18</b><i>b, </i>and <b>18</b><i>c </i>is adaptable to, and the control coordination apparatus <b>14</b> can also communicate with the plurality of controllers <b>18</b><i>a, </i><b>18</b><i>b, </i>and <b>18</b><i>c </i>by using simple parameters.
