For instance, in 5G wireless communication, advanced antennas and radar systems (such as phased antenna array modules) are utilized for beam forming by phase shifting and amplitude control techniques, without a physical change in direction or orientation and further, without a need for mechanical parts to effect such changes in direction or orientation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, a phased antenna array module includes a substrate and a radio frequency (RF) antenna cell provided in relation to the substrate. To design a radio frequency frontend (RFFE), for every phased antenna array module, a designer may also be required to purchase and integrate various semiconductor chips in order to realize their design objectives. The designer may also be required to consider other factors, such as the design of the antenna, various connections, transitions from the antenna cell to the semiconductor chips and the like, which may me quite complex, tedious, and time consuming. Further, impaired antenna impedance matching during scanning or beam forming results in increased return loss (defined as ratio of power returned from an antenna to power delivered to the antenna). Also, the choice of substrate materials is important is thicker substrates are more expensive and may behave as waveguides, adversely affecting radiation of RF waves from the antennas, and resulting in increased loss and lower efficiency. Thus, there is a need for a highly efficient antenna array module with a flexible design for RFFE (in the wireless communication systems) that overcomes the deficiencies in the art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with some aspects of the present disclosure as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Three-dimensional (3-D) antenna array module for use in RF communication system, substantially as shown in and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other advantages, aspects and novel features of the present disclosure, as well as details of an illustrated embodiment thereof, will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exemplary arrangement of 3-D antenna array modules on a printed circuit board (PCB), in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of an antenna cell of a 3-D antenna array module, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a perspective view of an exemplary 3-D antenna array module, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a top view of an exemplary 3-D antenna array module, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates a rear view of an exemplary 3-D antenna array module, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a side view arrangement of antenna cells of a 3-D antenna array module on a PCB, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Certain embodiments of the disclosure may be found in a 3-D antenna array module for use in RF communication system.

The material of the raised antenna patch <b>202</b> may be copper, stainless steel, or any other conductive material.

The improved matching conditions, scan range, and bandwidth are attributed to factors, such as the shape of the raised antenna patch <b>202</b> (for example, the projections <b>206</b><i>a, </i><b>206</b><i>b, </i><b>206</b><i>c, </i>and <b>206</b><i>d</i>), the use of air as dielectric to obtain the desired height of the raised antenna patch <b>202</b> at low cost, and shielding fence around the 3-D antenna cell <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with an embodiment, the raised antenna patch <b>202</b> uses air as a dielectric, instead of using solid material (such as FR4) as a dielectric, and thus may present several advantages. For example, air, unlike typical solid dielectrics, does not excite RF waves within the dielectric or on the surface thereof, and thus decreases power loss and increases efficiency. Moreover, since top plate <b>204</b> may have an increased height, the bandwidth of the raised antenna patch <b>202</b> with air dielectric may be significantly improved without increasing manufacturing cost. Furthermore, the use of air as the dielectric is free of cost, and may not result in formation of a waveguide since RF waves would not be trapped when air is used as the dielectric. In addition, the raised antenna patch <b>202</b> having the projections <b>206</b><i>a, </i><b>206</b><i>b, </i><b>206</b><i>c, </i>and <b>206</b><i>d </i>may provide improved matching with transmission lines, thereby, delivering power to the antenna over a wide range of scan angles, resulting in lower return loss.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a perspective view of an exemplary 3-D antenna array module, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.
