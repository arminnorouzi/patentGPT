id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">An accelerator device includes a pedal lever, at least one drive source, a power transmission mechanism, and a locking mechanism. The pedal lever operates in response to a depressing operation. The drive source is configured to exert a reaction force as a force in a returning direction to the pedal lever. The power transmission mechanism transmits a drive force from the drive source to the pedal lever. The locking mechanism is capable of regulating the operation of the pedal lever.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="192.87mm"

end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Hereinafter, examples of the present disclosure will be described.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to an example of the present disclosure, an accelerator pedal module includes an actuator. Specifically, an actuator is driven by a solenoid and is engaged with a rotational member to exert a force in a returning direction.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In this example, the accelerator pedal module has the rotational member driven by the actuator, and has a relatively large physical size. In addition, when a mechanism to fix the accelerator pedal when it is unnecessary to operate the accelerator pedal, such as during, e.g., automated driving, is provided, the physical size may be further increased to result in a complicated structure.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to an example, an accelerator device comprises a pedal lever configured to operate in response to a depressing operation. The accelerator device further comprises at least one drive source configured to exert a reaction force to the pedal lever in a returning direction. The accelerator device further comprises a power transmission mechanism configured to transmit a drive force from the drive source to the pedal lever. The accelerator device further comprises a locking mechanism configured to regulate an operation of the pedal lever. The accelerator device is thus configured to exert a reaction force to a pedal lever and also capable of appropriately regulating an operation of the pedal lever as required.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Hereinbelow, an accelerator device according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings. In the following plurality of embodiments, substantially the same components are denoted by the same reference numerals, and a description thereof is omitted.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The first embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>. An accelerator device <b>1</b> is configured to be attachable to a floor panel forming a part of a vehicle body of a vehicle and not shown. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, the accelerator device <b>1</b> includes a case <b>10</b>, a pedal lever <b>20</b>, a motor <b>40</b> serving as a drive source, a power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>, and the like. The case <b>10</b> is attachable to the vehicle body, and contains therein an internal movable mechanism such as a pedal <b>35</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or the like illustrates a state in which a cover provided on a front side of the case <b>10</b> over a surface of a paper sheet and not shown is detached, and shows a portion of a cover surface serving as a cross section is shown with hatching.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The pedal lever <b>20</b> includes a pad <b>21</b>, an arm <b>31</b>, and the pedal <b>35</b>, and is integrally driven by a depressing operation by a driver or the like. The pad <b>21</b> is provided to allow the driver to perform the depressing operation thereon. The pad <b>21</b> is supported by a supporting point member <b>23</b> provided in the case <b>10</b> to be rotatable with respect to the case <b>10</b>. The pedal lever <b>20</b> in the present embodiment is a so-called &#x201c;floor-standing type&#x201d; in which the pad <b>21</b> is provided to extend in a direction along one surface of the case <b>10</b>. It is assumed that a wall portion of the case <b>10</b> facing the pad <b>21</b> is a top wall portion <b>11</b>. A side surface guard <b>24</b> is a member that guards a gap between the pad <b>21</b> and the case <b>10</b> so as to prevent a foot of the driver from being caught between the pad <b>21</b> and the case <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The arm <b>31</b> connects the pad <b>21</b> and the pedal <b>35</b> to each other. In the top wall portion <b>11</b> of the case <b>10</b>, an opening through which the arm <b>31</b> is to be inserted is formed. The opening through which the arm <b>31</b> is to be inserted is formed so as not to interfere with the arm <b>31</b> in an entire range of a pedal operation.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The pedal <b>35</b> is contained in an inner space of the case <b>10</b>, and includes a shaft portion <b>351</b> and a connecting portion <b>352</b>. The shaft portion <b>351</b> is supported to be rotatable with respect to the case <b>10</b>. The connecting portion <b>352</b> is formed so as to extend from the shaft portion <b>351</b> substantially along the top wall portion <b>11</b>. An end portion of the connecting portion <b>352</b> opposite to the shaft portion <b>351</b> is engaged with the arm <b>31</b>. Accordingly, by an operation performed by the driver on the pad <b>21</b>, the pad <b>21</b>, the arm <b>31</b>, and the pedal <b>35</b> are integrally driven.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">A pedal biasing member <b>37</b> is a compression coil spring having one end fixed to the pedal <b>35</b> and another end fixed to the case <b>10</b> to bias the pedal <b>35</b> toward the top wall portion <b>11</b>. When the pad <b>21</b> is not depressed by the driver, the arm <b>31</b> comes into contact with a fully closed stopper <b>17</b> formed inside the top wall portion <b>11</b>. Meanwhile, when the pad <b>21</b> is depressed, the pad <b>21</b> comes into contact with a fully open stopper formed outside the top wall portion <b>11</b> and not shown. It is assumed hereinbelow that a state in which the arm <b>31</b> is in contact with the fully closed stopper <b>17</b> is an &#x201c;accelerator fully closed state&#x201d;, and a state in which the pad <b>21</b> is in contact with the fully open stopper is an &#x201c;accelerator fully open state&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">An accelerator position sensor <b>39</b> generates an accelerator position signal according to a rotation angle of the shaft portion <b>351</b>. The accelerator position sensor <b>39</b> has a detection circuit including a Hall element that detects, e.g., an orientation of a permanent magnet embedded in the shaft portion <b>351</b>. It is sufficient for the accelerator position sensor <b>39</b> to be able to detect an acceleration position, and an element other than the Hall element may also be used instead.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The accelerator position signal is output to an ECU <b>99</b> serving as a control unit via a connector not shown.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The motor <b>40</b> is, e.g., a DC motor and is provided on a side of the arm <b>31</b> with a leading end of the pad <b>21</b>. The ECU <b>99</b> controls driving by the motor <b>40</b> on the basis of detection values from the accelerator position sensor <b>39</b> and a position sensor <b>49</b> and the like. A drive force of the motor <b>40</b> is transmitted to the pedal lever <b>20</b> via the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>. Thus, the pedal lever <b>20</b> is driven by the drive force of the motor <b>40</b>. The accelerator device <b>1</b> in the present embodiment is configured such that, by providing the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>, the drive force of the motor <b>40</b> is allowed to actively drive the pedal lever <b>20</b> in an accelerator closing direction (hereinafter referred to appropriately as a &#x201c;returning direction&#x201d;). Meanwhile, a direction in which the accelerator pedal is opened is referred to appropriately as a &#x201c;depressing direction&#x201d;. Illustration of the accelerator position sensor <b>39</b>, the ECU <b>99</b>, and the accelerator opening/closing directions is omitted in the drawings other than <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Prior to a detailed description of the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b>, exerting of a reaction force by an actuator to the pedal lever <b>20</b> and a locking mechanism will conceptually be described. It is assumed herein that a sequence of configurations that transmit power from the drive source to the pedal lever <b>20</b> via the power transmission mechanism is the &#x201c;actuator&#x201d;. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, when the power transmission mechanism <b>50</b> is configured to include a linear motion member such as a rack gear and a compression spring, the linear motion member is driven by the motor <b>40</b> to move to be able to drive the pedal lever <b>20</b> in the accelerator closing direction.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>, the linear motion member may also directly drive the pedal lever <b>20</b> without using a spring.

In addition, the reaction force can be adjusted in response to a request from the driver or according to a vehicle type. Furthermore, by fixing the pedal lever <b>20</b> when an accelerator operation is unneeded such as during automated driving, it is possible to allow the pedal lever <b>20</b> to be used also as the footrest serving as a rest for a foot or keep the pedal lever <b>20</b> from being depressed to prevent a misstep.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The power transmission mechanism <b>50</b> includes the reaction-force-adjustment biasing member <b>54</b>, and transmits the drive force from the motor <b>40</b> to the pedal lever <b>20</b> via the reaction-force-adjustment biasing member.
