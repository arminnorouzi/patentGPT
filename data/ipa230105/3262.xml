id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A hydraulic transformer clutch enables controlled power transfer from an outer race to an output shaft. The outer race is driven by a rolling element and generates spin against its own axis. The rolling element is in contact with a rotating lever, which can rotate against a pin. A boss keeps the rolling element in contact with the rotating lever. The rotating lever is actuated by a piston via a contact surface. During the actuation process, the rotating lever wedges the rolling element, creating a rigid connection between the outer race and the output shaft. This connection, and resulting engagement of the outer race and the output shaft, is maintained as long as the piston is actuated.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to hydraulic transformer coupling components for automobiles and other wheeled vehicles.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Relatively simple hydraulic systems have been used for thousands of years and throughout the history of civilization, such as for irrigation and the provision of mechanical power using, for example, water wheels. In modern times, hydraulic systems have become increasingly sophisticated, and are used in a wide variety of industries for a wide variety of purposes. In general, hydraulic systems use liquids, and particularly pressurized liquids, to generate, control, and transmit mechanical power.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A clutch is a mechanical device which engages and disengages power transmission from a driving shaft to a driven shaft. In order to transfer torque from an internal combustion engine to a vehicle transmission, a clutch is required to engage and interrupt torque transmission when necessary based on the operating conditions of the vehicle. Dry clutches in one or more configurations are often used to increase the transfer surface. Complexity, torque ripple and actuation frequently associated with wear due to dry friction are a few reasons for the continuing development of clutches.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Motorcycles typically employ a wet clutch, with the clutch positioned in the same oil as the transmission. These clutches usually comprise a stack of alternating plain steel and friction plates. Some plates include lugs on their inner surfaces that lock them to the engine crankshaft. Wet clutches have a large engagement threshold, assuring a smooth engagement, and have higher durability and lower noise.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A dual clutch transmission (DCT) (sometimes referred to as a twin-clutch transmission) is a type of automatic transmission or automated automotive transmission. A dual clutch transmission provides automatic control, avoiding the use of an energy inefficient torque converter of typical automatic transmissions. A dual clutch transmission uses a pair of clutches, one clutch engaging odd-numbered gear sets and the other clutch engaging even-numbered gear sets. A dual clutch transmission can fundamentally be described as two separate manual transmissions (with their respective clutches) contained within one housing, and working as a single unit. A dual clutch transmission is usually operated in a fully automatic mode, providing a smooth and fast engagement of the active gear sets, well beyond the shifting capabilities of an operator. A dual clutch transmission also allows the vehicle operator to manually shift gears in semiautomatic mode. However, the structure of the transmission is complex, and thus expensive.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Dual clutch transmissions use two fundamentally different types of clutches: either two wet multi-plate clutches, bathed in oil (for cooling), or two dry single-plate clutches. The wet clutch design is generally used for higher torque engines, whereas the dry clutch design is generally more suitable for smaller vehicles with lower torque outputs. However, while the dry clutch variants may be limited in torque compared to their wet clutch counterparts, the dry clutch versions offer an increase in fuel efficiency, due to the lack of pumping losses of the transmission fluid in the clutch housing. Wet clutches generally have a wide engagement threshold and are easy to use, assuring a smooth engagement with a higher durability and lower noise than dry clutch variations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently, three variations of clutch installation are generally used. A first variation uses a concentric arrangement, where both clutches share the same plane when viewed perpendicularly from the transmission input shaft, along the same centerline as the engine crankshaft. In order to actuate them separately, one of the clutches must be larger in diameter than the other. As a result, different forces and control requirements apply for the two clutches. A second variation uses a side-by-side arrangement of two identically sized clutches around the rotational axis of the crank shaft, which increases space requirements. A third variation also uses two separate but identically-sized clutches arranged side-by-side when viewed head-on (along the length of the input shaft and crankshaft centerline), and also share the same plane when viewed perpendicularly. This clutch arrangement (unlike the other two variations) requires an additional gear set to assure the same rotational direction of the output shaft.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The current operation of dual clutch transmissions has a number of disadvantages, including different drag torques in subsequent gear ratios, manufacturing cost, and the amount of drag torque. Based on manufacturing limitations, current solutions are not scalable. In order to obtain a different transmission torque, the clutch must be resized.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, technological improvements of the present disclosure involve overcoming the above shortcomings of the prior art, including overcoming limitations related to configuration/assembly, cost, reduced drag torque and differentiating drag torque for the different transmission gears involved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Briefly stated, a hydraulic transformer clutch is disclosed that enables controlled power transfer from an input element to an output element.

Several different embodiments of the Hydraulic Transformer Clutch system are described below.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref> illustrates a Hydraulic Transformer Clutch with a radial hydraulic motor and braking system <b>10</b>, according to at least one illustrated embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the hydraulic transformer clutch system and method <b>10</b> with a planetary roller <b>26</b> and latching solenoid <b>46</b> is shown in a disengaged position. In the disengaged position, the planetary roller <b>26</b> is free to rotate around the outer race <b>22</b> between the pulley and the shaft.

In the engaged position, the planetary roller <b>26</b> wedges between the moon arm (rotating lever <b>30</b>) and the outer race <b>22</b>, thereby locking the two together. Notably, lower power is required to maintain engagement in this embodiment since the latching solenoid <b>46</b> requires little to no power to remain engaged.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some embodiments, the hydraulic transformer clutch system and method <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C</figref>, enables controlled power transfer from an input element (e.g., outer race) <b>22</b> to an output shaft <b>24</b>.

The rolling element <b>26</b> is in contact with a rotating lever <b>30</b>, which may rotate against a pin <b>28</b>. A boss <b>32</b> keeps the rolling element <b>26</b> in contact with the rotating lever <b>30</b>, which is actuated by a piston <b>36</b> via a contact surface <b>34</b>. In the actuation process, the rotating lever <b>30</b> wedges the rotating element <b>26</b>, creating a rigid connection between the outer race <b>22</b> and the output shaft <b>24</b>.

The piston stroke of each piston <b>912</b> within each hydraulic cylinder <b>910</b> is relatively short. Notably, the rolling engagement element <b>914</b> reduces friction during the engagement process, before full coupling occurs. The force transmission from the piston <b>912</b> to an inner ring (i.e., the output disc <b>916</b>) is accomplished using two contact surfaces; (1) the contact surface between the piston <b>912</b> and the rolling engagement element <b>914</b>, and (2) the contact surface between the rolling engagement element <b>914</b> and the inner ring (i.e., the output disc <b>916</b>).
