For example, certain example embodiments may generally relate to systems and/or methods for improved signaling of small data transmission (SDT).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Examples of mobile or wireless telecommunication systems may include the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), Long Term Evolution (LTE) Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN), LTE-Advanced (LTE-A), MulteFire, LTE-A Pro, and/or fifth generation (5G) radio access technology or new radio (NR) access technology. 5G wireless systems refer to the next generation (NG) of radio systems and network architecture. A 5G system is mostly built on a 5G new radio (NR), but a 5G (or NG) network can also build on the E-UTRA radio. It is estimated that NR provides bitrates on the order of 10-20 Gbit/s or higher, and can support at least service categories such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency-communication (URLLC) as well as massive machine type communication (mMTC). NR is expected to deliver extreme broadband and ultra-robust, low latency connectivity and massive networking to support the Internet of Things (IoT). With IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication becoming more widespread, there will be a growing need for networks that meet the needs of lower power, low data rate, and long battery life. The next generation radio access network (NG-RAN) represents the RAN for 5G, which can provide both NR and LTE (and LTE-Advanced) radio accesses. It is noted that, in 5G, the nodes that can provide radio access functionality to a user equipment (i.e., similar to the Node B, NB, in UTRAN or the evolved NB, eNB, in LTE) may be named next-generation NB (gNB) when built on NR radio and may be named next-generation eNB (NG-eNB) when built on E-UTRA radio.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For proper understanding of example embodiments, reference should be made to the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of the 4-step RACH based SDT type, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of the 2-step RACH based SDT type, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrates an example of the CG based SDT type (without RACH), according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of the NR RRC state machinery, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example signaling diagram for SDT without anchor relocation, according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate an example signaling diagram depicting an example of SDT without anchor relocation and with just uplink (UL) data, according to an example embodiment;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> illustrate another example signaling diagram depicting the storing of UE-specific DL SDT context at anchor CU-UP for SDT with DL data, according to an example embodiment;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example flow diagram of a method, according to one example embodiment;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example flow diagram of a method, according to an example embodiment;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> illustrates an example block diagram of an apparatus, according to an example embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> illustrates an example block diagram of an apparatus, according to an embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> illustrates an example block diagram of an apparatus, according to an example embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According some aspects, there is provided the subject matter of the independent claims.

Thus, the following detailed description of some example embodiments of systems, methods, apparatuses, and computer program products for improved signaling of small data transmission (SDT), is not intended to limit the scope of certain embodiments but is representative of selected example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The features, structures, or characteristics of example embodiments described throughout this specification may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more example embodiments. For example, the usage of the phrases &#x201c;certain embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments,&#x201d; or other similar language, throughout this specification refers to the fact that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with an embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in certain embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;in some embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;in other embodiments,&#x201d; or other similar language, throughout this specification do not necessarily all refer to the same group of embodiments, and the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, if desired, the different functions or procedures discussed below may be performed in a different order and/or concurrently with each other. Furthermore, if desired, one or more of the described functions or procedures may be optional or may be combined. As such, the following description should be considered as illustrative of the principles and teachings of certain example embodiments, and not in limitation thereof</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As will be discussed in detail below, certain example embodiments provide enhancements that enable UEs in the radio resource control (RRC) inactive state of 5G NR to perform small data transmission (SDT) in a more backhaul signaling efficient manner</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Currently, small and infrequent data transfers that are needed by a UE is in the RRC_INACTIVE state entail that an RRC connection resume is to be made to switch the UE to the RRC connected state, where the small data can be transferred, and then a subsequent suspension of the connection back to the RRC_INACTIVE state will likely occur immediately after the data transfer. This may happen for each and every data transmission, resulting in unnecessary UE power consumption and signaling overhead as well as increased packet latency. However, the NR system has requirements to be efficient and flexible for low throughput short data bursts (e.g. See 3GPP TS 22.891) and to support efficient signalling mechanisms (e.g., signalling is less than payload), and reducing the signalling overhead in general.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Therefore, in 3GPP Release 17, consideration is being given to address the inefficiencies explained above (i.e., signalling overhead and delay associated with state transition from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_CONNECTED to perform a short data transmission). The SDT functionality is important, since a motivation to introduce the RRC_INACTIVE state itself in NR was to be able to transition UEs with infrequent data transmission to a state with minimum signalling overhead and minimum power consumption. The current objectives for enabling SDT in the RRC inactive state include, for UL SDTs for random access channel (RACH)-based schemes (i.e., 2-step and 4-step RACH): identifying a general procedure to enable UP data transmission for small data packets from INACTIVE state (e.g., using MSGA or MSG3), enabling flexible payload sizes larger than the Release 16 common control channel (CCCH) message size that is currently possible for inactive state for MSGA and MSG3 to support user plane (UP) data transmission in uplink (UL), and enabling context fetch and data forwarding (with and without anchor relocation) in inactive state for RACH-based solutions. For transmission of UL data on pre-configured physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) shared resources (i.e., reusing the configured grant type <b>1</b>) when timing advance (TA) is valid, the objectives include identifying a general procedure for SDT over configured grant type <b>1</b> resources from inactive state, enabling configuration of the configured grant type <b>1</b> resources for SDT in UL for inactive state.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the above-noted objectives, three SDT types are being defined as discussed in the following. A UE in RRC_Inactive can transmit UL data as part of the random access, i.e., &#x201c;RA-SDT&#x201d;. For instance, RA-SDT may include &#x201c;4-step RA-SDT&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;2-step RA-SDT&#x201d;. In 4-step RA-SDT, the Msg3 (PUSCH) of the 4-step random access procedure is used to transmit the SDT payload. In 2-step RA SDT, the MsgA (PUSCH) of the 2-step random access procedure is used to transmit the SDT payload. Certain conditions may be defined for the UE to check before being allowed to use a RA-SDT type, such as: the payload should belong to a data radio bearer (DRB)/signaling radio bearer (SRB) allowed for SDT; the data volume should be below a defined data volume threshold; the (cell) Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) should be above a threshold; and/or a legacy RSRP based condition may apply to select between 2-step and 4-step RACH SDT.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A UE in RRC Inactive can transmit UL data on pre-configured PUSCH resources, &#x201c;CG-SDT&#x201d;. In this case, configured grant (CG) type <b>1</b> based PUSCH resources can be used by the UE to transmit the SDT payload, i.e., without a random access procedure, when the UE has a valid timing advance (TA) and other conditions are met. The conditions for CG-SDT may include TA validity conditions and/or further conditions that may be checked before the UE is allowed to use the assigned CG resources. With respect to the TA validity conditions, before using a CG-SDT resource, the UE has to ensure that its last received TA is valid by checking, e.g., that the TA timer (TAT) is running, if a TAT was received, and that the defined TA validity condition(s) are also valid. The latter may be based on an RSRP variation to be compared to RSRP variation thresholds, e.g., similar to the LTE preconfigured UL resources (PUR) based early data transmission (EDT). In addition to the TA validity condition(s) above, further conditions may be defined to be checked before UE is allowed to use the assigned CG resources, such as a combination of the following: the payload should belong to a DRB/SRB allowed for SDT; the data volume should be below a defined data volume threshold; the UE should be in the last serving cell that assigned the resources; the CG resources should be valid; and/or the SS-RSRP of the beam selected for the SDT transmission via a CG based PUSCH resource should be above a defined RSRP threshold.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is noted that in case any of these validation conditions defined for CG-SDT are not met, CG-SDT cannot be used and the UE can fall back to use RA-SDT (i.e., 4-step RA-SDT type or 2-step RA-SDT type, according to the specifications/configuration and validity/selection conditions defined for those SDT types).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, and <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrate examples of the three SDT types discussed above for the single-shot SDT case, i.e., an SDT procedure that includes only one UL data and in addtion only one DL data (optionally). In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of the 4-step RACH based SDT type, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of the 2-step RACH based SDT type, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrates an example of the CG based SDT type (without RACH).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It has been agreed that &#x201c;multi-shot&#x201d; SDT, i.e., an SDT procedure that includes multiple subsequent UL/DL SDT transmissions (without transitioning to RRC_CONNECTED), will be supported. In other words, when a UE is in RRC_INACTIVE, it should be possible to send multiple UL and DL packets as part of the same SDT mechanism and without transitioning to RRC_CONNECTED on dedicated grant.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Specific examples of small and infrequent data traffic that would benefit from the SDT procedure may include at least use cases relating to smanphone applications as well as non-smanphone applications. For instance, smartphone applications may include traffic from instant messaging services, heart-beat/keep-alive traffic from IM/email clients and other apps, and/or push notifications from various applications. Non-smanphone applications may include, for example, traffic from wearables (periodic positioning information, etc.), sensors (Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks transmitting temperature, pressure readings periodically or in an event triggered manner, etc.), and/or smart meters and smart meter networks sending periodic meter readings.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A new independent RRC state, referred to as RRC_INACTIVE, was introduced in 3GPP NR Release <b>15</b> complementing the existing states, RRC_CONNECTED and RRC_IDLE, with the goal of lean signalling and energy-efficient support of NR services. Although the design was conceived particularly for mMTC/MIoT services (e.g., See 3GPP TR 22.824), it could be beneficial to efficiently deliver small/infrequent traffic of eMBB and URLLC services as well. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of the NR RRC state machinery. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the RRC_INACTIVE state enables to more quickly resume an earlier suspended connection and start the transmission of small or sporadic data with a much lower initial access delay and associated signalling overhead as compared to the RRC_IDLE state. This is achieved mainly due to reduced control signalling required for requesting and obtaining the resume of a suspended RRC connection, which results in UE power saving. At the same time, a UE in RRC_INACTIVE is able to achieve similar power savings as in RRC_IDLE, benefiting from, e.g., a much larger period of PDCCH monitoring (e.g., for paging) and relaxed measurements compared to RRC_CONNECTED.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, compared to keeping the UE in RRC_CONNECTED, the new state minimizes mobility signalling both to RAN (e.g., RRC measurement reporting, handover messages) and to the core network (e.g., to/from the AMF) as the UE can move transparently to the RAN within a network defined set of cells (RAN notification area, RNA). The transition from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_INACTIVE, is triggered by the gNB with the transmission of a RRC Release message that includes the suspend configuration information, which includes I-RNTI, RAN-PagingCycle, RAN-NotificationAreaInfo and timer t<b>380</b> (that refers to the timer that controls when the periodic RNA Update (RNAU) procedure should occur at the UE).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is noted that, when a UE is moved to RRC_INACTIVE, the UE Access Stratum (AS) context (referred to as UE Inactive AS Context), necessary for the quick resume of the suspended connection, is maintained both at the UE side and RAN side (at the last serving gNB, aka Anchor gNB), and it is identified at the network side by the UE identifier, i.e., Inactive-RNTI (I-RNTI).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Both SDT solutions with and without anchor relocation are in scope for RA-SDT (context fetch and data forwarding with and without anchor relocation in INACTIVE state for RACH-based solutions), and will be defined in Release 17. It is noted that the decision on whether to perform anchor relocation is up to the network and is transparent to the UE. The working assumption is that the decision is up to the anchor gNB based on assistance information received from the target gNB. The content of such assistance information is still to be decided; however, it could comprise indication of whether the UE has further data to transmit in addition to the payload(s) included in the initial UL SDT transmission.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In SDT with anchor relocation, the target gNB initiates both the UE AS context fetch from the anchor gNB (last serving gNB) and the path switch procedure. After both procedures are complete, the PDCP processing of the UL data received from the UE can take place at the target gNB and the UL data can be forwarded to the UPF. This may be similar to the legacy procedure of RRC connection resume.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In SDT without anchor relocation, the target gNB initiates the UE AS context fetch from the anchor gNB (last serving gNB) but the anchor gNB responds with, e.g., a &#x201c;Retrieve Context Failure&#x201d;. That is, the anchor gNB does not provide the UE AS Context and keeps storing it; also, no path switch takes place, which is beneficial to avoid the heavy associated signalling. This may be similar to the legacy procedure of RNA update without context relocation.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example of a signaling diagram for SDT without anchor relocation. The signalling of SDT without anchor relocation is not optimized in Release 17. Particualrly, the use of a UE-specific RLC context has been agreed for SDT in Release 17. This implies the need for backhaul signalling to fetch the RLC configuration of the UE from the anchor gNB (CU-CP in disaggregated RAN architectures), which may be necessary to process, at the target gNB, the RLC PDU received from the UE. It is noted that such RLC configuration retrieval may be needed even though the UE AS context remains at the anchor gNB (CU-CP), i.e., no context nor anchor relocation takes place in SDT without relocation, as explained above. This results in increased backhaul signaling as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As will be discussed in detail herein, certain example embodiments include methods that make the signalling of SDT without anchor relocation leaner by avoiding the need for RLC context fetch by a target gNB at least for a &#x201c;returning UE&#x201d;. In an embodiment, a &#x201c;returning UE&#x201d; may be defined as a UE that initiates multiple SDT procedures in the same target gNB. In the context of certain embodiments, it may be assumed that each SDT procedure is without anchor relocation to save path switch signalling between RAN and access and mobility management function (AMF). The &#x201c;returning UE&#x201d; scenario can be quite likely, for example, for most smartphone UEs, as a smartphone can be served by the same gNB (e.g., the gNB providing coverage to the end-user home, office, etc.) for an extended period of time (e.g., hours), during which the UE can perform many SDT procedures to transmit small data from smartphone applications (e.g., APP notifications).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, UE-specific UL SDT context may be stored at a previous target node, e.g., target DU/CU-CP, for SDT with UL data. For example, a target gNB (e.g., target CU-CP and/or DU) may store certain UE-specific UL SDT context for a UE in RRC inactive state that previously had initiated an SDT procedure without anchor relocation to the same target DU. According to some embodiments, the stored UE-specific UL SDT context may include at least certain information, which was previously fetched from the anchor gNB (anchor CU-CP) by the target CU-CP via the Xn interface (e.g. triggered by a previous SDT procedure of the UE). For instance, the information included in the stored UE-specific UL SDT context may include one or more of UE-specific RLC context for SDT, F1 UL Tunnel Endpoint Identifiers (TEIDs) associated with the anchor node CU UP of the UE's DRB, and/or UE identifier (e.g. I-RNTI). The UE-specific RLC context for SDT can allow the target DU to be able to immediately perform the RLC processing of the RLC PDU(s) received from a &#x201c;returning UE&#x201d; (i.e., a UE that initiates a second, third, and so forth SDT procedure in the same target DU). It is noted that UE-specific RLC context for SDT includes part or the entire RLC configuration stored in the UE AS Context, to be used for UL SDT transmissions, which comprises the RLC mode per SDT-LCH/DRB (e.g., Acknowledged Mode, AM, or Unacknowledged Mode, UM), and the RLC sequence number (SN) length per SDT-LCH/DRB. The F1 UL TEIDs associated to the anchor node CU UP of the UE's DRBs may allow the target DU to be able to immediately forward the UL RLC SDU received from the UE (after RLC processing) to the anchor CU-UP (where PDCP processing and forwarding to UPF can then take place). The UE identifier (e.g., I-RNTI) can allow for identifying the UE initiating an SDT procedure as a &#x201c;returning UE&#x201d;. Any cell of the target DU can then leverage the stored UE-specific UL SDT context when the UE initiates a new SDT procedure towards any of these cells.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Some example embodiments may include maintaining UE-specific SDT UL context in synchronization in previous gNBs. Further, the anchor gNB may be responsible for updating the UE-specific UL SDT context to any previous target DU of same gNB or different previous gNB when needed, via target CU-CP. For example, an anchor gNB can trigger the update of the UE identifier (e.g., I-RNTI) in any previous target DU or target gNB upon the UE completing a new SDT procedure. Alternatively, the anchor gNB can trigger the discard of the UE-specific UL SDT context at the previous target DU or target gNB, e.g., if the UE resumes the RRC connection. Alternatively, or additionally, the target DU or target gNB can apply a timer-based approach to discard a stored UE-specific UL SDT context. It is noted that at least the I-RNTI may have to be updated after a SDT procedure.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to a further embodiment, a proactive transfer of UE-specific UL SDT context to potential target DUs/CU-CPs without previous SDT for &#x201c;SDT with UL data scenario&#x201d; may be performed. For example, after the first SDT procedure to a target gNB, the target CU-CP may send, to the DUs of the target gNB, the stored UE-specific UL SDT context pro-actively, so that any future SDT procedure to any DU can benefit from the stored UE-specific UL SDT context. It is noted that the UE-specific RLC context contains static information, and also the F1 UL TEID is static for the UE's DRB. Similarly, after receiving an update of the I-RNTI from the anchor CU-CP, the target CU-CP may update its DUs with the updated I-RNTI corresponding to the stored UE-specific UL SDT context.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another aspect, the anchor CU-CP may send pro-actively to some or all neighbor CU-CPs the stored UE SDT context, so that any future SDT procedure to any neighbor gNB can benefit from the stored UE-specific UL SDT context. In case of an update of the I-RNTI, the anchor gNB may send the updated I-RNTI to the involved neighbor gNBs.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some aspects, the proactive transfer of the UE-specific UL SDT context may be made based on a combination of the estimate/knowledge that the UE will be returning in a target DU/CU-CP, e.g., based on the history of UE mobility, and/or the estimate/knowledge that the UE's SDT procedure include more than a certain number of user plane/control plane data packets to transmit and/or receive. For example, no proactive transfer may be done for single-payload SDT scenarios.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Alternatively, in an embodiment, the anchor CU-CP can store the relevant information from the UE AS context or the entire UE AS context in the RAN database (e.g., using a service based architecture solution). The target CU-CP and/or target DU may retrieve the updated information from the RAN database, e.g., upon notification of a change. This will minimize the Xn signaling load at the anchor CU-CP, removing the need for the anchor CU-CP to provide Xn-based updates to all target gNBs.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to a further embodiment, UE-specific DL SDT context may be stored at anchor CU-UP for SDT with DL data. For example, the anchor CU-UP may store a certain UE-specific SDT DL context for a UE in RRC inactive state that previously had initiated an SDT procedure to the same target DU. The stored UE-specific DL SDT context at CU-UP may include at least certain information, which was previously received from the target DU (through target CU-CP and anchor CU-CP, via the F1/Xn interface, e.g., triggered by a previous SDT procedure of the UE to the same target DU). For instance, the information included in the stored UE-specific DL SDT context may include F1 DL TEIDs of the UE's DRBs at target DU. This allows the anchor CU-UP to be able to immediately forward the DL RLC SDU pending for the UE DRB to the target DU.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to yet a further embodiment, proactive transfer of UE-specific SDT DL context to anchor CU-UP for &#x201c;SDT with DL data scenario&#x201d; may be performed. This may be similar to the proactive transfer of UE-specific SDT UL context discussed above, with the difference that the UE-specific SDT context is a DL context, which is transferred to anchor CU-UP and that may include the F1 DL TEID of potential DUs of a previous target node.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate an example signaling diagram depicting an example of SDT without anchor relocation and with just UL data, according to an example embodiment. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the UE-specific UL SDT context may be stored at a previous target node or gNB, e.g., at the target DU/CU-CP, for SDT with UL data.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">More specifically, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, as shown at <b>410</b>, the target DU (e.g., target DU<b>1</b>) may store the UE-specific UL SDT context after a previous SDT procedure of the UE in the same DU for &#x201c;SDT without relocation and with UL data&#x201d;. In an embodiment, the stored UE-specific UL SDT context may include I-RNTI, UE-specific RLC context, and/or F1 UL TEID of the anchor CU UP. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, it is assumed and illustrated that the target DU stores the UE-specific UL SDT context previously fetched. However, alternatively, the target CU-CP (e.g., target CU-CP<b>1</b>) may store the UE-specific UL SDT context and could provide it to the target DU in a new additional F1 message (e.g., F1: UE context Setup procedure), after receiving the F1-C Initial UL Transfer (e.g., as reply to step <b>11</b>, which is not shown in the figure). As further illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, at <b>420</b>, the target DU (e.g., target DU<b>1</b>) may decide whether to apply the stored context based on BSR, and process RLC PDU using stored RLC context.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to some embodiments, an anchor CU-CP may be configured to ensure that the UE-specific UL SDT context is synchronized in previous target gNBs (e.g., previous target DUs/CU-CPs). For example, the anchor CU-CP may store the target gNBs that performed SDT without anchor relocation (note that these may be just in the UE's RNA). As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> at <b>425</b>, the anchor CU-CP may transmit a new Xn message, to one or more of the stored target gNBs (e.g., to a target DU and/or target CU-CP), to update any part of the UE-specific UL SDT context, such as the UE identifier (e.g., I-RNTI). In an embodiment, the target DU and/or target CU-CP may, at <b>430</b>, store the UE-specific UL SDT context and updated UE identifier. For example, in one embodiment, the target CU-CP may store all of the DUs of target gNB towards which the UE performed SDT without anchor relocation previously and will update their UE-specific UL SDT context as received from the anchor CU-CP. Further, in an embodiment, the target DU and/or target CU-CP may, at <b>435</b>, discard the stored UE-specific UL SDT context when needed, e.g., when the UE resumes the RRC connection.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is noted that, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, it may be assumed that the UE had earlier performed an SDT to target DU<b>2</b>, and thus target DU<b>2</b> is storing the UE-specific UL SDT context. In contrast, target DUI may store the UE-specific UL SDT context after the <b>1</b>st SDT procedure of the UE to target DUI has been completed (e.g., as shown in step <b>8</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). Alternatively, the target DUI could also store it pro-actively as outlined above.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, assistance information may be provided from the anchor CU-CP to target DU/CU-CP on whether the UE-specific UL SDT context should be stored and applied by target DU. For example, according to an embodiment, an anchor CU-CP can provide assistance information to target DU/target CU-CP indicating whether the target DU is allowed to store the UE-specific UL SDT context, and/or indicating under which conditions or rules the target DU is allowed to use or apply the stored UE-specific UL SDT context. According to certain embodiments, the assistance information can be provided by the anchor CU-CP, e.g., as a reply to the Xn Context Retrieve Request from the target CU-CP or in the Xn message providing the RRC Release (e.g., see step <b>7</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and similar step <b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) in the form of &#x201c;SDT without anchor relocation allowed&#x201d; indication. That is, the indication may be present (set to true) if the SDT without anchor relocation is suitable for the UE also in future SDT procedures; otherwise, such a field or information may not be present (or present with a &#x201c;not true&#x201d; value). Such an indication allows to avoid violation of the current working assumption that it is up to the anchor CU-CP to determine whether anchor relocation should be performed or not.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to some embodiments, as part of this assistance information, the conditions/rules on whether the target DU is allowed to use the stored UE-specific UL SDT context (when the UE initiates an SDT procedure to the target DU) can include one or more BSR thresholds. For example, if a UE includes a BSR in its initial UL SDT transmission, which indicates a data amount&#x3c;BSR thr<b>1</b>, then the target DU should not use or apply the immediate RLC processing of the received RLC PDUs based on the stored UE-specific UL SDT context (e.g., without contacting the anchor gNB CU-CP before). This is because in this scenario, the gain of using this method may be limited. In another example, if a UE includes a BSR in its initial UL SDT transmission, which indicates a data amount&#x3e;BSR thr<b>2</b> (BSR thr<b>2</b>&#x3e;thr<b>1</b>), then the target DU may be allowed to use or apply the immediate RLC processing of the received RLC PDUs based on the stored UE-specific UL SDT context (e.g., without contacting the anchor gNB CU-CP before). This is because in this scenario, the gain of using this method is greater.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> illustrate another example signaling diagram depicting the storing of UE-specific DL SDT context at anchor CU-UP for SDT with DL data, in addition to the storing of UE-specific UL SDT context at previous target DU/CU-CP for SDT with UL data, according to an example embodiment.

Particularly, when applying certain embodiments, the F1 and Xn backhaul signalling can be decreased for returning UEs since the UE-specific RLC context need not be fetched at every SDT procedure initiated in a target DU not belonging to the anchor gNB. This removes the need for signaling of certain messages during SDT procedure. Further, as a result of certain embodiments, the data latency entailed by SDT for returning UEs can be much shorter, as the data flow can happen immediately. Accordingly, the use of certain example embodiments results in improved functioning of communications networks and their nodes, such as base stations, eNBs, gNBs, and/or IoT devices, UEs or mobile stations.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some example embodiments, the functionality of any of the methods, processes, signaling diagrams, algorithms or flow charts described herein may be implemented by software and/or computer program code or portions of code stored in memory or other computer readable or tangible media, and may be executed by a processor.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some example embodiments, an apparatus may include or be associated with at least one software application, module, unit or entity configured as arithmetic operation(s), or as a program or portions of programs (including an added or updated software routine), which may be executed by at least one operation processor or controller.
