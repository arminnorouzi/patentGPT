id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Water loss to the environment due to the evaporative cooling process is common in cooling towers. Such evaporation is typically in the form of pure water vapor and presents no risk of harm to the environment. Cooling tower splash out occurs when the cooling fluid exits in the air inlet side of the tower. The water droplets are large enough in size and contain enough momentum to travel in the opposite direction of the incoming air and fall outside the cooling tower water basin. Such water droplets can carry chemicals and minerals which have a deleterious impact on the outside environment, such as the corrosion of manmade structures and damage to plant life. Additionally, wet conditions around the exterior of the cooling tower are unsafe for personnel. In addition, it is desirable that louver assemblies prevent light bypass, which reduces algae growth in the cooling tower.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">To combat this problem, the cooling tower industry has developed louver panels, slats and assemblies, which are designed to collect and redirect the splashing out water back into the water basin. There are two main types of louvers&#x2014;slats and panels. Slat style louvers are installed the length of the air inlet in a horizontal fashion. Water that hits the slats bounces back into the tower. This type of louver has a relatively low pressure drop, but provides the least amount of splash out prevention and does little to reduce light by-pass. Panel style louvers use a tubular design to allow air to flow through the tube channels but prevent water from exiting by forming a &#x201c;wall&#x201d; at the inlet. Panel style louvers generally have better light by-pass prevention characteristics than slat-style louvers. Panel style louvers have more limited options for size.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many existing louvers are manufactured out of polymetric or organic material such as PVC, FRP and wood. These products are flammable and have operating temperature limits based the on the material. In some cases, is it desirable to have non-combustible louvers or louvers which have a higher operating temperature range in excess of 125 degrees F. (52 degrees C.). Conventional louver materials also lack a desired level of corrosion resistance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need for a louver assembly system that is modular and able to be used in high-temperature and/or corrosive applications, while maintaining a reasonable cost.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several specific aspects of
