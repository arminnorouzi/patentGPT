In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the present subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art, that embodiments of the present subject matter may be practiced without some or other of these specific details. Examples merely typify possible variations. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, structures (e.g., structural components, such as modules) are optional and may be combined or subdivided, and operations (e.g., in a procedure, algorithm, or other function) may vary in sequence or be combined or subdivided.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure provides technical solutions for optimizing issue reporting in a navigation environment. In example embodiments, a networked system causes presentation of a navigation user interface on a user device of a user (e.g., driver or rider), whereby the navigation user interface includes a route being navigated and navigation instructions. The networked system also causes presentation of one or more issue icons on the user device, whereby each issue icon represents a different type of issue to be reported. A selection of an issue icon from the one or more issue icons is received by the networked system. In response to receiving the selection of the issue icon, the networked system infers a location associated with the issue. The networked system updates a database with the issue and the inferred location. In some cases, the database is updated after the inferred location or the issue is verified.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, the networked system provides an issue reporting system that requires minimal efforts from the user in order to report and issue. Because the user reporting the issue is likely driving a vehicle, the networked system attempts to make the reporting of the issue simple and with as few inputs (e.g., tap on a screen of the user device) as possible. As such, the networked system infers where a location of an issue may be located or a severity of an issue being reported. In some case, the inferred location may be verified by the user (or other users that have reported issues at the inferred location).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, example methods (e.g., algorithms) and example systems (e.g., special-purpose machines) are configured to improve a navigation process and system by providing an efficient issue reporting system that requires minimum input from a user. Because the user provides minimum input, there is a reduction in communications over a network communicatively coupling a user device of the user with the networked system. Therefore, one or more of the methodologies described herein facilitate solving technical problems associated with issue reporting by using trace data and inference to determine locations where issues are occurring and/or the type of issue being reported.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a network environment <b>100</b> suitable for optimizing issue reporting in a navigation environment, according to example embodiments. In some embodiments, the navigation environment comprises a ride sharing or delivery service that requires a driver to navigate from a pick-up location to a drop-off location. The network environment <b>100</b> includes a networked system <b>102</b> communicatively coupled via a network <b>104</b> to a requester device <b>106</b><i>a </i>and a service provider device <b>106</b><i>b </i>(collectively referred to as &#x201c;user devices <b>106</b>&#x201d;). In example embodiments, the networked system <b>102</b> comprises components that receive reports of issues and obtain, store, and analyze trace data received from the user devices <b>106</b> and other sources in order to infer locations where the issue may be located, determine a severity of the issue, and determine whether the reported issue should be verified. The components of the networked system <b>102</b> are described in more detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and may be implemented in a computer system, as described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are communicatively coupled via the network <b>104</b>. One or more portions of the network <b>104</b> may be an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a virtual private network (VPN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless WAN (WWAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a portion of the Internet, a portion of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), a cellular telephone network, a wireless network, a Wi-Fi network, a WiMax network, a satellite network, a cable network, a broadcast network, another type of network, or a combination of two or more such networks. Any one or more portions of the network <b>104</b> may communicate information via a transmission or signal medium. As used herein, &#x201c;transmission medium&#x201d; refers to any intangible (e.g., transitory) medium that is capable of communicating (e.g., transmitting) instructions for execution by a machine (e.g., by one or more processors of such a machine), and includes digital or analog communication signals or other intangible media to facilitate communication of such software.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In example embodiments, the user devices <b>106</b> are portable electronic devices such as smartphones, tablet devices, wearable computing devices (e.g., smartwatches), or similar devices. Alternatively, the service provider device <b>106</b>b can correspond to an on-board computing system of a vehicle. The user devices <b>106</b> each comprises one or more processors, memory, touch screen displays, wireless networking system (e.g., IEEE 802.11), cellular telephony support (e.g., LTE/GSM/UMTS/CDMA/HSDP A), and/or location determination capabilities. The user devices <b>106</b> interact with the networked system <b>102</b> through a client application <b>108</b> stored thereon. The client application <b>108</b> of the user devices <b>106</b> allows for exchange of information with the networked system <b>102</b> via user interfaces as well as in background. For example, the client application <b>108</b> running on the user devices <b>106</b> provides trace data to the networked system <b>102</b>, via the network <b>104</b>, for storage and analysis. The trace data includes, for example, location information (e.g., GPS coordinates, current location in latitude and longitude), speed of a vehicle a user is within when navigating a route, and timing information when navigating the route (e.g., time to traverse the route or a portion of the route). The client application <b>108</b> also receives information from the networked system <b>102</b> and presents the information on various user interfaces. The presented information can include, for example, a navigation route, navigation instructions, issue reporting icons, and verification messages.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In example embodiments, a first user (e.g., a requester) operates the requester device <b>106</b>a that executes the client application <b>108</b> to communicate with the networked system <b>102</b> to make a request for a transportation service such as transport or delivery service (referred to collectively as a &#x201c;trip&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the client application <b>108</b> determines or allows the user to specify a pick-up location (e.g., of the user or an item to be delivered) and to specify a drop-off location for the trip. The client application <b>108</b> also presents information, from the networked system <b>102</b> via user interfaces, to the user of the requester device <b>106</b><i>a</i>. For instance, the user interface can display a request from the networked system <b>102</b> to confirm a pick-up level or address, confirm an issue, or confirm a location associated with the issue.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A second user (e.g., a service provider) operates the service provider device <b>106</b><i>b </i>to execute the client application <b>108</b> that communicates with the networked system <b>102</b> to exchange information associated with providing transportation service (e.g., to the user of the requester device <b>106</b><i>a</i>). The client application <b>108</b> presents information via user interfaces to the user of the service provider device <b>106</b><i>b</i>, such as invitations to provide the transportation service, navigation instructions (e.g., maps), and pickup and drop-off locations of people or items. The client application <b>108</b> also provides data to the networked system <b>102</b> such as a current location (e.g., coordinates such as latitude and longitude) of the service provider device <b>106</b><i>b</i>, timing information, and indications reporting or confirming the issue.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In example embodiments, any of the systems, machines, databases, or devices (collectively referred to as &#x201c;components&#x201d;) shown in, or associated with, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be, include, or otherwise be implemented in a special-purpose (e.g., specialized or otherwise non-generic) computer that has been modified (e.g., configured or programmed by software, such as one or more software modules of an application, operating system, firmware, middleware, or other program) to perform one or more of the functions described herein for that system or machine.

In some embodiments, the device interface <b>202</b> generates and transmits instructions (or the user interfaces themselves) to the user devices <b>106</b> to cause the user interfaces to be displayed on the user devices <b>106</b>. The user interfaces can also be used to request transportation service from the requester device <b>106</b><i>a </i>and display invitations to provide the transportation service on the service provider device <b>106</b><i>b</i>. At least some of the information received from the user devices <b>106</b> are stored to the data storage <b>212</b>, for example, as trace data for each trip.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The UI module <b>204</b> manages generation of user interfaces that are presented, via the client application <b>108</b>, at the user device <b>106</b>. In example embodiments, the UI module <b>204</b> generates and causes presentation of user interfaces (e.g., sends the UI or instructions to generate the UI via the device interface <b>202</b>) on the user devices. In some embodiments, the UI comprises a navigation UI that includes a route for navigating between two locations (e.g., current location and destination, pick-up location and drop-off location). The navigation UI presents navigation instructions for navigating the route (e.g., instructions to turn, exit, take a particular roadway). In some embodiments, the navigation UI also includes a reporting icon to report an issue along the route.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some cases, in response to selection of the reporting icon, the UI module <b>204</b> presents (e.g., causes presentation on the user device <b>106</b>) one or more issue icons whereby each issue icon represents a different type of issue to be reported. The types of issue can include, for example, traffic, an accident, a roadway closure, a turn not allowed, a poor pick-up location, a poor drop-off location, missing roadway, incorrect name for roadway, incorrect one-way street, incorrect side of the street, poor parking locations or waiting spots, poor entrances/exits, or illegal stopping zone. In an alternative embodiment, the one or more issue icons are presents on the navigation UI. In other embodiments, there may be no need for the one or more issue icons. Instead, the reporting engine <b>208</b> can infer what the type of issue is based on trace data, as will be discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The navigation engine <b>206</b> manages generation and monitoring of routes between locations (e.g., a current or pick-up location and a drop-off location). In particular, the navigation engine <b>206</b> determines a route between the locations and presents turn-by-turn navigation instructions along the route. The route, in the form of a map, and navigation instructions are then presented via the UI module <b>204</b> and device interface <b>202</b>. In example embodiments, the navigation engine <b>206</b> monitors a user traversing the route and captures trace data from the monitoring. The trace data can include locations (e.g., latitude and longitude), speed, time, and whether users follow the suggested routes (e.g., followings the navigation instructions).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The reporting engine <b>208</b> is configured to manage issue reporting at the networked system <b>102</b>. In example embodiments, the reporting engine <b>208</b> receives indications of issues in the navigation environment, infers one or more locations where the issue may occur for each issue, scores users on their reporting, and determine severity of the issue. The reporting engine <b>208</b> will be discussed in more detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The data storage <b>210</b> is configured to store information associated with each user of the networked system <b>102</b>. The information includes various trip or trace data, which may be used by the networked system <b>102</b> to, for example, infer locations where an issue occurs or verify a reported issue. In some embodiments, the data is stored in or associated with a user profile corresponding to each user and includes a history of interactions using the networked system <b>102</b>. While the data storage <b>210</b> is shown to be embodied within the networked system, alternative embodiments can locate the data storage <b>210</b> elsewhere and have the networked system <b>102</b> communicatively coupled to the data storage <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating components of the reporting engine <b>208</b>, according to some example embodiments. In example embodiments, the reporting engine <b>208</b> is configured to manage issue reporting at the networked system <b>102</b>. In example embodiments, the reporting engine <b>208</b> receives an indication of an issue from a user. In some cases, the indication includes a type of issue being reported. Based on the indication and trace data associated with the user, the reporting engine <b>208</b> infers one or more locations where the issue may have occurred. In some cases, the reporting engine <b>208</b> scores users on their reporting and uses the scores to determine whether further verification is needed. Further still, the reporting engine <b>208</b>, in some cases, determines severity of the reported issue based on the trace data. To enable these operations, the reporting engine <b>208</b> comprises an inference module <b>302</b>, a scoring module <b>304</b>, a severity module <b>306</b>, and a verification module <b>308</b> all configured to communicate with each other (e.g., via a bus, shared memory, or a switch). The reporting engine <b>208</b> may also comprise other components (not shown) that are not pertinent to example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The issue identification (ID) module <b>302</b> detects a type of issue being reported. In some cases, the type of issue is automatically identified based on a selection of an issue icon shown on the user interface of the user. For instance, if the user selects an issue icon labeled &#x201c;turn not allowed,&#x201d; the issue ID module <b>302</b> detects that the issue is that a navigation instruction indicated a turn that is not legal or possible to make. In another example, if the user selects an issue icon labeled &#x201c;traffic,&#x201d; the issue ID module <b>302</b> detects that the user is reporting that there is traffic along the suggested route. Based on the type of issue being reported, one or more of the other components of the reporting engine <b>208</b> performs operations. For example, the severity module <b>308</b>, in some embodiments, is triggered when traffic is being reported. In some embodiments, the issue ID module <b>302</b> works with the inference module <b>304</b> to detect the type of issue being reported as discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The inference module <b>304</b> infers one or more locations where an issue being reported may be located. Because the networked system <b>102</b> attempts to limit a number of inputs required from a user to report an issue, the inference module <b>304</b> determines likely location(s) where the issue occurred. The determination by the inference module <b>302</b> is based on one or more signals from the trace data of a current trip and/or previous trips of the user. Such signals include, for example, an average speed, speed at certain locations, turns taken, how long between arriving at a pick-up location and start of a trip, or navigation instructions not followed. The signals may also include data from other users of the networked system <b>102</b> and tickets (e.g., reporting issues) filed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the inference module <b>304</b> uses intelligence to select one or more locations (e.g., roads or streets) where the issue may have occurred. In some cases, the inference module <b>302</b> selects a current location (e.g., if the issue is traffic) or a last predetermined number of roads (e.g., last three) that were suggested in the route being navigated (e.g., if the issue is a road closure or a turn not being allowed). In other cases, the inference module <b>304</b> analyzes location information (e.g., GPS information), speed of the user when (or shortly prior to when) the issue is reported, and navigation information (e.g., whether the user followed a navigation instruction). For example, if the navigation engine <b>206</b> provides a navigation instruction that instructs the user to make a left on Franklin Street, but instead, the user slows down and makes a right or U-turn, the inference module <b>304</b> infers that Franklin Street is the likely location where the issue occurred. As a result, the inference module <b>302</b> selects Franklin Street as the inferred location.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In other embodiment, the inference module <b>304</b> detects that the user is reporting an issue at or near a start of a trip (e.g., near a pick-up location) or after the trip is completed (e.g., near a drop-off location). In this embodiment, the inference module <b>304</b> selects the pick-up location or drop-off location as the inferred location. As further confirmation that the inferred location is the pick-up location or the drop-off location, the inference module <b>304</b> analyzes whether the user (e.g., driver) was stopped more than a threshold distance from the pick-up location or drop-off location. A result where the user stopped more than the threshold distance would infer that the pick-up location or drop-off location is an illegal stopping zone or has bad traffic.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a further embodiment, the inference module <b>304</b> detects a wait time for the user at an indicated location, whereby the indicated location is a pick-up location. The inference module <b>304</b> then determines whether the wait time traverses a predetermined wait time threshold. If the wait time traverses the predetermined wait time threshold, the inference module <b>304</b> selects the pick-up location as the inferred location. The inference module <b>304</b> may also infer that the type of issue is that the location is difficult for a user to walk to or access.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another embodiment, the inference module <b>304</b> infers the location for a multiple pick-up trip (e.g., a pool trip where a driver picks up and drops off multiple riders along the route). In this embodiment, when the user reports an issue, the inference module <b>304</b> accesses trace data for the plurality of pick-up locations. The inference module <b>304</b> detects a deviation from an expected wait time or suggested navigation instruction for one of the pick-up locations. Based on the detected deviation, the inference module <b>304</b> selects the pick-up location with the deviation as the inferred location.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the inference module <b>304</b> also uses data from other users to select the location(s). In some cases, the inference module <b>304</b> accesses data indicating issues reported along the same route or having a same one or more navigation instructions. In other cases, the inference module <b>302</b> analyzes a predetermined number of trips (e.g., 1000 trips) where the navigation engine <b>206</b> instructed a number of users (e.g., 100 drivers) to perform a particular navigation instruction (e.g., make a left turn at Franklin Street) and no user (or almost no user) followed the instructions. This is a strong indicator that Franklin Street is the location where a turn is not allowed or the street is closed. If the inference module <b>304</b> is fairly certain that the location (e.g., Franklin Street) is the location of the issue, the reporting engine <b>208</b> may not need to verify the location with the user. In other cases, the verification module <b>310</b> causes a verification user interface to be displayed to the user that indicates the one or more inferred locations and requests the user confirm the location (if one inferred location is identified), select the location (if more than one inferred location is selected), or change the location (if no inferred location is correct).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The scoring module <b>304</b> generates and maintains a credibility score for each user. The credibility score is a rating assigned to each user based on a number of previous issues reported by the user and accuracy of the previous issues reported. For example, if a user has provided a threshold number of issue reports, the user will have a higher score than a user that has only reported a few issues or inaccurate issues. For instance, a driver or courier that has only done two pool trips (e.g., multiple rider/pick-up location trip) and submits a poor pick-up or drop-off location may be evaluated differently from a driver that has done 100 pool trips. In example embodiments, the issues being reported by users that have a high credibility score can be turned actionable more quickly (e.g., update map data, update the data storage <b>210</b>) and without further verification. However, issues reported by more novice users having lower scores may need to be followed up with confirmation/verification.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The severity module <b>308</b> infers (e.g., determines) a severity of traffic being reported. In example embodiments, the inference is based on a number of users submitting a report, speed of the users (e.g., speed of vehicles the users are traveling in), how long it took to get through a traffic area, or detection of speed increasing or decreasing. As such, the severity module <b>308</b> detects a number of users reporting the issue at the inferred location (e.g., current location or area of each user) and accesses trace data for these users including location information and speed. Based on the trace data, the severity module <b>308</b> determines a speed or time to travel through the inferred location for each of the users and determines the severity based on the speed or time. For example, if a threshold number or percentage of users have a speed below 10 mph (or an average speed less than 10 mph) and/or takes 30 minutes to travel through a segment of road (or 25 minutes more than the estimated 5 minutes it should take), the traffic may be inferred to be heavy. In contrast, if a threshold number or percentage of users have a speed around 45 mph in a 55 mph zone (or an average speed of all users around 45 mph) and/or takes an extra 5 minutes to travel through a segment of road (compared to estimate time if no traffic), the traffic may be inferred to be low or light.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The verification module <b>310</b> manages verification of issues and/or location of an issue being reported. In some embodiments, the verification module <b>310</b> receives the one or more inferred locations determined by the inference module <b>304</b>. The verification module <b>310</b>, via the user interface module <b>204</b>, causes presentation of a user interface on the user device <b>106</b> that presents the one or more inferred locations and requests the user confirm the inferred location, select one of the inferred locations, or change the inferred location from the one or more that are shown.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the verification module <b>310</b> verifies reported issues using trace data from other users. The verification of reported issues may be triggered, in some cases, based on the reporting user having a low credibility score. In some cases, the verification module accesses trace data for other users that have navigated the same navigation instructions for the inferred location. Using the trace data for the other users, the verification module <b>310</b> verifies the issue being reported. The verification module <b>310</b> may verify the issue based on the other users also reporting the same issue or based on the other users performing a similar navigation maneuver in response to the navigation instructions (e.g., made a right turn on Franklin Street instead of the navigation instruction of making a left turn).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating operations of a method <b>400</b> for optimizing issue reporting in a navigation environment, according to some example embodiments.

The verification module <b>310</b> determines, based on stored trace data or historical data, whether other users have reported the same issue at the same inferred location. In some embodiments, if a threshold number or percentage of other users have reported the same issue at the same inferred location, then the reported issue from the user is verified. Further still, the verification module <b>310</b> can query other users in real-time along a similar route to verify a reported issue. For example, a message (e.g., &#x201c;traffic moving slow?&#x201d;) may be presented on user interfaces of other users (e.g., drivers or riders) asking if the issue is occurring.

Operations in the method <b>700</b> are performed by the networked system <b>102</b>, using components described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Accordingly, the method <b>700</b> is described by way of example with reference to the networked system <b>102</b>. However, it shall be appreciated that at least some of the operations of the method <b>700</b> may be deployed on various other hardware configurations or be performed by similar components residing elsewhere in the network environment <b>100</b>. Therefore, the method <b>700</b> is not intended to be limited to the networked system <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In operation <b>702</b>, the severity module <b>308</b> determines a number of reports reporting issues of the same issue type (e.g., bad traffic) at or near the same inferred location. In some cases, the inferred location comprises a segment of roadway (e.g., a part of a highway or freeway; one or more city blocks).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In operation <b>704</b>, the severity module <b>308</b> accesses trace data for the users reporting the same issue at the same inferred location. The trace data includes, for example, speed of each user (e.g., speed of vehicles the users are traveling in) and how long it took each user to get through the inferred location (e.g., a portion of road where the traffic is bad).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In operation <b>706</b>, the severity module <b>308</b> determines speed and/or time for each user to travel through the inferred location. In some case, the length of time it takes to traverse the inferred location is monitored by the networked system <b>102</b> and captured as part of the trace data. In other cases, a time at a beginning and end of the inferred location is detected and a difference in the time it takes to traverse the inferred location is determined.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the severity module <b>308</b> determines the speed (e.g., average speed) that each user traverse the inferred location based on the trace data directly (e.g., the trace data includes the speed). In other embodiments, the severity module <b>308</b> detects a distance traveled over a time period to derive the speed. Further still, the severity module <b>308</b> can detect if the speed is increasing or reaching the speed limit for the area. Such a detection indicates that the bad traffic has subsided or the user is no longer in the inferred location where the issue is occurring. Similarly, the severity module <b>308</b> can detect if the speed is decreasing or approaches zero for the area.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In operation <b>708</b>, severity module <b>308</b> identifies a severity of the reported issue. In some embodiments, the severity module <b>308</b> compares the average speed (of all the users reporting the issue) to an expected speed to determine the severity. In some embodiments, the severity module <b>308</b> detects hard braking and/or a comparison of location information and distance traveled over a particular time period after the user has reported the issue to determine severity. In other embodiments, the severity module <b>308</b> compares an average time to an expected time to traverse the inferred location in determining the severity. For example, assuming the issue type is (bad) traffic, the severity may be low traffic (e.g., less than a 10 minute delay; speeds 15% less than normal), medium traffic (e.g., between 10-20 minute delay; speeds 15-40% less than normal) or heavy traffic (e.g., greater than 20 minute delay; speeds &#x3e;40% less than normal). The inferred severity is associated with the reported issue and used to update the database. In some embodiments, the navigation engine <b>206</b> may, there soon after, update routes of further users to avoid the area with the bad traffic.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> are example screen shots of user interfaces for reporting an issue in a navigation environment that are displayed on the user device <b>106</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows an example navigation UI. As shown, the navigation UI displays a map of a route being traversed by the user. In the embodiment shown, the navigation UI includes a reporting icon <b>802</b>. By tapping on the reporting icon <b>802</b>, the user can report an issue along the route. Ideally, the user reports the issue as the user encounters the issue thus allowing the inference module <b>304</b> to select a last location as the inferred location. However, the networked system <b>102</b> can infer other locations where the issue may have occurred prior to a current or last location traversed by the user.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In response to the selection of the reporting icon <b>802</b>, an issue user interface (UI), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, is displayed on the user device <b>106</b>. The issue UI presents one or more issue icons <b>804</b> from which the user can select, whereby each issue icon represents a different type of issue being reported. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, the issue icons allow reporting of traffic, an accident, a road closure, a turn not being allowed, a poor pick-up location or a poor drop-off location. Other issue icons can be presented in other embodiments including, for example, missing roadway, incorrect name for roadway, illegal stopping zone, poor parking location (e.g., to pick up or drop off an item for delivery), poor entrances and exits for locations (e.g., restaurants), incorrect one-way street, or wrong side of the road. In some cases, some of other issue icons may be presented on a subsequent user interface (e.g., by the user selecting the &#x201c;other&#x201d; selection <b>806</b>) or are presented in place of the issue icons shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">While embodiments discussed above are directed to reporting issues, alternatively, the issue UI could also be used to report a good location.

Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware modules. A &#x201c;hardware module&#x201d; is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner.

A hardware module may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example, a hardware module may include software encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Accordingly, the term &#x201c;hardware module&#x201d; should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein.

Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured by software to become a special-purpose processor, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respectively different hardware modules at different times.

In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output.
