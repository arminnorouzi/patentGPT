These terms are merely used to distinguish one element, component, area, layer or part from another. Therefore, a first element, component, area, layer or part discussed below may be referred to as a second element, component, area, layer or part without departing from the teaching of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Spatially relative terms such as &#x201c;under&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;beneath&#x201d;, &#x201c;above&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper&#x201d; may be used herein for ease of description to describe the relationship between one element or feature and another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures.

For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, an element described as being &#x201c;below other elements or features&#x201d; or &#x201c;under other elements or features&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath other elements or features&#x201d; will be oriented to be &#x201c;above other elements or features&#x201d;.

The device may be oriented in other ways (rotated by 90 degrees or in other orientations), and the spatially relative descriptors used herein are interpreted correspondingly. In addition, it will also be understood that when a layer is referred to as being &#x201c;between two layers&#x201d;, it may be the only layer between the two layers, or there may also be one or more intermediate layers.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The terms used herein are merely for the purpose of describing specific embodiments and are not intended to limit the present disclosure.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items, and the phrase &#x201c;at least one of A and B&#x201d; refers to only A, only B, or both A and B.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is to be understood that when an element or a layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on another element or layer&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected to another element or layer&#x201d;, &#x201c;coupled to another element or layer&#x201d;, or &#x201c;adjacent to another element or layer&#x201d;, the element or layer may be directly on another element or layer, directly connected to another element or layer, directly coupled to another element or layer, or directly adjacent to another element or layer, or there may be an intermediate element or layer.

Because of this, variations in an illustrated shape, for example as a result of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, should be expected. Therefore, the embodiments of the present disclosure should not be interpreted as being limited to a specific shape of an area illustrated herein, but should comprise shape deviations caused due to manufacturing, for example. Therefore, the area illustrated in a figure is schematic in nature, and the shape thereof is neither intended to illustrate the actual shape of the area of a device, nor to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present disclosure belongs. It is to be further understood that the terms such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries should be interpreted as having meanings consistent with the meanings thereof in relevant fields and/or in the context of this specification, and will not be interpreted in an ideal or too formal sense, unless thus defined explicitly herein.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inventors of the present application recognize that CMOS-compatible silicon photonics technology is facing some challenges. For example, in order to provide an optical transmission channel to a photonic device, a window opening process is used to etch a plurality of dielectric material layers in a silicon photonic chip, making large-scale application of the silicon photonics technology difficult. In addition, to achieve the improvement in electrical properties (for example, microwave loss), other aspects of properties (for example, structural stability) in the silicon photonic chip may be sacrificed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The inventors of the present application further recognize that in the conventional CMOS-compatible silicon photonics technology, there are generally dielectric material (such as SiN or SiCN) layers between different metal layers, and that these dielectric material layers block the penetration of light undesirably. Therefore, it is required that a special photomask be provided to remove these dielectric material layers by etching, so as to open the area to be pervious to light (which is referred to as the &#x201c;window opening process&#x201d;). In the window opening process, the plurality of dielectric material layers are completely etched away, making large-scale application of the silicon photonics technology difficult. In addition, in the silicon photonic chip integrated with an active device, in order to achieve reduced microwave losses and improved impedance matching and refractive index matching, a solution has been proposed where through holes extending from the front side of the silicon photonic chip to the silicon substrate are provided and a part of the silicon substrate below the active device is hollowed out. However, this may cause the deterioration of the structural stability of the silicon photonic chip.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a semiconductor technology architecture, where after a front-side process is completed on a semiconductor-on-insulator substrate, the front side of the device is bonded to another carrier substrate, and then a substrate material under the insulator in the semiconductor-on-insulator substrate is completely removed. This provides a solution that may improve the optical properties and/or electrical properties of the obtained semiconductor device, making mass production of a semiconductor-based photonic devices possible.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; may refer to a substrate of a cut wafer, or may refer to a substrate of an uncut wafer.

In such an embodiment, the first substrate <b>211</b> may be made of any suitable material (for example, silicon or germanium).

Specifically, the patterning process of the silicon grating may include etching, for example, wet etching and dry etching. Depending on etching rates for different crystallographic orientations in an etching solution, the wet etching may be classified as isotropic etching and anisotropic etching. The dry etching uses a physical method (for example, sputtering or ion etching) or a chemical method (for example, reactive ion etching).

In an example, the material of the first insulating layer <b>212</b> is deposited on the first insulating layer <b>212</b>, and then the deposited material is planarized, such that the first insulating layer <b>212</b> deposited with the material has a predetermined thickness. For example, the original first insulating layer <b>212</b> is made of silicon dioxide and has a thickness of 2 &#x3bc;m, in this case, if a thicker first insulating layer <b>212</b> is required, a silicon dioxide material may be deposited on the first insulating layer <b>212</b>, and the deposited silicon dioxide is then planarized through a CMP process.

In an example embodiment where the electro-optic modulator is formed, the first area <b>216</b> and a sub-part of the modulated part that adjoin the first area <b>216</b> may be doped to form one of a P-type semiconductor and an N-type semiconductor, while the second area <b>218</b> and a sub-part of the modulated part that adjoin the second area <b>218</b> may be doped to form the other of the P-type semiconductor and the N-type semiconductor. Thus, the first area <b>216</b>, the modulated part, and the second area <b>218</b> form a P-N junction. By applying a modulation signal to the first area <b>216</b> and the second area <b>218</b>, the carrier concentration of the modulated part of the optical waveguide <b>217</b> may be changed. Therefore, the refractive index of the modulated part of the optical waveguide <b>217</b> is changed, thereby achieving the modulation of light.
