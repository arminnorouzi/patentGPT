The facial nerve is the seventh cranial nerve, or simply CN VII. It emerges from the pons of the brainstem, controls the muscles of facial expression, and functions in the conveyance of taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The nerve typically travels from the pons through the facial canal in the temporal bone and exits the skull at the stylomastoid foramen. It arises from the brainstem from an area posterior to the cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve) and anterior to cranial nerve VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve). The facial nerve also supplies preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to several head and neck ganglia. The facial and intermediate nerves can be collectively referred to as the nervus intermediofacialis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The path of the facial nerve can be divided into six segments: intracranial (cisternal) segment, meatal (canalicular) segment (within the internal auditory canal), labyrinthine segment (internal auditory canal to geniculate ganglion), tympanic segment (from geniculate ganglion to pyramidal eminence), mastoid segment (from pyramidal eminence to stylomastoid foramen), and extratemporal segment (from stylomastoid foramen to post parotid branches). The motor part of the facial nerve arises from the facial nerve nucleus in the pons while the sensory and parasympathetic parts of the facial nerve arise from the intermediate nerve. From the brain stem, the motor and sensory parts of the facial nerve join together and traverse the posterior cranial fossa before entering the petrous temporal bone via the internal auditory meatus. Upon exiting the internal auditory meatus, the nerve then runs a tortuous course through the facial canal, which is divided into the labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid segments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The labyrinthine segment is very short, and ends where the facial nerve forms a bend known as the geniculum of the facial nerve (&#x201c;genu&#x201d; meaning knee), which contains the geniculate ganglion for sensory nerve bodies. The first branch of the facial nerve, the greater superficial petrosal nerve, arises here from the geniculate ganglion. The greater petrosal nerve runs through the pterygoid canal and synapses at the pterygopalatine ganglion. Post synaptic fibers of the greater petrosal nerve innervate the lacrimal gland. In the tympanic segment, the facial nerve runs through the tympanic cavity, medial to the incus. The pyramidal eminence is the second bend in the facial nerve, where the nerve runs downward as the mastoid segment. In the temporal part of the facial canal, the nerve gives rise to the stapedius and chorda tympani. The chorda tympani supplies taste fibers to the anterior two thirds of the tongue, and also synapses with the submandibular ganglion. Postsynaptic fibers from the submandibular ganglion supply the sublingual and submandibular glands.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Upon emerging from the stylomastoid foramen, the facial nerve gives rise to the posterior auricular branch. The facial nerve then passes through the parotid gland, which it does not innervate, to form the parotid plexus, which splits into five branches innervating the muscles of facial expression (temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, cervical). Facial expression. The main function of the facial nerve is motor control of all of the muscles of facial expression. It also innervates the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, the stylohyoid muscle, and the stapedius muscle of the middle ear. All of these muscles are striated muscles of branchiomeric origin developing from the 2nd pharyngeal arch.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Facial sensation. In addition, the facial nerve receives taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue via the chorda tympani. Taste sensation is sent to the gustatory portion (superior part) of the solitary nucleus. General sensation from the anterior two-thirds of tongue are supplied by afferent fibers of the third division of the fifth cranial nerve (V-3). These sensory (V-3) and taste (VII) fibers travel together as the lingual nerve briefly before the chorda tympani leaves the lingual nerve to enter the tympanic cavity (middle ear) via the petrotympanic fissure. It joins the rest of the facial nerve via the canaliculus for chorda tympani. The facial nerve then forms the geniculate ganglion, which contains the cell bodies of the taste fibers of chorda tympani and other taste and sensory pathways. From the geniculate ganglion, the taste fibers continue as the intermediate nerve which goes to the upper anterior quadrant of the fundus of the internal acoustic meatus along with the motor root of the facial nerve. The intermediate nerve reaches the posterior cranial fossa via the internal acoustic meatus before synapsing in the solitary nucleus. The facial nerve also supplies a small amount of afferent innervation to the oropharynx below the palatine tonsil. There is also a small amount of cutaneous sensation carried by the nervus intermedius from the skin in and around the auricle (outer ear).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Facial nerve paralysis. Facial nerve paralysis is a common problem that involves the paralysis of any structures innervated by the facial nerve. The pathway of the facial nerve is long and relatively convoluted, so there are a number of causes that may result in facial nerve paralysis. The most common is Bell's palsy, a disease of unknown cause that may only be diagnosed by exclusion of identifiable serious causes. Facial nerve paralysis is characterized by facial weakness, usually only in one side of the face, with other symptoms possibly including loss of taste, hyperacusis and decreased salivation and tear secretion. Other signs may be linked to the cause of the paralysis, such as vesicles in the ear, which may occur if the facial palsy is due to shingles. Symptoms may develop over several hours.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Facial nerve paralysis may be divided into supranuclear and infranuclear lesions. Central facial palsy can be caused by a lacunar infarct affecting fibers in the internal capsule going to the nucleus. The facial nucleus itself can be affected by infarcts of the pontine arteries. These are corticobulbar fibers travelling in internal capsule. Infranuclear lesions refer to the majority of causes of facial palsy</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy is a type of facial paralysis that results in an inability to control the facial muscles on the affected side. Symptoms can vary from mild to severe. They may include muscle twitching, weakness, or total loss of the ability to move one or rarely both sides of the face. Other symptoms include drooping of the eyelid, a change in taste, pain around the ear, and increased sensitivity to sound. Typically, symptoms progress over 48 hours. The symptoms of Bell's palsy are schematically illustrated in the drawing <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicting a person's face, showing a droopy eyelid <b>11</b>, a chick or facial paralysis or twitching <b>12</b>, and a drooping corner <b>13</b> of the mouth.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The condition normally gets better by itself with most achieving normal or near-normal function. Corticosteroids have been found to improve outcomes, while antiviral medications may be of a small additional benefit. The eye should be protected from drying up with the use of eye drops or an eyepatch. Surgery is generally not recommended. Often signs of improvement begin within 14 days, with complete recovery within six months. A few may not recover completely or have a recurrence of symptoms. Bell's palsy is the most common cause of one-sided facial nerve paralysis (70%). It occurs in 1 to 4 per 10,000 people per year. About 1.5% of people are affected at some point in their life. It most commonly occurs in people between ages 15 and 60. Males and females are affected equally.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Bell's palsy is characterized by a one-sided facial droop that progresses within 72 hours. In rare cases (&#x3c;1%), it can occur on both sides resulting in total facial paralysis. The facial nerve controls a number of functions, such as blinking and closing the eyes, smiling, frowning, lacrimation, salivation, flaring nostrils and raising eyebrows. It also carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, via the chorda tympani nerve (a branch of the facial nerve). Because of this, people with Bell's palsy may present with loss of taste sensation in the anterior &#x2154; of the tongue on the affected side. Although the facial nerve innervates the stapedius muscle of the middle ear (via the tympanic branch), sound sensitivity, causing normal sounds to be perceived as very loud, and dysacusis are possible but hardly ever clinically evident.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Although defined as a mononeuritis (involving only one nerve), people diagnosed with Bell's palsy may have &#x201c;myriad neurological symptoms&#x201d; including &#x201c;facial tingling, moderate or severe headache/neck pain, memory problems, balance problems, ipsilateral limb paresthesia, ipsilateral limb weakness, and a sense of clumsiness&#x201d; that are &#x201c;unexplained by facial nerve dysfunction&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Bell's palsy occurs due to a malfunction of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which controls the muscles of the face. Facial palsy is typified by inability to control movement in the muscles of facial expression. The paralysis is of the infranuclear/lower motor neuron type. It is thought that as a result of inflammation of the facial nerve, pressure is produced on the nerve where it exits the skull within its bony canal (the stylomastoid foramen), blocking the transmission of neural signals or damaging the nerve. Patients with facial palsy for which an underlying cause can be found are not considered to have Bell's palsy per se. Possible causes include tumor, meningitis, stroke, diabetes mellitus, head trauma and inflammatory diseases of the cranial nerves (sarcoidosis, brucellosis, etc.). In these conditions, the neurologic findings are rarely restricted to the facial nerve.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Eye blink. Blinking is a bodily function involving a semi-autonomic rapid closing of the eyelid. A single blink is determined by the forceful closing of the eyelid or inactivation of the levator palpebrae superioris and the activation of the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi, not the full open and close. It is an essential function of the eye that helps spread tears across and remove irritants from the surface of the cornea and conjunctiva. Blinking may have other functions since it occurs more often than necessary just to keep the eye lubricated. Blink speed can be affected by elements such as fatigue, eye injury, medication, and disease. The blinking rate is determined by the body itself, but it can also be affected by external stimulus. Blinking provides moisture to the eye by irrigation using tears and a lubricant the eyes secrete. The eyelid provides suction across the eye from the tear duct to the entire eyeball to keep it from drying out. Blinking also protects the eye from irritants. Eyelashes are hairs attached to the upper and lower eyelids that create a line of defense against dust and other elements to the eye. The eyelashes catch most of these irritants before they reach the eyeball.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">There are multiple muscles that control reflexes of blinking. The main muscles, in the upper eyelid, that control the opening and closing are the orbicularis oculi and levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The orbicularis oculi closes the eye, while the contraction of the levator palpebrae muscle opens the eye. The M&#xfc;ller's muscle, or the superior tarsal muscle, in the upper eyelid and the inferior palpebral muscle in the lower <b>3</b> eyelid are responsible for widening the eyes. These muscles are not only imperative in blinking, but they are also important in many other functions such as squinting and winking. The inferior palpebral muscle is coordinated with the inferior rectus to pull down the lower lid when one looks down.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Though one may think that the stimulus triggering blinking is dry or irritated eyes, it is most likely that it is controlled by a &#x201c;blinking center&#x201d; of the globus pallidus of the lenticular nucleus&#x2014;a body of nerve cells between the base and outer surface of the brain. Nevertheless, external stimuli can contribute. The orbicularis oculi is a facial muscle; therefore its actions are translated by the facial nerve root. The levator palpebrae superioris' action is sent through the oculomotor nerve. The duration of a blink is on average 100-150 milliseconds according to UCL researcher and between 100-400 ms according to the Harvard Database of Useful Biological Numbers. Closures in excess of 1000 ms were defined as microsleeps. Greater activation of dopaminergic pathways dopamine production in the striatum is associated with a higher rate of spontaneous eye blinking. Conditions in which there is reduced dopamine availability such as Parkinson's disease have reduced eye blink rate, while conditions in which it is raised such as schizophrenia have an increased rate</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">There are three types of eye blink. Spontaneous blinking which is done without external stimuli and internal effort. This type of blinking is conducted in the pre-motor brain stem and happens without conscious effort, like breathing and digestion. A reflex blink occurs in response to an external stimulus, such as contact with the cornea or objects that appear rapidly in front of the eye. A reflex blink is not necessarily a conscious blink either; however it does happen faster than a spontaneous blink. Reflex blink may occur in response to tactile stimuli (e.g. corneal, eyelash, skin of eyelid, contact with eyebrow), optical stimuli (e.g., dazzle reflex, or menace reflex) or auditory stimuli (e.g., menace reflex). Voluntary blink is larger amplitude than Reflex blink, with the use of all 3 divisions of the orbicularis oculi muscle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Dry Eye Syndrome (DES). Dry eye syndrome (DES), also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), is the condition of having dry eyes. Other associated symptoms include irritation, redness, discharge, and easily fatigued eyes. Blurred vision may also occur. The symptoms can range from mild and occasional to severe and continuous. Scarring of the cornea may occur in some cases without treatment. Dry eye occurs when either the eye does not produce enough tears or when the tears evaporate too quickly. This can result from contact lens use, meibomian gland dysfunction, allergies, pregnancy, Sj&#xf6;gren's syndrome, vitamin A deficiency, LASIK surgery, and certain medications such as antihistamines, some blood pressure medication, hormone replacement therapy, and antidepressants. Chronic conjunctivitis such as from tobacco smoke exposure or infection may also lead to the condition. Diagnosis is mostly based on the symptoms, though a number of other tests may be used. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Artificial tears are the usual first line treatment. Wrap around glasses that fit close to the face may decrease tear evaporation. Stopping or changing certain medications may help. The medication ciclosporin or steroid eye drops may be used in some cases. Another option is lacrimal plugs that prevent tears from draining from the surface of the eye. Dry eye syndrome occasionally makes wearing contact lenses impossible.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Dry eye syndrome is a common eye disease. It affects 5-34% of people to some degree depending on the population looked at. Among older people it affects up to 70%. In China it affects about 17% of people. Typical symptoms of dry eye syndrome are dryness, burning sensation, and a sandy-gritty eye irritation that gets worse as the day goes on. Symptoms may also be described as itchy, scratchy, stinging or tired eyes. Other symptoms are pain, redness, a pulling sensation, and pressure behind the eye. There may be a feeling that something, such as a speck of dirt, is in the eye. The resultant damage to the eye surface increases discomfort and sensitivity to bright light. Both eyes usually are affected. There may also be a stringy discharge from the eyes. Although it may seem strange, dry eye can cause the eyes to water. This can happen because the eyes are irritated. One may experience excessive tearing in the same way as one would if something got into the eye. These reflex tears will not necessarily make the eyes feel better. This is because they are the watery type that are produced in response to injury, irritation, or emotion. They do not have the lubricating qualities necessary to prevent dry eye.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Because blinking coats the eye with tears, symptoms are worsened by activities in which the rate of blinking is reduced due to prolonged use of the eyes. These activities include prolonged reading, computer usage, driving, or watching television. Symptoms increase in windy, dusty or smoky (including cigarette smoke) areas, in dry environments high altitudes including airplanes, on days with low humidity, and in areas where an air conditioner (especially in a car), fan, heater, or even a hair dryer is being used. Symptoms reduce during cool, rainy, or foggy weather and in humid places, such as in the shower.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Most people who have dry eyes experience mild irritation with no long-term effects. However, if the condition is left untreated or becomes severe, it can produce complications that can cause eye damage, resulting in impaired vision or (rarely) in the loss of vision. Symptom assessment is a key component of dry eye diagnosis&#x2014;to the extent that many believe dry eye syndrome to be a symptom-based disease. Several questionnaires have been developed to determine a score that would allow for dry eye diagnosis. Having dry eyes for a while can lead to tiny abrasions on the surface of the eyes. In advanced cases, the epithelium undergoes pathologic changes, namely squamous metaplasia and loss of goblet cells. Some severe cases result in thickening of the corneal surface, corneal erosion, punctate keratopathy, epithelial defects, corneal ulceration (sterile and infected), corneal neovascularization, corneal scarring, corneal thinning, and even corneal perforation. Another contributing factor may be lacritin monomer deficiency. Lacritin monomer, active form of lacritin, is selectively decreased in aqueous deficient dry eye, Sjogren's syndrome dry eye, contact lens-related dry eye and in blepharitis.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Dry eyes can usually be diagnosed by the symptoms alone. Tests can determine both the quantity and the quality of the tears. A slit lamp examination can be performed to diagnose dry eyes and to document any damage to the eye. A Schirmer's test can measure the amount of moisture bathing the eye. This test is useful for determining the severity of the condition. A five-minute Schirmer's test with and without anesthesia using a Whatman #41 filter paper 5 mm wide by 35 mm long is performed. For this test, wetting under 5 mm with or without anesthesia is considered diagnostic for dry eyes. If the results for the Schirmer's test are abnormal, a Schirmer II test can be performed to measure reflex secretion. In this test, the nasal mucosa is irritated with a cotton-tipped applicator, after which tear production is measured with a Whatman #41 filter paper. For this test, wetting under 15 mm after five minutes is considered abnormal.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A tear breakup time (TBUT) test measures the time it takes for tears to break up in the eye. The tear breakup time can be determined after placing a drop of fluorescein in the cul-de-sac. A tear protein analysis test measures the lysozyme contained within tears. In tears, lysozyme accounts for approximately 20 to 40 percent of total protein content. A lactoferrin analysis test provides good correlation with other tests. The presence of the recently described molecule Ap4A, naturally occurring in tears, is abnormally high in different states of ocular dryness. This molecule can be quantified biochemically simply by taking a tear sample with a plain Schirmer test. Utilizing this technique it is possible to determine the concentrations of Ap4A in the tears of patients and in such way diagnose objectively if the samples are indicative of dry eye.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">TENS. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS or TNS) is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes. TENS, by definition, covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical battery-operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity. Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (&#x3e;50 Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (&#x3c;10 Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">TENS devices available to the domestic market are used as a non-invasive nerve stimulation intended to reduce both acute and chronic pain. In principle, an adequate intensity of stimulation is necessary to achieve pain relief with TENS. An analysis of treatment fidelity (meaning that the delivery of TENS in a trial was in accordance with current clinical advice, such as using &#x201c;a strong but comfortable sensation&#x201d; and suitable, frequent treatment durations) showed that higher fidelity trials tended to have a positive outcome. A few studies have shown objective evidence that TENS may modulate or suppress pain signals in the brain.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Various commercial off-the-shelf TENS devices are available in the market, primarily for providing non-invasive, drug-free method for controlling pain, by using electrical impulses sent through the skin to nerves to modify pain perception.

Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), also known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) or electromyostimulation, is the elicitation of muscle contraction using electric impulses. EMS has received an increasing amount of attention in the last few years for many reasons: it can be utilized as a strength training tool for healthy subjects and athletes; it could be used as a rehabilitation and preventive tool for partially or totally immobilized patients; it could be utilized as a testing tool for evaluating the neural and/or muscular function in vivo; it could be used as a post-exercise recovery tool for athletes. The impulses are generated by a device and are delivered through electrodes on the skin near to the muscles being stimulated. The electrodes are generally pads that adhere to the skin. The impulses mimic the action potential that comes from the central nervous system, causing the muscles to contract.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In medicine, EMS is used for rehabilitation purposes, for instance in physical therapy in the prevention muscle atrophy due to inactivity or neuromuscular imbalance, which can occur for example after musculoskeletal injuries (damage to bones, joints, muscles, ligaments and tendons). This is distinct from Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), in which an electric current is used for pain therapy.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Skin electrodes. An electrode is an electrical conductor used to make contact with a nonmetallic part of a circuit (e.g. a semiconductor, an electrolyte, a vacuum or air). Skin electrodes are the actual conductive pads attached to the body surface.] Any pair of electrodes can measure the electrical potential difference between the two corresponding locations of attachment. Commonly, 10 electrodes attached to the body are used to form 12 ECG leads, with each lead measuring a specific electrical potential difference (as listed in the table below). Two types of electrodes in common use are a flat paper-thin sticker and a self-adhesive circular pad. The former are typically used in a single ECG recording while the latter are for continuous recordings as they stick longer. Each electrode consists of an electrically conductive electrolyte gel and a silver/silver chloride conductor. The gel typically contains potassium chloride&#x2014;sometimes silver chloride as well&#x2014;to permit electron conduction from the skin to the wire and to the electrocardiogram.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">&#x2018;Electronic skin&#x2019; electrodes. Flexible, stretchable printed circuits electrodes (referred to herein as &#x201c;electronic skin&#x201d; electrodes) shaped as miniature tattoos are described in an article entitled: &#x201c;<i>Bionic Skin for a Cyborg You&#x2014;Flexible electronics allow us to cover robots and humans with stretchy sensors</i>&#x201d; by Takao Someya of the University of Tokyo, Japan, published August 2013 in IEEE Spectrum (downloaded May 2019 from spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/bionics/bionic-skin-for-a-cyborg-you&#x2014;preceded by https://), which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Such electrodes typically consist of a patterned conductive material printed on an adhesive film that attaches to the skin.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Electromyography is a non-invasive method widely used to map muscle activation. For decades, it was commonly accepted that dry metallic electrodes establish poor electrode-skin contact, making them impractical for skin electromyography applications. Gelled electrodes are therefore the standard in electromyography with their use confined, almost entirely, to laboratory settings. The tattoo electrodes are made of a conductive material laminated between adhesive polymer films, leaving the electrode ends exposed to be attached to the skin and the connector end to be attached to a slim connector (ZIF&#x2014;Zero force connector, used to connect flexible printed circuits). This slim ZIF connector is wired to a signal generator by a flexible cable. Novel dry electrodes, exhibiting outstanding electromyography recording along with excellent user comfort, are presented in an article entitled: &#x201c;<i>Temporary</i>-<i>tattoo for long</i>-<i>term high fidelity biopotential recordings</i>&#x201d; by Bareket L., Inzelberg L., Rand D., David-Pur M., Rabinovich D., Brandes B., and Hanein Y.

The electrodes were realized using screen-printing of carbon ink on a soft support. The conformity of the electrodes helps establish direct contact with the skin, making the use of a gel superfluous. Plasma polymerized 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene was used to enhance the impedance of the electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed an increase in electrode capacitance by a factor of up to 100 in wet conditions. Impedance measurements show a reduction factor of 10 in electrode impedance on human skin. The suitability of the electrodes for long-term electromyography recordings from the hand and from the face is demonstrated. The presented electrodes are ideally suited for many applications, such as brain-machine interfacing, muscle diagnostics, post-injury rehabilitation, and gaming.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">An example of an electrode assembly <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

EEG electrodes, placed on the scalp, can be either &#x201c;passive&#x201d; or &#x201c;active&#x201d;. Passive electrodes, which are metallic, are connected to an amplifier, e.g., by a cable. Active electrodes may have an inbuilt preamplifier to make them less sensitive to environmental noise and cable movements. Some types of electrodes may need gel or saline liquid to operate, in order to reduce the skin-electrode contact impedance. While other types of EEG electrodes can operate without a gel or saline and are considered &#x201c;dry electrodes&#x201d;. There are various brain activity patterns that may be measured by EEG. Some of the popular ones often used in affective computing include: Event Related Desynchronization/Synchronization, Event Related Potentials (e.g., P300 wave and error potentials), and Steady State Evoked Potentials. Measurements of EEG electrodes are typically subjected to various feature extraction techniques which aim to represent raw or preprocessed EEG signals by an ideally small number of relevant values, which describe the task-relevant information contained in the signals. For example, these features may be the power of the EEG over selected channels, and specific frequency bands.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Implantable electrodes. Implantable electrodes are described in a presentation entitled: &#x201c;<i>Implantable Neural Electrodes&#x2014;Implantable Electronics Session</i>&#x201d; by Dr. Martin Schuettler (of the Laboratory for Biomedical Microtechnology Department of Microsystem Engineering University of Freiburg, Germany) dated 2012 Mar. 30, and in an article entitled: &#x201c;<i>ELECTRODE IMPLANTATION IN THE HUMAN BODY</i>&#x201d; by Margaret I.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain, which is typically noninvasive, with the electrodes placed along the scalp, although invasive electrodes are sometimes used in specific applications. EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain. In clinical contexts, EEG refers to the recording of the brain's spontaneous electrical activity over a period, as recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp. Diagnostic applications generally focus on the spectral content of EEG, that is, the type of neural oscillations (popularly called &#x201c;brain waves&#x201d;) that can be observed in EEG signals. Despite limited spatial resolution, EEG continues to be a valuable tool for research and diagnosis, especially when millisecond-range temporal resolution (not possible with CT or MRI) is required. Derivatives of the EEG technique include evoked potentials (EP), which involves averaging the EEG activity time-locked to the presentation of a stimulus of some sort (visual, somatosensory, or auditory). Event-related potentials (ERPs) refer to averaged EEG responses that are time-locked to more complex processing of stimuli; this technique is used in cognitive science, cognitive psychology, and psychophysiological research. EEG and measuring EEG are described in an article published 2006 in Wiley Encyclopedia of Biomedical Engineering by Katarzyna Blinowska and Piotr Durka of Warshow University, Waszawa, Poland entitled: &#x201c;<i>ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY </i>(<i>EEG</i>)&#x201d;, in an article in Measurement Science Review (Volume 2, Section 2, 2002) by M. Teplan entitled: &#x201c;<i>Fundamentals of EEG Measurement</i>&#x201d;, and in a presentation by M. Kabiraj in Neuroscoences 2003; Vol. 8 Supplement 2, entitled: &#x201c;<i>EEG COURSE&#x2014;Workshop </i>1<i>&#x2014;&#x2018;Basic principles and interpretations of electroencephalography</i>&#x2019;&#x201d;, which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In conventional scalp EEG, the recording is obtained by placing electrodes on the scalp with a conductive gel or paste, usually after preparing the scalp area by light abrasion to reduce impedance due to dead skin cells. Many systems typically use electrodes, each of which is attached to an individual wire. Some systems use caps or nets into which electrodes are embedded; this is particularly common when high-density arrays of electrodes are needed. Electrode locations and names are specified by the International 10-20 system for most clinical and research applications (except when high-density arrays are used). This system ensures that the naming of electrodes is consistent across laboratories. In most clinical applications, 19 recording electrodes (plus ground and system reference) are used. A smaller number of electrodes are typically used when recording EEG from neonates. Additional electrodes can be added to the standard set-up when a clinical or research application demands increased spatial resolution for a particular area of the brain. High-density arrays (typically via cap or net) can contain up to 256 electrodes more-or-less evenly spaced around the scalp. Each electrode is connected to one input of a differential amplifier (one amplifier per pair of electrodes); a common system reference electrode is connected to the other input of each differential amplifier. These amplifiers amplify the voltage between the active electrode and the reference (typically 1,000-100,000 times, or 60-100 dB of voltage gain). In analog EEG, the signal is then filtered (next paragraph), and the EEG signal is output as the deflection of pens as paper passes underneath. Most EEG systems these days, however, are digital, and the amplified signal is digitized via an analog-to-digital converter, after being passed through an anti-aliasing filter. Analog-to-digital sampling typically occurs at 256-512 Hz in clinical scalp EEG; sampling rates of up to 20 kHz are used in some research applications.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">During the recording, a series of activation procedures may be used. These procedures may induce normal or abnormal EEG activity that might not otherwise be seen. These procedures include hyperventilation, photic stimulation (with a strobe light), eye closure, mental activity, sleep and sleep deprivation. During (inpatient) epilepsy monitoring, a patient's typical seizure medications may be withdrawn. The digital EEG signal is stored electronically and can be filtered for display. Typical settings for the high-pass filter and a low-pass filter are 0.5-1 Hz and 35-70 Hz, respectively. The high-pass filter typically filters out slow artifact, such as electrogalvanic signals and movement artifact, whereas the low-pass filter filters out high-frequency artifacts, such as electromyographic signals. An additional notch filter is typically used to remove artifact caused by electrical power lines (60 Hz in the United States and 50 Hz in many other countries). The EEG signal can be processed by freely available EEG software such as EEGLAB or the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As part of an evaluation for epilepsy surgery, it may be necessary to insert electrodes near the surface of the brain, under the surface of the dura mater. This is accomplished via burr hole or craniotomy. This is referred to variously as &#x201c;electrocorticography (ECoG)&#x201d;, &#x201c;intracranial EEG (I-EEG)&#x201d; or &#x201c;subdural EEG (SD-EEG)&#x201d;. Depth electrodes may also be placed into brain structures, such as the amygdala or hippocampus, structures, which are common epileptic foci and may not be &#x201c;seen&#x201d; clearly by scalp EEG. The electrocorticographic signal is processed in the same manner as digital scalp EEG (above), with a couple of caveats. ECoG is typically recorded at higher sampling rates than scalp EEG because of the requirements of Nyquist theorem&#x2014;the subdural signal is composed of a higher predominance of higher frequency components. In addition, many of the artifacts that affect scalp EEG do not affect ECoG, and therefore display filtering is often not needed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A typical adult human EEG signal is about 10 &#x3bc;V to 100 &#x3bc;V in amplitude when measured from the scalp and is about 10-20 mV when measured from subdural electrodes. Since an EEG voltage signal represents a difference between the voltages at two electrodes, the display of the EEG for the reading encephalographer may be set up in one of several ways. The representation of the EEG channels is referred to as a montage.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Internet. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), including Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents on the World Wide Web (WWW) and the infrastructure to support electronic mail. The Internet backbone refers to the principal data routes between large, strategically interconnected networks and core routers on the Internet. These data routers are hosted by commercial, government, academic, and other high-capacity network centers, the Internet exchange points and network access points that interchange Internet traffic between the countries, continents and across the oceans of the world. Traffic interchange between Internet service providers (often Tier 1 networks) participating in the Internet backbone exchange traffic by privately negotiated interconnection agreements, primarily governed by the principle of settlement-free peering.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol suite (IP) described in RFC 675 and RFC 793, and the entire suite is often referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets between programs running on computers connected to a local area network, intranet or the public Internet. It resides at the transport layer. Web browsers typically use TCP when they connect to servers on the World Wide Web, and is used to deliver email and transfer files from one location to another. HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, SSH, FTP, Telnet and a variety of other protocols are encapsulated in TCP. As the transport layer of TCP/IP suite, the TCP provides a communication service at an intermediate level between an application program and the Internet Protocol (IP). Due to network congestion, traffic load balancing, or other unpredictable network behavior, IP packets may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out-of-order. TCP detects these problems, requests retransmission of lost data, rearranges out-of-order data, and even helps minimize network congestion to reduce the occurrence of the other problems. Once the TCP receiver has reassembled the sequence of octets originally transmitted, it passes them to the receiving application. Thus, TCP abstracts the application's communication from the underlying networking details. The TCP is utilized extensively by many of the Internet's most popular applications, including the World Wide Web (WWW), E-mail, File Transfer Protocol, Secure Shell, peer-to-peer file sharing, and some streaming media applications.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">While IP layer handles actual delivery of the data, TCP keeps track of the individual units of data transmission, called segments, which are divided smaller pieces of a message, or data for efficient routing through the network. For example, when an HTML file is sent from a web server, the TCP software layer of that server divides the sequence of octets of the file into segments and forwards them individually to the IP software layer (Internet Layer). The Internet Layer encapsulates each TCP segment into an IP packet by adding a header that includes (among other data) the destination IP address. When the client program on the destination computer receives them, the TCP layer (Transport Layer) reassembles the individual segments and ensures they are correctly ordered and error-free as it streams them to an application.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The TCP protocol operations may be divided into three phases. First, the connections must be properly established in a multi-step handshake process (connection establishment) before entering the data transfer phase. After data transmission is completed, the connection termination closes established virtual circuits and releases all allocated resources. A TCP connection is typically managed by an operating system through a programming interface that represents the local end-point for communications, the Internet socket. The local end-point undergoes a series of state changes throughout the duration of a TCP connection.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol used for relaying datagrams (packets) across a network using the Internet Protocol Suite. It is considered as the primary protocol that establishes the Internet, and is responsible for routing packets across the network boundaries. IP is the primary protocol in the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite and has the task of delivering datagrams from the source host to the destination host based on their addresses. For this purpose, IP defines addressing methods and structures for datagram encapsulation. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) is the dominant protocol of the Internet. IPv4 is described in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) 791 and RFC 1349, and the successor, Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), is currently active and in growing deployment worldwide. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses (providing 4 billion: 4.3&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>addresses), while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses (providing 340 undecillion or 3.4&#xd7;10<sup>38 </sup>addresses), as described in RFC 2460.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The Internet architecture employs a client-server model, among other arrangements.

William Stallings [ISBN: 0-13-191835-4] entitled: &#x201c;<i>Wireless Communications and Networks&#x2014;second Edition</i>&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Wireless networking typically employs an antenna (a.k.a. aerial), which is an electrical device that converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa, connected to a wireless radio transceiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency to the antenna terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a low voltage at its terminals that is applied to a receiver to be amplified. Typically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming radio wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna. Antennas can be designed to transmit and receive radio waves in all horizontal directions equally (omnidirectional antennas), or preferentially in a particular direction (directional or high gain antennas). In the latter case, an antenna may also include additional elements or surfaces with no electrical connection to the transmitter or receiver, such as parasitic elements, parabolic reflectors or horns, which serve to direct the radio waves into a beam or other desired radiation pattern.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">ISM. The Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) radio bands are radio bands (portions of the radio spectrum) reserved internationally for the use of radio frequency (RF) energy for industrial, scientific and medical purposes other than telecommunications. In general, communications equipment operating in these bands must tolerate any interference generated by ISM equipment, and users have no regulatory protection from ISM device operation. The ISM bands are defined by the ITU-R in 5.138, 5.150, and 5.280 of the Radio Regulations. Individual countries use of the bands designated in these sections may differ due to variations in national radio regulations. Because communication devices using the ISM bands must tolerate any interference from ISM equipment, unlicensed operations are typically permitted to use these bands, since unlicensed operation typically needs to be tolerant of interference from other devices anyway. The ISM bands share allocations with unlicensed and licensed operations; however, due to the high likelihood of harmful interference, licensed use of the bands is typically low. In the United States, uses of the ISM bands are governed by Part 18 of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, while Part 15 contains the rules for unlicensed communication devices, even those that share ISM frequencies. In Europe, the ETSI is responsible for governing ISM bands.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Commonly used ISM bands include a 2.45 GHz band (also known as 2.4 GHz band) that includes the frequency band between 2.400 GHz and 2.500 GHz, a 5.8 GHz band that includes the frequency band 5.725-5.875 GHz, a 24 GHz band that includes the frequency band 24.000-24.250 GHz, a 61 GHz band that includes the frequency band 61.000-61.500 GHz, a 122 GHz band that includes the frequency band 122.000-123.000 GHz, and a 244 GHz band that includes the frequency band 244.000-246.000 GHz.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">ZigBee. ZigBee is a standard for a suite of high-level communication protocols using small, low-power digital radios based on an IEEE 802 standard for Personal Area Network (PAN). Applications include wireless light switches, electrical meters with in-home-displays, and other consumer and industrial equipment that require a short-range wireless transfer of data at relatively low rates. The technology defined by the ZigBee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other WPANs, such as Bluetooth. ZigBee is targeted at Radio-Frequency (RF) applications that require a low data rate, long battery life, and secure networking. ZigBee has a defined rate of 250 kbps suited for periodic or intermittent data or a single signal transmission from a sensor or input device.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">ZigBee builds upon the physical layer and medium access control defined in IEEE standard 802.15.4 (2003 version) for low-rate WPANs. The specification further discloses four main components: network layer, application layer, ZigBee Device Objects (ZDOs), and manufacturer-defined application objects, which allow for customization and favor total integration. The ZDOs are responsible for a number of tasks, which include keeping of device roles, management of requests to join a network, device discovery, and security. Because ZigBee nodes can go from a sleep to active mode in 30 ms or less, the latency can be low and devices can be responsive, particularly compared to Bluetooth wake-up delays, which are typically around three seconds. ZigBee nodes can sleep most of the time, thus the average power consumption can be lower, resulting in longer battery life.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">There are three defined types of ZigBee devices: ZigBee Coordinator (ZC), ZigBee Router (ZR), and ZigBee End Device (ZED). ZigBee Coordinator (ZC) is the most capable device and forms the root of the network tree and might bridge to other networks. There is exactly one defined ZigBee coordinator in each network, since it is the device that started the network originally. It is able to store information about the network, including acting as the Trust Center &#x26; repository for security keys. ZigBee Router (ZR) may be running an application function as well as may be acting as an intermediate router, passing on data from other devices. ZigBee End Device (ZED) contains functionality to talk to a parent node (either the coordinator or a router). This relationship allows the node to be asleep a significant amount of the time, thereby giving long battery life. A ZED requires the least amount of memory, and therefore can be less expensive to manufacture than a ZR or ZC.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The protocols build on recent algorithmic research (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector, neuRFon) to automatically construct a low-speed ad-hoc network of nodes. In most large network instances, the network will be a cluster of clusters. It can also form a mesh or a single cluster. The current ZigBee protocols support beacon and non-beacon enabled networks. In non-beacon-enabled networks, an unslotted CSMA/CA channel access mechanism is used. In this type of network, ZigBee Routers typically have their receivers continuously active, requiring a more robust power supply. However, this allows for heterogeneous networks in which some devices receive continuously, while others only transmit when an external stimulus is detected.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In beacon-enabled networks, the special network nodes called ZigBee Routers transmit periodic beacons to confirm their presence to other network nodes. Nodes may sleep between the beacons, thus lowering their duty cycle and extending their battery life. Beacon intervals depend on the data rate; they may range from 15.36 milliseconds to 251.65824 seconds at 250 Kbit/s, from 24 milliseconds to 393.216 seconds at 40 Kbit/s, and from 48 milliseconds to 786.432 seconds at 20 Kbit/s. In general, the ZigBee protocols minimize the time the radio is on to reduce power consumption. In beaconing networks, nodes only need to be active while a beacon is being transmitted. In non-beacon-enabled networks, power consumption is decidedly asymmetrical: some devices are always active while others spend most of their time sleeping.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Except for the Smart Energy Profile 2.0, current ZigBee devices conform to the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN) standard. The standard specifies the lower protocol layers&#x2014;the PHYsical layer (PHY), and the Media Access Control (MAC) portion of the Data Link Layer (DLL). The basic channel access mode is &#x201c;Carrier Sense, Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance&#x201d; (CSMA/CA), that is, the nodes talk in the same way that people converse; they briefly check to see that no one is talking before they start. There are three notable exceptions to the use of CSMA. Beacons are sent on a fixed time schedule, and do not use CSMA. Message acknowledgments also do not use CSMA. Finally, devices in Beacon Oriented networks that have low latency real-time requirement, may also use Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS), which by definition do not use CSMA.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Z-Wave. Z-Wave is a wireless communications protocol by the Z-Wave Alliance (http://www.z-wave.com) designed for home automation, specifically for remote control applications in residential and light commercial environments. The technology uses a low-power RF radio embedded or retrofitted into home electronics devices and systems, such as lighting, home access control, entertainment systems and household appliances. Z-Wave communicates using a low-power wireless technology designed specifically for remote control applications. Z-Wave operates in the sub-gigahertz frequency range, around 900 MHz. This band competes with some cordless telephones and other consumer electronics devices, but avoids interference with WiFi and other systems that operate on the crowded 2.4 GHz band. Z-Wave is designed to be easily embedded in consumer electronics products, including battery-operated devices such as remote controls, smoke alarms, and security sensors.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Z-Wave is a mesh networking technology where each node or device on the network is capable of sending and receiving control commands through walls or floors, and use intermediate nodes to route around household obstacles or radio dead spots that might occur in the home. Z-Wave devices can work individually or in groups, and can be programmed into scenes or events that trigger multiple devices, either automatically or via remote control. The Z-wave radio specifications include bandwidth of 9,600 bit/s or 40 Kbit/s, fully interoperable, GFSK modulation, and a range of approximately 100 feet (or 30 meters) assuming &#x201c;open air&#x201d; conditions, with reduced range indoors depending on building materials, etc. The Z-Wave radio uses the 900 MHz ISM band: 908.42 MHz (United States); 868.42 MHz (Europe); 919.82 MHz (Hong Kong); and 921.42 MHz (Australia/New Zealand).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Z-Wave uses a source-routed mesh network topology and has one or more master controllers that control routing and security. The devices can communicate to another by using intermediate nodes to actively route around, and circumvent household obstacles or radio dead spots that might occur. A message from node A to node C can be successfully delivered even if the two nodes are not within range, providing that a third node B can communicate with nodes A and C. If the preferred route is unavailable, the message originator will attempt other routes until a path is found to the &#x201c;C&#x201d; node. Therefore, a Z-Wave network can span much farther than the radio range of a single unit; however, with several of these hops, a delay may be introduced between the control command and the desired result. In order for Z-Wave units to be able to route unsolicited messages, they cannot be in sleep mode. Therefore, most battery-operated devices are not designed as repeater units. A Z-Wave network can consist of up to 232 devices with the option of bridging networks if more devices are required.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">WWAN. Any wireless network herein may be a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) such as a wireless broadband network, and the WWAN port may be an antenna and the WWAN transceiver may be a wireless modem. The wireless network may be a satellite network, the antenna may be a satellite antenna, and the wireless modem may be a satellite modem. The wireless network may be a WiMAX network such as according to, compatible with, or based on, IEEE 802.16-2009, the antenna may be a WiMAX antenna, and the wireless modem may be a WiMAX modem. The wireless network may be a cellular telephone network, the antenna may be a cellular antenna, and the wireless modem may be a cellular modem. The cellular telephone network may be a Third Generation (3G) network, and may use UMTS W-CDMA, UMTS HSPA, UMTS TDD, CDMA2000 1&#xd7;RTT, CDMA2000 EV-DO, or GSM EDGE-Evolution. The cellular telephone network may be a Fourth Generation (4G) network and may use or be compatible with HSPA+, Mobile WiMAX, LTE, LTE-Advanced, MBWA, or may be compatible with, or based on, IEEE 802.20-2008.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">WLAN. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), is a popular wireless technology that makes use of the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) frequency spectrum. In the US, three of the bands within the ISM spectrum are the A band, 902-928 MHz; the B band, 2.4-2.484 GHz (a.k.a. 2.4 GHz); and the C band, 5.725-5.875 GHz (a.k.a. 5 GHz). Overlapping and/or similar bands are used in different regions such as Europe and Japan. In order to allow interoperability between equipment manufactured by different vendors, few WLAN standards have evolved, as part of the IEEE 802.11 standard group, branded as WiFi (www.wi-fi.org). IEEE 802.11b describes a communication using the 2.4 GHz frequency band and supporting communication rate of 11 Mb/s, IEEE 802.11a uses the 5 GHz frequency band to carry 54 MB/s and IEEE 802.11g uses the 2.4 GHz band to support 54 Mb/s. The WiFi technology is further described in a publication entitled: &#x201c;<i>WiFi Technology</i>&#x201d; by Telecom Regulatory Authority, published on July 2003, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The IEEE 802 defines an ad-hoc connection between two or more devices without using a wireless access point: the devices communicate directly when in range. An ad hoc network offers peer-to-peer layout and is commonly used in situations such as a quick data exchange or a multiplayer LAN game, because the setup is easy and an access point is not required.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A node/client with a WLAN interface is commonly referred to as STA (Wireless Station/Wireless client). The STA functionality may be embedded as part of the data unit, or alternatively be a dedicated unit, referred to as bridge, coupled to the data unit. While STAs may communicate without any additional hardware (ad-hoc mode), such network usually involves Wireless Access Point (a.k.a. WAP or AP) as a mediation device. The WAP implements the Basic Stations Set (BSS) and/or ad-hoc mode based on Independent BSS (IBSS). STA, client, bridge and WAP will be collectively referred to hereon as WLAN unit. Bandwidth allocation for IEEE 802.11g wireless in the U.S. allows multiple communication sessions to take place simultaneously, where eleven overlapping channels are defined spaced 5 MHz apart, spanning from 2412 MHz as the center frequency for channel number 1, via channel 2 centered at 2417 MHz and 2457 MHz as the center frequency for channel number 10, up to channel 11 centered at 2462 MHz. Each channel bandwidth is 22 MHz, symmetrically (+1-11 MHz) located around the center frequency. In the transmission path, first the baseband signal (IF) is generated based on the data to be transmitted, using 256 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) based OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) modulation technique, resulting a 22 MHz (single channel wide) frequency band signal. The signal is then up converted to the 2.4 GHz (RF) and placed in the center frequency of required channel, and transmitted to the air via the antenna. Similarly, the receiving path comprises a received channel in the RF spectrum, down converted to the baseband (IF) wherein the data is then extracted.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In order to support multiple devices and using a permanent solution, a Wireless Access Point (WAP) is typically used. A Wireless Access Point (WAP, or Access Point&#x2014;AP) is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi, or related standards. The WAP usually connects to a router (via a wired network) as a standalone device, but can also be an integral component of the router itself. Using Wireless Access Point (AP) allows users to add devices that access the network with little or no cables. A WAP normally connects directly to a wired Ethernet connection, and the AP then provides wireless connections using radio frequency links for other devices to utilize that wired connection. Most APs support the connection of multiple wireless devices to one wired connection. Wireless access typically involves special security considerations, since any device within a range of the WAP can attach to the network. The most common solution is wireless traffic encryption. Modern access points come with built-in encryption such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), typically used with a password or a passphrase. Authentication in general, and a WAP authentication in particular, is used as the basis for authorization, which determines whether a privilege may be granted to a particular user or process, privacy, which keeps information from becoming known to non-participants, and non-repudiation, which is the inability to deny having done something that was authorized to be done based on the authentication. An authentication in general, and a WAP authentication in particular, may use an authentication server that provides a network service that applications may use to authenticate the credentials, usually account names and passwords of their users. When a client submits a valid set of credentials, it receives a cryptographic ticket that it can subsequently be used to access various services. Authentication algorithms include passwords, Kerberos, and public key encryption.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Prior art technologies for data networking may be based on single carrier modulation techniques, such as AM (Amplitude Modulation), FM (Frequency Modulation), and PM (Phase Modulation), as well as bit encoding techniques such as QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) and QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying). Spread spectrum technologies, to include both DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) and FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) are known in the art. Spread spectrum commonly employs Multi-Carrier Modulation (MCM) such as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing). OFDM and other spread spectrum are commonly used in wireless communication systems, particularly in WLAN networks.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">BAN. A wireless network may be a Body Area Network (BAN) according to, or based on, IEEE 802.15.6 standard, and communicating devices may comprise a BAN interface that may include a BAN port and a BAN transceiver. The BAN may be a Wireless BAN (WBAN), and the BAN port may be an antenna and the BAN transceiver may be a WBAN modem.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Bluetooth. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs). It can connect several devices, overcoming problems of synchronization. A Personal Area Network (PAN) may be according to, compatible with, or based on, Bluetooth&#x2122; or IEEE 802.15.1-2005 standard. A Bluetooth controlled electrical appliance is described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2014/0159877 to Huang entitled: &#x201c;Bluetooth Controllable Electrical Appliance&#x201d;, and an electric power supply is described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2014/0070613 to Garb et al. entitled: &#x201c;Electric Power Supply and Related Methods&#x201d;, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Any Personal Area Network (PAN) may be according to, compatible with, or based on, Bluetooth&#x2122; or IEEE 802.15.1-2005 standard. A Bluetooth controlled electrical appliance is described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2014/0159877 to Huang entitled: &#x201c;Bluetooth Controllable Electrical Appliance&#x201d;, and an electric power supply is described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2014/0070613 to Garb et al. entitled: &#x201c;Electric Power Supply and Related Methods&#x201d;, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Bluetooth operates at frequencies between 2402 and 2480 MHz, or 2400 and 2483.5 MHz including guard bands 2 MHz wide at the bottom end and 3.5 MHz wide at the top. This is in the globally unlicensed (but not unregulated) Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) 2.4 GHz short-range radio frequency band. Bluetooth uses a radio technology called frequency-hopping spread spectrum. Bluetooth divides transmitted data into packets, and transmits each packet on one of 79 designated Bluetooth channels. Each channel has a bandwidth of 1 MHz. It usually performs 800 hops per second, with Adaptive Frequency-Hopping (AFH) enabled. Bluetooth low energy uses 2 MHz spacing, which accommodates 40 channels. Bluetooth is a packet-based protocol with a master-slave structure. One master may communicate with up to seven slaves in a piconet. All devices share the master's clock. Packet exchange is based on the basic clock, defined by the master, which ticks at 312.5 &#x3bc;s intervals. Two clock ticks make up a slot of 625 &#x3bc;s, and two slots make up a slot pair of 1250 &#x3bc;s. In the simple case of single-slot packets the master transmits in even slots and receives in odd slots. The slave, conversely, receives in even slots and transmits in odd slots. Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long, but in all cases the master's transmission begins in even slots and the slave's in odd slots.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A master Bluetooth device can communicate with a maximum of seven devices in a piconet (an ad-hoc computer network using Bluetooth technology), though not all devices reach this maximum. The devices can switch roles, by agreement, and the slave can become the master (for example, a headset initiating a connection to a phone necessarily begins as master&#x2014;as initiator of the connection&#x2014;but may subsequently operate as slave). The Bluetooth Core Specification provides for the connection of two or more piconets to form a scatternet, in which certain devices simultaneously play the master role in one piconet and the slave role in another. At any given time, data can be transferred between the master and one other device (except for the little-used broadcast mode). The master chooses which slave device to address; typically, it switches rapidly from one device to another in a round-robin fashion. Since it is the master that chooses which slave to address, whereas a slave is supposed to listen in each receive slot, being a master is a lighter burden than being a slave. Being a master of seven slaves is possible; being a slave of more than one master is difficult.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Bluetooth Low Energy. Bluetooth low energy (Bluetooth LE, BLE, marketed as Bluetooth Smart) is a wireless personal area network technology designed and marketed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, fitness, beacons, security, and home entertainment industries. Compared to Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a similar communication range. Bluetooth low energy is described in a Bluetooth SIG published Dec. 2, 2014 standard Covered Core Package version: 4.2, entitled: &#x201c;<i>Master Table of Contents </i>&#x26; <i>Compliance Requirements&#x2014;Specification Volume </i>0&#x201d;, and in an article published 2012 in Sensors [ISSN 1424-8220] by Carles Gomez et al. [Sensors 2012, 12, 11734-11753; doi:10.3390/s120211734] entitled: &#x201c;<i>Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low</i>-<i>Power Wireless Technology</i>&#x201d;, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Bluetooth Smart technology operates in the same spectrum range (the 2.400 GHz-2.4835 GHz ISM band) as Classic Bluetooth technology, but uses a different set of channels. Instead of the Classic Bluetooth 79 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Smart has 40 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using Gaussian frequency shift modulation, similar to Classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1 Mbit/s, and the maximum transmit power is 10 mW. Bluetooth Smart uses frequency hopping to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both FCC and ETSI classify Bluetooth technology as an FHSS scheme, Bluetooth Smart is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a direct-sequence spread spectrum. All Bluetooth Smart devices use the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT). The application programming interface offered by a Bluetooth Smart aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">WMN. A Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) and Wireless Distribution Systems (WDS) are known in the art to be a communication network made up of clients, mesh routers and gateways organized in a mesh topology and connected using radio. Such wireless networks may be based on DSR as the routing protocol. WMNs are standardized in IEEE 802.11s and described in a slide-show by W. Steven Conner, Intel Corp. et al. entitled: &#x201c;<i>IEEE </i>802.11<i>s Tutorial</i>&#x201d; presented at the IEEE 802 Plenary, Dallas on Nov. 13, 2006, in a slide-show by Eugen Borcoci of University Politehnica Bucharest, entitled: &#x201c;<i>Wireless Mesh Networks Technologies: Architectures, Protocols, Resource Management and Applications</i>&#x201d;, presented in INFOWARE Conference on August 22-29<sup>th </sup>2009 in Cannes, France, and in an IEEE Communication magazine paper by Joseph D. Camp and Edward W. Knightly of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, Tex., USA, entitled: &#x201c;<i>The IEEE </i>802.11<i>s Extended Service Set Mesh Networking Standard</i>&#x201d;, which are incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The arrangement described herein can be equally applied to such wireless networks, wherein two clients exchange information using different paths by using mesh routers as intermediate and relay servers. Commonly in wireless networks, the routing is based on MAC addresses. Hence, the above discussion relating to IP addresses applies in such networks to using the MAC addresses for identifying the client originating the message, the mesh routers (or gateways) serving as the relay servers, and the client serving as the ultimate destination computer.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Cellular. Cellular telephone network may be according to, compatible with, or may be based on, a Third Generation (3G) network that uses UMTS W-CDMA, UMTS HSPA, UMTS TDD, CDMA2000 1&#xd7;RTT, CDMA2000 EV-DO, or GSM EDGE-Evolution. The cellular telephone network may be a Fourth Generation (4G) network that uses HSPA+, Mobile WiMAX, LTE, LTE-Advanced, MBWA, or may be based on or compatible with IEEE 802.20-2008.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">NFC. Any wireless communication herein may be partly or in full in accordance with, or based on, short-range communication such as Near Field Communication (NFC), having a theoretical working distance of 20 centimeters and a practical working distance of about 4 centimeters, and commonly used with mobile devices, such as smartphones. The NFC typically operates at 13.56 MHz as defined in ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface, and at data rates ranging from 106 Kbit/s to 424 Kbit/s. NFC commonly involves an initiator and a target; the initiator actively generates an RF field that may power a passive target. NFC peer-to-peer communication is possible, provided both devices are powered.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The NFC typically supports passive and active modes of operation. In passive communication mode, the initiator device provides a carrier field and the target device answers by modulating the existing field, and the target device may draw its operating power from the initiator-provided electromagnetic field, thus making the target device a transponder. In active communication mode, both devices typically have power supplies, and both initiator and target devices communicate by alternately generating their own fields, where a device deactivates its RF field while it is waiting for data. NFC typically uses Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK), and employs two different schemes to transfer data. At the data transfer rate of 106 Kbit/s, a modified Miller coding with 100% modulation is used, while in all other cases Manchester coding is used with a modulation ratio of 10%.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The NFC communication may be partly or in full in accordance with, or based on, NFC standards ISO/IEC 18092 or ECMA-340 entitled: &#x201c;Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol-1 (NFCIP-1)&#x201d;, and ISO/IEC 21481 or ECMA-352 standards entitled: &#x201c;<i>Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol</i>-2 (<i>NFCIP</i>-2)&#x201d;.

Randomness is commonly implemented by using random numbers, defined as a sequence of numbers or symbols that lack any pattern and thus appear random, are often generated by a random number generator. Randomness for security is also described in IETF RFC 1750 <i>&#x201c;Randomness Recommendations for Security</i>&#x201d; (December 1994), which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. A random number generator (having either analog or digital output) can be hardware based, using a physical process such as thermal noise, shot noise, nuclear decaying radiation, photoelectric effect or other quantum phenomena. Alternatively, or in addition, the generation of the random numbers can be software based, using a processor executing an algorithm for generating pseudo-random numbers which approximates the properties of random numbers.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The term &#x2018;random&#x2019; herein is intended to cover not only pure random, non-deterministically and non-predicted generated signals, but also pseudo-random, deterministic signals such as the output of a shift-register arrangement provided with a feedback circuit as used to generate pseudo-random binary signals or as scramblers, and chaotic signals, and where a randomness factor may be used.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">A digital random signal generator (known as random number generator) wherein numbers in binary form replaces the analog voltage value output may be used for any randomness.

The digital random signal generator can be hardware based, generating random numbers from a natural physical process or phenomenon, such as the thermal noise of semiconductor which has no periodicity. Typically, such hardware random number generators are based on microscopic phenomena such as thermal noise, shot noise, nuclear decaying radiation, photoelectric effect or other quantum phenomena, and typically contain a transducer to convert some aspect of the physical phenomenon to an electrical signal, an amplifier and other electronic to bring the output into a signal that can be converted into a digital representation by an analog to digital converter. In the case where digitized serial random number signals are generated, the output is converted to parallel, such as 8 bits data, with 256 values of random numbers (values from 0 to 255). Alternatively, a digital random signal generator may be software (or firmware) based, such as pseudo-random number generators. Such generators include a processor for executing software that includes an algorithm for generating numbers, which approximates the properties of random numbers. The random signal generator (either analog or digital) may output a signal having uniform distribution, in which there is a substantially or purely equal probability of a signal falling between two defined limits, having no appearance outside these limits. However, Gaussian and other distribution may be equally used.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Electronic circuits and components are described in a book by Wikipedia entitled: &#x201c;<i>Electronics</i>&#x201d; downloaded from en.wikibooks.org dated Mar. 15, 2015, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Smartphone. A mobile phone (also known as a cellular phone, cell phone, smartphone, or hand phone) is a device which can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link whilst moving around a wide geographic area, by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile network operator. The calls are to and from the public telephone network, which includes other mobiles and fixed-line phones across the world. The Smartphones are typically hand-held and may combine the functions of a personal digital assistant (PDA), and may serve as portable media players and camera phones with high-resolution touch-screens, web browsers that can access, and properly display, standard web pages rather than just mobile-optimized sites, GPS navigation, Wi-Fi and mobile broadband access. In addition to telephony, the Smartphones may support a wide variety of other services such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming and photography.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">An example of a contemporary smartphone is model iPhone 6 available from Apple Inc., headquartered in Cupertino, Calif., U.S.A. and described in iPhone 6 technical specification (retrieved October 2015 from www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/), and in a User Guide dated 2015 (019-00155/2015-06) by Apple Inc. entitled: &#x201c;<i>iPhone User Guide For iOS </i>8.4 <i>Software</i>&#x201d;, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

Instant Messaging (IM) is a type of online chat, which offers real-time text transmission over the Internet. Short messages are typically transmitted bi-directionally between two parties, when each user chooses to complete a thought and select &#x201c;send&#x201d;. Some IM applications can use push technology to provide real-time text, which transmits messages character by character, as they are composed. More advanced instant messaging can add file transfer, clickable hyperlinks, Voice over IP, or video chat. Instant messaging systems typically facilitate connections between specified known users (often using a contact list also known as a &#x201c;buddy list&#x201d; or &#x201c;friend list&#x201d;). Depending on the IM protocol, the technical architecture can be peer-to-peer (direct point-to-point transmission) or client-server (a central server retransmits messages from the sender to the communication device).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Instant messaging is a set of communication technologies used for text-based communication between two or more participants over the Internet or other types of networks. IM-chat happens in real-time. Of importance is that online chat and instant messaging differ from other technologies such as email due to the perceived quasi-synchrony of the communications by the users. Some systems permit messages to be sent to users not then &#x2018;logged on&#x2019; (offline messages), thus removing some differences between IM and email (often done by sending the message to the associated email account). Various IP technologies are described in a thesis by Tim van Lokven (Jan. 23, 2011) entitled: &#x201c;<i>Review and Comparison of Instant Messaging Protocols</i>&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Text Messaging. Text messaging, or texting, is the act of composing and sending brief, electronic messages between two or more mobile phones, or fixed or portable devices over a phone network. The term commonly refers to messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS), but may include messages containing image, video, and sound content (known as MMS messages). The sender of a text message is known as a texter, while the service itself has different colloquialisms depending on the region. Text messages can be used to interact with automated systems, for example, to order products or services, or to participate in contests. Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing to message mobile phone users about promotions, payment due dates, et cetera instead of using mail, e-mail or voicemail. In a straight and concise definition for the purposes of this English language article, text messaging by phones or mobile phones should include all 26 letters of the alphabet and 10 numerals, i.e., alpha-numeric messages, or text, to be sent by texter or received by the textee. SMS messaging gateway providers can provide gateway-to-mobile (Mobile Terminated&#x2014;MT) services. Some suppliers can also supply mobile-to-gateway (text-in or Mobile Originated/MO services).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">SMS. Short Message Service (SMS) is a text messaging service component of phone, Web, or mobile communication systems. It uses standardized communications protocols to allow fixed line or mobile phone devices to exchange short text messages. SMS as used on modern handsets as part of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) series of standards as a means of sending messages of up to 160 characters to and from GSM mobile handsets. Though most SMS messages are mobile-to-mobile text messages, support for the service has expanded to include other mobile technologies, such as ANSI CDMA networks and Digital AMPS, as well as satellite and landline networks. The Short Message Service&#x2014;Point to Point (SMS-PP) is standardized by the 3GPP as TS 23.040 and 3GPP TS 23.041, which define the Short Message Service-Cell Broadcast (SMS-CB), which allows messages (advertising, public information, etc.) to be broadcast to all mobile users in a specified geographical area.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Messages are sent to a Short Message Service Center (SMSC), which provides a &#x201c;store and forward&#x201d; mechanism. It attempts to send messages to the SMSC recipients, and if a recipient is not reachable, the SMSC queues the message for later retry. Some SMSCs also provide a &#x201c;forward and forget&#x201d; option where transmission is tried only once. Both Mobile Terminated (MT, for messages sent to a mobile handset) and Mobile Originating (MO, for those sent from the mobile handset) operations are supported, and the message delivery is &#x201c;best effort&#x201d; scheme, so there are no guarantees that a message will actually be delivered to its recipient, but delay or complete loss of a message is uncommon. SMS is a stateless communication protocol in which every SMS message is considered entirely independent of other messages. Enterprise applications using SMS as a communication channel for stateful dialogue (where an MO reply message is paired to a specific MT message) requires that session management be maintained external to the protocol through proprietary methods as Dynamic Dialogue Matrix (DDM).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The Short Message Service is realized by the use of the Mobile Application Part (MAP) of the SS #7 protocol, with Short Message protocol elements being transported across the network as fields within the MAP messages. These MAP messages may be transported using &#x2018;traditional&#x2019; TDM based signaling, or over IP using SIGTRAN and an appropriate adaptation layer. The Short Message protocol itself is defined by 3GPP TS 23.040 for the Short Message Service-Point-to-Point (SMS-PP), and 3GPP TS 23.041 for the Cell Broadcast Service (CBS). SMS is further described in a 3GPP Technical Specification 3GPP TS 22.011 (v143.0.0, 2015-09) entitled: &#x201c;3<i>rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Service accessibility </i>(<i>Release </i>14)&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">MIMS. Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is an Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) standard way to send messages that include multimedia content to and from mobile phones over a cellular network. It extends the core SMS (Short Message Service) capability that allowed exchange of text messages only up to 160 characters in length. The most popular use is to send photographs from camera-equipped handsets, and is used on a commercial basis by media companies as a method of delivering news and entertainment content and by retail brands as a tool for delivering scannable coupon codes, product images, videos and other information. Unlike text only SMS, commercial MMS can deliver a variety of media including up to forty seconds of video, one image, multiple images via slideshow, or audio plus unlimited characters.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">MMS messages are delivered differently from SMS. The first step is for the sending device to encode the multimedia content in a fashion similar to sending a MIME e-mail (MIME content formats are defined in the MMS Message Encapsulation specification). The message is then forwarded to the carrier MMS store and forward server, known as the MMSC (Multimedia Messaging Service Centre). If the receiver is on another carrier, then the MMSC acts as a relay, and forwards the message to the MMSC of the recipient's carrier using the Internet.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Once the recipient MMSC has received a message, it first determines whether the receiver's handset is &#x201c;MMS capable&#x201d;, that it supports the standards for receiving MMS. If so, the content is extracted and sent to a temporary storage server with an HTTP front-end. An SMS &#x201c;control message&#x201d; (ping) containing the URL of the content is then sent to the recipient's handset to trigger the receiver's WAP browser to open and receive the content from the embedded URL. Several other messages are exchanged to indicate status of the delivery attempt. Before delivering content, some MMSCs also include a conversion service known as &#x201c;content adaptation&#x201d; that will attempt to modify the multimedia content into a format suitable for the receiver. E-mail and web-based gateways to the MMS (and SMS) system are common. On the reception side, the content servers can typically receive service requests from both WAPs and normal HTTP browsers, so delivery via the web is simple. For sending from external sources to handsets, most carriers allow MIME encoded message to be sent to the receiver's phone number with a special domain. MMS is described in a 3GPP technical specification 3GPP TS 23.140 V6.16.0 (2009-03) entitled: &#x201c;3<i>rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Core Network and Terminals; Multimedia Messaging Service </i>(<i>MMS</i>); <i>Functional description; Stage </i>2 (<i>Release </i>6)&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Facebook. Facebook Messenger is an instant messaging service and software application which provides text and voice communication. Integrated with Facebook web-based Chat feature and built on the open MQTT protocol, Messenger lets Facebook users chat with friends both on mobile and on the main website. Facebook is described in a guide by American Majority organization (retrieved October 2015 from http://cmrw.org/) entitled: &#x201c;<i>facebook&#x2014;A Beginner's Guide</i>&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Twitter. Twitter is an online social networking service by Twitter Inc. (headquartered in San Francisco) that enables users to send and read short 140-character messages called &#x201c;tweets&#x201d;. Registered users can read and post tweets, but unregistered users can only read them. Users access Twitter through the website interface, SMS, or mobile device applications. Tweets are publicly visible by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to just their followers. Users can tweet via the Twitter website, compatible external applications (such as for smartphones), or by Short Message Service (SMS) available in certain countries. The action of forwarding a tweet via Twitter is referred to as Retweeting. Both tweets and retweets can be tracked to see which ones are most popular. Users may subscribe to other users tweets&#x2014;this is known as &#x201c;following&#x201d; and subscribers are known as &#x201c;followers&#x201d; or &#x201c;tweeps&#x201d;, a portmanteau of Twitter and peeps. Users can check the people who are unsubscribing them on Twitter (&#x201c;unfollowing&#x201d;) via various services. In addition, users can block those who have followed them.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As a social network, Twitter revolves around the principle of followers. When you choose to follow another Twitter user that user's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page. Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called snowflake, and geolocation data is added using &#x2018;Rockdove&#x2019;. The URL t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL. Next, the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard, and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent. Tweets are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API. The process itself is managed by FlockDB and takes an average of 350 ms, and the service's Application Programming Interface (API) allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter. Twitter is described in a guide (retrieved 10/15 from https://g.twimg.com/business/pdfs/Twitter_Smallbiz_Guide.pdf) by Twitter, Inc., entitled: &#x201c;<i>Twitter for Small Business&#x2014;A GUIDE TO GET STARTED</i>&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">WhatsApp. WhatsApp is an instant messaging app developed by WhatsApp Inc. (headquartered in Mountain View, Calif.) for smartphones that operates under a subscription business model. The proprietary, cross-platform app uses the Internet to send text messages, images, video, user location, and audio media messages. WhatsApp uses a customized version of the open standard Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). Upon installation, it creates a user account using one's phone number as the username (Jabber ID: [phone number]@s.whatsapp.net) WhatsApp software automatically compares all the phone numbers from the device's address book with its central database of WhatsApp users to automatically add contacts to the user's WhatsApp contact list.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Multimedia messages are sent by uploading the image, audio or video to be sent to an HTTP server and then sending a link to the content along with its Base64 encoded thumbnail (if applicable). WhatsApp follows a &#x2018;store and forward&#x2019; mechanism for exchanging messages between two users. When a user sends a message, it first travels to the WhatsApp server where it is stored. Then the server repeatedly requests the receiver acknowledge receipt of the message. As soon as the message is acknowledged, the server drops the message; it is no longer available in database of server. The WhatsApp service is described in an article published (Aug. 30, 2013) on MOBILE HCl 2013&#x2014;COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION by Karen Church and Rodrigo de Oliveira (both of Telefonica Research) entitled: &#x201c;<i>What's up with WhatsApp? Comparing Mobile Instant&#x2014;Messaging Behaviors with Traditional SMS</i>&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Viber. Viber is an instant messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) app for smartphones developed by Viber Media, where in addition to instant messaging, users can exchange images, video and audio media messages. Viber works on both 3G/4G and Wi-Fi networks. Viber includes text, picture and video messaging across all platforms, with voice calling available only to iPhone, Android and Microsoft's Windows Phone. The application user interface includes tab bar on the bottom, giving access to messages, recent calls, contact, the keypad and a button for accessing more options. Upon installation, it creates a user account using one's phone number as username. Viber synchronizes with the phone's address book, so users do not need to add contacts in a separate book. Since all users are registered with their phone number, the software returns all Viber users among the user contacts.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Mail Server. Mail server (a.k.a. Email server, Electronic Mail server, Mail Exchanger&#x2014;MX) refer to a server operating as an electronic post office for email exchanging across networks, commonly performing the server-side of an MTA function. A Message Transfer Agent (or Mail Transfer Agent&#x2014;MTA), or mail relay is a software that transfers electronic mail messages from one computer to another using a client&#x2014;server application architecture. An MTA typically implements both the client (sending) and server (receiving) portions of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The Internet mail architecture is described in IETF RFC 5598 entitled: &#x201c;<i>Internet Mail Architecture</i>&#x201d;, and the SMTP protocol is described in IETF RFC 5321 entitled: &#x201c;<i>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</i>&#x201d; and in IETF RFC 7504 entitled: &#x201c;<i>SMTP </i>521 <i>and </i>556 <i>Reply Codes</i>&#x201d;, which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The Domain Name System (DNS) typically associates a mail server to a domain with mail exchanger (MX) resource records, containing the domain name of a host providing MTA services. A message transfer agent receives mail from either another MTA, a Mail Submission Agent (MSA), or a Mail User Agent (MUA). The transmission details are specified by the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). When a recipient mailbox of a message is not hosted locally, the message is relayed, that is, forwarded to another MTA. Every time an MTA receives an email message, it adds a &#x2018;Received&#x2019; trace header field to the top of the header of the message, thereby building a sequential record of MTAs handling the message. The process of choosing a target MTA for the next hop is also described in SMTP, but can usually be overridden by configuring the MTA software with specific routes. Internet mail schemes are described in IEEE Annals of the History of Computing paper published 2008 by the IEEE Computer Society [1058-6180/08], authored by Craig Partridge of BBN Technologies entitled: &#x201c;<i>The technical Development of Internet Mail</i>&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">A mail server infrastructure consists of several components that work together to send, relay, receive, store, and deliver email, and typically uses various Internet standard protocols for sending and retrieving email, such as the Internet standard protocol Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email, the Internet standard protocols for retrieving email Post Office Protocol (POP), and Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAPv4). An example of a mail server software is &#x2018;Microsoft Exchange Server 2013&#x2019; (available from Microsoft Corporation, headquartered in Redmond, Wash., U.S.A.), described in &#x2018;Pocket Consultant&#x2019; book [ISBN: 978-0-7356-8168-2] published 2013 by Microsoft Press and entitled: &#x201c;<i>Microsoft Exchange Server </i>2013<i>&#x2014;Configuration </i>&#x26; <i>Clients</i>&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The POP is specified in IETF RFC 1939 entitled: &#x201c;<i>Post Office Protocol</i>&#x201d;, and updated specification with an extension mechanism is described in IETF RFC 2449 entitled: &#x201c;<i>POP</i>3 <i>Extension Mechanism</i>&#x201d;, and an authentication mechanism is described in IETF RFC 1734 entitled: &#x201c;<i>POP</i>3 <i>AUTHentication command</i>&#x201d;, which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. IMAP4 clients can create, rename, and/or delete mailboxes (usually presented to the user as folders) on the mail server, and copy messages between mailboxes, and this multiple mailbox support also allows servers to access shared and public folders.

Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open standard communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language) that enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data between any two or more network entities. Designed to be extensible, the protocol has also been used for publish-subscribe systems, signaling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services. The XMPP network uses a client&#x2014;server architecture where clients do not talk directly to one another. The model is decentralized and anyone can run a server. By design, there is no central authoritative. Every user on the network has a unique XMPP address, called JID (for historical reasons, XMPP addresses are often called Jabber IDs). The JID is structured like an email address with a username and a domain name (or IP address) for the server where that user resides, separated by an at sign (@), such as username@example.com. Since a user may wish to log in from multiple locations, they may specify a resource. A resource identifies a particular client belonging to the user (for example home, work, or mobile). This may be included in the JID by appending a slash followed by the name of the resource. For example, the full JID of a user's mobile account could be username@example.com/mobile. Each resource may have specified a numerical value called priority. Messages simply sent to username@example.com will go to the client with highest priority, but those sent to username@example.com/mobile will go only to the mobile client. The highest priority is the one with largest numerical value. JIDs without a username part are also valid, and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server. A resource remains optional for these JIDs as well. XMPP is described in IETF RFC 6120 entitled: &#x201c;<i>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol </i>(<i>XMPP</i>): <i>Core</i>&#x201d;, which describes client-server messaging using two open-ended XML streams, in IETF RFC 6121 entitled: &#x201c;<i>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol </i>(<i>XMPP</i>): <i>Instant Messaging and Presence</i>&#x201d;, which describes instant messaging (IM), the most common application of XMPP, and in IETF RFC 6122 entitled: &#x201c;<i>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol </i>(<i>XMPP</i>): <i>Address Format</i>&#x201d;, which describes the rules for XMPP addresses, also called JabberIDs or JIDs.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">SIMPLE. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE) is an open standard Instant Messaging (IM) and presence protocol suite based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force. The SIMPLE presence use the core protocol machinery that provides the actual SIP extensions for subscriptions, notifications and publications. IETF RFC 6665 defines the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods, where SUBSCRIBE allows to subscribe to an event on a server, and the server responds with NOTIFY whenever the event come up. IETF RFC 3856 defines how to make use of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY for presence. Two models are defined: an end-to-end model in which each User Agent handles presence subscriptions itself, and a centralized model. The message PUBLISH (IETF RFC 3903) allows User Agents to inform the presence server about their subscription states.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">SIP defines two modes of instant messaging: The Page Mode makes use of the SIP method MESSAGE, as defined in IETF RFC 3428. This mode establishes no sessions, and the Session Mode. The Message Session Relay Protocol (RFC 4975, RFC 4976) is a text-based protocol for exchanging arbitrarily-sized content between users, at any time. An MSRP session is set up by exchanging certain information, such as an MSRP URI, within SIP and SDP signaling. SIMPLE is described in IETF RFC 6914 entitled: &#x201c;<i>SIMPLE Made Simple: An Overview of the IETF Specifications for Instant Messaging and Presence Using the Session Initiation Protocol </i>(<i>SIP</i>)&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Wearables. As used herein, the term &#x201c;wearable device&#x201d; (or &#x201c;wearable&#x201d;) includes a body-borne device (or item) designed or intended to be worn by a human. Such devices are typically comfortably worn on, and are carried or transported by, the human body, and are commonly used to create constant, convenient, seamless, portable, and mostly hands-free access to electronics and computers. The wearable devices may be in direct contact with the human body (such as by touching, or attaching to, the body skin), or may be releasably attachable to clothes or other items intended or designed to be worn on the human body. In general, the goal of wearable technologies is to smoothly incorporate functional, portable electronics and computers into individuals' daily lives. Wearable devices may be releasably attached to the human body using attaching means such as straps, buckles, belts, or clasps. Alternatively or in addition, wearable devices may be shaped, structured, or having a form factor to be body releasably mountable or attachable, such as using eye-glass frames or headphones.

A hearing aid is a small electronic device this wear in or behind a human ear to make some sounds louder so that a person with hearing loss can listen, communicate, and participate more fully in daily activities. A hearing aid can help people hear more in both quiet and noisy situations. A hearing aid has three basic parts: a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. The hearing aid receives sound through a microphone, which converts the sound waves to electrical signals and sends them to an amplifier. The amplifier increases the power of the signals and then sends them to the ear through a speaker.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">As described by U.S. Department Of Health And Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) publication No. 99-4340 September 2013 Reprinted July 2015 entitled: &#x201c;<i>NIDCD Fact Sheet|Hearing and Balance</i>&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein, there are three basic styles of hearing aids, two of which shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>. The styles differ by size, their placement on or inside the ear, and the degree to which they amplify sound.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids shown in a view <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>consist of a hard plastic case worn behind the ear and connected to a plastic earmold that fits inside the outer ear. The electronic parts are held in the case behind the ear. Sound travels from the hearing aid through the earmold and into the ear. A new kind of BTE aid (&#x2018;Mini&#x2019; BTE) is an open-fit hearing aid. Small, open-fit aids fit behind the ear completely, with only a narrow tube inserted into the ear canal, enabling the canal to remain open. For this reason, open-fit hearing aids may be a good choice for people who experience a buildup of earwax, since this type of aid is less likely to be damaged by such substances. In addition, some people may prefer the open-fit hearing aid because their perception of their voice does not sound &#x201c;plugged up.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In-The-Ear (ITE) hearing aids shown in a view <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>fit completely inside the outer ear and are used for mild to severe hearing loss. The case holding the electronic components is made of hard plastic. Some ITE aids may have certain added features installed, such as a telecoil. A telecoil is a small magnetic coil that allows users to receive sound through the circuitry of the hearing aid, rather than through its microphone. This makes it easier to hear conversations over the telephone. A telecoil also helps people hear in public facilities that have installed special sound systems, called induction loop systems. Induction loop systems can be found in many churches, schools, airports, and auditoriums. ITE aids usually are not worn by young children because the casings need to be replaced often as the ear grows.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The term &#x2018;client&#x2019; typically refers to an application (or a device executing the application) used for retrieving or rendering resources, or resource manifestations, such as a web browser, an e-mail reader, or a Usenet reader, while the term &#x2018;server&#x2019; typically refers to an application (or a device executing the application) used for supplying resources or resource manifestations, and typically offers (or hosts) various services to other network computers and users. These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access points beyond the server's network address. Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program, which is responsible for handling requests to that port. A daemon, being a user program, can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kernel.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">A mobile operating system (also referred to as mobile OS), is an operating system that operates a smartphone, tablet, PDA, or another mobile device. Modern mobile operating systems combine the features of a personal computer operating system with other features, including a touchscreen, cellular, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS mobile navigation, camera, video camera, speech recognition, voice recorder, music player, near field communication and infrared blaster. Currently, the popular mobile OSs include Android, Symbian, Apple iOS, BlackBerry, MeeGo, Windows Phone, and Bada. Mobile devices with mobile communications capabilities (e.g. smartphones) typically contain two mobile operating systems: a main user-facing software platform is supplemented by a second low-level proprietary real-time operating system that operates the radio and other hardware.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Android is a Linux-based, open source mobile operating system (OS) based on the Linux kernel that is currently offered by Google. With a user interface based on direct manipulation, Android is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers with specialized user interfaces for televisions (Android TV), cars (Android Auto), and wrist watches (Android Wear). The OS uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard. Despite being primarily designed for touchscreen input, it also has been used in game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics. The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions. For example, adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on the device orientation, or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, a process that simulates control of a steering wheel.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Android devices boot to the homescreen, the primary navigation and information point on the device, which is similar to the desktop found on PCs. The homescreens on Android are typically made up of app icons and widgets. App icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content such as the weather forecast, the user's email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the homescreen. A homescreen may be made up of several pages that the user can swipe back and forth between pages. A heavily-customizable Android homescreen interface allows the user to adjust the look and feel of the device to their liking. Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the homescreen, and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as Windows Phone.

(headquartered in Cupertino, Calif., U.S.A.) is a mobile operating system distributed exclusively for Apple hardware. The user interface of the iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command), or rotating it in three dimensions (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode). The iOS is described in a publication entitled: &#x201c;<i>IOS Tutorial</i>&#x201d;, downloaded from tutorialspoint.com on July 2014, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">RTOS. A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is an Operating System (OS) intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays. Processing time requirements (including any OS delay) are typically measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of time, and is a time bound system which has well defined fixed time constraints. Processing is commonly to be done within the defined constraints, or the system will fail. They either are event driven or time sharing, where event driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities while time sharing systems switch the task based on clock interrupts. A key characteristic of an RTOS is the level of its consistency concerning the amount of time it takes to accept and complete an application's task; the variability is jitter. A hard real-time operating system has less jitter than a soft real-time operating system. The chief design goal is not high throughput, but rather a guarantee of a soft or hard performance category. An RTOS that can usually or generally meet a deadline is a soft real-time OS, but if it can meet a deadline deterministically it is a hard real-time OS. An RTOS has an advanced algorithm for scheduling, and includes a scheduler flexibility that enables a wider, computer-system orchestration of process priorities. Key factors in a real-time OS are minimal interrupt latency and minimal thread switching latency; a real-time OS is valued more for how quickly or how predictably it can respond than for the amount of work it can perform in a given period of time.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Common designs of RTOS include event-driven, where tasks are switched only when an event of higher priority needs servicing; called preemptive priority, or priority scheduling, and time-sharing, where task are switched on a regular clocked interrupt, and on events; called round robin. Time sharing designs switch tasks more often than strictly needed, but give smoother multitasking, giving the illusion that a process or user has sole use of a machine. In typical designs, a task has three states: Running (executing on the CPU); Ready (ready to be executed); and Blocked (waiting for an event, I/O for example). Most tasks are blocked or ready most of the time because generally only one task can run at a time per CPU. The number of items in the ready queue can vary greatly, depending on the number of tasks the system needs to perform and the type of scheduler that the system uses. On simpler non-preemptive but still multitasking systems, a task has to give up its time on the CPU to other tasks, which can cause the ready queue to have a greater number of overall tasks in the ready to be executed state (resource starvation).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">RTOS concepts and implementations are described in an Application Note No. RES05B00008-0100/Rec. 1.00 published January 2010 by Renesas Technology Corp. entitled: &#x201c;<i>R</i>8<i>C Family&#x2014;General RTOS Concepts</i>&#x201d;, in JAJA Technologfy Review article published February 2007 [1535-5535/$32.00] by The Association for Laboratory Automation [doi:10.1016/j.jala.2006.10.016] entitled: &#x201c;<i>An Overview of Real</i>-<i>Time Operating Systems</i>&#x201d;, and in Chapter 2 entitled: &#x201c;<i>Basic Concepts of Real Time Operating Systems</i>&#x201d; of a book published 2009 [ISBN&#x2014;978-1-4020-9435-4] by Springer Science+Business Media B.V. entitled: &#x201c;<i>Hardware</i>-<i>Dependent Software&#x2014;Principles and Practice</i>&#x201d;, which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">QNX. One example of RTOS is QNX, which is a commercial Unix-like real-time operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems market. QNX was one of the first commercially successful microkernel operating systems and is used in a variety of devices including cars and mobile phones. As a microkernel-based OS, QNX is based on the idea of running most of the operating system kernel in the form of a number of small tasks, known as Resource Managers. In the case of QNX, the use of a microkernel allows users (developers) to turn off any functionality they do not require without having to change the OS itself; instead, those services will simply not run.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">FreeRTOS. FreeRTOS&#x2122; is a free and open-source Real-Time Operating system developed by Real Time Engineers Ltd., designed to fit on small embedded systems and implements only a very minimalist set of functions: very basic handle of tasks and memory management, and just sufficient API concerning synchronization. Its features include characteristics such as preemptive tasks, support for multiple microcontroller architectures, a small footprint (4.3 Kbytes on an ARM7 after compilation), written in C, and compiled with various C compilers. It also allows an unlimited number of tasks to run at the same time, and no limitation about their priorities as long as used hardware can afford it.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">FreeRTOS&#x2122; provides methods for multiple threads or tasks, mutexes, semaphores and software timers. A tick-less mode is provided for low power applications, and thread priorities are supported. Four schemes of memory allocation are provided: allocate only; allocate and free with a very simple, fast, algorithm; a more complex but fast allocate and free algorithm with memory coalescence; and C library allocate and free with some mutual exclusion protection. While the emphasis is on compactness and speed of execution, a command line interface and POSIX-like IO abstraction add-ons are supported. FreeRTOS&#x2122; implements multiple threads by having the host program call a thread tick method at regular short intervals.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The thread tick method switches tasks depending on priority and a round-robin scheduling scheme. The usual interval is 1/1000 of a second to 1/100 of a second, via an interrupt from a hardware timer, but this interval is often changed to suit a particular application. FreeRTOS&#x2122; is described in a paper by Nicolas Melot (downloaded July 2015) entitled: &#x201c;<i>Study of an operating system: FreeRTOS&#x2014;Operating systems for embedded devices</i>&#x201d;, in a paper (dated Sep. 23, 2013) by Dr. Richard Wall entitled: &#x201c;<i>Carebot PIC</i>32 <i>MX</i>7<i>ck implementation of Free RTOS</i>&#x201d;, FreeRTOS&#x2122; modules are described in web pages entitled: &#x201c;FreeRTOS&#x2122; Modules&#x201d; published in the www,freertos.org web-site dated 26 Nov. 2006, and FreeRTOS kernel is described in a paper published 1 April 07 by Rich Goyette of Carleton University as part of &#x2018;SYSC5701: Operating System Methods for Real-Time Applications&#x2019;, entitled: &#x201c;<i>An Analysis and Description of the Inner Workings of the FreeRTOS Kernel</i>&#x201d;, which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">SafeRTOS. SafeRTOS was constructed as a complementary offering to FreeRTOS, with common functionality but with a uniquely designed safety-critical implementation. When the FreeRTOS functional model was subjected to a full HAZOP, weakness with respect to user misuse and hardware failure within the functional model and API were identified and resolved. Both SafeRTOS and FreeRTOS share the same scheduling algorithm, have similar APIs, and are otherwise very similar, but they were developed with differing objectives. SafeRTOS was developed solely in the C language to meet requirements for certification to IEC61508. SafeRTOS is known for its ability to reside solely in the on-chip read only memory of a microcontroller for standards compliance. When implemented in hardware memory, SafeRTOS code can only be utilized in its original configuration, so certification testing of systems using this OS need not re-test this portion of their designs during the functional safety certification process.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">VxWorks. VxWorks is an RTOS developed as proprietary software and designed for use in embedded systems requiring real-time, deterministic performance and, in many cases, safety and security certification, for industries, such as aerospace and defense, medical devices, industrial equipment, robotics, energy, transportation, network infrastructure, automotive, and consumer electronics. VxWorks supports Intel architecture, POWER architecture, and ARM architectures. The VxWorks may be used in multicore asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP), symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and mixed modes and multi-OS (via Type <b>1</b> hypervisor) designs on 32- and 64-bit processors. VxWorks comes with the kernel, middleware, board support packages, Wind River Workbench development suite and complementary third-party software and hardware technologies. In its latest release, VxWorks <b>7</b>, the RTOS has been re-engineered for modularity and upgradeability so the OS kernel is separate from middleware, applications and other packages. Scalability, security, safety, connectivity, and graphics have been improved to address Internet of Things (IoT) needs.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">&#x3bc;C/OS. Micro-Controller Operating Systems (MicroC/OS, stylized as &#x3bc;C/OS) is a real-time operating system (RTOS) that is a priority-based preemptive real-time kernel for microprocessors, written mostly in the programming language C, and is intended for use in embedded systems. MicroC/OS allows defining several functions in C, each of which can execute as an independent thread or task. Each task runs at a different priority, and runs as if it owns the central processing unit (CPU). Lower priority tasks can be preempted by higher priority tasks at any time. Higher priority tasks use operating system (OS) services (such as a delay or event) to allow lower priority tasks to execute. OS services are provided for managing tasks and memory, communicating between tasks, and timing.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Electrical sensor. Electrical sensor is a component, device or a circuit used to measure electrical quantities. Such an electrical sensor may be conductively connected to measure the electrical parameter, or may be non-conductively coupled to measure an electric-related phenomenon, such as magnetic field or heat. Further, the average or RMS value may be measured.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Ampermeter. An electrical sensor may be an ampermeter (a.k.a. ammeter) that is a current sensor that measures the magnitude of the electric current in a circuit or in a conductor such as a wire. Electric current is commonly measured in Amperes, milliampers, microamperes, or kiloampers. The sensor may be an integrating ammeter (a.k.a. watt-hour meter) where the current is summed over time, providing a current/time product, which is proportional to the energy transferred. The measured electric current may be an Alternating Current (AC) such as a sinewave, a Direct Current (DC), or an arbitrary waveform. A galvanometer is a type of ampermeter for detecting or measuring low current, typically by producing a rotary deflection of a coil in a magnetic field. Some ampermeters use a resistor (shunt), whose voltage is directly proportional to the current flowing through, requiring the current to pass through the meter. A hot-wire ampermeter involves passing the current through a wire which expands as it heats, and the expansion is measured. A non-conductive or non-contact current sensor may be based on &#x2018;Hall effect&#x2019; magnetic field sensor, measuring the magnetic field generated by the current to be measured. Other non-conductive current sensors involve a current clamp or current probe, which has two jaws that open to allow clamping around an electrical conductor, allowing for measuring of the electric current properties (commonly AC), without making a physical contact or disconnecting the circuit. Such current clamp commonly comprises a wire coil wounded around a split ferrite ring, acting as the secondary winding of a current transformer, with the current-carrying conductor acting as the primary winding. Other current sensors and related circuits are described in Zetex Semiconductors PLC application note &#x201c;<i>AN</i>39<i>&#x2014;Current measurement application handbook</i>&#x201d; Issue 5, January 2008, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Voltmeter. An electrical sensor may be a voltmeter, commonly used for measuring the magnitude of the electric potential difference between two points. Electric voltage is commonly measured in volts, millivolts, microvolts, or kilovolts. The measured electric voltage may be an Alternating Current (AC) such as a sinewave, a Direct Current (DC), or an arbitrary waveform. Similarly, an electrometer may be used for measuring electric charge (commonly in Coulomb units&#x2014;C) or electrical potential difference, with very low leakage current. The voltmeter commonly works by measuring the current through a fixed resistor, which, according to Ohm's Law, is proportional to the voltage across the resistor. A potentiometer-based voltmeter works by balancing the unknown voltage against a known voltage in a bridge circuit. A multimeter (a.k.a. VOM&#x2014;Volt-Ohm-Milliameter) as well as Digital MultiMeter (DMM), typically includes a voltmeter, an ampermeter and an ohmmeter.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Wattmeter. An electrical sensor may be a wattmeter measuring the magnitude of the active power (or the supply rate of electrical energy), commonly using watts (W), milliwatts, kilowatts, or megawatts units. A wattmeter may be based on measuring the voltage and the current, and multiplying to calculate the power P=VI. In AC measurement, the true power is P=VIcos(&#x3d5;). The wattmeter may be a bolometer, used for measuring the power of incident electromagnetic radiation via the heating of a material with a temperature-dependent electrical resistance. A sensor may be an electricity meter (or electrical energy meter) that measures the amount of electrical energy consumed by a load. Commonly, an electricity meter is used to measure the energy consumed by a single load, an appliance, a residence, a business, or any electrically powered device, and may provide or be the basis for the electricity cost or billing. The electricity meter may be an AC (single or multi-phase) or DC type, and the common unit of measurement is kilowatt-hour, however any energy related unit may be used such as Joules. Some electricity meters are based on wattmeters, which accumulate or average the readings, or may be based on induction.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Ohmeter. An electrical sensor may be an ohmmeter measuring the electrical resistance, commonly measured in ohms (&#x3a9;), milliohms, kiloohms or megohms, or conductance measured in Siemens (S) units. Low-resistance measurements commonly use micro-ohmmeter, while megohmmeter (a.k.a. Megger) measures large value of resistance. Common ohmmeter passes a constant known current through the measured unknown resistance (or conductance), while measuring the voltage across the resistance, and deriving the resistance (or conductance) value from Ohm's law (R=V/I). A Wheatstone bridge may also be used as a resistance sensor, by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, where one leg includes the unknown resistance (or conductance) component. Variations of Wheatstone bridge may be used to measure capacitance, inductance, impedance, and other electrical or non-electrical quantities.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Capacitance meter. An electrical sensor may be a capacitance meter for measuring capacitance, commonly using units of picofarads, nanofarads, microfarads, and Farads (F). A sensor may be an inductance meter for measuring inductance, commonly using SI units of Henry (H), such as microHenry, milliHenry, and Henry. Further, a sensor may be an impedance meter for measuring an impedance of a device or a circuit. A sensor may be an LCR meter, used to measure inductance (L), capacitance (C), and resistance (R). A meter may use sourcing an AC voltage, and use the ratio of the measured voltage and current (and their phase difference) through the tested device according to Ohm's law to calculate the impedance. Alternatively or in addition, a meter may use a bridge circuit (Similar to Wheatstone bridge concept), where variable calibrated elements are adjusted to detect a null. The measurement may be in a single frequency, or over a range of frequencies.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Magnetometer. An electrical sensor may be a magnetometer for measuring a local H or B magnetic fields. The B-field (a.k.a. magnetic flux density or magnetic induction) is measured in Tesla (T) in SI units and Gauss in cgs units, and magnetic flux is measured in Weber (Wb) units. The H-field (a.k.a. magnetic field intensity or magnetic field strength) is measured in ampere-turn per meter (A/m) in SI units, and in Oersteds (Oe) in cgs units. Many Smartphones contain magnetometers serving as compasses. A magnetometer may be a scalar magnetometer, measuring the total strength, or may be a vector magnetometer, providing both magnitude and direction (relative to the spatial orientation) of the magnetic field. Common magnetometers include Hall effect sensor, magneto-diode, magneto-transistor, AMR magnetometer, GMR magnetometer, magnetic tunnel junction magnetometer, magneto-optical sensor, Lorentz force based MEMS sensor (a.k.a. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance&#x2014;NMR), Electron Tunneling based MEMS sensor, MEMS compasses, Nuclear precession magnetic field sensor, optically pumped magnetic field sensor, fluxgate magnetometer, search coil magnetic field sensor, and Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer. &#x2018;Hall effect&#x2019; magnetometers are based on &#x2018;Hall probe&#x2019;, which contains an indium compound semiconductor crystal such as indium antimonide, mounted on an aluminum backing plate, and provides a voltage a voltage in response to the measured B-field. A fluxgate magnetometer makes use of the non-linear magnetic characteristics of a probe or sensing element that has a ferromagnetic core. NMR and Proton Precession Magnetometers (PPM) measure the resonance frequency of protons in the magnetic field to be measured. SQUID meters are very sensitive vector magnetometers, based on superconducting loops containing Josephson junctions. The magnetometer may be Lorentz-force-based MEMS sensor, relying on the mechanical motion of the MEMS structure due to the Lorentz force acting on the current-carrying conductor in the magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Signal generator. A signal generator (a.k.a. frequency generator) is an electronic device or circuit devices that can generate repeating or non-repeating electronic signals (typically voltage or current), having an analog output (analog signal generator) or a digital output (digital signal generator). The output signal may be based on an electrical circuit, or may be based on a generated or stored digital data. A function generator is typically a signal generator which produces simple repetitive waveforms. Such devices contain an electronic oscillator, a circuit that is capable of creating a repetitive waveform, or may use digital signal processing to synthesize waveforms, followed by a digital to analog converter, or DAC, to produce an analog output. Common waveforms are a sine wave, a saw-tooth, a step (pulse), a square, and a triangular waveforms. The generator may include some sort of modulation functionality such as Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), or Phase Modulation (PM). An Arbitrary Waveform Generators (AWGs) are sophisticated signal generators which allow the user to generate arbitrary waveforms, within published limits of frequency range, accuracy, and output level. Unlike function generators, which are limited to a simple set of waveforms; an AWG allows the user to specify a source waveform in a variety of different ways. Logic signal generator (a.k.a. data pattern generator and digital pattern generator) is a digital signal generator that produces logic types of signals&#x2014;that is logic l's and <b>0</b>'s in the form of conventional voltage levels. The usual voltage standards are: LVTTL, LVCMOS.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Processor.

It is usually used to turn on a transmitter or recorder when someone speaks and turn it off when they stop speaking. Another example is a mercury switch (also known as a mercury tilt switch), which is a switch whose purpose is to allow or interrupt the flow of electric current in an electrical circuit in a manner that is dependent on the switch's physical position or alignment relative to the direction of the &#x201c;pull&#x201d; of earth's gravity, or other inertia. The threshold of a threshold based switch may be fixed or settable. Further, an actuator may be used in order to locally or remotely set the threshold level.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In some cases, a sensor operation may be based on generating a stimulus or an excitation to generate influence or create a phenomenon. The entire or part of the generating or stimulating mechanism may be in this case an integral part of the sensor, or may be regarded as independent actuators, and thus may be controlled by the controller. Further, a sensor and an actuator, independent or integrated, may be cooperatively operating as a set, for improving the sensing or the actuating functionality. For example, a light source, treated as an independent actuator, may be used to illuminate a location, in order to allow an image sensor to faithfully and properly capture an image of that location. In another example, where a bridge is used to measure impedance, the excitation voltage of the bridge may be supplied from a power supply treated and acting as an actuator.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">A sensor may be a piezoelectric sensor, where the piezoelectric effect is used to measure pressure, acceleration, strain or force. Depending on how the piezoelectric material is cut, there are three main modes of operation: transverse longitudinal and shear. In the transverse effect mode, a force applied along an axis generates charges in a direction perpendicular to the line of force, and in the longitudinal effect mode, the amount of charge produced is proportional to the applied force and is independent of size and shape of the piezoelectric element. When using as a pressure sensor, commonly a thin membrane is used to transfer the force to the piezoelectric element, while in accelerometer use, a mass is attached to the element, and the load of the mass is measured. A piezoelectric sensor element material may be a piezoelectric ceramics (such as PZT ceramic) or a single crystal material. A single crystal material may be gallium phosphate, quartz, tourmaline, or Lead Magnesium Niobate-Lead Titanate (PMN-PT).</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">A sensor may be a solid state sensor, which is typically a semiconductor device and which have no mobile parts, and commonly enclosed as a chip.

A survey performed on a human feasibility study to determine whether transcutaneous neural stimulation can elicit a blink in individuals with acute facial palsy and to obtain feedback from participants regarding the tolerability of surface electrical stimulation for daily blink restoration. The survey results are provided in an article entitled: &#x201c;<i>Electrical Stimulation of Eye Blink in Individuals with Acute Facial Palsy: Progress toward a Bionic Blink</i>&#x201d; by Alice Frigerio, M.D., Ph.D., James T. Heaton, Ph.D., Paolo Cavallari, M.D., Ph.D., Chris Knox, B. S., Marc H. Hohman, M.D., and Tessa A. Hadlock, M.D. (Milan, Italy; and Boston, Mass.), and published October 2015 in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Journal [DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000001639] and presented in part at the 2013 International Facial Nerve Symposium, in Boston, Mass., June 28 through Jul. 2, 2013, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The Method included forty individuals with acute unilateral facial paralysis, HB grades 4 through 6, that were prospectively studied between 6 and 60 days of onset. Unilateral stimulation of zygomatic facial nerve branches to elicit eye blink was achieved with brief bipolar, charge-balanced pulse trains, delivered transcutaneously by adhesive electrode placement; results were recorded on a high-speed video camera. The relationship between stimulation parameters and cutaneous sensation was analyzed using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale. Complete eye closure was achieved in 55 percent of participants using stimulation parameters reported as tolerable. In those individuals, initial eye twitch was observed at an average current of 4.6 mA (&#xb1;1.7; average pulse width of 0.7 ms, 100 to 150 Hz), with complete closure requiring a mean of 7.2 mA (&#xb1;2.6). Conclusions: Transcutaneous facial nerve stimulation may artificially elicit eye blink in a majority of patients with acute facial paralysis. Although individuals varied widely in their reported degrees of discomfort from blink-eliciting stimulation, most of them indicated that such stimulation would be tolerable if it could restore eye closure. These patients would therefore benefit from a biomimetic device to facilitate eye closure until the recovery process is complete.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Facial palsy is a devastating condition potentially amenable to rehabilitation by functional electrical stimulation. A novel paradigm for unilateral facial reanimation using an implantable neuroprosthetic device is proposed and its feasibility demonstrated in a live rodent model as described in an article entitled: &#x201c;<i>Toward the Bionic Face: A Novel Neuroprosthetic Device Paradigm for Facial Reanimation Consisting of Neural Blockade and Functional Electrical Stimulation</i>&#x201d; by Nate Jowett, M.D., Robert E. Kearney, Ph.D., Christopher J. Knox, B. S., and Tessa A. Hadlock, M.D. (of Boston, Mass., U.S.A. and Montreal, Quebec, Canada) that was published in Volume 143, Number 1 of the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Journal [DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000005164] and Presented as part at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Peripheral Nerve, in Scottsdale, Ariz., which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The paradigm comprises use of healthy-side electromyographic activity as control inputs to a system whose outputs are neural stimuli to effect symmetric facial displacements. The vexing issue of suppressing undesirable activity resulting from aberrant neural regeneration (synkinesis) or nerve transfer procedures is addressed using proximal neural blockade. Methods: Epimysial and nerve cuff electrode arrays were implanted in the faces of Wistar rats. Stimuli were delivered to evoke blinks and whisks of various durations and amplitudes. The dynamic relation between electromyographic signals and facial displacements was modeled, and model predictions were compared against measured displacements. Optimal parameters to achieve facial nerve blockade by means of high-frequency alternating current were determined, and the safety of continuous delivery was assessed. Results: Electrode implantation was well tolerated. Blinks and whisks of tunable amplitudes and durations were evoked by controlled variation of neural stimuli parameters. Facial displacements predicted from electromyographic input modelling matched those observed with a variance-accounted-for exceeding 96 percent. Effective and reversible facial nerve blockade in awake behaving animals was achieved, without detrimental effect noted from long-term continual use. Conclusions: Proof-of-principle of rehabilitation of hemifacial palsy by means of a neuroprosthetic device has been demonstrated. The use of proximal neural blockade coupled with distal functional electrical stimulation may have relevance to rehabilitation of other peripheral motor nerve deficits.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Systems and methods for detecting a user's facial movement and expression are featured in U.S. Pat.

The drawings and descriptions are conceptual only. In actual practice, a single component can implement one or more functions; alternatively or in addition, each function can be implemented by a plurality of components and devices. In the figures and descriptions, identical reference numerals indicate those components that are common to different embodiments or configurations. Identical numerical references (even in the case of using different suffix, such as <b>5</b>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b </i>and <b>5</b><i>c</i>) refer to functions or actual devices that are either identical, substantially similar, or having similar functionality. It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the apparatus, system, and method of the present invention, as represented in the figures herein, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely the representative embodiments of the invention. It is to be understood that the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; herein include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a component surface&#x201d; includes reference to one or more of such surfaces. By the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; it is meant that the recited characteristic, parameter, or value need not be achieved exactly, but that deviations or variations, including for example, tolerances, measurement errors, measurement accuracy limitations and other factors known to those of skill in the art, may occur in amounts that do not preclude the effect the characteristic was intended to provide.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">In one example, a stimulating device or apparatus is used to generate modulated pulse bursts, preferably enabling adjustment of the output signal parameters or characteristics, offering minimum energy consumption and minimal discomfort. The device is preferably located to effectively couple the output signal to a nerve, such as a facial nerve, via a coupling device. The device output may be controlled manually or automatically, and may be synchronized with the opposite eye or by a preset program. In one application, the stimulating device may be used to generate timed eye blinking preferably by inducing muscle action to close upper and preferably also lower eyelids, each independently or in combination, to result in complete eye closure, and with the correct physiological ratio between lower and upper eyelids. Further, the device may be used to stimulate or squeeze the tear gland.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">A general arrangement <b>30</b> of using a general stimulator device <b>31</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and a general arrangement <b>40</b> of using an examplary embodiment of a stimulator device <b>31</b><i>a </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The device <b>31</b> comprises a Gated Pulse Generator <b>35</b> that outputs via a connection or port <b>38</b> a gated symmetrical or asymmetrical Bi-Phasic square pulse signal <b>41</b>. The signal <b>41</b> is comprised of train of square wave bursts <b>41</b><i>d </i>having a peak-to-peak amplitude &#x2018;A&#x2019; <b>41</b><i>c </i>and a time duration d <b>41</b><i>a</i>. The pulses train <b>41</b> is periodically repeated every T <b>41</b><i>b </i>seconds, and in each burst <b>41</b><i>d </i>the square-wave frequency is T. The generator <b>35</b> output signal <b>41</b> is carried over the connection <b>38</b> to a connector <b>28</b><i>b </i>in the enclosure of the device <b>31</b>. The signal <b>41</b> reaches electrodes <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>that are attached to a scalp of a treated person <b>25</b>. The electrodes <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>are connected via wires or conductors to a connector <b>27</b><i>a</i>. A cable <b>29</b> having end connectors <b>28</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>b </i>connects respectively to the device <b>31</b> connector <b>28</b><i>a </i>and electrodes structure connector <b>27</b><i>b</i>, thus forming a continuous connection from the generator <b>35</b> to the person <b>25</b> skin.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">The device <b>31</b> operation is controlled by a controller block <b>39</b>, which preferably comprises a software (or firmware) and a processor for executing the software (or firmware). The controller <b>39</b> further controls and set the signal <b>41</b> parameters, such as the burst duration &#x2018;d&#x2019; <b>41</b><i>a</i>, the repetition period &#x2018;T&#x2019; <b>41</b><i>b</i>, the amplitude A <b>41</b><i>c</i>, the burst internal frequency <b>41</b><i>d</i>, or any combination thereof, via a connection <b>47</b> between the controller <b>39</b> and the generator <b>35</b>. The simulating device <b>31</b> may further comprise a sensor <b>32</b> that outputs sensor data, in response to a physical phenomenon, the sensor <b>32</b> may be coupled to transmit the sensor output data to the controller <b>39</b> for further handling and processing, and for acting in response to the value of the sensor <b>32</b> output.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">The stimulating device <b>31</b> may further include an indicator <b>37</b> that is an output component for notifying or outputting information to a user, which may be the person <b>25</b> that is treated by the arrangement <b>30</b>, or another person. For example, the indicator <b>37</b> may provide auditory or visual feedback to a human, such as to alert the user through auditory tones/beeps in advance of the presentation of information, or by changes in a display. Alternatively or in addition, the indicator <b>37</b> may include a vibrator for tactile interface with the user, such as the person <b>25</b> that may wear the device <b>31</b>. The indicator <b>37</b> is coupled to be controlled or activated by the controller <b>39</b>.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">The stimulating device <b>31</b> may further include a user control functionality <b>33</b> that is an input component for receiving information or control commands from a user, which may be the person <b>25</b> that is treated by the arrangement <b>30</b>, or another person. The user control block <b>33</b> may include an input component that may be a piece of computer hardware equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or information appliance. Such input component may be an integrated or a peripheral input device (e.g., hard/soft keyboard, mouse, resistive or capacitive touch display, etc.). Examples of input components include keyboards, mouse, scanners, digital cameras and joysticks. An input components can be categorized based on the modality of input (e.g., mechanical motion, audio, visual, etc.), whether the input is discrete (e.g. pressing of key) or continuous (e.g., a mouse's position, though digitized into a discrete quantity, is fast enough to be considered continuous), the number of degrees of freedom involved (e.g., two-dimensional traditional mice, or three-dimensional navigators designed for CAD applications). Pointing devices (such as &#x2018;computer mouse&#x2019;), which are input components used to specify a position in space, can further be classified according to whether the input is direct or indirect. With direct input, the input space coincides with the display space, i.e., pointing is done in the space where visual feedback or the pointer appears. Touchscreens and light pens involve direct input. Examples involving indirect input include the mouse and trackball, and whether the positional information is absolute (e.g., on a touch screen) or relative (e.g., with a mouse that can be lifted and repositioned). Direct input is almost necessarily absolute, but indirect input may be either absolute or relative. For example, digitizing graphics tablets that do not have an embedded screen involve indirect input and sense absolute positions and are often run in an absolute input mode, but they may also be set up to simulate a relative input mode like that of a touchpad, where the stylus or puck can be lifted and repositioned. Further, an input component in the user control block <b>33</b> may include dedicated hard controls for frequently used/accessed functions (e.g., repeat system message).</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">The stimulating device <b>31</b> may further include a communication interface <b>36</b> for transmitting data to, or for receiving data from, another device over a communication network. The communication interface <b>36</b> may consist of, be part of, or include, a transceiver or modem for communication with the network. In the case of wired networks, the communication interface <b>36</b> connects to the network via a port that may include a connector, and in the case of wireless network, the communication interface <b>36</b> connects to the network via the port that may include an antenna. The communication interface <b>36</b> is controlled and activated by the controller <b>39</b>. Further, data received from an external device over the communication network is transferred to the controller <b>39</b> for further handling, and data to be sent to an external device over the communication network is received at the communication interface <b>36</b> from the controller <b>39</b>. The electronic circuits and components in the stimulating device <b>31</b> are electrically powered from a power source <b>34</b>, which typically supplies a Direct Current (DC) voltage (or current).</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">The controller <b>39</b> may be based on a discrete logic or an integrated device, such as a processor, microprocessor or microcomputer, and may include a general-purpose device or may be a special purpose processing device, such as an ASIC, PAL, PLA, PLD, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Gate Array, or other customized or programmable device. In the case of a programmable device as well as in other implementations, a memory is required. The controller <b>39</b> commonly includes a memory that may include a static RAM (random Access Memory), dynamic RAM, flash memory, ROM (Read Only Memory), or any other data storage medium. The memory may include data, programs, and/or instructions and any other software or firmware executable by the processor. Control logic can be implemented in hardware or in software, such as a firmware stored in the memory. The controller <b>39</b> controls and monitors the device operation, such as initialization, configuration, interface, and commands. Any step, method, or flow-chart herein may be performed by the processor in the controller <b>39</b> as directed by the software therein.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">Battery. In one example, the power source <b>34</b> may comprise, may be based on, or may consist of, a battery. A battery may be a primary battery or cell, in which an irreversible chemical reaction that generates the electricity, and thus the cell is disposable and cannot be recharged, and need to be replaced after the battery is drained. Such battery replacement may be expensive and cumbersome. Alternatively or in addition, the battery may be a rechargeable battery <b>34</b><i>a</i>, illustrated as part of the stimulator device <b>31</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, such as a nickel-cadmium based battery. In such a case, a battery charger <b>41</b> is employed for charging the battery while it is in use or not in use. Various types of such battery chargers are known in the art, such as trickle chargers, pulse chargers and the like. The battery charger may be integrated with the field unit or be external to it. The battery may be a primary or a rechargeable (secondary) type, may include a single or few batteries, and may use various chemicals for the electro-chemical cells, such as lithium, alkaline and nickel-cadmium. Common batteries are manufactured in pre-defined standard output voltages (1.5, 3, 4.5, 9 Volts, for example), as well as defined standard mechanical enclosures (usually defined by letters such as &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;AA&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d;, &#x201c;C&#x201d; sizes), and &#x2018;coin&#x2019; or &#x2018;button&#x2019; type. In one embodiment, the battery (or batteries) is held in a battery holder or compartment, and thus can be easily replaced.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">A battery may be a &#x2018;watch battery&#x2019; (a.k.a. &#x2018;coin cell&#x2019; or &#x2018;button cell&#x2019;), which is a small single cell battery shaped as a squat cylinder typically 5 to 25 mm in diameter and 1 to 6 mm high. Button cells are typically used to power small portable electronics devices such as wrist watches, pocket calculators, artificial cardiac pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators, and hearing aids. Most button cells have low self-discharge and hold their charge for a long time if not used. Higher-power devices such as hearing aids may use zinc-air cells that have much higher capacity for a given size, but discharge over a few weeks even if not used. Button cells are single cells, usually disposable primary cells. Common anode materials are zinc or lithium, and common cathode materials are manganese dioxide, silver oxide, carbon monofluoride, cupric oxide or oxygen from the air. A metal can forms the bottom body and positive terminal of the cell, where the insulated top cap is the negative terminal.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">An example of a &#x2018;coin cell&#x2019; is designated by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in the IEC 60086-3 standard (Primary batteries, part 3 Watch batteries) as LR44 type, which is an alkaline 1.5 volt button cell. The letter <b>1</b>&#x2032; indicates the electrochemical system used: a zinc negative electrode, manganese dioxide depolarizer and positive electrode, and an alkaline electrolyte. R44 indicates a round cell 11.4&#xb1;0.2 mm diameter and 5.2&#xb1;0.2 mm height as defined by the IEC standard 60086. An example of LR44 type battery is Energizer A76 battery, available from Energizer Holdings, Inc., and described in a product datasheet Form No. EBC&#x2014;4407cp-Z (downloaded from the Internet March 2016) entitled: &#x201c;<i>Energizer A</i>76<i>&#x2014;ZEROMERCURY Miniature Alkaline</i>&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Another example of a &#x2018;coin cell&#x2019; is a CR2032 battery, which is a button cell lithium battery rated at 3.0 volts. Nominal diameter is 20 mm, nominal height is 3.2 mm. CR2032 indicates a round cell 19.7-20 mm diameter and 2.9-3.2 mm height as defined by the IEC standard 60086. The battery weight typically ranges from 2.8 g to 3.9 g. The BR2032 battery has the same dimensions, a slightly lower nominal voltage and capacity, and an extended temperature range compared with the CR2032. It is rated for a temperature range of &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. to 85&#xb0; C., while the CR2032 is specified over the range &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. to 70&#xb0; C. BR2032 also has a much lower self-discharge rate. An example of CR2032 type battery is Energizer CR2032 Lithium Coin battery, available from Energizer Holdings, Inc., and described in a product datasheet Form No. EBC&#x2014;4120M (downloaded from the Internet March 2016) entitled: &#x201c;<i>Energizer CR</i>2032<i>&#x2014;Lithium Coin</i>&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">While the invention was exampled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> above with regard to a direct and conductive charging, thus may require a connector, a contactless charging may equally be used, such as by using inductive coupling where the energy is transferred using an electromagnetic field. In inductive coupling a charging station sends energy using a transmitter induction coil to the device to be charged, which includes a receiving induction coil inductively coupled to the transmitter coil. The received power is commonly used to charge the rechargeable battery <b>34</b><i>a </i>while enclosed within the device. In such a configuration there is no need for any connectors or for connector engagement, thus making it easy to use, impermeable to water and dirt and with improved shape and look. Such an arrangement of induction-based charging device <b>31</b><i>b </i>capable of inductive charging is shown in an arrangement <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The receiving coil <b>56</b> internal to the device <b>31</b><i>b </i>is designed to receive energy when properly positioned in an electromagnetic field.

A relay may be an electromagnetic relay, that typically consists of a coil of wire wrapped around a soft iron core, an iron yoke which provides a low reluctance path for magnetic flux, a movable iron armature, and one or more sets of contacts. The armature is hinged to the yoke and mechanically linked to one or more sets of moving contacts. It is held in place by a spring so that when the relay is de-energized there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit. In this condition, one of the two sets of contacts in the relay pictured is closed, and the other set is open.

The MOSFET transistor is a four-terminal component with source (S), gate (G), drain (D), and body (B) terminals, where the body (or substrate) of the MOSFET is often connected to the source terminal, making it a three-terminal component like other field-effect transistors. In an enhancement mode MOSFETs, a voltage drop across the oxide induces a conducting channel between the source and drain contacts via the field effect. The term &#x201c;enhancement mode&#x201d; refers to the increase of conductivity with an increase in oxide field that adds carriers to the channel, also referred to as the inversion layer. The channel can contain electrons (called an nMOSFET or nMOS), or holes (called a pMOSFET or pMOS), opposite in type to the substrate, so nMOS is made with a p-type substrate, and pMOS with an n-type substrate.

It uses remotely located charge-coupled-device cameras equipped with active infrared illuminators to acquire video images of the driver. Various visual cues that typically characterize the level of alertness of a person are extracted in real time and systematically combined to infer the fatigue level of the driver. The visual cues employed characterize eyelid movement, gaze movement, head movement, and facial expression. A probabilistic model is developed to model human fatigue and to predict fatigue based on the visual cues obtained. The simultaneous use of multiple visual cues and their systematic combination yields a much more robust and accurate fatigue characterization than using a single visual cue. This system was validated under real-life fatigue conditions with human subjects of different ethnic backgrounds, genders, and ages; with/without glasses; and under different illumination conditions.

Common ohmmeter passes a constant known current through the measured unknown resistance (or conductance), while measuring the voltage across the resistance, and deriving the resistance (or conductance) value from Ohm's law (R=V/I). A Wheatstone bridge may also be used as a resistance sensor, by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, where one leg includes the unknown resistance (or conductance) component.

The facial nerve branches off to smaller nerves and muscles that go to 5 different parts of the face. Therefore, when the nerve is damaged those smaller veins are not supplied with enough blood for circulation which is necessary for muscles in the different areas of the face to move. Each nerve branch affects the movement of different muscles.

This nerve controls the ability or lack thereof to either; 1) Blinking, or 2) Tear Production, but it can also cause 3) Ptosis (Droopy Eyelid). Dry eye can help as a warning of facial nerve damage. Other facial nerve damage may affect eating, since without the ability to move the Buccal branch and the Marginal Mandibular Branch, holding food in your mouth becomes very frustrating, and awkward. Drinking with a straw is often necessary. Similarly, talking may be affected since the same nerves that make eating difficult can also make proper or clear pronunciation of certain letters/sounds; B, P, M, and W. Facial nerve damage may affect a Droopy Face, due to lack of complete eyelid closure and a fallen smile, and nasal issues, such as a runny nose or congestion. Further, lack of control of wrinkled forehead symmetry, as well as saliva and tooth decay/dry mouth may be affected, since anything that diminishes the flow of saliva will dramatically increase the incidence of tooth decay.

The sensor may serve as, or be, a detector, for detecting the presence of the phenomenon. Alternatively or in addition, a sensor may measure (or respond to) a parameter of a phenomenon or a magnitude of the physical quantity thereof. For example, the sensor <b>32</b> may be a thermistor or a platinum resistance temperature detector, a light sensor, a pH probe, or a piezoelectric bridge. Similarly, the sensor <b>32</b> may be used to measure pressure, flow, force or other mechanical quantities. A signal conditioning circuit is typically coupled to the sensor <b>32</b> output, for adapting and preparing the output signal for further processing. For example, the conditioning circuit may include an amplifier connected to the sensor output. Other signal conditioning may also be applied in order to improve the handling of the sensor output or adapting it to the next stage or manipulating, such as attenuation, delay, current or voltage limiting, level translation, galvanic isolation, impedance transformation, linearization, calibration, filtering, amplifying, digitizing, integration, derivation, and any other signal manipulation. Some sensors conditioning involves connecting them in a bridge circuit. In the case of conditioning, the conditioning circuit may added to manipulate the sensor output, such as filter or equalizer for frequency related manipulation such as filtering, spectrum analysis or noise removal, smoothing or de-blurring in case of image enhancement, a compressor (or de-compressor) or coder (or decoder) in the case of a compression or a coding/decoding schemes, modulator or demodulator in case of modulation, and extractor for extracting or detecting a feature or parameter such as pattern recognition or correlation analysis. In case of filtering, passive, active or adaptive (such as Wiener or Kalman) filters may be used. The conditioning circuits may apply linear or non-linear manipulations. Further, the manipulation may be time-related such as analog or digital delay-lines, integrators, or rate-based manipulation. A sensor <b>32</b> may have analog output, requiring an A/D to be connected thereto, or may have digital output. Further, the conditioning may be based on the book entitled: &#x201c;<i>Practical Design Techniques for Sensor Signal Conditioning</i>&#x201d;, by Analog Devices, Inc., 1999 (ISBN-0-916550-20-6), which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

An appropriate sensor may be adapted for a specific physical phenomenon, such as a sensor responsive to temperature, humidity, pressure, audio, vibration, light, motion, sound, proximity, flow rate, electrical voltage, and electrical current. The sensor <b>32</b> may measure the amount of a property or of a physical quantity, or the magnitude relating to a physical phenomenon, body, or substance. Alternatively or in addition, the sensor <b>32</b> may be used to measure the time derivative thereof, such as the rate of change of the amount, the quantity or the magnitude. In the case of space related quantity or magnitude, a sensor may measure the linear density, surface density, or volume density, relating to the amount of property per volume. Alternatively or in addition, the sensor <b>32</b> may measure the flux (or flow) of a property through a cross-section or surface boundary, the flux density, or the current. In the case of a scalar field, a sensor may measure the quantity gradient. The sensor <b>32</b> may measure the amount of property per unit mass or per mole of substance. A single sensor may be used to measure two or more phenomena.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0344">The sensor <b>32</b> may directly or indirectly measure the rate of change of the physical quantity (gradient) versus the direction around a particular location, or between different locations. For example, a temperature gradient may describe the differences in the temperature between different locations. Further, the sensor <b>32</b> may measure time-dependent or time-manipulated values of the phenomenon, such as time-integrated, average or Root Mean Square (RMS or rms), relating to the square root of the mean of the squares of a series of discrete values (or the equivalent square root of the integral in a continuously varying value). Further, a parameter relating to the time dependency of a repeating phenomenon may be measured, such as the duty-cycle, the frequency (commonly measured in Hertz&#x2014;Hz) or the period. A sensor may be based on the Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems&#x2014;MEMS (a.k.a. Micro-mechanical electrical systems) technology. The sensor <b>32</b> may respond to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, noise, vibration, fumes, odors, toxic conditions, dust, and ventilation.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0345">The sensor <b>32</b> may be an active sensor, requiring an external source of excitation. For example, resistor-based sensors such as thermistors and strain gages are active sensors, requiring a current to pass through them in order to determine the resistance value, corresponding to the measured phenomenon. Similarly, a bridge circuit based sensors are active sensors depending or external electrical circuit for their operation. A sensor may be a passive sensor, generating an electrical output without requiring any external circuit or any external voltage or current. Thermocouples and photodiodes are examples or passive sensors.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0346">The sensor <b>32</b> may measure the amount of a property or of a physical quantity or the magnitude relating to a physical phenomenon, body or substance. Alternatively or in addition, a sensor may be used to measure the time derivative thereof, such as the rate of change of the amount, the quantity or the magnitude. In the case of space related quantity or magnitude, a sensor may measure the linear density, relating to the amount of property per length, a sensor may measure the surface density, relating to the amount of property per area, or a sensor may measure the volume density, relating to the amount of property per volume. Alternatively or in addition, a sensor may measure the amount of property per unit mass or per mole of substance. In the case of a scalar field, the sensor <b>32</b> may further measure the quantity gradient, relating to the rate of change of property with respect to position. Alternatively or in addition, the sensor <b>32</b> may measure the flux (or flow) of a property through a cross-section or surface boundary. Alternatively or in addition, the sensor <b>32</b> may measure the flux density, relating to the flow of property through a cross-section per unit of the cross-section, or through a surface boundary per unit of the surface area. Alternatively or in addition, the sensor <b>32</b> may measure the current, relating to the rate of flow of property through a cross-section or a surface boundary, or the current density, relating to the rate of flow of property per unit through a cross-section or a surface boundary. The sensor <b>32</b> may include or consists of a transducer, defined herein as a device for converting energy from one form to another for the purpose of measurement of a physical quantity or for information transfer. Further, a single sensor may be used to measure two or more phenomena. For example, two characteristics of the same element may be measured, each characteristic corresponding to a different phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0347">A sensor output may have multiple states, where the sensor state is depending upon the measured parameter of the sensed phenomenon. The sensor <b>32</b> may be based on a two state output (such as &#x2018;0&#x2019; or &#x2018;1&#x2019;, or &#x2018;true&#x2019; and &#x2018;false&#x2019;), such as an electric switch having two contacts, where the contacts can be in one of two states: either &#x201c;closed&#x201d; meaning the contacts are touching and electricity can flow between them, or &#x201c;open&#x201d;, meaning the contacts are separated and the switch is non-conducting. The sensor <b>32</b> may be a threshold switch, where the switch changes its state upon sensing that the magnitude of the measured parameter of a phenomenon exceeds a certain threshold. For example, the sensor <b>32</b> may be a thermostat is a temperature-operated switch used to control a heating process. Another example is a voice operated switch (a.k.a. VOX), which is a switch that operates when sound over a certain threshold is detected. It is usually used to turn on a transmitter or recorder when someone speaks and turn it off when they stop speaking. Another example is a mercury switch (also known as a mercury tilt switch), which is a switch whose purpose is to allow or interrupt the flow of electric current in an electrical circuit in a manner that is dependent on the switch's physical position or alignment relative to the direction of the &#x201c;pull&#x201d; of earth's gravity, or other inertia. The threshold of a threshold based switch may be fixed or settable. Further, an actuator may be used in order to locally or remotely set the threshold level.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0348">The sensor <b>32</b> may be an analog sensor having an analog signal output such as analog voltage or current, or may have continuously variable impedance. Alternatively on in addition, the sensor <b>32</b> may have a digital signal output. A sensor may serve as a detector, notifying only the presence of a phenomenon, such as by a switch, and may use a fixed or settable threshold level. The sensor <b>32</b> may measure time-dependent or space-dependent parameters of a phenomenon. The sensor <b>32</b> may measure time-dependencies or a phenomenon such as the rate of change, time-integrated or time-average, duty-cycle, frequency or time between events. The sensor <b>32</b> may be a passive sensor, or an active sensor requiring an external source of excitation. The sensor <b>32</b> may be semiconductor-based, and may be based on MEMS technology.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0349">In some cases, the sensor <b>32</b> operation is based on generating a stimulus or an excitation to generate influence or create a phenomenon. The entire or part of the generating or stimulating mechanism may be in this case an integral part of the sensor <b>32</b>, or may be regarded as independent actuators, and thus may be controlled by the controller. Further, the sensor <b>32</b> and an actuator, independent or integrated, may be cooperatively operating as a set, for improving the sensing or the actuating functionality. For example, a light source, treated as an independent actuator, may be used to illuminate a location, in order to allow an image sensor to faithfully and properly capture an image of that location. In another example, where a bridge is used to measure impedance, the excitation voltage of the bridge may be supplied from a power supply treated and acting as an actuator.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0350">The sensor <b>32</b> may respond to chemical process or may be involved in fluid handling, such as measuring flow or velocity. The sensor <b>32</b> may be responsive to the location or motion such as navigational instrument, or be used to detect or measure position, angle, displacement, distance, speed or acceleration. The sensor <b>32</b> may be responsive to mechanical phenomenon such as pressure, force, density or level. The environmental related sensor may respond to humidity, air pressure, and air temperature. Similarly, any sensor used to detect or measure a measurable attribute and converts it into an electrical signal may be used. Further, the sensor <b>32</b> may be a metal detector, which detects metallic objects by detecting their conductivity.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0351">In one example, the sensor <b>32</b> is used to measure, sense or detect the temperature of an object, that may be solid, liquid or gas (such as the air temperature), in a location. Such sensor <b>32</b> may be based on a thermistor, which is a type of resistor whose resistance varies significantly with temperature, and is commonly made of ceramic or polymer material. A thermistor may be a PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) type, where the resistance increases with increasing temperatures, or may be an NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) type, where the resistance decreases with increasing temperatures. Alternatively (or in addition), a thermoelectric sensor may be based on a thermocouple, consisting of two different conductors (usually metal alloys), that produce a voltage proportional to a temperature difference. For higher accuracy and stability, an RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) may be used, typically consisting of a length of fine wire-wound or coiled wire wrapped around a ceramic or glass core. The RTD is made of a pure material whose resistance at various temperatures is known (R vs. T). A common material used may be platinum, copper, or nickel. A quartz thermometer may be used as well for high-precision and high-accuracy temperature measurement, based on the frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator. The temperature may be measured using conduction, convection, thermal radiation, or by the transfer of energy by phase changes. The temperature may be measured in degrees Celsius (&#xb0; C.) (a.k.a. Centigrade), Fahrenheit (&#xb0; F.), or Kelvin (&#xb0; K). In one example, the temperature sensor (or its output) is used to measure a temperature gradient, providing in which direction and at what rate the temperature changes the most rapidly around a particular location. The temperature gradient is a dimensional quantity expressed in units of degrees (on a particular temperature scale) per unit length, such as the SI (International System of Units) unit Kelvin per meter (K/m).</p><p id="p-0354" num="0352">In some embodiments, a measurement of affective response of a user comprises, and/or is based on, a behavioral cue of the user. A behavioral cue of the user is obtained by monitoring the user in order to detect things such as facial expressions of the user, gestures made by the user, tone of voice, and/or other movements of the user's body (e.g., fidgeting, twitching, or shaking). The behavioral cues may be measured utilizing various types of sensors. Some non-limiting examples include an image capturing device (e.g., a camera), a movement sensor, a microphone, an accelerometer, a magnetic sensor, and/or a pressure sensor. In one example, a behavioral cue may involve prosodic features of a user's speech such as pitch, volume, tempo, tone, and/or stress (e.g., stressing of certain syllables), which may be indicative of the emotional state of the user. In another example, a behavioral cue may be the frequency of movement of a body (e.g., due to shifting and changing posture when sitting, laying down, or standing). In this example, a sensor embedded in a device such as accelerometers in a smartphone or smartwatch may be used to take the measurement of the behavioral cue.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0353">In some embodiments, a measurement of affective response of a user may be obtained by capturing one or more images of the user with an image-capturing device, such as a camera.

Optionally, the one or more captured images are in two dimensions and/or in three dimensions. Optionally, the one or more captured images comprise one or more of the following: a single image, sequences of images, a video clip. In one example, images of a user captured by the image capturing device may be utilized to determine the facial expression and/or the posture of the user. In another example, images of a user captured by the image capturing device depict an eye of the user. Optionally, analysis of the images can reveal the direction of the gaze of the user and/or the size of the pupils. Such images may be used for eye tracking applications, such as identifying what the user is paying attention to, and/or for determining the user's emotions (e.g., what intentions the user likely has). Additionally, gaze patterns, which may involve information indicative of directions of a user's gaze, the time a user spends gazing at fixed points, and/or frequency at which the user changes points of interest, may provide information that may be utilized to determine the emotional response of the user.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0354">In some embodiments, a measurement of affective response of a user may include a physiological signal derived from a biochemical measurement of the user. For example, the biochemical measurement may be indicative of the concentration of one or more chemicals in the body of the user (e.g., electrolytes, metabolites, steroids, hormones, neurotransmitters, and/or products of enzymatic activity). In one example, a measurement of affective response may describe the glucose level in the bloodstream of the user. In another example, a measurement of affective response may describe the concentration of one or more stress-related hormones such as adrenaline and/or cortisol. In yet another example, a measurement of affective response may describe the concentration of one or more substances that may serve as inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP). In one embodiment, a sensor that provides a biochemical measurement may be an external sensor (e.g., a sensor that measures glucose from a blood sample extracted from the user). In another embodiment, a sensor that provides a biochemical measurement may be in physical contact with the user (e.g., contact lens in the eye of the user that measures glucose levels). In yet another embodiment, a sensor that provides a biochemical measurement may be a sensor that is in the body of the user (an &#x201c;in vivo&#x201d; sensor).

The pain typically travels from the injured area or organ along the small nerves leading to the spinal cord, where it travels up the spinal cord to the brain, where it is then interpreted causing the pain to be felt. In one example, any of the methods and devices described herein may be used as non-invasive, drug-free method for controlling pain. Comfortable electrical impulses are transmitted to the human body through the skin and to the nerves in a non-invasive way, in order to modify the pain perspective. While not curing the physiological problem that causes the pain, it may help and be effective, at least in some persons, in reducing or eliminating the pain, allowing for a return to normal activity.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0363">While exampled herein for stimulating blinking or other eye related functionalities, any apparatus and method herein may equally be used for patients that suffer from Dry Eye Syndrome (DES).

The loss of facial expression and the disfigurement of facial paralysis have serious implications for a patient's physical and psychological well-being. Numerous aetiologies of facial paralysis exist but once nerve recovery has been static for two years, interventional surgery is required to improve the situation. Facial paralysis is often treated as an aesthetic problem but can also have real physical and psychological problems. These include difficulty with speech, low self-esteem, poor social interaction, oral incontinence, and dental problems; caries may develop due to the lack of food progression through the oral cavity and repeated trauma and ulceration caused by biting of the inside of the paralysed cheek.

Parkinson's Disease (PD). Parkinson's Disease (PD) belongs to a group of conditions called motor system disorders, which are the result of the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. The four primary symptoms of PD are tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural instability, or impaired balance and coordination. As these symptoms become more pronounced, patients may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks. PD usually affects people over the age of 60. Early symptoms of PD are subtle and occur gradually. In some people the disease progresses more quickly than in others. As the disease progresses, the shaking, or tremor, which affects the majority of people with PD may begin to interfere with daily activities. Other symptoms may include depression and other emotional changes; difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking; urinary problems or constipation; skin problems; and sleep disruptions. There are currently no blood or laboratory tests that have been proven to help in diagnosing sporadic PD. Therefore the diagnosis is based on medical history and a neurological examination. The disease can be difficult to diagnose accurately. Doctors may sometimes request brain scans or laboratory tests in order to rule out other diseases.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0370">Hypomimia is a common and early symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which reduces the ability of PD patients in manifesting emotions, and it is visually evaluated by the neurologist during neurological examinations for PD diagnosis as described in task 3.2 of the Movement Disorder Society&#x2014;Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).

The spontaneous eye blink rate-minute (sEBR), its maximum amplitude (BMP), and facial cutaneous muscles activity were measured in 24 PD patients and 24 HC while the subjects looked at a visual-tester composed by three main parts: static vision, dynamic vision, and reading silently. Specificity and sensitivity for each parameter were calculated. The VEOG and the fsEMG allowed identifying some parameters related to eye blink and facial expressions (i.e., sEBR, BMP, frontal and peribuccal muscular activities) able to distinguish between PD patients and HC with high sensitivity and specificity.

Assessing daily motor fluctuations is an important part of the disease management for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the frequent recording of subjective and/or objective assessments is not always feasible, and easier monitoring methods have been sought. Previous studies have reported that the spontaneous eye-blink rate (EBR) is correlated with the dopamine levels in the brain. Thus, the continuous monitoring of the EBR may be useful for predicting the motor status in patients with PD. Methods Electrooculograms (EOGs) were recorded for up to 7.5 hours from three PD patients using a wearable device that resembled ordinary glasses. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare the ability of the EBR estimates at each time-point (Blink Index) and the plasma levodopa levels to predict the motor status. Results&#x2014;The Blink Index was correlated with the plasma levodopa levels. When an indicator for the first hour of the observation period was included in the model, the Blink Index discerned wearing-off and dyskinesia as accurately as the plasma levodopa level.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0372">Dry eye is an important problem in Parkinson's disease (PD) with a potential to affect life quality. Tear osmolarity, accepted as the gold standard in dry eye diagnosis, has not been studied in this subset of patients so far. A study that evaluates tear osmolarity, Schirmer's test scores and tear film break-up time (TBUT) in PD patients is described in a paper entitled: &#x201c;Tear Osmolarity, Break-up Time and Schirmer's Scores in Parkinson's Disease&#x201d; by Turk J. Ophthalmol Published online Aug. 5, 2015 [doi: 10.4274/tjo.46547, 2015 August; 45(4): 142-145 PMC&#x2014;US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health], which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The results show that BR and Schirmer's scores decreased significantly in PD patients. Although not significant, the demonstrated tear osmolarity increment might be important to document the dry eye and inflammatory process of the ocular surface in PD patients. Materials and Methods&#x2014;PD patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year and healthy controls who admitted for refractive abnormalities were enrolled to the study. Subjects using any systemic medication with a possibility to affect tear tests were not included in the study. The presence of any ocular surface disorder, previous ocular surgery, previous dry eye diagnosis, any topical ophthalmic medication or contact lens use were other exclusion criteria. Age, gender, disease duration, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&#x26;Y) score for disease severity were noted, and blink rate (BR), Schirmer's test score, TBUT and tear osmolarity of the right eye were measured in both groups. Results&#x2014;Thirty-seven PD patients and 37 controls were enrolled to the study. The groups were age and gender matched. The mean disease duration and H&#x26;Y score were 5.70&#xb1;2.64 years and 1.70&#xb1;0.93, respectively. H&#x26;Y staging and disease duration were not correlated to BR, Schirmer's scores, TBUT, or tear osmolarity (p&#x3e;0.05). The mean BR was 8.54&#xb1;4.99 blinks/minute in PD patients and 11.97&#xb1;6.36 blinks/minute in the control group. Mean Schirmer's scores, TBUT and osmolarity values were 9.08&#xb1;4.46 mm, 11.38&#xb1;4.05 seconds and 306.43&#xb1;12.63 mOsm/L in the PD group and 17.16&#xb1;9.57 mm, 12.81&#xb1;3.66 seconds and 303.81&#xb1;16.13 mOsm/L in the control group. The differences were significant only in BR and Schirmer's scores.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0000">b. ALS. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a specific disease that causes the death of neurons controlling voluntary muscles. Some also use the term motor neuron disease for a group of conditions of which ALS is the most common. ALS is characterized by stiff muscles, muscle twitching, and gradually worsening weakness due to muscles decreasing in size. It may begin with weakness in the arms or legs, or with difficulty speaking or swallowing. About half of the people affected develop at least mild difficulties with thinking and behavior and most people experience pain. Most eventually lose the ability to walk, use their hands, speak, swallow, and breathe. The cause is not known in 90% to 95% of cases, but is believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors. The remaining 5-10% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. About half of these genetic cases are due to one of two specific genes. The underlying mechanism involves damage to both upper and lower motor neurons. The diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms, with testing done to rule out other potential causes.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0373">No cure for ALS is known. The goal of treatment is to improve symptoms. A medication called riluzole may extend life by about two to three months. Non-invasive ventilation may result in both improved quality and length of life. Mechanical ventilation can prolong survival but does not stop disease progression. A feeding tube may help. The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts around the age of 60 and in inherited cases around the age of 50. The average survival from onset to death is two to four years, though this can vary. About 10% survive longer than 10 years. Most die from respiratory failure. In Europe, the disease affects about two to three people per 100,000 per year. Rates in much of the world are unclear. In the United States, it is more common in white people than black people. ALS patients may communicate via a dedicated communication computer that is based on eye focusing, blinking, and other eye tracking functions.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0374">Apps are beginning to appear that take advantage of Apple's True Depth camera to provide eye gaze control on the latest iPhone or iPad Pro. There are actually two cameras; your usual selfie camera and an infrared camera that maps your face. Eye gaze for Apple devices has been a long wished for accessibility feature. Eye gaze bars that hook up to a computer usually cost around $2000, so that access to eye gaze and face tracking on the iPad is a big deal. News of this new technology came out at Apple's WWDC in June of 2018. Apple's ARKit 2.0 introduced an eye tracking feature. Folks quickly realized that this tool was not just for advertisers, but could really benefit people with disabilities, such as ALS. It took a few months for the first apps to follow.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0375">An apparatus, system, and method for a mobile, low-cost headset for 3D point of gaze estimation is described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2015/0070470 to McMurrough entitled: &#x201c;Apparatus, System, and Method for Mobile, Low-Cost Headset for 3D Point of Gaze Estimation&#x201d;, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

Stroke. A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both result in parts of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0377">The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan. A CT scan can rule out bleeding, but may not necessarily rule out ischemia, which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, as well as possibly aspirin, statins, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing, and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Aspirin should be used. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from surgery. Treatment to try to recover lost function is called stroke rehabilitation and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0378">In 2013 approximately 6.9 million people had an ischemic stroke and 3.4 million people had a hemorrhagic stroke. In 2015 there were about 42.4 million people who had previously had a stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes which occurred each year decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world. In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.3 million deaths (11% of the total). About 3.0 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.3 million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke. About half of people who have had a stroke live less than one year. Overall, two thirds of strokes occurred in those over 65 years old. Other stroke statistics may be found at http://www.strokecenter.org/patients/about-stroke/stroke-statistics/. Post stroke conditions are described in https://www.stroke.org/we-can-help/survivors/stroke-recovery/post-stroke-conditions/physical/.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0000">d. Lyme disease. Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium named <i>Borrelia </i>spread by ticks. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as erythema migrans, that appears at the site of the tick bite about a week after it occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 70-80% of infected people develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and tiredness. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and tiredness for at least six months.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0379">Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus <i>Ixodes</i>. In the United States, ticks of concern are usually of the <i>Ixodes scapularis </i>type, and must be attached for at least 36 hours before the bacteria can spread. In Europe ticks of the <i>Ixodes ricinus </i>type may spread the bacteria more quickly. In North America, <i>Borrelia burgdorferi </i>and <i>Borrelia </i>mayonii are the cause. In Europe and Asia, the bacteria <i>Borrelia afzelii </i>and <i>Borrelia garinii </i>are also causes of the disease. The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals, or through food. Diagnosis is based upon a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often negative in the early stages of the disease. Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0380">Prevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites such as by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs, and using DEET-based insect repellents. Using pesticides to reduce tick numbers may also be effective. Ticks can be removed using tweezers. If the removed tick was full of blood, a single dose of doxycycline may be used to prevent development of infection, but is not generally recommended since development of infection is rare. If an infection develops, a number of antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime. Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. Some people develop a fever and muscle and joint pains from treatment which may last for one or two days. In those who develop persistent symptoms, long-term antibiotic therapy has not been found to be useful.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0381">Lyme disease is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. It is estimated to affect 300,000 people a year in the United States and 65,000 people a year in Europe. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Old Lyme, Connecticut. It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer. Chronic symptoms following treatment are well described and are known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). PTLDS is different from chronic Lyme disease; a term no longer supported by the scientific community and used in different ways by different groups. Some healthcare providers claim that PTLDS is caused by persistent infection, but this is not believed to be true because of the inability to detect infectious organisms after standard treatment. A vaccine for Lyme disease was marketed in the United States between 1998 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the market due to poor sales. Research is ongoing to develop new vaccines.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0000">e. Ramsay Hunt syndrome type <b>2</b>. Ramsay Hunt syndrome type <b>2</b>, also known as herpes zoster oticus, is a disorder that is caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion, a nerve cell bundle of the facial nerve. Ramsay Hunt syndrome type <b>2</b> typically presents with inability to move many facial muscles, pain in the ear, taste loss on the front of the tongue, dry eyes and mouth, and a vesicular rash. The symptoms and signs include acute facial nerve paralysis, pain in the ear, taste loss in the front two-thirds of the tongue, dry mouth and eyes, and an erythematous vesicular rash in the ear canal, the tongue, and/or hard palate. Since the vestibulocochlear nerve is in proximity to the geniculate ganglion, it may also be affected, and patients may also suffer from tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo. Involvement of the trigeminal nerve can cause numbness of the face. Ramsay Hunt syndrome type <b>2</b> refers to shingles of the geniculate ganglion. After initial infection, varicella zoster virus lies dormant in nerve cells in the body, where it is kept in check by the immune system. Given the opportunity, for example during an illness that suppresses the immune system, the virus travels to the end of the nerve cell, where it causes the symptoms described above.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0382">The affected ganglion is responsible for the movements of facial muscles, the touch sensation of a part of ear and ear canal, the taste function of the frontal two-thirds of the tongue, and the moisturization of the eyes and the mouth. The syndrome specifically refers to the combination of this entity with weakness of the muscles activated by the facial nerve. In isolation, the latter is called Bell's palsy. However, as with shingles, the lack of lesions does not definitely exclude the existence of a herpes infection. Even before the eruption of vesicles, varicella zoster virus can be detected from the skin of the ear. Shingles is prevented by immunizing against the causal virus, varicella zoster, for example through Zostavax, a stronger version of chickenpox vaccine.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0000">f Moebius syndrome. Moebius syndrome is a rare neurological condition that primarily affects the muscles that control facial expression and eye movement. The signs and symptoms of this condition are present from birth. Weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles is one of the most common features of Moebius syndrome. Affected individuals lack facial expressions; they cannot smile, frown, or raise their eyebrows. The muscle weakness also causes problems with feeding that become apparent in early infancy. Many people with Moebius syndrome are born with a small chin (micrognathia) and a small mouth (microstomia) with a short or unusually shaped tongue. The roof of the mouth may have an abnormal opening (cleft palate) or be high and arched. These abnormalities contribute to problems with speech, which occur in many children with Moebius syndrome. Dental abnormalities, including missing and misaligned teeth, are also common. Moebius syndrome also affects muscles that control back-and-forth eye movement. Affected individuals must move their head from side to side to read or follow the movement of objects. People with this disorder have difficulty making eye contact, and their eyes may not look in the same direction (strabismus). Additionally, the eyelids may not close completely when blinking or sleeping, which can result in dry or irritated eyes.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0383">Other features of Moebius syndrome can include bone abnormalities in the hands and feet, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and hearing loss. Affected children often experience delayed development of motor skills (such as crawling and walking), although most eventually acquire these skills. Some research studies have suggested that children with Moebius syndrome are more likely than unaffected children to have characteristics of autism spectrum disorders, which are a group of conditions characterized by impaired communication and social interaction. However, recent studies have questioned this association. Because people with Moebius syndrome have difficulty with eye contact and speech due to their physical differences, autism spectrum disorders can be difficult to diagnose in these individuals. Moebius syndrome may also be associated with a somewhat increased risk of intellectual disability; however, most affected individuals have normal intelligence.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0000">g. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by recurring facial paralysis, swelling of the face and lips (usually the upper lip&#x2014;cheilitis granulomatosis) and the development of folds and furrows in the tongue (fissured tongue). Onset is in childhood or early adolescence. After recurrent attacks (ranging from days to years in between), swelling may persist and increase, eventually becoming permanent. The lip may become hard, cracked, and fissured with a reddish-brown discoloration. The cause of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is unknown, but there may be a genetic predisposition. It has been noted to be especially prevalent among certain ethnic groups in Bolivia. It can be symptomatic of Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis. Approximately 400 cases have been reported worldwide.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0384">Diagnosis is mainly based on clinical features. However, biopsy has been useful in diagnosis as well as in differentiating between the different types of the disease. Treatment is symptomatic and may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids to reduce swelling, antibiotics and immunosuppressants. Surgery may be indicated to relieve pressure on the facial nerves and reduce swelling, but its efficacy is uncertain. Massage and electrical stimulation may also be prescribed. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome may recur intermittently after its first appearance. It can become a chronic disorder. Follow-up care should exclude the development of Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0000">h. Guillain-Barr&#xe9; Syndrome (GBS). Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body, with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening, with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure. The cause is unknown. The underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly by surgery and rarely by vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There are a number of subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0385">In those with severe weakness, prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis, together with supportive care, will lead to good recovery in the majority of people. Recovery may take weeks to years. About a third have some permanent weakness. Globally, death occurs in about 7.5% of those affected. Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome is rare, at one or two cases per 100,000 people every year. Both sexes and all parts of the world have similar rates of disease. The first symptoms of Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, alone or in combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress for as long as four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level (&#x201c;plateau phase&#x201d;) before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain in the head and neck relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0386">Many people with Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome have experienced the signs and symptoms of an infection in the 3-6 weeks prior to the onset of the neurological symptoms. This may consist of upper respiratory tract infection (rhinitis, sore throat) or diarrhea. In children, particularly those younger than six years old, the diagnosis can be difficult and the condition is often initially mistaken (sometimes for up to two weeks) for other causes of pains and difficulty walking, such as viral infections, or bone and joint problems. On neurological examination, characteristic features are the reduced strength of muscles and reduced or absent tendon reflexes (hypo- or areflexia, respectively). However, a small proportion have normal reflexes in affected limbs before developing areflexia, and some may have exaggerated reflexes. In the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome (see below), a triad of weakness of the eye muscles, abnormalities in coordination, as well as absent reflexes can be found. The level of consciousness is normally unaffected in Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome, but the Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis subtype may feature drowsiness, sleepiness, or coma</p><p id="p-0397" num="0387">Directly assessing nerve conduction of electrical impulses can exclude other causes of acute muscle weakness, as well as distinguish the different types of Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome. Needle electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies may be performed. In the first two weeks, these investigations may not show any abnormality. Neurophysiology studies are not required for the diagnosis. Formal criteria exist for each of the main subtypes of Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), but these may misclassify some cases (particularly where there is reversible conduction failure) and therefore changes to these criteria have been proposed. Sometimes, repeated testing may be helpful.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0000">i. Sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a disease involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells that form lumps known as granulomas. The disease usually begins in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. Less commonly affected are the eyes, liver, heart, and brain. Any organ, however, can be affected. The signs and symptoms depend on the organ involved. Often, no, or only mild, symptoms are seen. When it affects the lungs, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain may occur. Some may have Lofgren syndrome with fever, large lymph nodes, arthritis, and a rash known as erythema nodosum.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0388">The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. Some believe it may be due to an immune reaction to a trigger such as an infection or chemicals in those who are genetically predisposed. Those with affected family members are at greater risk. Diagnosis is partly based on signs and symptoms, which may be supported by biopsy. Findings that make it likely include large lymph nodes at the root of the lung on both sides, high blood calcium with a normal parathyroid hormone level, or elevated levels of angiotensin converting enzyme in the blood. The diagnosis should only be made after excluding other possible causes of similar symptoms such as tuberculosis.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0389">Sarcoidosis may resolve without any treatment within a few years. However, some people may have long-term or severe disease. Some symptoms may be improved with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. In cases where the condition causes significant health problems, steroids such as prednisone are indicated. Medications such as methotrexate, chloroquine, or azathioprine may occasionally be used in an effort to decrease the side effects of steroids. The risk of death is 1-7%. The chance of the disease returning in someone who has had it previously is less than 5%. In 2015, pulmonary sarcoidosis and interstitial lung disease affected 1.9 million people globally and they resulted in 122,000 deaths. It is most common in Scandinavians, but occurs in all parts of the world. In the United States risk is greater among black as opposed to white people. It usually begins between the ages of 20 and 50. It occurs more often in women than men. Sarcoidosis was first described in 1877 by the English doctor Jonathan Hutchinson as a nonpainful skin disease.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0390">Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ, although it can be asymptomatic and is discovered by accident in about 5% of cases. Common symptoms, which tend to be vague, include fatigue (unrelieved by sleep; occurs in 66% of cases), lack of energy, weight loss, joint aches and pains (which occur in about 70% of cases), arthritis (14-38% of persons), dry eyes, swelling of the knees, blurry vision, shortness of breath, a dry, hacking cough, or skin lesions. Less commonly, people may cough up blood. The cutaneous symptoms vary, and range from rashes and noduli (small bumps) to erythema nodosum, granuloma annulare, or lupus pernio. Sarcoidosis and cancer may mimic one another, making the distinction difficult. The combination of erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and joint pain is called Lofgren syndrome, which has a relatively good prognosis. This form of the disease occurs significantly more often in Scandinavian patients than in those of non-Scandinavian origin.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0391">Any of the components of the nervous system can be involved. Sarcoidosis affecting the nervous system is known as neurosarcoidosis. Cranial nerves are most commonly affected, accounting for about 5-30% of neurosarcoidosis cases, and peripheral facial nerve palsy, often bilateral, is the most common neurological manifestation of sarcoidosis. It occurs suddenly and is usually transient. The central nervous system involvement is present in 10-25% of sarcoidosis cases. Other common manifestations of neurosarcoidosis include optic nerve dysfunction, papilledema, palate dysfunction, neuroendocrine changes, hearing abnormalities, hypothalamic and pituitary abnormalities, chronic meningitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Myelopathy, that is spinal cord involvement, occurs in about 16-43% of neurosarcoidosis cases and is often associated with the poorest prognosis of the neurosarcoidosis subtypes. Whereas facial nerve palsies and acute meningitis due to sarcoidosis tend to have the most favourable prognosis, another common finding in sarcoidosis with neurological involvement is autonomic or sensory small-fiber neuropathy. Neuroendocrine sarcoidosis accounts for about 5-10% of neurosarcoidosis cases and can lead to diabetes insipidus, changes in menstrual cycle and hypothalamic dysfunction. The latter can lead to changes in body temperature, mood, and prolactin (see the endocrine and exocrine section for details).</p><p id="p-0403" num="0000">j. Sj&#xf6;gren syndrome. Sj&#xf6;gren syndrome (SjS, SS) is a long-term autoimmune disease that affects the body's moisture-producing glands. Primary symptoms are a dry mouth and dry eyes. Other symptoms can include dry skin, vaginal dryness, a chronic cough, numbness in the arms and legs, feeling tired, muscle and joint pains, and thyroid problems. Those affected are at an increased risk (5%) of lymphoma. While the exact cause is unclear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetics and an environmental trigger such as exposure to a virus or bacteria. It can occur independently of other health problems (primary Sj&#xf6;gren syndrome) or as a result of another connective tissue disorder (secondary Sj&#xf6;gren syndrome). The inflammation that results progressively damages the glands. Diagnosis is by biopsy of moisture-producing glands and blood tests looking for specific antibodies. On biopsy there are typically lymphocytes within the glands. Treatment is directed at the person's symptoms. For dry eyes artificial tears, medications to reduce inflammation, punctal plugs, or surgery to shut the tear ducts, may be tried. For a dry mouth, chewing gum (preferably sugar free), sipping water, or a saliva substitute may be used. In those with joint or muscle pain, ibuprofen may be used. Medications that can cause dryness, such as antihistamines, may also be stopped.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0392">The disease was described in 1933 by Henrik Sj&#xf6;gren, after whom it is named; however, a number of earlier descriptions of people with the symptoms exist. Between 0.2% and 1.2% of the population are affected, with half having the primary form and half the secondary form. Females are affected about ten times as often as males and it commonly begins in middle age; however, anyone can be affected. Among those without other autoimmune disorders, life expectancy is unchanged.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0393">The hallmark symptom of SS is dry mouth and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes). Vaginal dryness and dry skin and dry nose may also occur. Other organs of the body may also be affected including kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, liver, pancreas, and brain. Skin dryness in some people with SS may be the result of lymphocytic infiltration into skin glands. The symptoms may develop insidiously, with the diagnosis often not considered for several years, because the complaints of sicca may be otherwise attributed to medications, a dry environment, aging, or may be regarded as not of severity warranting the level of investigation necessary to establish the presence of the specific underlying autoimmune disorder. SS can damage vital organs of the body with symptoms that may plateau or worsen, or go into remission as with other autoimmune diseases. Some people may experience only the mild symptoms of dry eyes and mouth, while others have symptoms of severe disease. Many patients can treat problems symptomatically. Others experience blurred vision, constant eye discomfort, recurrent mouth infections, swollen parotid glands, dysphonia (vocal disorders including hoarseness), and difficulty in swallowing and eating. Debilitating fatigue and joint pain can seriously impair quality of life. Some patients can develop renal (kidney) involvement (autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis) leading to proteinuria (excess protein in urine), urinary concentrating defect, and distal renal tubular acidosis.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0394">Moisture replacement therapies such as artificial tears may ease the symptoms of dry eyes. Some patients with more severe problems use goggles to increase local humidity or have punctal plugs inserted to help retain tears on the ocular surface for a longer time. Additionally, cyclosporine (Restasis) is available by prescription to help treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. Prescription drugs are also available that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as cevimeline (Evoxac) and pilocarpine. Salagen, a manufactured form of pilocarpine, can be used to help produce tears, as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines. It is derived from the jaborandi plant.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0395">Any apparatus herein, which may be any of the systems, devices, modules, or functionalities described herein, may be integrated with a smartphone.
