Processes of manufacturing IC involve several stages, comprising, for example, a design stage, a manufacturing stage and an inspection stage. The design stage involves designing both structure and arrangement of circuit components for IC. The manufacturing stage may comprise a plurality of operations, such as lithography, etching, deposition, chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), and the like. During the manufacturing stage, in a &#x201c;patterning&#x201d; process thereof, geometric features (e.g., patterns) on a mask or a reticle may be transferred to a surface of the wafer. A wafer formed with geometric features thus transferred may be referred to as a &#x201c;patterned wafer&#x201d;. In the inspection stage, the IC thus manufactured can be inspected for quality control.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Defects may be incurred during the manufacturing stage. For example, the surface of the wafer may be provided with defects, or the mask may be provided with defects that can be further transferred to the wafer. Therefore, it is advantageous to check for potential defects in the wafer and/or the mask (e.g., in appropriate processing operations) during the inspection stage. Results of the inspection may be used to improve or adjust the design stage, the manufacturing stage, the inspection stage or any combination thereof. In general, &#x201c;patterned substrate&#x201d; (or abbreviated as &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; in the context, without introducing any confusion herein) may be used to represent a wafer, a mask, a reticle, or any structure having a pattern thereon. As semiconductor devices becomes more and more miniaturized in recent years, detection and critical dimension measurement for objects such as substrates (e.g., wafers, or masks, or reticles) become increasingly important.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the field of electron beam inspection (EBI) for semiconductors, both detection speed and throughput are very demanding, and size of available field of view (FOV) of a single frame scanning image determines maximum detection efficiency of the apparatus. As it is expected to achieve components of smaller size in IC manufacturing process so as to achieve higher performance density, then, it becomes a challenge in semiconductor manufacturing to detect defects of relatively small size. Imaging techniques are typically used to inspect defects on patterned substrates. When design rules are reduced (e.g., below 20 nm), high-throughput inspection system (e.g., optical inspection system) may face the challenge of insufficient sensitivity for finding defects (e.g., physical defects). In addition, the optical inspection system may not be able to detect electrical defects buried below the surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, a high-resolution inspection systems, e.g., an electron beam inspection (EBI) system or a charged particle beam imaging system, becomes more and more important in defect detection, especially for electrical defects and minor physical defects. Electron beam inspection apparatus is typically used for defect detection in the production process of semiconductor devices, and its main principle is to bombard the surface of the sample which is being detected with high-energy electron beam, detect both secondary electrons (SE) and backscattered electrons (BSE) generated in a bombarded area of the surface of the sample which area is bombarded, and obtain various physical and chemical information of the sample itself which is being detected, such as topology, composition thereof, etc. Applications of electron beam detection device are typically, for example, based on detection and critical dimension measurement of microscopic patterns on semiconductor silicon wafer and mask with electron beam in vacuum. Electron beam inspection apparatus (comprising scanning electron microscope and the like) is typically used in application scenarios such as semiconductor silicon wafer pattern defect detection with electron beam, and the like. As such, with continuous refinement of semiconductor processes, optical inspection has gradually been unable to meet the detection requirements, and electron beam inspection has been applied more and more widely.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, electron beam inspection also has inherent defects, for example, it has a relatively narrow field of view, and thus it takes more time to inspect samples having the same area, resulting in relatively low throughput of semiconductor detection with electron beam, which limits its popularity for on-line process monitoring and mass manufacturing in semiconductor processes. Further, by way of example, an electromagnetic lens is typically as an objective lens arranged behind or after an electron beam deflection mechanism; Specifically, in a typical electron beam inspection apparatus, e.g., a scanning electron microscope (SEM), there are two deflectors provided in the electron beam deflection mechanism, i.e., a first deflector which is configured to deflect the electron beam emitted from an electron beam source in an off-axis way, and a second deflector which is located downstream the first deflector deflects the electron beam back towards a paraxial position, such that the electron beam thus deflected then travels to the objective lens and focuses to image near a pole piece of the objective lens. With the assistance of the deflector, a movement of positioning and scanning the electron beam thus generated on the sample to be detected can be used to generate and acquire secondary electrons or backscattered electrons from the sample, and then used to generate the sample image. The image obtained by such a typical scanning way is subject to a fact that an off-axis aberration of the electron beam incident on the surface of the sample to be detected is relatively large, such that its available field of view is relatively small, which affects the operation efficiency of the electron beam inspection apparatus.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, in a relevant technical field, it is required urgently to obtain improved scanning electron microscope device and electron beam inspection apparatus, which can reduce off-axis aberration of the electron beam incident thereon, ensure an even larger available field of view of scanning image produced by the electron beam, thus enhancing operational efficiency of the inspection apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The embodiments of the present disclosure have been made to overcome or alleviate at least one aspect of the above mentioned disadvantages and/or shortcomings in the prior art, by providing a scanning electron microscope device and an electron beam inspection apparatus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to achieve above objectives, following technical solutions are adopted in exemplary embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one aspect of embodiments of the disclosure, there is provided a scanning electron microscope device for a sample to be detected, the scanning electron microscope device being configured to project electron beam to a surface of the sample to generate backscattered electrons and secondary electrons, and comprising: an electron beam source, a deflection mechanism, and an objective lens assembly.

By way of example, the electron beam source <b>10</b> is configured to emit an electron beam along an optical axis O of the electron beam source <b>10</b>. In exemplary embodiments, specifically, the electron beam source <b>10</b> is, for example, a hot electron emitter, a cold field emitter, or a hot electron field emitter (e.g., a Schottky emitter).The electron beam source <b>10</b> comprises, for example, a single emitter or a plurality of emitters of any one type of above types of electron emitters. For example, the deflection mechanism <b>11</b> comprises at least: a first deflector <b>111</b> located downstream the electron beam source <b>10</b>; and a second deflector <b>112</b> located downstream the first deflector <b>111</b>. And, by way of example, the objective lens assembly <b>12</b> comprises an excitation coil <b>121</b> which is energized to create a magnetic field and a magnetic yoke <b>122</b> which is for example a housing formed by a magnetizer material to open towards the sample <b>15</b>. And the magnetic yoke <b>122</b> further comprises: a hollow body <b>1221</b> which is for example in the form of closed ring shape and defines an internal chamber <b>1222</b>; and at least one inclined portion which extends (e.g., at whole circumference thereof) inward from the hollow body <b>1221</b> (e.g., at an angle with reference to the hollow body) and directing towards the optical axis O. For example, as illustrated, the at least one inclined portion comprises an inclined portion <b>1223</b> extending inward toward the optical axis O from a radial inner wall of the hollow body <b>1221</b> at an angle (and in turn, for example, at an angle with reference to the optical axis O), with an end of the at least one inclined portion (e.g., the inclined portion <b>1223</b>) being formed as a pole piece <b>1224</b>, the excitation coil <b>121</b> being accommodated in the internal chamber <b>1222</b>. As such, the pole piece <b>1224</b> opens in a direction essentially directing towards the sample <b>15</b> to be detected.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">By way of example, the magnetizer material forming the magnetic yoke <b>122</b> is, for example, a soft magnetic material, e.g., a ferromagnetic material, preferably iron, ferroalloy, or any other relatively material having relatively high magnetic permeability and thus used to provide a magnetic path of relatively low magnetic reluctance for the magnetic field established by the excitation coil.

A purpose of providing the two deflectors is to change the propagation direction of the electron beam in which it travels. Moreover, by way of example, the third deflector <b>113</b> is installed at center(s) of magnetic field and/or electric field of the objective lens assembly <b>12</b>, and an off-axis aberration of off-axis electron beam is reduced with a distribution of electrostatic field, so as to improve size of an available field of view (FOV). A solution of embodiments of the present disclosure is mainly directed towards a technical field of semiconductor defect detection with electron beam.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">By way of example, the first deflector <b>111</b>, the second deflector <b>112</b> and the third deflector <b>113</b> are arranged coaxially with each other or one another along the optical axis O.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Moreover, in embodiments of the present disclosure, each of the first deflector <b>111</b>, the second deflector <b>112</b> and the third deflector <b>113</b> of the deflection mechanism <b>11</b> comprises at least a pair of electrodes provided opposite to each other and symmetrically relative to the optical axis O, and is applied with respective electric excitation which is adjustable so as to adjust both direction and angle of the electron beam passing through the scanning electron microscope device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">More specifically, voltage excitations among the third deflector <b>113</b>, and the first deflector <b>111</b> and the second deflector <b>112</b> may be proportional. If different voltage ratios are adopted, then resolutions of scanning images of the electron beam may vary (i.e., resolutions of scanning images are different). Magnitudes of respective electric excitations of the three deflectors are adjusted depending on different acceleration energies as required respectively, so as to ensure a maximum available field of view of the image generated by the electron beam.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a more specific embodiment, by way of example, each of the first deflector <b>111</b>, the second deflector <b>112</b> and the third deflector <b>113</b> comprises a pair of electrodes provided opposite to each other and symmetrically relative to the optical axis O, and is applied with respective electric excitation which is adjustable so as to adjust both direction and angle of the electron beam passing through the scanning electron microscope device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an alternative more specific embodiment, for example, each of the first deflector <b>111</b>, the second deflector <b>112</b> and the third deflector <b>113</b> is a multi-pole type electrostatic deflector for example comprising four, six, eight, ten, twelve or any even number of poles. Each multi-pole type electrostatic deflector may be &#x201c;excited&#x201d; with different voltages or currents to control a parameter referred to as &#x201c;excitation intensity&#x201d;. The excitation intensity represents a capacity of extending or restraining a cross section of the electron beam (such cross section may be referred to as &#x201c;beam spot&#x201d;). In the present disclosure, &#x201c;excitation&#x201d; refers to a process of generating deflection fields by applying voltages respectively. Typically, the multi-pole type electrostatic deflector is for example in the form of 8-pole or 12-pole electrostatic deflector, and is applied with respective electric excitation which is adjustable so as to adjust both direction and angle of the electron beam passing through the scanning electron microscope device. Specifically, an electrostatic deflector in the form of either 8-pole or 12-pole electrostatic deflector may be used to reduce the off-axis aberration of the electron beam, with a difference therebetween lying in that: 8-pole electrostatic deflector requires a relatively complex electronic control module, but it is relatively easy to process and to ensure the processing accuracy therefore; while an electric control module of 12-pole electrostatic deflector is relatively simple, but the processing thereof is relatively cumbersome and thus is not easy to ensure the accuracy.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Both direction and angle of the electron beam are adjustable upon passing through the three deflectors, by changing magnitudes of respective excitations of the three deflectors.

the electrostatic field generated by the third deflector <b>113</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Specifically, simulation results as illustrated in Table 1 are obtained by using the electronic optical simulation software MeBS to implement analysis. As illustrated in the list in Table 1, in essence, comparison of geometric aberrations, in case of three fields of view of 100 &#x3bc;m, 150 &#x3bc;m, and 200 &#x3bc;m, between respective scanning electron microscope devices in the relevant art and in embodiments of the disclosure. Specifically, upon consideration of definition of geometric aberration in the art, then on-axis aberration mainly comprises following items, that is, monochromatic aberration thereof for a monochromatic light (i.e., specifically functioning as monochromatic aberration from on-axis point, comprising spherical aberration) and position chromatic aberration for chromatic light having different wavelengths (functioning as chromatic aberration from on-axis point), both of which constitute aberration from on-axis point; and off-axis aberration mainly comprises the following items, that is, monochromatic aberration thereof (i.e., specifically functioning as monochromatic aberration from off-axis point, comprising coma, astigmatism, field curvature, and distortion) and magnification chromatic aberration (functioning as chromatic aberration from off-axis point), both of which constitute aberration from off-axis point, then, in embodiments of the present disclosure, the off-axis aberration of the electron beam mainly refers to off-axis chromatic aberration, astigmatism, field curvature and distortion, in which the distortion affects orthogonality of the image rather than affecting the resolution of the image. Thereby, as compared with a condition containing merely two deflectors in relevant art, then, in embodiments of the present disclosure, due to the addition of the third deflector <b>113</b>, off-axis chromatic aberration, field curvature and distortion (especially the latter two, i.e., field curvature and distortion) of the electron beam will be significantly decreased, without affecting size of the beam spot on the axis, simultaneously. As such, the available field of view of the scanning images of the electron beam may be expanded and detection efficiency of the electron beam may be improved.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Moreover, by way of example, as illustrated in Table 1, it can be seen that in a condition of the deflection mechanism in the form of dual deflector type in relevant art, then, as to a field of view of 100 &#x3bc;m, the off-axis beam spot is 16.73 nm, however, the off-axis beam spot may be decreased to 9.5 nm (.e., with a drop percentage or decreasing amplitude percentage up to 43%) in the existence of additional third deflector <b>113</b>. Furthermore, as to a field of view of 150 &#x3bc;m, the off-axis beam spot may be decreased with a drop percentage or decreasing amplitude percentage of 45% in the existence of additional third deflector <b>113</b>; and as to a field of view of 200 &#x3bc;m, the off-axis beam spot may be decreased with a drop percentage or decreasing amplitude percentage of 45.3% in the existence of additional third deflector <b>113</b>. A main factor resulting in reduction of the off-axis beam spot lies in that, off-axis chromatic aberration, field curvature and distortion all become smaller; and although both astigmatism and coma become larger, their respective contributions to the size of the electron beam spot are relatively small. In general, the electron beam spot becomes smaller in the existence of additional third deflector <b>113</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Therefore, an incident angle of the electron beam entering the objective lens assembly <b>12</b> may be controlled by changing the deflection excitation of the second deflector <b>112</b>, and then, the maximum available field of view of the electron beam image may be ensured, by changing the excitation of the third deflector <b>113</b>, which fact expands service conditions of the deflector.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, specifically, for example, the hollow body <b>1221</b> is an annular hollow body <b>1221</b> defining the internal chamber <b>1222</b> in a form of annular shape for accommodating the excitation coil <b>121</b> therein.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">And, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, specifically, for example, the inclined portion <b>1223</b> is in a form of a conical ring shrinking towards the sample.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, for example, the inclined portion <b>1223</b> of the objective lens assembly <b>12</b> defines an electron beam channel <b>13</b> shrinking towards the sample <b>15</b>, with a portion of the electron beam channel <b>13</b> at the third deflector <b>113</b> being a gap defined between the electrodes of the third deflector <b>113</b> in a diameter direction thereof.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Moreover, installation position, size and installation angle of the third deflector <b>113</b> additionally provided in the opening of the pole piece <b>1224</b> of the objective lens assembly <b>12</b> have great influence on the off-axis aberration of the electron beam propagating therethrough; the material of the third deflector <b>113</b> may also affect electromagnetic properties of the electron beam. Therefore, it is necessary to properly set the material, specific installation settings (comprising installation position, installation orientation, angle, and the like) and size of the third deflector <b>113</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, for example, the pole piece <b>1224</b> is an end of the inclined portion <b>1223</b> of the magnetic yoke <b>122</b> disposed substantially parallel to the optical axis O, and a length of each electrode of the third deflector <b>113</b> is of the same order of magnitude as a thickness of the pole piece <b>1224</b> but is not smaller than and is preferably equal to the thickness of the pole piece <b>1224</b>. Thereby, the selection of both size of the third deflector <b>113</b> (e.g., especially a length thereof along an extension direction in which its electrode extends) and size of the pole piece <b>1224</b> (especially the thickness thereof) is essentially computationally obtained by conversion, for a combination of both size of the third deflector <b>113</b> and size of the pole piece <b>1224</b> which obtains minimized (or approximately minimized) off-axis aberration on the basis of results of a simulation analysis with the electronic optical simulation software MeBS.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">Additionally or alternatively, in other exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, for example, the orientation of electrodes of the third deflector <b>113</b> is arranged at a predetermined angle relative to electrodes of the first deflector <b>111</b>, and the predetermined angle is set such that an off-axis aberration of the electron beam which is subject to deflection applied by the third deflector <b>113</b> is minimized. This predetermined angle has an important influence on the imaging effect. Thereby, the selection of the orientation (i.e. predetermined angle) of electrodes of the third deflector <b>113</b> relative to electrodes of the first deflector <b>111</b> is essentially computationally obtained by conversion, for relative angle setting between the third deflector <b>113</b> and the first deflector <b>111</b> of the third deflector <b>113</b> and size of the pole piece <b>1224</b> which obtains minimized (or approximately minimized) off-axis aberration on the basis of results of a simulation analysis with the electronic optical simulation software MeBS.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">In embodiments of the present disclosure, for example, it is an option that the third deflector <b>113</b> is installed inside the pole piece <b>1224</b> of the objective lens assembly, and the third deflector <b>113</b> is formed by a non-magnetizer material which is electrically conductive.

In other words, with individual control (i.e., discrete control) of respective potentials of the composite detection assembly, the shielding plate <b>14</b> and the sample <b>15</b> to be detected, all of the three jointly and cooperatively define one decelerating electric field of the decelerating electrostatic lens, and then the decelerating electric field cooperates with an immersed type magnetic field generated by the magnetic lens jointly form a composite objective field which is of immersed type for deceleration, which may produce at least three composite effects as follows: firstly, it is capable of focusing the electron beam incident on the sample <b>15</b>; secondly, it is capable of decelerating the electron beam incident on the sample <b>15</b> and reducing the energy of the electron beam so as to reduce its impact on the sample; thirdly, it is capable of accelerating signal electrons (comprising backscattered electrons (BSE) and secondary electrons (SE)) generated on the surface of sample <b>15</b> so as to improve collection rate of the signal electrons at the detector(s), and in turn to obtain smaller focused beam spots and to achieve higher resolution.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">Moreover, in a further embodiment of the present disclosure, for example, an additional deflection control mechanism is additionally provided between the surface of the sample <b>15</b> to be detected and the objective lens assembly <b>12</b>, more specifically, for example, the deflection control mechanism comprises at least one pair of opposed electrodes and a gap therebetween for passing therethrough the electron beam for scanning. The electrodes of the deflection control mechanism is manufactured by an electrically conductive material having no magnetoconductivity or magnetic permeability, and the deflection control mechanism generates a scanning electric field after a scanning voltage is applied thereon, and the scanning electric field is further coupled with the composite objective field which is of immersed type for deceleration, such that a central axis of the composite objective field which is of immersed type for deceleration of the objective lens assembly <b>12</b> swings or translates so as to further reduce the off-axis aberration.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic structural view illustrating an objective lens assembly in a scanning electron microscope device according to an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">According to an alternative embodiment of the present disclosure, unlike the objective lens assembly which functions as an immersed type magnetic lens having merely a pole piece which is essentially an end of a single inclined portion angled from the radial inner wall of the hollow body of the magnetic yoke towards the optical axis as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the objective lens assembly as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is, for example, a semi-immersed type magnetic lens excited by a current coil, or alternatively a non-immersed type magnetic lens. And the objective lens assembly as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> comprises an magnetic excitation/induction coil (i.e., magnetization coil) wound by a wire and a housing (i.e., a magnetic yoke) formed by a magnetizer material, and the housing has two inclined portions angled towards the optical axis (i.e., two inclined portions, each extending inward from a respective one of radial inner wall and radial outer wall of the housing at respective angle with reference to the respective one of radial inner wall and radial outer wall, respectively, and directing towards the optical axis), and respective ends of the two inclined portions are respectively formed into an upper pole piece and a lower pole piece; and in the direction of the optical axis, the upper pole piece is located above the lower pole piece and positioned closer to the optical axis than the lower pole piece. Moreover, a current excitation in the excitation coil resulting in a formation of a magnetic field between the upper and lower pole pieces. The inner diameter of the upper pole piece is &#x3a6;1 while the inner diameter of the lower pole piece is &#x3a6;2. In a condition of &#x3a6;1&#x2265;&#x3a6;2, the magnetic field is concentrated between the upper pole piece and the lower pole piece and thus operates with both of the two pole pieces to function as a non-immersed type magnetic lens; and in a condition of &#x3a6;1&#x2264;&#x3a6;2, a portion of resulting magnetic field will leak towards the sample to be detected so as to form a semi-immersed type lens.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">The technical solution provided by embodiments of the present disclosure has at least one of the following advantages:</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">By introducing the third deflector which cooperates with the use of both the first deflector and the second deflector, the off-axis aberration of the electron beam may be reduced and the available field of view (FOV) of scanning images of the electron beam may be expanded, so as to improve detection efficiency of the electron beam. By providing the shielding plate below the third deflector and changing voltage applied on the shielding plate below the third deflector, the influence on performance of the third deflection as applied by the deceleration mode of the objective lens may be weakened so as to ensure the detection efficiency of the electron beam inspection apparatus. Moreover, voltage excitations between the third deflector and each of the first deflector and the second deflector may be proportional; as such, if different voltage ratios are adopted, then resolutions of scanning images of the electron beam may vary. Magnitudes of respective electric excitations of the three deflectors are adjusted depending on different acceleration energies as required by the electron beam inspection apparatus respectively, so as to ensure a maximum available field of view of the image generated by the electron beam.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">In addition, according to the foregoing embodiments of the present disclosure, it can be understood that any technical solution formed by any combination of two or more embodiments also falls within the scope of protection of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">It should be understood that, orientation terms in the description of the present disclosure, such as &#x201c;up&#x201d;, &#x201c;down&#x201d;, &#x201c;left&#x201d;, &#x201c;right&#x201d;, and the like, are used to explain orientation relationship as illustrated in the attached drawings.
