China application serial no. 202110750325.1, filed on Jul. 2, 2021. The entirety of the above-mentioned patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a display technique, and in particularly, relates to a backlight module and a display apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Along with increasing applications of non-self-luminous displays such as liquid crystal displays, the design of backlight modules also needs to be adjusted for different purposes. In order to improve the light energy utilization rate of a light source, backlight modules equipped with optical brightness enhancement film (BEF) have become one of the mainstreams in the market. Generally, this type of backlight module is equipped with a laminated structure of two optical BEFs (for example, two prism sheets with prism extending directions to be orthogonal to each other), which may guide a light beam emitted from a light guide plate at a large angle to cover a specific angle range (for example, &#x2212;60 degrees to 60 degrees) of a normal viewing angle to increase the light intensity of the backlight module near the normal viewing angle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to further improve high light collection of the backlight modules, a high light collection type backlight module using reverse prism sheets to replace the two laminated optical BEFs is developed. This type of the backlight module may further increase the total light output near the normal viewing angle (i.e., having a light converging characteristic of a smaller angle range). However, since prism structures of the reverse prism sheet needs to be arranged opposite to the light guide plate, the light emitting surface of the light guide plate may be easily scratched by the prism structures of the reverse prism sheet, which affects the production yield of the backlight module. On the other hand, since the illumination beam generated by such backlight module has a low light beam polarizability, the loss of light energy after passing through a display panel with a polarizer is large, resulting in a poor light energy utilization rate of the display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The information disclosed in this BACKGROUND section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the described technology and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Further, the information disclosed in the BACKGROUND section does not mean that one or more problems to be resolved by one or more embodiments of the invention was acknowledged by a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is directed to a backlight module adapted to generate an illumination beam with a relatively high proportion of a specific polarization component.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention is directed to a display apparatus providing a favorable light energy utilization rate.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve one or a portion of or all of the objects or other objects, an embodiment of the invention provides a backlight module. The backlight module includes a light guide plate, a light source, a first optical film, and a second optical film. The light guide plate has a light incident surface and a light emitting surface connected to each other. The light source is disposed on one side of the light incident surface of the light guide plate, and is configured to emit an illumination beam. The first optical film is disposed on one side of the light emitting surface of the light guide plate. The illumination beam has a first polarization component parallel to a virtual surface and a second polarization component perpendicular to the virtual surface after passing through the first optical film. The virtual surface is perpendicular to the light incident surface and the light emitting surface. A ratio of the first polarization component to the second polarization component is greater than or equal to 1.2 and less than or equal to 10. The second optical film is disposed on one side of the first optical film facing away from the light guide plate, and includes a substrate and a plurality of prism structures. The prism structures are disposed on one side of the substrate of the second optical film facing the light guide plate, and an included angle between an extending direction of the prism structures and the light incident surface of the light guide plate is less than 5 degrees.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve one or a portion of or all of the objects or other objects, an embodiment of the invention further provides a display apparatus. The display apparatus includes a display panel and a backlight module. The backlight module is disposed in overlap with the display panel, and includes a light guide plate, a light source, a first optical film, and a second optical film. The light guide plate has a light incident surface and a light emitting surface connected to each other. The light source is disposed on one side of the light incident surface of the light guide plate, and is configured to emit an illumination beam. The first optical film is disposed on one side of the light emitting surface of the light guide plate. The illumination beam has a first polarization component parallel to a virtual surface and a second polarization component perpendicular to the virtual surface after passing through the first optical film. The virtual surface is perpendicular to the light incident surface and the light emitting surface.

The second optical film is disposed on one side of the first optical film facing away from the light guide plate, and includes a substrate and a plurality of prism structures. The prism structures are disposed on one side of the substrate facing the light guide plate, and an included angle between an extending direction of the prism structures and the light incident surface of the light guide plate is less than 5 degrees.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Based on the above descriptions, in the backlight module and the display apparatus of an embodiment of the invention, the first optical film and the second optical film are disposed on one side of the light emitting surface of the light guide plate. One side of the second optical film facing the light guide plate is provided with a plurality of prism structures with the extending direction substantially parallel to the light incident surface of the light guide plate. The first optical film located between the prism structures and the light guide plate may increase a polarization component of the illumination beam from the light guide plate in a specific direction, which is beneficial to an increase in the light energy utilization rate of the display apparatus. Moreover, through arrangement of the first optical film, the light emitting surface of the light guide plate is prevented from being scratched by the prism structures of the second optical film, so the production yield of the backlight module is prevented from being affected.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other objectives, features and advantages of the present invention will be further understood from the further technological features disclosed by the embodiments of the present invention wherein there are shown and described preferred embodiments of this invention, simply by way of illustration of modes best suited to carry out the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the invention, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.

The backlight module <b>50</b> includes the light guide plate <b>100</b>, the light source <b>110</b>, a first optical film <b>120</b>, and the second optical film <b>130</b>. The light guide plate <b>100</b> has a light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b</i>, a light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>a</i>, and a bottom surface <b>100</b><i>c</i>. The light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>is connected to the light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>a </i>and the bottom surface <b>100</b><i>c</i>. The light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>a </i>is opposite to the bottom surface <b>100</b><i>c</i>. The light source <b>110</b> is disposed on one side of the light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b>, and is configured to emit an illumination beam IB. Namely, the backlight module <b>50</b> of the embodiment is an edge-type backlight module. It should be noted that in the embodiment, a number of the light sources <b>110</b> is, for example, four, which does not mean that the invention is limited to the content disclosed in the drawings. In other embodiments, the number of the light sources <b>110</b> may be adjusted according to an optical design of the backlight module.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this embodiment, the light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b> may be selectively provided with a plurality of lenticular lens structures <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>1</b>, and the bottom surface <b>100</b><i>c </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b> may be selectively provided with a plurality of optical microstructures <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>2</b>. For example, the lenticular lens structures <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>1</b> are arranged in a direction Y and extend in a direction X, and the optical microstructures <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> are arranged in the direction X and extend in the direction Y. Namely, an extending direction of the lenticular lens structures <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>1</b> intersects an extending direction of the optical microstructures <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>2</b>. Particularly, the extending direction of the lenticular lens structures <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>1</b> is substantially perpendicular to the light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b>. However, the invention is not limited thereto. In other embodiments, a plurality of optical microstructures may be provided on at least one of the light emitting surface and the bottom surface of the light guide plate according to actual light shape requirements.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this embodiments, each of the lenticular lens structures <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>1</b> of the light guide plate <b>100</b> has a height H<b>1</b> parallel to a normal direction (for example, a direction Z) of the light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>a </i>and a width W parallel to the light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>and the light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>a</i>, and a ratio of the height H<b>1</b> to the width W is greater than 0.15. The optical microstructures <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> of the light guide plate <b>100</b> respectively have a light-facing surface <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>2</b><i>r</i>. In the embodiment, by setting an included angle &#x3b1; between the light-facing surface <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>2</b><i>r </i>of the optical microstructure <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> and the bottom surface <b>100</b><i>c </i>is between 1 degree and 10 degrees, the illumination beam IB may be emitted out from the light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b> at a relatively large angle (for example, greater than 50 degrees). In an exemplary embodiment, the included angle &#x3b1; between the light-facing surface <b>100</b><i>m</i><b>2</b><i>r </i>and the bottom surface <b>100</b><i>c </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b> may be between 4 degrees and 10 degrees.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To be more specific, a light exit type of the light guide plate <b>100</b> of the embodiment has concentricity and directivity, and a transmission direction of the illumination beam IB emitted from the light guide plate <b>100</b> is substantially deflected toward a normal direction of the light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>(for example, a direction opposite to the direction X). For example, a light intensity of the illumination beam IB emitted from the light guide plate <b>100</b> is mostly concentrated on a side of the light guide plate <b>100</b> relative to the light source <b>110</b> (a region near an azimuth angle of 90 degrees in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>), and the light intensity is more concentrated in an exit angle range of 50 degrees to 85 degrees on this azimuth (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). Therefore, the illumination beam IB from the light guide plate <b>100</b> may enter the first optical film <b>120</b> at a relatively large angle (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). For example, an included angle &#x3b8; (i.e., an incident angle) between the illumination beam IB incident to the first optical film <b>120</b> and a normal direction of the first optical film <b>120</b> toward a first surface <b>120</b><i>s </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b> is greater than 50 degrees.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, the first optical film <b>120</b> is disposed on one side of the light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b>. The illumination beam IB from the light guide plate <b>100</b> has a first polarization component P<b>1</b> parallel to a virtual surface (not shown in the figure) and a second polarization component P<b>2</b> perpendicular to the virtual surface, and the virtual surface here is, for example, an XZ plane, i.e., the virtual surface is perpendicular to the light incident surface <b>110</b><i>b </i>and the light emitting surface <b>110</b><i>a</i>. Particularly, after the illumination beam IB passes through the first optical film <b>120</b>, it also has the first polarization component P<b>1</b> parallel to the aforementioned virtual surface and the second polarization component P<b>2</b> perpendicular to the virtual surface, wherein a ratio of the first polarization component P<b>1</b> to the second polarization component P<b>2</b> is greater than or equal to 1.2 and less than or equal to 10. In an exemplary embodiment, the ratio of the first polarization component P<b>1</b> to the second polarization component P<b>2</b> of the illumination beam IB after passing through the first optical film <b>120</b> may be greater than or equal to 1.2 and less than or equal to 4.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this embodiment, a material of the first optical film <b>120</b> is, for example, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Therefore, if the illumination beam IB from the light guide plate <b>100</b> enters the first optical film <b>120</b> at an angle greater than 50 degrees, a transmittance difference of the first polarization component P<b>1</b> and the second polarization component P<b>2</b> of the illumination beam IB at a light incident surface (i.e., the first surface <b>120</b><i>s </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) of the first optical film <b>120</b> may be greater than 10%, and a good polarization separation effect is thereby provided.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> together, the second optical film <b>130</b> is disposed on a side of the first optical film <b>120</b> facing away from the light guide plate <b>100</b> and includes a substrate <b>131</b> and a plurality of prism structures <b>132</b>. The substrate <b>131</b> has a surface <b>131</b><i>a </i>facing the light guide plate <b>100</b> and a surface <b>131</b><i>b </i>opposite to the surface <b>131</b><i>a</i>. The prism structures <b>132</b> of the second optical film <b>130</b> are arranged on the surface <b>131</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>131</b> in the direction X and extend in the direction Y. Namely, an extending direction of the prism structures <b>132</b> of the embodiment is parallel to the light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b>, but the invention is not limited thereto. In other embodiments, in order to avoid a moire pattern produced by the prism structures <b>132</b> and the periodic structures of other film layers, the extending direction of the prism structures <b>132</b> may not be parallel to the light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b>, for example, an included angle between the extending direction of the prism structures <b>132</b> and the light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b> may be less than 15 degrees. In an exemplary embodiment, the included angle between the extending direction of the prism structures <b>132</b> and the light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b> may be less than 5 degrees.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In detail, each of the prism structures <b>132</b> has a prism light-facing surface <b>132</b><i>r </i>facing the light source <b>110</b> and a shady surface <b>132</b><i>b </i>facing away from the light source <b>110</b>. Here, the prism light-facing surface <b>132</b><i>r </i>and the shady surface <b>132</b><i>b </i>define a ridge line <b>132</b>RL of the prism structure <b>132</b>, and an extending direction of the ridge line <b>132</b>RL is parallel to the light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b>. The shady surface <b>132</b><i>b </i>of the prism structure <b>132</b> may be divided into two parts, i.e., a first part <b>132</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and a second part <b>132</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>. The first part <b>132</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> is connected between the substrate <b>131</b> and the second part <b>132</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>. The second part <b>132</b><i>b </i>is connected between the prism light-facing surface <b>132</b><i>r </i>and the first part <b>132</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Particularly, in this embodiment, an included angle [<b>31</b> between the first part <b>132</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> of the shady surface <b>132</b><i>b </i>of the prism structure <b>132</b> and the prism light-facing surface <b>132</b><i>r </i>is between 62 degrees and 68 degrees, and an included angle P<b>2</b> between the second part <b>132</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> of the shady surface <b>132</b><i>b </i>and a virtual extending surface of the first part <b>132</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> is between 2 degrees and 4 degrees. Namely, the shady surface <b>132</b><i>b </i>of the prism structure <b>132</b> is a bent surface. The illumination beam IB from the first optical film <b>120</b> is deflected toward the normal direction (for example, the direction Z) of the light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>a </i>after entering the prism structure <b>132</b> of the second optical film <b>130</b>, thereby increasing an output brightness value of the backlight module <b>50</b> near the normal viewing angle, and forming a light shape with high light collection.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is configured to illustrate that the shady surface <b>132</b><i>b </i>of the prism structure <b>132</b> of the second optical film <b>130</b> has a break angle, the invention is not limited thereto. In other embodiments that are not shown, it is also possible that the prism light-facing surface <b>132</b><i>r </i>of the prism structure <b>132</b> of the second optical film <b>130</b> has a break angle, i.e., the prism structure <b>132</b> of the second optical film <b>130</b> has a break angle on one side surface. In an embodiment, besides that the shady surface <b>132</b><i>b </i>of a prism structure <b>132</b>A of a second optical film <b>130</b>&#x2033; has a break angle, a prism light-facing surface <b>132</b><i>r</i>&#x2033; of the prism structure <b>132</b>A of a second optical film <b>130</b>&#x2033; may also be divided into two parts, i.e., a third part <b>132</b><i>r</i><b>1</b> and a fourth part <b>132</b><i>r</i><b>2</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). The third part <b>132</b><i>r</i><b>1</b> is connected between the substrate <b>131</b> and the fourth part <b>132</b><i>r</i><b>2</b>. The fourth part <b>132</b><i>r</i><b>2</b> is connected between the second part <b>132</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> of the shady surface <b>132</b><i>b </i>and the third part <b>132</b><i>r</i><b>1</b>. Similar to the shady surface <b>132</b><i>b</i>, an included angle P<b>3</b> between the fourth part <b>132</b><i>r</i><b>2</b> of the prism light-facing surface <b>132</b><i>r</i>&#x2033; and a virtual extending surface of the third part <b>132</b><i>r</i><b>1</b> is between 2 degrees and 4 degrees. Therefore, both sides surfaces of the prism structure <b>132</b>A of the second optical film <b>130</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> have the break angles.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some other embodiments, the prism light-facing surface and the shady surface of the prism structure of the second optical film may also be planar surfaces without break angles. For example, in a prism structure <b>132</b>C of a second optical film <b>130</b>C of an embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, neither a prism light-facing surface <b>132</b><i>r</i>&#x2032; nor a shady surface <b>132</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; has a break angle. Particularly, an included angle y <b>1</b> between the prism light-facing surface <b>132</b><i>r</i>&#x2032; and the substrate <b>131</b> is not equal to an included angle y <b>2</b> between the shady surface <b>132</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; and the substrate <b>131</b>, and an included angle <b>13</b> <b>1</b>&#x2032; between the prism light-facing surface <b>132</b><i>r</i>&#x2032; and the shady surface <b>132</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; of the prism structure <b>132</b>C is preferably between 48 degrees and 74 degrees, and is optimally between 48 degrees and 64 degrees. However, the invention is not limited thereto. In an embodiment that is not shown, the included angle between the prism light-facing surface of the prism structure and the substrate of the second optical film may also be equal to the included angle between the shady surface and the substrate, and the included angle between the prism light-facing surface and the shady surface of the prism structure is preferably between 59 degrees and 67 degrees, and is optimally between 60 degrees and 64 degrees.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the other hand, since an apex angle of the prism structure <b>132</b> of the second optical film <b>130</b> is an acute angle, it is easy to scratch the light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>a </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b> to form bright marks or bright spots. By disposing the first optical film <b>120</b> between the light guide plate <b>100</b> and the second optical film <b>130</b>, the prism structures <b>132</b> on the second optical film <b>130</b> may also be prevented from directly contacting the light emitting surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b>, thereby improving production yield of the backlight module <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this embodiment, a material of the substrate of the first optical film <b>120</b> (such as the substrate <b>121</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) and the substrate <b>131</b> of the second optical film <b>130</b> may be a low complex refractive index material, and the low complex refractive index material includes, for example, polycarbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), cyclic olefin polymer (COP) and cellulose triacetate (TAC), but the invention is not limited thereto. In other embodiments, the material of the substrate of the first optical film <b>120</b> and/or the substrate <b>131</b> of the second optical film <b>130</b> may also be a high complex refractive index material, and the high complex refractive index material includes, for example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC) or a stretched film of cyclic olefin copolymer (COP). Particularly, if the high complex refractive index material is configured to fabricate the substrate of the first optical film <b>120</b> and the substrate <b>131</b> of the second optical film <b>130</b> (i.e., the substrate of the optical film has birefringence), an axial direction of an optical axis (or a material stretching axis) of the substrate of the optical film should be parallel or perpendicular to the light incident surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the light guide plate <b>100</b> to avoid phase retardation of the illumination beam IB after passing through these films. Such phase retardation may cause a change of the ratio of the first polarization component P<b>1</b> to the second polarization component P<b>2</b> of the illumination beam IB, which results in deterioration of the aforementioned polarization separation effect.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> again, the display apparatus <b>10</b> further includes a display panel <b>200</b> that is overlapped and disposed on the backlight module <b>50</b>. The display panel <b>200</b> is located on one side of the surface <b>131</b><i>b </i>of the second optical film <b>130</b> and includes two polarizers <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> and a liquid crystal cell <b>220</b>.
