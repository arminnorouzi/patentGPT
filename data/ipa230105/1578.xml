The illustrative examples may be implemented or incorporated in other aspects, variations, and modifications, and may be practiced or carried out in various ways. Further, unless otherwise indicated, the terms and expressions employed herein have been chosen for the purpose of describing the illustrative examples for the convenience of the reader and are not for the purpose of limitation thereof. Also, it will be appreciated that one or more of the following-described aspects, expressions of aspects, and/or examples, can be combined with any one or more of the other following-described aspects, expressions of aspects, and/or examples.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053">Minimally-invasive surgery (MIS), such as laparoscopic surgery and bronchoscopy, typically involves techniques intended to reduce tissue damage during a surgical procedure. For example, laparoscopic procedures can involve creating a number of small incisions in the patient (e.g., in the abdomen) and introducing one or more surgical tools (e.g., end effectors and an endoscope) through the incisions into the patient. Bronchoscopy can involve passing a bronchoscope through a patient's nose and/or mouth, down the patient's throat, and into the patient's lungs. Surgical procedures may then be performed using the introduced surgical tools and with visualization aid provided by the endoscope, for example.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054">MIS may provide certain benefits, such as reduced patient scarring, less patient pain, shorter patient recovery periods, and/or lower medical treatment costs associated with patient recovery. Recent technological developments allow robotic systems to perform more MIS procedures. The robotic systems typically include one or more robotic arms for manipulating surgical tools based on commands from a remote operator (e.g. surgeon/clinician). A robotic arm may, for example, support at its distal end various surgical devices such as surgical end effectors, imaging devices, and cannulas for providing access to the patient's body cavity and organs.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0055">Existing robotically-assisted surgical systems typically consist of a surgeon console and a patient-side cart with one or more interactive robotic arms controlled from the console. For example, one robotic arm can support a camera and the other robotic arm(s) can support robotic tools such as scalpels, scissors, graspers, and staplers, for example. Various exemplary robotic tools are further described herein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0056">A robotic surgical system disclosed herein can be a software-controlled, electro-mechanical system designed for clinicians to perform MIS procedures. The robotic surgical system can be used with an endoscope, compatible endoscopic instruments, and accessories. The system may be used by trained clinicians (e.g. physicians/surgeons) in an operating room environment to assist in the accurate control of compatible endoscopic instruments during robotically-assisted urologic, gynecologic, gastrological, and other laparoscopic surgical procedures. The compatible endoscopic instruments and accessories for use with the surgical system are intended for endoscopic manipulation of tissue including stapling, grasping, cutting, blunt and sharp dissection, approximation, ligation, electrocautery, and suturing, for example.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0057">An exemplary robotic system <b>2100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which depicts a cart-based robotically-enabled system arranged for a diagnostic and/or therapeutic bronchoscopy procedure. During a bronchoscopy, the system <b>2100</b> may include a cart <b>2110</b> having one or more robotic arms <b>2112</b> to deliver a surgical device, such as a steerable endoscope <b>2113</b>, which may be a procedure-specific bronchoscope for bronchoscopy, to a natural orifice access point (i.e., the mouth of the patient positioned on a table in the present example) to deliver diagnostic and/or therapeutic tools. As shown, the cart <b>2110</b> may be positioned proximate to the patient's upper torso in order to provide access to the access point. Similarly, the robotic arms <b>2112</b> may be actuated to position the bronchoscope relative to the access point. The arrangement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may also be utilized when performing a gastro-intestinal (GI) procedure with a gastroscope, a specialized endoscope for GI procedures.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0058">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, once the cart <b>2110</b> is properly positioned, the robotic arms <b>2112</b> may insert the steerable endoscope <b>2113</b> into the patient robotically, manually, or a combination thereof. The endoscope <b>2113</b> may be directed down the patient's trachea and lungs after insertion using precise commands from the robotic system until reaching the target destination or operative site. For example, the endoscope <b>2113</b> may be directed to deliver a biopsy needle to a target, such as, for example, a lesion or nodule within the lungs of a patient. The needle may be deployed down a working channel that runs the length of the endoscope to obtain a tissue sample to be analyzed by a pathologist. Depending on the pathology results, additional tools may be deployed down the working channel of the endoscope for additional biopsies. After identifying a nodule to be malignant, the endoscope <b>2113</b> may endoscopically deliver tools to resect the potentially cancerous tissue. In some instances, diagnostic and therapeutic treatments can be delivered in separate procedures. In those circumstances, the endoscope <b>2113</b> may also be used to deliver a fiducial to &#x201c;mark&#x201d; the location of the target nodule as well. In other instances, diagnostic and therapeutic treatments may be delivered during the same procedure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0059">The system <b>2100</b> may also include a movable tower <b>2130</b>, which may be connected via support cables to the cart <b>2110</b> to provide support for controls, electronics, fluidics, optics, sensors, and/or power to the cart <b>2110</b>. Placing such functionality in the tower <b>2130</b> allows for a smaller form factor cart <b>2110</b> that may be more easily adjusted and/or re-positioned by an operating clinician (e.g. surgeon) and his/her staff. Additionally, the division of functionality between the cart/table and the tower <b>2130</b> reduces operating room clutter and facilitates improving clinical workflow. While the cart <b>2110</b> may be positioned close to the patient, the tower <b>2130</b> may be stowed in a remote location to stay out of the way during a procedure.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0060">In support of the robotic systems described above, the tower <b>2130</b> may include component(s) of a computer-based control system that stores computer program instructions, for example, within a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium such as a persistent magnetic storage drive, solid state drive, etc. The execution of those instructions, whether the execution occurs in the tower <b>2130</b> or the cart <b>2110</b>, may control the entire system or sub-system(s) thereof. For example, when executed by a processor of the computer system, the instructions may cause the components of the robotics system to actuate the relevant carriages and arm mounts, actuate the robotics arms, and control the robotic surgical tools. For example, in response to receiving the control signal, the motors in the joints of the robotics arms may position the arms into a certain posture.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0061">The tower <b>2130</b> may also include a pump, flow meter, valve control, and/or fluid access in order to provide controlled irrigation and aspiration capabilities to the system that may be deployed through the endoscope <b>2113</b>. These components may also be controlled using the computer system of tower <b>2130</b>. In some aspects, irrigation and aspiration capabilities may be delivered directly to the endoscope <b>2113</b> through separate cable(s).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0062">The tower <b>2130</b> may include a voltage and surge protector designed to provide filtered and protected electrical power to the cart <b>2110</b>, thereby avoiding placement of a power transformer and other auxiliary power components in the cart <b>2110</b>, resulting in a smaller, more moveable cart <b>2110</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0063">The tower <b>2130</b> may also include support equipment for the sensors deployed throughout the robotic system <b>2100</b>. For example, the tower <b>2130</b> may include opto-electronics equipment for detecting, receiving, and processing data received from the optical sensors or cameras throughout the robotic system <b>2100</b>. In combination with the control system, such opto-electronics equipment may be used to generate real-time images for display in any number of consoles deployed throughout the system, including in the tower <b>2130</b>. Similarly, the tower <b>2130</b> may also include an electronic subsystem for receiving and processing signals received from deployed electromagnetic (EM) sensors. The tower <b>2130</b> may also be used to house and position an EM field generator for detection by EM sensors in or on the robotic surgical tool. The tower <b>2130</b> can also house an electrosurgical generator for supplying RF current to a robotic surgical tool, such as monopolar scissors, for example.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">The tower <b>2130</b> may also include a console <b>2132</b> in addition to other consoles available in the rest of the system, e.g., a console mounted on top of the cart <b>2110</b>. The console <b>2132</b> may include a user interface and a display screen, such as a touchscreen, for the clinician. Consoles in the system <b>2100</b> are generally designed to provide both robotic controls as well as pre-operative and real-time information of the procedure, such as navigational and localization information of the endoscope <b>2113</b>. When the console <b>2132</b> is not the only console available to the clinician, it may be used by a second clinician, such as a nurse, for example, to monitor the health or vitals of the patient and the operation of system, as well as provide procedure-specific data, such as navigational and localization information. In other aspects, the console <b>2132</b> is housed in a body that is separate from the tower <b>2130</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0065">The tower <b>2130</b> may be coupled to the cart <b>2110</b> and endoscope <b>2113</b> through one or more cables or connections. In some aspects, the support functionality from the tower <b>2130</b> may be provided through a single cable to the cart <b>2110</b>, simplifying and de-cluttering the operating room. In other aspects, specific functionality may be coupled in separate cabling and connections. For example, while power may be provided through a single power cable to the cart, the support for controls, optics, fluidics, and/or navigation may be provided through one or more separate cables.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts the cart <b>2110</b> from the cart-based robotically-enabled system <b>2100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The cart <b>2110</b> generally includes an elongated support structure <b>2114</b> (often referred to as a &#x201c;column&#x201d;), a cart base <b>2115</b>, and a console <b>2116</b> at the top of the elongated support structure <b>2114</b>. The elongated support structure <b>2114</b> may include one or more carriages, such as a carriage <b>2117</b> (alternatively &#x201c;arm support&#x201d;) for supporting the deployment of one or more robotic arms <b>2112</b> (three shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The carriage <b>2117</b> may include individually configurable arm mounts that rotate along a perpendicular axis to adjust the base of the robotic arms <b>2112</b> for better positioning relative to the patient. The carriage <b>2117</b> also includes a carriage interface <b>2119</b> that allows the carriage <b>2117</b> to vertically translate along the elongated support structure <b>2114</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0067">The carriage interface <b>2119</b> is connected to the elongated support structure <b>2114</b> through slots, such as slot <b>2120</b>, that are positioned on opposite sides of the elongated support structure <b>2114</b> to guide the vertical translation of the carriage <b>2117</b>. The slot <b>2120</b> contains a vertical translation interface to position and hold the carriage at various vertical heights relative to the cart base <b>2115</b>. Vertical translation of the carriage <b>2117</b> allows the cart <b>2110</b> to adjust the reach of the robotic arms <b>2112</b> to meet a variety of table heights, patient sizes, and physician preferences. Similarly, the individually configurable arm mounts on the carriage <b>2117</b> allow the robotic arm base <b>2121</b> of robotic arms <b>2112</b> to be angled in a variety of configurations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0068">The elongated support structure <b>2114</b> may include internal mechanisms, such as gears and motors, that are designed to use a vertically aligned lead screw to translate the carriage <b>2117</b> in a mechanized fashion in response to control signals generated in response to user inputs, e.g., inputs from the console <b>2116</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0069">The robotic arms <b>2112</b> may generally include robotic arm bases <b>2121</b> and tool drivers <b>2122</b>, separated by a series of linkages <b>2123</b> that are connected by a series of joints <b>2124</b>, each joint including an independent actuator, each actuator including an independently controllable motor. Each independently controllable joint represents an independent degree of freedom available to the robotic arm. Each of the arms <b>2112</b> have seven joints, and thus provide seven degrees of freedom. A multitude of joints result in a multitude of degrees of freedom, allowing for &#x201c;redundant&#x201d; degrees of freedom. Redundant degrees of freedom allow the robotic arms <b>2112</b> to position their respective tool drivers <b>2122</b> at a specific position, orientation, and trajectory in space using different linkage positions and joint angles. This allows for the system to position and direct a robotic surgical tool from a desired point in space while allowing the clinician to move the arm joints into a clinically advantageous position away from the patient to create greater access while avoiding arm collisions.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0070">The cart base <b>2115</b> balances the weight of the elongated support structure <b>2114</b>, carriage <b>2117</b>, and arms <b>2112</b> over the floor. Accordingly, the cart base <b>2115</b> houses heavier components, such as electronics, motors, power supply, as well as components that either enable movement and/or immobilize the cart. For example, the cart base <b>2115</b> includes rollable wheel-shaped casters <b>2125</b> that allow for the cart <b>2110</b> to easily move around the room prior to a procedure. After reaching the appropriate position, the casters <b>2125</b> may be immobilized using wheel locks to hold the cart <b>2110</b> in place during the procedure.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0071">Positioned at a vertical end of elongated support structure <b>2114</b>, the console <b>2116</b> allows for both a user interface for receiving user input and a display screen (or a dual-purpose device such as, for example, a touchscreen <b>2126</b>) to provide the clinician with both pre-operative and intra-operative data. Potential pre-operative data on the touchscreen <b>2126</b> may include pre-operative plans, navigation and mapping data derived from pre-operative computerized tomography (CT) scans, and/or notes from pre-operative patient interviews. Intra-operative data on display may include optical information provided from the tool, sensor and coordinate information from sensors, as well as vital patient statistics, such as respiration, heart rate, and/or pulse. The console <b>2116</b> may be positioned and tilted to allow a clinician to access the console from the side of the elongated support structure <b>2114</b> opposite carriage <b>2117</b>. From this position, the clinician may view the console <b>2116</b>, robotic arms <b>2112</b>, and patient while operating the console <b>2116</b> from behind the cart <b>2110</b>. As shown, the console <b>2116</b> also includes a handle <b>2127</b> to assist with maneuvering and stabilizing cart <b>2110</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0072">The distal end of the system's robotic arms include the tool driver <b>2122</b> (alternatively referred to as &#x201c;instrument drive mechanism&#x201d; or &#x201c;instrument device manipulator&#x201d; (IDM)) that incorporate electro-mechanical means for actuating the robotic tool. A removable or detachable robotic tool can be releasably mounted to the tool driver <b>2122</b>. The robotic tool can be devoid of any electro-mechanical components, such as motors. This dichotomy may be driven by the need to sterilize robotic surgical tools used in medical procedures, and the inability to adequately sterilize expensive capital equipment due to their intricate mechanical assemblies and sensitive electronics. Accordingly, the robotic surgical tools may be designed to be detached, removed, and interchanged from the instrument driver (and thus the system) for individual sterilization or disposal by the clinician or the clinician's staff. In contrast, the instrument drivers need not be changed or sterilized, and may be draped for protection.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> illustrate an example tool driver paired with a robotic surgical tool. The tool drivers are positioned at the distal end <b>2222</b> of a robotic arm <b>2212</b>, which can be similar in many aspects to the robotic arms <b>2112</b>. Positioned at the distal end <b>2222</b> of the robotic arm <b>2212</b>, the tool drivers comprises one or more drive units arranged with parallel axes to provide controlled torque to a robotic surgical tool via drive shafts. Each drive unit includes an individual drive shaft for interacting with the instrument, a gear head for converting the motor shaft rotation to a desired torque, a motor for generating the drive torque, an encoder to measure the speed of the motor shaft and provide feedback to the control circuitry, and control circuity for receiving control signals and actuating the drive unit. Each drive unit being independently controlled and motorized, the tool driver may provide multiple (four as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>) independent drive outputs to the robotic surgical tool. In operation, the control circuitry can receive a control signal, transmit a motor signal to the motor, compare the resulting motor speed as measured by the encoder with the desired speed, and modulate the motor signal to generate the desired torque, for example.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0074">For procedures that require a sterile environment, the robotic system may incorporate a drive interface, such as a sterile adapter connected to a sterile drape, that sits between the tool driver and the robotic surgical tool. The chief purpose of the sterile adapter is to transfer angular motion from the drive shafts of the tool driver to the drive inputs of the instrument while maintaining physical separation, and thus sterility, between the drive shafts and drive inputs. Accordingly, an example sterile adapter may comprise of a series of rotational inputs and outputs intended to be mated with the drive shafts of the tool driver and drive inputs on the instrument. Connected to the sterile adapter, the sterile drape, comprised of a thin, flexible material such as transparent or translucent plastic, is designed to cover the capital equipment, such as the tool driver, the robotic arm, and the cart (in a cart-based system) or table (in a table-based system). Use of the drape would allow the capital equipment to be positioned proximate to the patient while still being located in an area not requiring sterilization (i.e., non-sterile field). On the other side of the sterile drape, the robotic surgical tool may interface with the patient in an area requiring sterilization (i.e., sterile field).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0075">Robotic surgical platforms like the robotic surgical system <b>2100</b> are further described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2021/0059777, titled ARTICULATING INCLUDING ANTAGONISTIC CONTROLS FOR ARTICULATION AND CALIBRATION, published Mar. 4, 2021.

The tool driver <b>2275</b> can be coupled to a distal end <b>2222</b> of the robotic arm <b>2212</b>. Like other surgical tools designed for use with a robotic system, the robotic surgical tool <b>2270</b> includes an elongated shaft <b>2271</b> (or elongate body) and a housing (or base) <b>2272</b>. The housing <b>2272</b>, can also be referred to as an &#x201c;instrument handle&#x201d; due to its intended design for manual interaction by the clinician when attaching or coupling the surgical tool <b>2270</b> to the tool driver <b>2275</b> on the robotic arm <b>2212</b>. The housing <b>2272</b> includes rotatable drive inputs <b>2273</b>, e.g., receptacles, pulleys or spools, that are designed to be mated with drive outputs <b>2274</b> that extend through a drive interface on tool driver <b>2275</b> at the distal end <b>2222</b> of the robotic arm <b>2212</b>. When physically connected, latched, and/or coupled, the mated drive inputs <b>2273</b> of housing <b>2272</b> may share axes of rotation with the drive outputs <b>2274</b> in the tool driver <b>2275</b> to allow the transfer of torque from drive outputs <b>2274</b> to drive inputs <b>2273</b>. In some instances, the drive outputs <b>2274</b> may include splines that are designed to mate with receptacles on the drive inputs <b>2273</b>. The drive outputs <b>2274</b> (and drive inputs <b>2273</b> when drivingly coupled thereto) are configured to rotate about axes parallel with a central axis <b>2276</b> defined through the tool driver <b>2275</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0077">The elongated shaft <b>2271</b> is designed to be delivered through either an anatomical opening or lumen, e.g., as in endoscopy, or a minimally invasive incision, e.g., as in laparoscopy. The elongated shaft <b>2271</b> may be either flexible (e.g., having properties similar to an endoscope) or rigid (e.g., having properties similar to a laparoscope) or contain a customized combination of both flexible and rigid portions. In an unflexed configuration, the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> extends along a longitudinal axis <b>2277</b>, which is transverse to the central axis <b>2276</b> of the tool driver <b>2275</b>. When designed for laparoscopy, the distal end of a rigid elongated shaft may be connected to an end effector extending from a jointed wrist formed from a clevis with at least one degree of freedom and a surgical tool or robotic surgical tool, such as, for example, a grasper, scissors, a stapler, or other surgical device. The end effector can be actuated based on force from the tendons as the drive inputs <b>2273</b> rotate in response to torque received from the drive outputs <b>2274</b> of the tool driver <b>2275</b>. Various highly articulatable robotic surgical tools are further described herein. When designed for endoscopy, the distal end of a flexible elongated shaft may include a steerable or controllable bending section that may be articulated and bent based on torque received from the drive outputs <b>2274</b> of the tool driver <b>2275</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0078">Torque from the tool driver <b>2275</b> is transmitted down the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> using tendons along the shaft <b>2271</b>. These individual tendons, such as pull wires, may be individually anchored to individual drive inputs <b>2273</b> within the housing <b>2272</b>. From the housing <b>2272</b>, the tendons are directed down one or more pull lumens along the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> and anchored at the distal portion of the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> or in the wrist at the distal portion of the elongated shaft <b>2271</b>. During a surgical procedure, such as a laparoscopic, endoscopic or hybrid procedure, these tendons may be coupled to a distally mounted end effector, such as a grasper or scissors, for example. Under such an arrangement, torque exerted on drive inputs <b>2273</b> would transfer tension to the tendon, thereby causing the end effector to actuate in some way. In some instances, during a surgical procedure, the tendon may cause a joint to rotate about an axis, thereby causing the end effector to move in one direction or another. Alternatively, the tendon may be connected to one or more jaws of a grasper at distal end of the elongated shaft <b>2271</b>, where tension from the tendon cause the grasper to close.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0079">In endoscopy, the tendons may be coupled to a bending or articulating section positioned along the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> (e.g., at the distal end) via adhesive, a control ring, or other mechanical fixation. When fixedly attached to the distal end of a bending section, torque exerted on drive inputs <b>2273</b> would be transmitted down the tendons, causing the softer, bending section (sometimes referred to as the articulable section or region) to bend or articulate. Along the non-bending sections, it may be advantageous to spiral or helix the individual pull lumens that direct the individual tendons along (or inside) the walls of the endoscope shaft to balance the radial forces that result from tension in the pull wires. The angle of the spiraling and/or spacing there between may be altered or engineered for specific purposes, wherein tighter spiraling exhibits lesser shaft compression under load forces, while lower amounts of spiraling results in greater shaft compression under load forces, but also exhibits limits bending. On the other end of the spectrum, the pull lumens may be directed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> to allow for controlled articulation in the desired bending or articulable sections.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0080">In endoscopy, the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> houses a number of components to assist with the robotic procedure. The shaft may include a working channel for deploying surgical tools (or robotic surgical tools), irrigation, and/or aspiration to the operative region at the distal end of the shaft <b>2271</b>. The shaft <b>2271</b> may also accommodate wires and/or optical fibers to transfer signals to/from an optical assembly at the distal tip, which may include an optical camera. The shaft <b>2271</b> may also accommodate optical fibers to carry light from proximally-located light sources, such as light emitting diodes, to the distal end of the shaft. In various instances, an RF electrode can extend through the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> and can be configured to deliver RF energy to a distal end effector of the robotic surgical tool <b>2270</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0081">At the distal end of the robotic surgical tool <b>2270</b>, the distal tip may also comprise the opening of a working channel for delivering tools for diagnostic and/or therapy, irrigation, and aspiration to an operative site. The distal tip may also include a port for a camera, such as a fiberscope or a digital camera, to capture images of an internal anatomical space. Relatedly, the distal tip may also include ports for light sources for illuminating the anatomical space when using the camera.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0082">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the drive shaft axes, and thus the drive input axes, are parallel to the central axis <b>2276</b> of the tool driver <b>2275</b> and orthogonal to the longitudinal axis <b>2277</b> of the elongated shaft. This arrangement, however, can complicate roll capabilities for the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> in certain instances. Rolling the elongated shaft <b>2271</b> along its longitudinal axis <b>2277</b> while keeping the drive inputs <b>2273</b> static may result in undesirable tangling of the tendons as they extend off the drive inputs <b>2273</b> and enter pull lumens within the elongated shaft <b>2271</b>. The resulting entanglement of such tendons may disrupt any control algorithms intended to predict movement of the flexible elongated shaft during an endoscopic procedure.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates another tool driver <b>2285</b> and a paired robotic surgical tool <b>2280</b> where the axes of the drive units are parallel to an axis defined by an elongated shaft <b>2281</b> of the surgical tool <b>2280</b>. As shown, a circular tool driver <b>2285</b> comprises four drive units with their drive outputs <b>2284</b> aligned in parallel at the end of the robotic arm <b>2212</b>. The drive units, and their respective drive outputs <b>2284</b>, are housed in a rotational assembly <b>2278</b> of the tool driver <b>2285</b> that is driven by one of the drive units within the rotational assembly <b>2278</b>. In response to torque provided by the rotational drive unit, the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> rotates along a circular bearing that connects the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> to a non-rotational portion <b>2279</b> of the tool driver <b>2285</b>. Power and controls signals may be communicated from the non-rotational portion <b>2279</b> of the tool driver <b>2285</b> to the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> through electrical contacts, which can be maintained through rotation by a brushed slip ring connection. In other aspects of the present disclosure, the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> may be responsive to a separate drive unit that is integrated into the non-rotational portion <b>2279</b>, and thus not in parallel to the other drive units. The rotational assembly <b>2278</b> allows the tool driver <b>2285</b> to rotate the drive units, and their respective drive outputs <b>2284</b>, as a single unit around a tool driver axis <b>2286</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0084">Similar to the robotic surgical tool <b>2270</b>, the robotic surgical tool <b>2280</b> includes an elongated shaft portion <b>2281</b> and a housing <b>2282</b> (shown as transparent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> for illustrative purposes) including a plurality of drive inputs <b>2283</b> (such as receptacles, pulleys, and spools) that are configured to receive the drive outputs <b>2284</b> in the tool driver <b>2285</b>.

Since the shaft <b>2281</b> is positioned at the center of the housing <b>2282</b>, the shaft <b>2281</b> is coaxial with tool driver's central axis <b>2286</b> when attached. Thus, rotation of the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> causes the shaft <b>2281</b> to rotate about its own longitudinal axis <b>2287</b>. Moreover, as the rotational assembly <b>2278</b> rotates with the shaft <b>2281</b>, any tendons connected to the drive inputs <b>2283</b> in the housing <b>2282</b> are not tangled during rotation. Accordingly, the parallelism of the axes of the drive outputs <b>2284</b>, drive inputs <b>2283</b>, and shaft <b>2281</b> allows for the shaft rotation without tangling any control tendons.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0086">In other instances, the tool drives may include a different configuration of actuated drives.

The healthy and diseased tissue samples may comprise, for instance, samples of the same portion of an organ (from different patients), irradiated vs. non-irradiated tissue, scarred vs. unscarred tissue, etc. The resulting visual effort indicator profiles, in addition to the magnitude, could indicate tissue properties.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> depict progressive operation of an example user input device <b>2702</b> used to move, articulate, and/or actuate the surgical tool <b>2400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) and/or the end effector <b>2412</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).

In some embodiments, the effort indicators may comprise a combination of audible and tactile feedback, such as a vibration and a click or sound being generated simultaneously and communicated to the operator. In yet other embodiments, the effort indicators may comprise visual feedback that can be seen (viewed) by the operator. The visual feedback may be provided to the operator in a variety of ways. In some embodiments, the effort indicators may comprise a combination of audible, tactile, and visual feedback, or any combination thereof. Various types of feedback are further described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2021/0093409, titled COMMUNICATING CLOSURE EFFORT FOR ROBOTIC SURGICAL TOOLS BACKGROUND, which published Apr. 1, 2021, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0116">In various instances, communicating the current and previous work <b>2804</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) values may prove advantageous in determining tissue characteristics and/or helping the clinician understand the type of tissue being grasped. For example, feedback related to the work can replace the loss of tactile feedback clinician's experience when using a handheld surgical grasping tool and/or surgical stapler. For example, when a surgical robot is performing the work during a clamping motion, the clinician can be unaware of the amount of effort required to clamp the tissue. However, the work or effort required of the surgical robot during the clamping motion can provide clinical insight with respect to a subsequent clamping and/or firing stroke.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0117">In certain instances, grasping work can be calculated for each piece of tissue. When the end effector is opened, relocated, repositioned, and/or reoriented to grasp a different piece of tissue, the grasping work calculation can be reset. In such instances, work calculations for different locations of tissue are separate calculations rather than a combined total across tissue locations, and the grasping work calculations can account for end effector stability and distinguish between different pieces of tissue.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0118">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a flowchart <b>3000</b> depicts work calculation logic for a robotic system and a robotic tool thereof, such as the robotic system <b>2100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and the robotic tool <b>2400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), for example.

For example, a change in rotary direction from a closing direction of the closure motor to an opening direction indicates opening of the jaws. In various instances, the angle of the closure motor is measured by a position sensor (e.g. rotary encoder <b>2510</b>) and the angle is recorded/stored in memory.

For example, the UID can be used to select a dedicated characterization grasping control on the GUI via a clutch. In certain instances, the characterization grasp(s) can be initiated from another user input control, such as a clamping actuator/pedal. For example, a brief pulse or input (in comparison to a click-and-hold input) on a clamping pedal can initiate a characterization grasping sequence in certain instances.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0172">In certain instances, a sample of tissue can have unexpected tissue properties. For example, a clinician may select a particular tool, end effector, disposable loading unit, reload, and/or staple cartridge assembly based on the appearance of the tissue in combination with the clinician's experience. Upon grasping the tissue, a clinician may obtain output (e.g. grasping work calculations) related to the tissue difficulty. In certain instances, the output may indicate that the tissue is different than expected (e.g. thinner or thicker than expected). In such instances, the clinician may decide not to implement a clamping and/or firing stroke without further inspection and/or evaluation of the tissue. Before clamping and/or firing, the clinician may massage and/or further examine the patient's tissue. Additionally or alternatively, the clinician may exchange the surgical tool, end effector, disposable loading unit, reload, and/or replaceable staple cartridge assembly to better suit the tissue properties detected during the characterization grasping motion.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0173">In certain instances, a grasping motion may only move through a portion of the grasping range as a result of torque limitations on the robotic tool. For example, the magnitude of grasping torque can be limited since high grasping torques can increase roll friction in certain instances. With limited torque, the grasping motion may stall at arbitrary angles, which can cut off the grasping work calculation. However, a clinician may still value information regarding the tissue properties, such as a tissue difficulty and/or grasping effort metric, for example, even in instances where torque limits stall the grasping motion prior to moving through the entire grasping range.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0174">In various instances, a robotic surgical system can include statistics regarding grasping work for an entire tissue range at different grasping angles. Regardless of where a grasping motion is stalled, the grasping work can be extrapolated and compared, which can provide the surgeon with an indication of tissue properties.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0175">In one instance, a lookup table can include a grasp metric (or tissue difficulty metric) for each work and angle across different tissue samples encompassing the use range of the surgical tool. An exemplary 2D lookup table <b>3700</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. To generate the 2D lookup table <b>3700</b>, multiple representative surgical tools are clamped on randomized and measured tissue of different thicknesses encompassing the use range of the surgical tool. Torque and angle over time while grasping are recorded for each test such that the grasping work can be calculated through the full grasping range. Then, statistical properties for the grasping work are calculated for discrete increments of the grasping angle through the full grasping range. For example, the maximum work, minimum work, mean work, and standard deviations are calculated over the test clamping motions. These statistical properties can be saved in a memory (e.g. memory of the robotic surgical tool).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0176">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, a flowchart for utilizing grasp metric statistics to normalize grasping work is shown. At block <b>3710</b>, the robotic surgical system can read the lookup table stored in the memory of the robotic surgical tool (e.g. lookup table <b>3700</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>). During the surgical procedure, the robotic surgical system can record the torque and angular displacement over time during the grasping motion up to the maximum grasping angle at block <b>3712</b>. Based on the detected torque and angular displacement, grasping work is calculated at block <b>3714</b>. To normalize the grasping work calculation, grasp metric statistics for the maximum grasping angle can be found in the lookup table at block <b>3716</b>. Then, the grasping work can be normalized at block <b>3718</b> based on this grasp metric statistics in the lookup table. The normalized grasping work can enable a clinician to compare grasping work independent of where grasping stalled to provide an improved indication of tissue properties to the clinician.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0177">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, a graphical representation <b>3720</b> of example work-to-grasp calculations for example angular inputs is shown. The graphical statistical data is stored in a lookup table on the robotic tool, for example. During a grasping motion, the actual work-to-grasp is calculated from angle &#x3b8;0 to angle &#x3b8;1, which corresponds to the maximum grasping angle in a particular grasping motion. For example, the grasping motion may have stalled at angle &#x3b8;0 due to resistance from the tissue. The work-to-grasp is calculated up to the angle &#x3b8;1 and amounts to a work-to-grasp value of B(&#x3b8;), which is less than the mean work-to-grasp at the angle &#x3b8;1 and between the mean less three times the standard deviation of the work-to-grasp at the angle &#x3b8;1.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0178">In certain instances, the look-up table can include the angle &#x3b8;0. Additionally, the look-up table can include the work-to-grasp value of &#x201c;B&#x201d; for the angle &#x3b8;1 in certain instances. Based on the input angle and work-to-grasp, the grasping metric can be determined from the look-up table. In other instances, statistical values for the grasping work are interpolated. For example, the value of B(&#x3b8;) can be entered into a grasping metric formula to calculate a grasping metric when the value of B(&#x3b8;) is outside the range in the lookup table (e.g. greater than C(&#x3b8;)) for the maximum grasping angle. The grasping metric can be computed based on statistical values of grasping work for the angle &#x3b8;1. The grasping metric is configured to compute an output within a predefined range (e.g. 0 to 100) regardless of where the maximum grasping angle occurred. In certain instances min-max scaling or min-max normalization can be applied to the grasping work. For example, the grasping metric formula can be:</p><p id="p-0175" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00003" num="00003"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>Grasp</mi>  <mo>&#x2062;</mo>  <mtext>   </mtext>  <mi>Metric</mi>  <mo>&#x2062;</mo>  <mrow>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mn>1</mn>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mn>0</mn>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mn>0</mn>    <mo>*</mo>    <mrow>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>B</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3b8;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>-</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>A</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3b8;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>      </mrow>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>C</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3b8;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>-</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>A</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3b8;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>      </mrow>     </mfrac>     <mo>.</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0176" num="0179">The value A(&#x3b8;) corresponds to the minimum torque in a statistically meaningful range (e.g. mean less three times the standard deviation) and the value C(&#x3b8;) corresponds to the maximum work-to-grasp in the statistically meaningful range (e.g. mean plus three times the standard deviation).

Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, a warning message can be issued to the clinician based on the grasping metric in certain instances. For example, wherein the grasping metric or normalized grasping work calculation is greater than a threshold value (e.g. greater than the maximum value of 100 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>), a warning can be issued to the clinician. If the measured grasping work at a given angle B(&#x3b8;) is greater than C(&#x3b8;), for example, the metric will exceed 100.

However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to claims containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and indefinite articles such as &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;a&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should typically be interpreted to mean &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0214">In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of &#x201c;two recitations,&#x201d; without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, or C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, or C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that typically a disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms unless context dictates otherwise. For example, the phrase &#x201c;A or B&#x201d; will be typically understood to include the possibilities of &#x201c;A&#x201d; or &#x201c;B&#x201d; or &#x201c;A and B.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0212" num="0215">With respect to the appended claims, those skilled in the art will appreciate that recited operations therein may generally be performed in any order. Also, although various operational flow diagrams are presented in a sequence(s), it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently. Examples of such alternate orderings may include overlapping, interleaved, interrupted, reordered, incremental, preparatory, supplemental, simultaneous, reverse, or other variant orderings, unless context dictates otherwise. Furthermore, terms like &#x201c;responsive to,&#x201d; &#x201c;related to,&#x201d; or other past-tense adjectives are generally not intended to exclude such variants, unless context dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0216">It is worthy to note that any reference to &#x201c;one aspect,&#x201d; &#x201c;an aspect,&#x201d; &#x201c;an exemplification,&#x201d; &#x201c;one exemplification,&#x201d; and the like means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the aspect is included in at least one aspect. Thus, appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in one aspect,&#x201d; &#x201c;in an aspect,&#x201d; &#x201c;in an exemplification,&#x201d; and &#x201c;in one exemplification&#x201d; in various places throughout the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same aspect. Furthermore, the particular features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more aspects.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0217">Any patent application, patent, non-patent publication, or other disclosure material referred to in this specification and/or listed in any Application Data Sheet is incorporated by reference herein, to the extent that the incorporated materials is not inconsistent herewith.
