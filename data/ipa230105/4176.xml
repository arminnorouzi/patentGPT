Many traditional climate control systems, such as variable air volume (&#x201c;VAV&#x201d;) systems and constant air volume (&#x201c;CAV&#x201d;) systems, are now becoming cost-prohibitive due to high electricity usage associated with moving air and the rising costs of electricity. The costs associated with installing and maintaining climate control systems are also very high, as multi-person crews are often necessary to custom-fit wiring, ducting, piping, and other overhead in a given structure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many aspects of the present technology can be better understood with reference to the following drawings.

architects, and/or building owners elect to avoid the use of traditional drop ceilings, often in favor of maintaining visibility of the structural components of the enclosure ceiling. Forgoing use of drop ceilings can lead to several challenges. These challenges include sound propagation and the need to provide sufficient lighting, climate control structure, and supporting hardware while avoiding prominence of unsightly wiring and ducting in the enclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Specific details of several embodiments of acoustic appliance hubs for use in enclosures, as well as associated systems and methods, are described below. As used herein, an &#x201c;enclosure&#x201d; can be a room or other enclosed or partially enclosed space, including spaces having full ceilings, partial ceilings, no ceilings, complete wall perimeters, partial-perimeter walls (e.g., one of more open sides), and/or other indoor or partially indoor spaces. The appliance hubs, sometimes referred to as panels, clouds, acoustic panels, or acoustic clouds, can be positioned in the upper portions of enclosures. The appliance hubs can be installed such that they do not create plenum within the enclosure. In some embodiments, the space between the appliance hubs and each other/the ceiling can allow for additional light (e.g., sunlight) to fill a space than would be the case if the appliance hubs formed a plenum. In some applications, the appliance hubs can be mounted along or near a wall of an enclosure. The enclosures can include, but are not limited to, classrooms, offices, concert halls, foyers, cafeterias, restaurants, residential rooms, warehouses, etc. The appliance hubs can be installed in original construction projects, or retrofitted to existing structure or enclosure. The appliance or appliance hub can include a sound-absorbing substrate. Other components can be mounted onto or into the substrate. For example, the appliances can include a climate control apparatus configured to regulate a temperature within the enclosure, one or more lighting elements configured to provide light within the enclosure, a fire suppression apparatus configured to suppress flames within the enclosure, a plurality of fluid lines configured to provide fluid service and return to one or both of the fire suppression apparatus and the climate control apparatus, and/or a plurality of electrical connections connected to the sound-absorbing substrate and configured to provide electrical power and/or data to at least one of the climate control apparatus, the fire suppression apparatus, and the one or more lighting elements. As used herein, &#x201c;fluid&#x201d; refers to one or both of a liquid (e.g., water, refrigerant, etc.) and a gas (air, conditioned air, etc.). Preferably, the appliances include one or more of a sound level sensor, a motion sensor (e.g., an infrared sensor), a camera, a microphone, an air quality monitor, a carbon dioxide sensor, a carbon monoxide sensor, a smoke detector, a light level sensor, a heat sensor, a room temperature sensor, a dew point sensor, and a humidity sensor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> provides a schematic illustration of an embodiment of an appliance or appliance hub <b>10</b>. As illustrated, the appliance hub <b>10</b> can include a substrate <b>14</b>. The substrate <b>14</b> can be configured to absorb sound, reflect light, contribute to an aesthetic theme of the enclosure in which the appliance hub is installed, and/or provide other desired functions. In some embodiments, sound-absorbing material can be attached/detached from the substrate <b>14</b> via hook-and-loop fasteners, magnets, flanges, and/or other attachment mechanisms. Detachability of the sound-absorbing material can allow for reuse of the sound-absorbing material when new and/or replacement appliance hubs are installed. Detachability of the sound-absorbing material can also allow for quick and easy modification to the look of the appliance hub <b>10</b>. For example, different-colored, textured, and/or shaped sound-absorbing material portions can be swapped out for each other to provide a desired look for the appliance hub <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the sound-absorbing material is connected to the substrate <b>14</b> such that a gap remains between the sound-absorbing material and a bottom surface of the substrate <b>14</b>. Maintaining a gap between the sound-absorbing material and the substrate <b>14</b> for at least a portion of the sound-absorbing material can enhance the noise reduction provided by the sound-absorbing material. Specifically, sound waves can deflect between the sound-absorbing material and the substrate <b>14</b>, thereby increasing the sound-absorption effected by the sound-absorbing material. The substrate <b>14</b> can have a top surface facing the upper structure or bottom of the deck of the enclosure, and the bottom surface facing the floor of the enclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When observed from below, the substrate <b>14</b> can have a generally rounded shape (e.g., circular or oval shape), a polygonal shape, an irregular shape (e.g., a cloud shape, an asymmetric shape, etc.), and/or some combination thereof. The substrate <b>14</b> can include rigid structures configured to maintain the shape of the substrate <b>14</b>. In some applications, the substrate <b>14</b> is at least partially covered by a non-rigid, roughened, irregular, soft, and/or some other type of material. Sound-absorbing materials (e.g., open cell foams, sponges, porous materials, resonant absorber material, polyester, and/or other materials) may be used to cover or form the outer surface of all or a portion of the substrate <b>14</b>. The materials (e.g., sound-absorbing materials) used to cover the substrate <b>14</b> can be fire-resistant (e.g., UL and/or ETL compliant). In some embodiments, the materials are produced from recycled products. In some applications, other components of the appliance hub are fire-resistant and/or UL/ETL compliant (e.g., chilled beam(s), light fixture(s), controls, power supplies, etc.).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the substrate <b>14</b> has a maximum width, as measured parallel to the floor of the enclosure in which the appliance hub <b>10</b> is installed (or parallel to a wall on which the appliance hub <b>10</b> is installed in some embodiments), of less than 5 feet, less than 6 feet, less than 8 feet, less than 12 feet, and/or less than 18 feet. In some embodiments, the maximum width of the substrate <b>14</b>, as measured parallel to the floor of the enclosure in which the appliance hub <b>10</b> is installed is greater than 2 feet, greater than 3 feet, greater than 6 feet, greater than 10 feet, and/or greater than 18 feet. The substrates <b>14</b> can be manufactured in various sizes, shapes, materials, and configurations to allow for convenient fit of the substrates <b>14</b> into various installation sites.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The substrate <b>14</b>, or some portion thereof, may be releasably mounted at an installation site. For example, the substrate <b>14</b> can include mounting features configured to mount to preexisting structures (e.g., beams, framing, etc.) and/or to pre-mounted adaptors in the enclosure. The substrate <b>14</b> can be mounted to various positions within the enclosure, including at or near the ceiling or walls of the enclosure. In some applications, raceways (e.g., tracks) can be installed in a given enclosure to allow for mounting of the substrates <b>14</b>. The raceways may extend vertically and/or horizontally. In some embodiments, the raceways provide defined path(s) for movement of the substrates <b>14</b> along the raceways without detaching the substrates <b>14</b> from the raceways. For example, the raceways can include one or more flanges or channels configured to interface with mounting channels or flanges on the appliance hub <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">One or more components can be mounted onto and/or into the substrate <b>14</b>. Arrangement and inclusion/exclusion of components on the substrate <b>14</b> can be customized for the desired installation (e.g., classrooms v. offices (private or open) v. conference rooms, etc.). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the appliance hub <b>10</b> can include one or more lighting elements <b>18</b>. The lighting elements <b>18</b> can be, for example, light-emitting diodes (&#x201c;LEDs&#x201d;), incandescent sockets and bulbs, halogen sockets and bulbs, fluorescent sockets and bulbs, smart bulbs, and/or some other type of lighting element. In some embodiments, the lighting elements <b>18</b> are retractable (e.g., can hang downward as pendant lights and be retracted back to the substrate <b>14</b>). Preferably, the lighting elements <b>18</b> are low-voltage (e.g., 24V, 48V, 120V, or 220V). The lighting elements <b>18</b> can be configured to dim or brighten in response to control signals. The substrate <b>14</b> can include a local light control module <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the light control module <b>22</b> is positioned somewhere separate from the substrate <b>14</b>. The light control module <b>22</b> can be configured to control the operation of the lighting elements <b>18</b>. For example, the light control module <b>22</b> can control ON/OFF, dimming, strobing, and/or other lighting behavior. The light control module <b>22</b> can be configured to operate automatically. For example, ON/OFF schedules, desired enclosure brightness levels, red-green-blue (RGB) characteristics, and/or other target light characteristics can be programmed into the light control module <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the light control modules <b>22</b> are configured to operate the lighting elements <b>18</b> in a circadian rhythm pattern wherein the hue, intensity, brightness, and/or color of the light emitted from the lighting elements <b>18</b> varies over the course of a day (e.g., warmer in the morning and cooler as the day progresses). In some configurations, two or more of the lighting elements <b>18</b> can be configured to emit different colors of light. In some such embodiments, the light control module <b>22</b> can be configured to control the operation of the lighting elements <b>18</b> to control the net color output from the appliance hub <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the light control module <b>22</b> is connected to one or more of a lighting power line <b>23</b> (e.g., a low voltage power line) and/or a general tenant power line <b>24</b> connected to an outside power source. In some embodiments, one or more batteries are positioned on or in the substrate <b>14</b> to power various components (e.g., lighting elements, controllers, etc.). In some embodiments, the batteries operate primarily or solely as backup power in the case of a power outage. Preferably, most or all of the components of the appliance hubs <b>10</b> are reusable and/or recyclable. Use of reusable/recyclable components can reduce waste production.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The appliance hub <b>10</b> can include a climate control apparatus <b>26</b> mounted onto and/or into the substrate. The climate control apparatus <b>26</b> can be, for example, a chilled beam. Other possible climate control apparatuses can include fans, radiant heat pipes, cold water pipes, hydronic temperature control apparatuses, air-driven climate control apparatuses (e.g., vents or other air inlet/outlet structures), and/or other climate control apparatuses or combinations of apparatuses. In the illustrated example, one or more water or other liquid conduits <b>30</b> can be fluidly connected to the climate control apparatus <b>26</b>. The conduits (e.g., pipes, hoses, channels, or other pathways) <b>30</b> can include at least one of a chilled water return, a chilled water supply, a hot water return, a hot water supply, a refrigerant return, and/or a refrigerant supply. One or multi-way valves <b>34</b> can be positioned in all or a subset of the fluid lines between the conduits <b>30</b> and the climate control apparatus <b>26</b>. The climate control apparatus <b>26</b> and/or valves <b>34</b> can be controlled remotely via wireless signals. In some embodiments, a building control network controls one or more of the components of the applicant hub <b>10</b>, either wirelessly or via a wired connection. In some embodiments, the climate control apparatus <b>26</b> and/or valves <b>34</b> are driven by a controller via a wired connection. The valves <b>34</b> can be driven by an analog control (e.g., a control capable of infinite and/or incremental variability) to precisely control fluid flow through the fluid pathways between the climate control apparatus <b>26</b> and the conduits <b>30</b>. In some embodiments, the substrate <b>14</b> includes a plurality of climate control apparatuses <b>26</b>. In some embodiments, dedicated outdoor air system ducting <b>38</b> can be connected to the one or more climate control apparatuses <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the appliance hub <b>10</b> includes one or more fire suppression apparatuses <b>42</b>. The fire suppression apparatuses <b>42</b> can be, for example, water sprinklers, foam (e.g., aqueous film-forming foam, film-forming fluoroprotein, compressed air foam, and/or some combination thereof) emitters, powder (e.g., sodium bicarbonate, monoammonium phosphate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, and/or some combination thereof) emitters. In the illustrated embodiment, the fire suppression apparatuses <b>42</b> are connected to fluid line <b>46</b>. The fluid line <b>46</b> can be, for example, a fire branch line or other water line. In some embodiments, one or more valves <b>50</b> can be positioned in the fluid pathways between the fluid line <b>46</b> and the fire suppression apparatuses <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As illustrated, the substrate <b>14</b> can include pre-formed mounts for various optional add-on components. For example, a projector mount <b>54</b> can be formed on an upper or lower surface of the substrate <b>14</b>. Other mounts (e.g., decorative cover mounts, additional lighting mounts, speaker mounts, and/or other mounts) can be positioned on various surfaces of the substrate <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the substrate <b>14</b> includes internal data and/or electrical power conduits connected to one or more of the pre-formed mounts to provide power and/or control to the add-on equipment.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The appliance hub <b>10</b> can be configured such that all of the necessary piping, ducting, and/or wiring (collectively &#x201c;connection structures&#x201d;) for the various components of the appliance hub <b>10</b> are pre-engineered and connected to the various components on the substrate <b>14</b>. In some configurations, a single connection interface can provide connection between the various connection structures of the appliance hub <b>10</b> with the corresponding connection structures in the core of the building in which the appliance hub <b>10</b> is installed. Pre-engineering or pre-assembling the connection structures on the substrate <b>14</b> can allow for &#x201c;plug and play&#x201d; connection between the appliance hub <b>10</b> and the building, greatly reducing the installation and maintenance costs as compared with a system in which each individual connection structure must be arranged and connected to each subsystem on site. In some applications, the appliance hubs <b>10</b> have a second interface configured to facilitate connection between connection structures of one appliance hub <b>10</b> with another appliance hub <b>10</b>, thereby reducing or eliminating the need to connect each separate appliance hub <b>10</b> to the core of the building. In some embodiments, substrate <b>14</b> is seismically anchored, thereby eliminating the need to separately anchor each of the components and subsystems installed on the substrate <b>14</b>. The appliance hubs described herein can be configured to operate agnostic of preexisting building control systems, allowing easy and fast deployment and integration of the appliance hubs.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the cross-sectional profile of the substrate <b>14</b> can take many shapes. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, all or a portion of the substrate <b>14</b> can be substantially flat. In some embodiments, the substrate <b>14</b>, or some portion thereof, may have a wavy or curved shape, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the substrate <b>14</b> may include one or more bends, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The appliance hubs <b>10</b> can include a plurality of sensors, monitors, and/or other devices configured to evaluate various attributes of the enclosure in which the appliance hub <b>10</b> is installed. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the appliance hub <b>10</b> can include one or more of a lighting sensor <b>58</b>, occupancy sensor <b>62</b>, sound level sensor <b>66</b> (e.g., a sensor attuned to sound level and/or to specific sounds such as gunshots or explosions), smoke/heat detector <b>70</b>, indoor air quality (&#x201c;IAQ&#x201d;) sensor <b>74</b>, air flow sensor <b>78</b>, room temperature sensor <b>82</b>, a hot/chilled water flow sensor <b>86</b>, and/or some other sensor or monitor (collectively, &#x201c;sensors&#x201d;). The functionality of any two or more of the sensors may be combined into a single physical sensor. All or some of the sensors can be mounted on or in the substrate <b>14</b> of the appliance hub <b>10</b>. Preferably, one or more or all of the sensors are low voltage (e.g., 24V, 48V, 120V, or 220V).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some applications, the IAQ sensor <b>74</b> can be configured to monitor various air quality indicators. These indicators can include carbon monoxide levels, carbon dioxide levels, volatile organic compound levels, radon levels, and/or some other air quality indicators. In some setups, data from the IAQ sensor <b>74</b> can act as a proxy for other characteristics of the enclosure. For example, carbon dioxide levels can be used to indicate approximate occupancy levels in the enclosure. Similarly, data from the room temperature sensor <b>82</b> can be used to indicate occupancy (e.g., the warmer the room, the more bodies within the room).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the appliance hub <b>10</b> can be configured to be disassembled into multiple portions, and reassembled on-site. For example, the substrate <b>14</b> may be constructed in multiple portions, each of which is configured to releasably mate with one or more other portions of the substrate <b>14</b>. In some applications, all or most of the sensors and components of the appliance hub <b>10</b> are positioned/installed on a single portion of the substrate <b>14</b> (e.g., a central portion or a portion designed to be closest to the core of the installation site) and the remaining portions of the substrate <b>14</b> do not include sensors or other components. Configuring the hub <b>10</b> to be disassembled and reassembled can allow for installation of larger hub <b>10</b> than may otherwise fit in elevators, doorways, windows, or other installation pathways in a given installation site. Disassembling the hub <b>10</b> can also allow for easier and/or cheaper shipping of the hub <b>10</b> to the installation site. In some embodiments, utilizing disassemble/reassemble designs for the hub <b>10</b> can allow for uniform manufacturing of a single substrate <b>14</b> design for installation of the components and/or sensors, while the remaining portions of the substrate <b>14</b> can be customizable to the space and preferences at a given installation site.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The appliance hub <b>10</b> may include one or more data hubs <b>90</b>. The data hubs <b>90</b> can be configured to communicate (e.g., bilaterally) with one or more of the sensors, lighting elements <b>18</b>, fire suppression apparatuses <b>42</b>, climate control apparatus(es) <b>26</b>, and/or other components of the appliance hub <b>10</b> (collectively, &#x201c;components&#x201d;). In some embodiments, one or more of the components includes a dedicated wireless data transmitter. In some embodiments, each of the components is connected to the data hub(s) <b>90</b> via a wired connection. The components and sensors of the appliance hub <b>10</b> can be tracked (e.g., physical location, operating status, power status, warranty information, service history, maintenance schedule, etc.) via Bluetooth&#xae; beacons, IP device tracking, RFID and/or other tracking protocols. In some embodiments, this tracking can be facilitated via one or more of the data hubs <b>90</b>. In some embodiments, the tracking and other associated information is monitorable via a mobile application. The ability to track the locations and components of specific appliance hubs <b>10</b> can allow for easy exchange of one appliance hub <b>10</b> for another. For example, if a building owner, tenant, or other individual wishes to trade their appliance hub <b>10</b> for the appliance hub <b>10</b> of another individual (e.g., for aesthetic and/or functional reasons), the tracking of the appliance hub locations can allow for automatic accounting of the locations of the appliance hubs before and after moving. Tracking the locations of the individual appliance hubs <b>10</b> can also allow for simplified retrofitting of existing structures. More specifically, because the characteristics of appliance hubs <b>10</b> can be monitored and associated with specific locations within a structure, the control algorithms and other control systems can be easily customized for wholistic management of the appliance hubs <b>10</b> within a given structure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>M</figref> illustrate an embodiment of an appliance hub <b>200</b> having many similar features to the appliance hub <b>10</b> described above. For example, the appliance hub <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>M</figref> can include one or more of the modules or the components of the appliance hubs <b>10</b> described above. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the appliance hub <b>200</b> can include a substrate <b>204</b>. The substrate <b>204</b> can be constructed in one or more layers. One or more modules can be mounted onto and/or into the substrate <b>204</b>. The substrate <b>204</b> can be connected to a ceiling or other support structure via hangers <b>206</b> or other structural attachments.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The appliance hub <b>200</b> can include one or more lighting modules <b>208</b> and/or one or more climate modules <b>212</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the appliance hub <b>200</b> includes lighting modules <b>208</b> positioned at or near the perimeter of the substrate <b>204</b>. In some embodiments, the lighting modules <b>208</b> are positioned at or near the center of the substrate <b>204</b> or at positions between the center and the perimeter of the substrate <b>204</b>. The lighting modules <b>208</b> can include, for example, fluorescent lights, LED lights, incandescent lights, and/or some other combination of light sources. The lighting modules <b>208</b> can be constructed as replaceable (e.g., modular) units. For example, a lighting module <b>208</b> having LED lights may be exchangeable for module having fluorescent lights without modifying the structure of the substrate <b>204</b> or other portions of the appliance hub <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The one or more climate modules <b>212</b> can be distributed on the substrate <b>204</b> at various positions. For example, in the illustrated embodiment the climate module <b>212</b> is positioned at or near the center of the substrate <b>204</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the lighting modules <b>208</b> and/or the climate modules <b>212</b> can be connected to the substrate <b>204</b> via one or more brackets <b>214</b>, <b>215</b> or other attachment structures. In some embodiments, the substrate <b>204</b> includes one or more indentations, cavities, cutouts <b>216</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>I</figref>), and/or other features configured to accommodate the lighting and/or climate modules <b>208</b>, <b>212</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>G</figref>, the brackets <b>214</b> used to mountain the lighting modules <b>208</b> can have a height with respect to the substrate <b>204</b> that is greater than the lighting modules <b>208</b>. This can facilitate adjustment of the vertical position of the lighting modules <b>208</b> with respect to the substrate <b>204</b>. For example, the brackets <b>214</b> can be connected to the lighting modules <b>208</b> via a bolt <b>220</b> and an adjustable nut <b>222</b> configured to allow for vertical adjustment of the lighting module <b>208</b>. This adjustment can allow the installer to, for example, align the lighting modules <b>208</b> with a bottom surface of the substrate <b>204</b> and/or the bottom surface of materials (e.g., acoustic and/or aesthetic materials) connected to the substrate <b>204</b>. For example, vertical adjustment of the lighting modules <b>208</b> and/or of other components can also facilitate alignment of the components with acoustic materials or other materials attached to the substrate and having varying thicknesses. In some embodiments, vertical positioning of the lighting modules <b>208</b> can affect the aesthetic quality of the appliance hub <b>200</b> in various ways that may be desired in particular installations.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the climate module <b>212</b> includes one or more of a chilled beam, an HVAC duct, a heated beam, and/or some other climate control device. As illustrated, the appliance hub <b>200</b> can include a valve system <b>224</b>. The valve system <b>224</b> can include one or more valves configured to selectively control flow of fluid and/or gas to the climate module <b>212</b>. For example, the valve system <b>224</b> can include a first valve <b>226</b><i>a </i>configured to control flow of hot water to the climate module <b>212</b> and a second valve <b>226</b><i>b </i>configured to control flow of cold water to the climate module <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, the first valve <b>226</b><i>a </i>is an inlet valve configured to control flow of fluid (e.g., hot or cold fluid) into the climate module <b>212</b> in the second valve <b>226</b><i>b </i>is an outlet valve configured to control flow of fluid out from the climate module <b>212</b>, or vice versa. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>G</figref>, the climate module <b>212</b> includes one or more pipes <b>228</b> connected to the one or more valves <b>226</b><i>a</i>, <b>226</b><i>b</i>.

The process can include the step S<b>2</b> of associating the location data (e.g., address, building, floor, and/or room data) of the sensors or other inputs with the input data provided to the network of distributed servers <b>106</b>. The network of distributed servers <b>106</b> can be configured, as reflected in step S<b>3</b>, to calculate various characteristics of the enclosure and/or building from the input data. These calculated characteristics can include occupancy, temperature distribution, air quality, overall comfort, and/or other characteristics. Based on the data from the sensors/inputs and/or the calculated characteristics of the enclosures, the network of distributed servers <b>106</b> can send control signals (S<b>5</b>) to the various components of the appliance hubs <b>10</b> to adjust the characteristics of the enclosure to desired values. These desired values (e.g., desired temperature, desired air quality, desired humidity, desired lighting levels, etc.) can be pre-established by a user of the system via a user interface (e.g., a mobile application, a voice command interface, PC, SMS text, or some other user interface). In some embodiments, the desired values can be informed by data from utility readings, occupant input (e.g., electronic calendars, recorded class or office schedules, badge-scanning in the building and/or at a parking structure, etc.). In some embodiments, a mobile application may be used to control one or more features of the appliance hubs <b>10</b> (e.g., either directly or via the network of distributed servers <b>106</b>). The mobile application can be secured (e.g., via custom voice activation, encryption, password protection, biometric identification, and/or other security measures) to reduce the risk that control of the one or more appliance hubs <b>10</b> is unintentionally exposed to an unwanted user. In some embodiments, the control signals used to control the components (e.g., sensors, lighting elements, etc.) of the appliance hub(s) are generated automatically (e.g., without manual input) based on preset parameters (e.g., desired temperature, energy usage, etc.).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">After the control signals are sent, steps S<b>1</b>-S<b>4</b> of the process can be repeated (S<b>6</b>). The network of distributed servers <b>106</b> can be configured to diagnose malfunctions of or other undesirable outcomes generated by one or more components of one or more appliance hubs <b>10</b> based upon discrepancies between the desired values and the measured characteristics determined in the second iteration of step S<b>4</b> (S<b>7</b>). For example, a higher temperature reading in the second iteration of step S<b>4</b> may indicate a faulty climate control apparatus. This same discrepancy may, on the other hand, indicate that a door or window is opened. Upon detection of a discrepancy between the desired value and the measured characteristic, an alert may be sent to a designated user to evaluate whether one or more components of the appliance hubs <b>10</b> are faulty. This automated diagnosis regime can help users of the appliance hubs <b>10</b> and related networks <b>100</b> save significant maintenance costs. In some embodiments, the appliance hubs <b>10</b>, networks <b>100</b>, and/or cloud networks <b>106</b> can employ machine learning based on the sensor data, user input, and/or other parameters to improve overall efficiency or other operability parameters of appliance hubs <b>10</b>. For example, machine learning can be used to evaluate relationships between operation of components of appliance hubs <b>10</b> and associated sensor measurements to reduce variance between intended outcomes (e.g., temperatures, lighting levels, air quality) and actual outcomes associated with operation of the appliance hubs <b>10</b> and associated components. Machine learning can also be used to monitor the habits of the inhabitants of the enclosures in which the appliance hubs <b>10</b> are installed. For example, the appliance hubs can be configured to monitor energy usage, personnel movement patterns, and other information which can then be conveyed to a user (e.g., a technician or other user) to suggest changes in automatic protocols (e.g., suggestions to shut off lights and/or climate control at earlier times, etc.).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Utilizing a network of appliance hubs <b>10</b> that are uniquely identified by location can allow for overall efficiency gains with respect to energy use, temperature optimization, maintenance management, and/or other parameters.

Carbon production information can be used to facilitate carbon tax allocation and/or to allow for easier diagnosis of increased carbon emissions. The appliance hubs <b>10</b>, via the network <b>100</b> components, can be coordinated together to provide a holistic energy plan for a given building, room, city, or other scale.

Consistent naming/identifying of appliance hubs and components thereof can also improve machine learning associated with data detection and recordation from the appliance hubs and components thereof by improving the accuracy of assessments that can be made during analysis of the collected data (e.g., reliable attribution of location and type features of the data&#x2014;such as temperature data from a specific room or location within a room).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It may be desirable for manufacturing, marketing, inventory, and other purposes to have preset appliance hub &#x201c;models,&#x201d; wherein each model has a preset combination of components.
