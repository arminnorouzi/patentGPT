The compounds used in the making of the adhesive layers of Examples 1 to 6 are listed in Table 2. In display devices of Comparative Examples and Examples, the type of the adhesive layer, the components of the adhesive layer, and whether a method for removing an adhesion force is applied are varied, and thus the degree of display surface deformation (crease) and folding reliability according to the folding of the display device are indicated. The folding reliability was evaluated by repeatedly folding and unfolding display devices including the adhesive layer 200,000 times. In Table 1, if the evaluation result of the folding reliability is &#x201c;OK&#x201d;, the folding reliability of the display device is maintained when the folding and unfolding are repeated, and in the case of &#x201c;NG&#x201d;, the display device is broken or the display panel is damaged when the folding and unfolding are repeated. The degree of display surface deformation of the display device is obtained by measuring the maximum value of the stepped part on the surface of the display panel using a laser microscope (VK-X, Keyence Co., Ltd.).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0"
