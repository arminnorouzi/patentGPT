They are typically used either to provide primary illumination for a room or area, or to backlight signs and displays.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">LGPs are a type of light guide, a cousin of fiber optics&#x2014;in an LGP, light is emitted into the edge of a panel. The panel is usually made of a transparent plastic like polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or polycarbonate that has a higher refractive index than air. By total internal reflection, the LGP contains much of the light, directs it, and diffuses it. In most modern LGPs, small surface defects are introduced into one surface of the LGP in order to reduce total internal reflection and release well-diffused light over the entire visible surface of the LGP.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Basic light guide technology has been available for many decades. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,443,561, issued in the late 1940s, describes a crib light that uses a light guide panel&#x2014;in this case, an incandescent lamp emits light into the edge of a plastic panel. which is bent in a U-shape and hung over the sidewall of a crib such that the occupant of the crib is protected from the electrical elements and lamp. While innovative, products like this relied on bulky, hot incandescent lamps as light sources.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent decades, lighting based on light emitting diodes (LEDs) has become dominant in both residential and commercial settings. The rise of LED lighting has brought with it a resurgence in light guide technology and a number of sophisticated, LED-based LGPs. In contrast to its incandescent and fluorescent forebears, LED lighting is smaller, lighter, and generates less heat&#x2014;particularly suitable for LGP applications, in which the objective is to emit light directly into the thin edge of a plastic or glass panel.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a modern LGP, a sheet of light-guide material, such as PMMA or polycarbonate, is surrounded by a frame. At least one side of the frame contains a strip of linear lighting&#x2014;a flexible or rigid printed circuit board (PCB) that contains LED light engines spaced at a regular pitch or spacing. The strip of linear lighting is oriented so that the LED light engines emit light into the side edge of the sheet of light guide material. Many LGPs have linear lighting along two sides, for more even light, and some may have strips of linear lighting along all four sides. The sheet of light-guide material is backed by a reflective layer, which may be a white sheet or a metallic/reflector sheet. In many cases, the front of the sheet of light guide material has an etched-in or burned-in pattern that helps to release light uniformly from the front of the panel. The pattern may be produced by, e.g., shallowly laser-etching the light-guide material.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each modern LGP typically has a power cable that penetrates the frame to connect to the linear lighting. Most LGPs operate at low voltage using direct current (DC) power. While the definition of &#x201c;low voltage&#x201d; varies according to the source one consults, for purposes of this description, voltages under 50V will be considered to be low voltage. The use of low voltage carries with it fewer safety risks.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the invention relates to a light-emitting panel. The light-emitting panel may be a light-guide panel (LGP) that includes a light guide, a light source arranged to emit light into the light guide, and a frame arrayed around the light guide and light source. The frame has one or more magnets associated with it, typically arrayed along at least one edge. The magnets provide both mechanical and electrical connection points, such that a second LGP of the same type brought adjacent to the first LGP will be both mechanically and electrically connected to the first LGP, such that the first and second LGPs can share power.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the following description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention will be described with respect to the following drawing figures, in which like numerals represent like features throughout the description, and in which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view of a light-guide panel (LGP) according to one embodiment of the invention, illustrating the reverse (i.e., non-emitting) side of the LGP;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of three LGPs assembled into a three-dimensional structure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front elevational view of a system of four LGPs connected together in a series, illustrating power being brought into the system at two different points;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an LGP frame, illustrating an alternative, internal structure for making an electrical connection with a magnet mounted on the exterior of the frame;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an LGP frame with a grouped set of contacts for making connections between a power cable with multiple conductors and a number of individual magnets arrayed along the side of the frame;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an illustration of another LGP frame that uses a terminal block to make connections between a power cable with multiple conductors and a number of individual magnets arrayed along the side of the frame; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a partial top plan cross-section of an LGP according to another embodiment, showing magnets inlaid in notches in the light guide.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view of the reverse side a light-guide panel (LGP), generally indicated at <b>10</b>, according to one embodiment of the invention. The LGP <b>10</b> includes a frame <b>12</b>, a light guide <b>14</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and a reflective layer <b>16</b>, which backs the light guide <b>14</b> and obscures it in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The light guide <b>14</b> is typically a sheet of plastic, such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or polycarbonate, but other plastics may be used. Additionally, glass may be used in some embodiments, as may more exotic materials like sapphire. The only typical requirement of a light guide <b>14</b> is that it have a higher index of refraction than its surrounding environment. For example, if the LGP <b>10</b> is to be used in air, the light guide <b>14</b> should have an index of refraction higher than that of air. A typical light guide <b>14</b> intended for use in air has a refractive index of at least about 1.4, although materials with higher indices of refraction may be used.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The LGP <b>10</b> may be assumed to have at least one strip of linear lighting, mounted within the frame <b>12</b>, that emits light into the edge of the light guide <b>14</b>. However, in various embodiments, all sides of the frame <b>12</b> may have such strips of linear lighting. The number of strips of linear lighting that are used, and their positioning, may be determined by a number of factors, including the size of the LGP <b>10</b>, the luminous flux required of the LGP <b>10</b>, and the degree of evenness of light emission that is required across the surface of the LGP <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, it may be assumed that there are two strips of linear lighting, positioned along the left and right sides of the frame <b>12</b>, although more or fewer may be used. The number of strips of linear lighting that is used is not critical to the invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As described above, the front surface of the light guide <b>14</b> may have a texture or pattern to facilitate light release. This pattern may be formed, e.g., by laser etching.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The LGP <b>10</b> of this embodiment is square, although the LGP <b>10</b> may have any shape, including other polygonal shapes and curved shapes. Rectangular shapes are the most common for LGPs <b>10</b>, and if a rectangular shape is used, it may have any height-to-width aspect ratio desired. Other polygonal shapes might include, e.g., triangles, circles, and hexagons.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The frame <b>12</b> of the LGP <b>10</b> is mitered in the corners. As can be seen in the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the frame <b>12</b> forms a thin rim <b>18</b> around the front of the light guide <b>14</b>, but covers a significant portion of the rear of the LGP <b>10</b>. The primary purpose of the frame <b>12</b> is to mount the linear lighting in place and to make a light-tight seal around the light guide <b>14</b>. Any shape or extent for the frame <b>12</b> that accomplishes those goals may be used. The frame <b>12</b> may also mount and protect, or at least partially protect, any reflective layer(s) <b>16</b> placed behind the light guide <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the illustrated embodiment, the LGP <b>10</b> and its light guide <b>14</b> are generally flat, although there is no requirement that they be so in all embodiments. LGPs and light guides according to embodiments of the invention may be curved in multiple planes.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">LGP <b>10</b> differs from conventional LGPs in the manner in its handling of power, and in the way in which it is adapted to connect to other LGPs. As shown, LGP <b>10</b> has four magnets <b>20</b> positioned immediately proximate to its side edges <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The magnets <b>20</b> may be flush with their respective edges <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, or they may be set back from the edges a short distance, e.g. 1-5 mm. The magnets <b>20</b> may be adhered to the frame <b>12</b> solely by way of magnetic attractive force, or they may be secured to the frame <b>12</b> by any suitable means, including fasteners and adhesives. The magnets <b>20</b> are adapted to serve as both mechanical connectors (i.e., by way of magnetic attractive force) to connect the LGP <b>10</b> to other LGPs and as terminals to receive and convey power.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The magnets <b>20</b> themselves may be any type of permanent magnet, including aluminum-nickel-cobalt, strontium-iron, neodymium-iron-boron, samarium-cobalt, or the like. If the magnet <b>20</b> itself is not electrically conductive, it may be coated with any conductive material, including nickel, zinc, and multi-layer conductive coatings with other metals and materials, including Ni&#x2014;Cu&#x2014;Ni and Ni&#x2014;Cu&#x2014;Au, to name a few. In one embodiment, the magnets may be nickel or multi-layer nickel-plated neodymium magnets.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, two magnets <b>20</b> are on each side <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the frame <b>12</b> of the LGP <b>10</b>, spaced from one another about evenly along the length of the side <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The two magnets <b>20</b> on a single side <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are electrically isolated from one another. In this embodiment, the two magnets <b>20</b> that are directly across from one another are electrically coupled to one another, as will be explained below in more detail.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">On the left side <b>22</b> of the LGP <b>10</b>, a power cable <b>26</b> is shown. In this embodiment, the power cable <b>26</b> has two conductors, a positive conductor <b>28</b> and a negative or minus-return conductor <b>30</b>. The positive conductor <b>28</b> is connected to one magnet <b>20</b>, in this case, the upper magnet <b>20</b>, and the minus-return conductor <b>30</b> is connected to the other magnet <b>20</b>, in this case, the lower magnet <b>20</b>. The connections between the conductors <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and their respective magnets <b>20</b> may be made by soldering, by adhesive (e.g., conductive adhesive) or by other mechanisms, as will be described below in more detail.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In each case, a second wire <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> is electrically connected at one end to a magnet <b>20</b>. The second wires <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> transit through openings <b>36</b> in the frame <b>12</b> to connect to linear lighting within the frame <b>12</b>. Thus, in this embodiment, the magnets <b>20</b> act as connection terminals, receiving power from the cable <b>26</b> and its conductors <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and serving as connection points for second wires <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> that penetrate the frame <b>12</b> to bring power to the linear lighting within its interior. As was described briefly above, in this embodiment, the power is low voltage DC power.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">On the opposite side of the LGP <b>10</b>, a second set of magnets <b>20</b> receive power from third wires <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> that exit the frame <b>12</b> through openings <b>36</b> and connect to respective magnets <b>20</b>. With the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, both sets of magnets <b>20</b>, on the right side <b>22</b> and the left side <b>24</b>, will convey power to adjacent LGPs <b>20</b> if and when complementary magnets or magnetic, conductive pieces make contact.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is one opening <b>36</b> for each magnet <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, there may be fewer openings <b>36</b>. For example, a single opening <b>36</b> may be provided in the center of each side of the LGP <b>10</b>, with longer lead wires that contact each magnet <b>20</b> on that side. The use of fewer openings <b>36</b> provides less chance for light leaking out and less chance for contamination getting in. It could also mean fewer manufacturing steps to seal the openings <b>36</b> around the wires.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Within the frame <b>12</b> of the LGP <b>10</b>, various arrangements may be used. For example, a magnet <b>20</b> on the right side <b>22</b> may be directly connected to its counterpart magnet <b>20</b> on the left side <b>24</b> by a dedicated wire or conductor within the frame <b>12</b>. Alternately, connections between counterpart magnet-terminals <b>20</b> may be indirect and made through other electrical components. For example, one magnet <b>20</b> may connect to a terminal on a strip of linear lighting, which connects to another strip of linear lighting, which connects to the counterpart magnet on the opposite side.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">One possible application of this is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which shows three LGPs connected in a shape that approximates a triangular prism. One LGP <b>10</b> is the LGP of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The other two LGPs <b>50</b> have magnets <b>20</b> on their side edges, just as the LGP <b>10</b> does, and those magnets <b>20</b> are electrically connected as power terminals, but they are not connected to a power cable <b>26</b>. In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, all three LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> are lit when the power cable <b>26</b> is connected to power. The LGPs <b>50</b> that are not directly connected to a power cable <b>26</b> receive power through the magnets <b>20</b> which, as described above, serve as power terminals. This arrangement allows multiple LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> to be assembled into numerous configurations, some of which are self-supporting, with only limited connection to power. Examples include pyramids, cubes, etc.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">There is no particular limit to the number of LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> that can be connected and powered in this way. However, regulatory limits in some jurisdictions may impose limits on the total amount of power that a system comprised of multiple LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> can draw and the maximum voltage that may be used. For example, Class 2 low voltage standards promulgated in the National Electrical Code by the National Fire Protection Association in the United States limit low-voltage circuits to 60 W of power at 12V and 96 W of power at 24V. Additionally, as a practical matter, if a number of LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> are in series, Ohmic voltage drop, i.e., loss of voltage due to the inherent electrical resistance of the magnets <b>20</b> and other electrical components of the circuit, may limit the number of LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> that can be connected together and successfully lit. If a particularly large number of LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> is to be connected together, it may be useful to connect corresponding magnets <b>20</b> together directly by dedicated conductors, rather than routing the connection through strips of linear lighting or other electrical components.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, more than one LGP <b>10</b> in a connected a connected system may be connected to a power cable <b>26</b> to bring power into the system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front elevational view of four LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> arranged in a simple series. This arrangement is chosen for ease of illustration and description, but the arrangement could be of any type. In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, two LGPs <b>10</b> with power cables <b>26</b> are at respective ends of the series, and two LGPs <b>50</b> without connection to power cables <b>26</b> lie between them. As was described above, bringing power in at multiple points may increase the number of LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> that can be connected in any one series.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should also be understood that although the LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> have terminal-magnets <b>20</b> along two sides <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, an LGP according to embodiments of the invention may have terminal-magnets <b>20</b> on any number of sides. If terminal-magnets <b>20</b> are provided along three or four sides of the LGP <b>10</b>, <b>50</b>, those additional terminal-magnets <b>20</b> increase the number of ways that a single LGP <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> can be connected to others, and thus, increase the versatility of lighting systems that can be built using the LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b>. On the other hand, terminal-magnets <b>20</b> along only one side of the LGP <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> may be sufficient in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, LGPs according to embodiments of the invention may have some magnets that do not act as terminals. As may be apparent from the description above, in a simple embodiment, only two magnets <b>20</b> need act as terminals in a scenario where the LGP <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> requires only one channel of low-voltage DC power to operate. However, additional magnets may be provided that do not act as terminals and are serve solely to increase attachment force. Magnets <b>20</b> that act as terminals may also be of substantial size in some cases, so that they cover a substantial portion of each connecting side <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the above description, wires <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> soldered to the magnets <b>20</b> are used to convey power. However, there are arrangements that may reduce or eliminate the need to use wires <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, at least externally. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the frame <b>12</b> illustrating an alternative way in which the magnet <b>20</b> may be connected.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">More specifically, in this view, a magnet <b>20</b> rests atop the frame <b>12</b>, just as described above. The frame <b>12</b> has a nonconducting layer <b>52</b> as its outer surface, and a similar nonconducting layer <b>52</b> on its inner surface. That nonconducting layer <b>52</b> may be paint, another type of coating, an oxide layer, or any other kind of insulative or passivating layer that may be used. The magnet <b>20</b> itself has a core <b>54</b> of magnetic material and, as described above, an outer conductive layer <b>56</b>. A through-hole <b>58</b> is formed in the frame <b>12</b> directly underneath the magnet <b>20</b>. That through-hole <b>58</b> is filled with solder or another conductive compound <b>60</b> and forms a terminal or pad <b>62</b> along the interior of the frame <b>12</b>. An interior wire <b>64</b> is connected to the pad <b>62</b>, e.g., by soldering, and carries power from the magnet <b>20</b> to the linear lighting and other components within the frame <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The conductors <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> from the power cable <b>28</b> may enter the frame <b>12</b> and make internal connections in similar fashion. Alternatively, a specific connector for the power cable <b>26</b> and its conductors <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> may be provided along the exterior of the frame <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> above use two-terminal connections to convey power, there are situations in which more terminals may be needed to convey power and, in some cases, data signals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a portion of an LGP, generally indicated at <b>100</b>, illustrating this principle. Specifically, a portion of the frame <b>102</b> of the LGP <b>100</b> is shown.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">One common situation in which more terminals and conductors may be needed occurs when the LED light engines on a strip of linear lighting are capable of emitting more than one color of light. In this case, the LED light engines would typically contain more than one type of LED, each of which requires its own power and control signals. For example, so-called RGB LED light engines contain independently-controllable red, green, and blue LEDs which are additively color-mixed to produce any number of different colors of light. This may also be the case if the LED light engines are designed to produce multiple, different colors of so-called &#x201c;white&#x201d; light. A full survey of all scenarios in which LED light engines may require more than positive and minus-return conductors <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> lies outside the scope of this document, but there are many.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> assumes that the LGP <b>100</b> has RGB LEDs, which require a separate (voltage) control signal for each of the red, green, and blue channels, as well as a common anode or cathode, for a total of four voltage/signal lines. Thus, there are four magnets <b>104</b> arrayed along the edge of the frame <b>102</b>. With the magnets <b>104</b> spread out over the length of the side of the frame <b>102</b>, connecting the conductors of a power cable individually to each magnet <b>104</b> may be impractical. Thus, the LGP <b>100</b> also has another feature: a set of four conductive contacts <b>106</b> clustered together along the perpendicular edge <b>108</b> of the frame <b>102</b>. These contacts <b>106</b> are connected by pre-laid conductors <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> to respective magnets <b>104</b>. These pre-laid conductors <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> may be inlaid wires, conductors on a printed circuit board that is laid on the frame, or any other suitable type of connectors. This simplifies and neatens the process of connecting magnets <b>104</b> with a power cable <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The contacts <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may be simple solder pads, but more complex arrangements may be used. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an illustration of an LGP <b>150</b> with a frame <b>152</b>. The arrangement of the frame <b>152</b> is very similar to that of the frame <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. There are four magnets <b>104</b> arrayed along the outer edge of the frame. In this case, a terminal block <b>154</b> with four individual terminals receives the conductors from the power cable <b>120</b>. Individual conductors <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are connected between the terminal block <b>154</b> and the magnets <b>104</b>. Although these conductors <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are shown as being on the external surface of the frame <b>152</b> for ease of illustration, they may alternatively be on the inside surface of the frame <b>152</b> and use structures such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to make electrical connections with the magnets <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Of course, a terminal block <b>154</b> is only one example of a connecting structure that may be used for a power cable <b>120</b>. In other embodiments, complementary male and female connectors on the power cable and frame may be used to make press-in connections that are easily made and, when needed, easily broken.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In all of the above description, the magnets <b>20</b> are shown as lying along the exterior of the LGP <b>10</b>, <b>50</b>. However, that need not be the case in all embodiments. In some embodiments, the magnets <b>20</b> may be inlaid into the frame <b>12</b> or into the light guide <b>14</b> itself. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of an LGP <b>200</b> according to another embodiment of the invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, magnets <b>20</b> are inlaid into notches <b>210</b> cut in the light guide.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">One particular advantage of embodiments of the invention is that additional LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> may be added on to a system simply by bringing them in close enough proximity to snap into place by magnetic attraction. Because magnets provide both electrical and mechanical connection, LGP lighting systems can be quickly and dynamically assembled and disassembled, and an assembled system may be either temporary or permanent. For example, a number of LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> may be assembled to provide light over an area and that area may be added to quickly by snapping additional LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> in place if expansion is necessary. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, quickly-assembled self-supporting structures may provide localized task lighting or even aesthetic light sculpture.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although much of this description shows and describes magnets <b>20</b>, <b>104</b> as the sole connecting structure that connects adjacent LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b>, that need not be the case in all embodiments. Particularly with larger or heavier LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> magnetic force may not be sufficient to secure two LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> together. In that case, or if a structure made with LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> is intended to be semi-permanent or permanent, additional mechanical securement may be used. This may include screws, bolts, nails, staples, etc., and LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> according to embodiments of the invention may include flanges, openings, straps, and other structures to receive fasteners. As those of skill in the art will note, even if an LGP-based structure requires additional securement, the magnets <b>20</b>, <b>104</b> may still provide some advantages in the construction of such structures: they may provide enough force to bind adjacent LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> together while additional mechanical securement is installed, or they may allow the temporary construction of a structure while the need for additional mechanical securement is evaluated.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should also be understood that while this description focuses on traditional LGPs powered by traditional linear lighting, the connection techniques and resulting systems described here may be applied to other types of technologies. For example, the light source within the LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b> need not be traditional LED linear lighting, but may instead be continuous strips of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) or other light-emitting technologies. In fact, in some cases, the light-emitting panel may be a large OLED panel. When the term &#x201c;LGP&#x201d; is used in this description, unless the text indicates otherwise (e.g., by referring to structure that is only found in an LGP per se), the term should be interpreted to refer to all types of light-emitting panels.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As those of skill in the art will understand, the LGPs <b>10</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>200</b> described above are all of the &#x201c;fixed frame&#x201d; variety, i.e., the frame is fixed in place. LGPs are also made in so-called &#x201c;snap frame&#x201d; configurations. In a snap-frame LGP, a portion of the frame is movable and can &#x201c;snap&#x201d; into place. LGPs of this type are most commonly used as backings for advertisements. The medium holding the advertisement is clamped into place by the frame of the LGP and also backlit by it. Snap-frame LGPs are particularly convenient when backlit advertisements may need to be changed often. The structures described above may be applied to snap-frame LGPs as well.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">This description uses the term &#x201c;about.&#x201d; When that term is used in this description, it means that the stated value or range of values may change as long as those changes do not make the stated function or result impossible. If it cannot be determined what amount of change would make a stated function or result impossible, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; to should be construed to mean&#xb1;5%.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the invention has been described with respect to certain embodiments, the description is intended to be exemplary, rather than limiting.
