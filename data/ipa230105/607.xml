An elongated aperture has a pair of nodes located on opposing sides of the aperture and between a pair of antinodes located on the extended and opposing ends of the elongated aperture. A geometric pattern may have various geometric shapes, or tiles, between the plurality of apertures. The geometric tiles have a bounded perimeter formed by the plurality of elongated apertures. A substantial portion of the elongated apertures may be configured with the antinodes proximal to one of said pair of nodes of a separate elongated aperture; wherein the antinodes are closer to one of the pair of nodes than to any other antinode.

Skin grafts are commonly used for burn victims and for cosmetic surgeries. It is common to mesh these scaffolds to expand them, thereby increasing the area of coverage offered by a limited resource, and improving their compliance. Current mesh designs allow for the scaffold to be elongated in one direction at the expense of length in the perpendicular direction. This mono-direction elongation results in stress being placed on the surrounding tissue, wrinkles in the graft and surrounding tissue and in some cases rupture or tears. It significantly limits compliance when attempting to cover or modify three dimensional structures.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention is directed to a biological compliant scaffold having a pattern of elongated apertures to enable biaxial elongation and contraction and methods of forming said biological compliant scaffold both ex vivo or in vivo. The pattern of elongated apertures includes nodes and antinodes that enables bi-lateral expansion through expansion of the apertures and rotation of tiles configured therebetween. This renders the biological compliant scaffold compliant around complex shapes including round or curved surfaces. An exemplary biological compliant scaffold is expandable or moldable and can encourage selective contraction in specific areas; all of which systematically change the shape of the biological compliant scaffold. Altering the compliance and plasticity of a biological compliant scaffold is accomplished by introducing a plurality of elongated apertures that form a geometric pattern that enables biaxial expansion. This may be in vivo modification of living tissue including, but not limited to, skin, tendon, muscle, vessel, bone, and the like, ex vivo modification of living tissue such as sundry harvested grafts including, but not limited to, skin, bone or tendon, or modification of implantable biological devices such as plates, acellular dermal matrix, allograft, xenograft and the like. The invention is directed to a biological compliant scaffold and method of forming said biological compliant scaffold by creating the elongated apertures in a pattern as detailed herein in vivo or ex vivo.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A pattern of elongated apertures, in a closed or expanded state, or combination thereof can be formed in vivo on a bone or may be formed in a bone graft external to the body and then implanted.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A biological compliant scaffold, as used herein includes graft or biologic materials implanted or attached to biological material or tissue, and ex vivo grafts wherein biological material comprises a plurality of elongated apertures as described herein. A biological compliant scaffold may have no blood supply and be implanted to be revitalized, may be a flap wherein blood supply is left intact. A biological compliant scaffold may be tissue from the patient or from a donor that is configured with a plurality of elongated apertures, it may be tissue that is altered ex vivo with a plurality of elongated apertures or a combination of both. A biological compliant scaffold may be a non-biological material such as a fastener, screw, plate and the like and may be made out of biologically compatible materials, such metal, metal alloys, stainless steel, titanium, nitinol, bioresorbable materials, polymeric materials such as fluoropolymers and in particular polytetrafluoroethylene. Biological, as used herein, includes tissue or materials that are biologically compatible for implantation such as certain metals and alloys, polymers and the like.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A compliant scaffold made of metal may be made out of shape memory alloy such as a composite of nickel-titanium, nitinol. This material is used in stents and stent grafts and in some cases the vasculature may be non-uniform or branched and a metal with a pattern of elongated apertures as described herein may be used for compliance of the stent. Other metal implantable applications may include intravascular filters, hernia patch material, bone plates, fasteners and the like. Stents may be used in the intravascular system, gastro-intestinal system or liver system, for example. A stent may be a self-expanding stent that is made out of a shape memory material or may be a balloon expandable stent. A stent may have be a bare stent or may be part of a stent-graft, comprising a graft material coupled to the stent.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A compliant scaffold may be made out of a bioresorbable material that may be used within the body that overtime is absorbed. A bioresorbable material may comprise a pattern of elongated apertures therethrough and may configured with other implantable materials, such as a stent or graft.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A compliant scaffold, such as one made of metal, plastic, fiber board, films, architectural or building materials, for example, may be used in as a building scaffolding for concrete or other materials that are later applied thereto or coated thereon or therethrough. The compliant metal scaffold may be placed and shaped over a curved or irregular shaped structure and then the building material, such as concrete may be applied. The compliant metal scaffold may be configured over an expandable or inflatable structure that is then inflated to cause the compliant scaffold to conform to the expanded shape and subsequently, a building material, such as concrete, may be applied. The expandable structure may then be retracted and removed, leaving a structure that is curved or irregularly shaped.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A compliant scaffold made be used in garments or apparel applications and may be made out of an elastomeric material or may be coupled with an elastomeric material to enable the apparel article, such as a garment to conform to an individual body shape and retract when taken off. An elastomeric material may be applied to, imbibed into a compliant scaffold material having the plurality of elongated apertures. A compliant scaffold may be made out of an elastomeric material, such as a sheet or fabric. Elastomeric apparel articles are common for both athletic activities and for general fashion. Undergarments, leggings and even jeans incorporate elastomeric materials to provide form fitting garments and the compliant scaffold may be incorporated with these garments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An elastomeric material is a material that can be deformed, such as by stretching by a deforming load, and will substantially return to pre-deformed state, upon removal of a deforming load. An elastomeric sheet is a planar piece of material that can be stretched and substantially return to original dimensions, such as within about 10% or preferably within about 5%, within about one hour of removal of a extension force; wherein the stretch is performed over no more than 2 minutes and is no more than a 30% elongation and wherein the elastomeric material is not held in stretched state for more than a minute.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A compliant scaffold made be used in garments or apparel applications, such as for molds or supports for shoes, hats or helmets, or for brassieres wherein a specific supporting contour would be desired. A compliant scaffold for apparel applications may be made of metal, elastomeric material, plastic, foams and the like. A compliant scaffold may be a metal sheet or plastic sheet with the apertures formed therethrough. In the brassiere application, the compliant scaffold support may be provided with the apertures closes or partially open and then the geometry of a particular person may further form and open or close the apertures. An exemplary compliant graft may be used in avant-garde apparel to form shapes that form part of the unique design. An exemplary compliant graft may also be used for draperies or other applications where fluid movement and conformability are desired.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An exemplary compliant scaffold may be configured as an enclosure, such as a duffle bag or purse such that the enclosure can expand and conform to accommodate items therein. The enclosure may comprise an elastomeric component that enables the expanded compliant scaffold to retract after removal of the items therein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An exemplary compliant scaffold may be configured as a rapid splint or support structure for medical purposes. A sheet of compliant scaffold formed of a plastic or metal, for example, may be shaped and formed around an appendage to retain the limb in a desired orientation and prevent movement. A sheet or roll of conformable material may be cut and formed in the field for emergency applications. An exemplary compliant scaffold may be configured as a C-collars for cervical spine stabilization, for example.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An exemplary compliant scaffold may be configured as a structural support for a structure, such as a building, a dwelling, roof and the like. The compliant scaffold may be shaped in situ to form the compliant and shaped structure and may have a secondary material applied to further support the structure, such as cement or a resin.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an exemplary embodiment, the elongated apertures comprise a pair of nodes centrally located on opposing sides of the aperture and between a pair of antinodes, wherein the antinodes are configured on opposing ends of the elongated aperture. The geometric pattern comprises a plurality of geometric shapes, or tiles, between the plurality of apertures. The geometric shapes or tiles have a bounded perimeter formed by the plurality of elongated apertures. An exemplary biological compliant scaffold, has a substantial portion of the elongated apertures that are configured with the antinodes proximal to one of said pair of nodes of a separate elongated aperture; wherein the antinodes are closer to one of the pair of nodes than to any other antinode; wherein the node and antinode are considered a node, antinode pair. This unique arrangement of the elongated apertures produces a biological compliant scaffold material that can be biaxially expanded. During expansion of the biological compliant scaffold, the first and second nodes separate from each other while the antinodes approach each other to form an arrangement of tessellated apertures. The arrangement of the elongated apertures and tiles therebetween enables biaxial expansion with tiles rotating. Adjacent tiles that are connected through a node antinode pair counter rotate and those adjacent tiles not connected by a node antinode may pair co-rotate. This combination of tile rotation and aperture expansion enables a generally uniform biaxially expansion.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The position to apertures relative to one another can be used to alter the properties of the compliant scaffold, including stiffness and percent elongation or expansion. The first means of doing this is to maintain the basic node antinode relationship between adjacent elongated apertures but increase the space between the apertures which effectively also increases the distance between node and antinode pairs. The second method of altering the properties of the compliant graft requires altering the place of interaction between nodes and antinodes along the elongated aperture. Moving the point of interaction of nodes to adjacent antinodes may change the expansion ratio and allow fine tuning the stiffness and expansile properties of the compliant scaffold for a specific application.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An exemplary biological compliant scaffold may be beneficial in a wide array of applications, including skin grafts, bone grafts, cardiac patches or grafts, hernia patches or grafts, organ grafts, vascular graft and stent grafts, for example. A graft may be a donor graft comprising material such as skin, bone or tissue from a donor patient, or from a donor site of the patient being treated, or may be a constructed graft, which may comprise organic donor material or layers and additional material or layers. A constructed scaffold may be synthetic scaffold made from non-donor materials such as bioresorbable material that resorb into the body over time. An exemplary scaffold material may be an in vivo scaffold made by creating the plurality of apertures and geometric pattern in the tissue directly, such as with the use of lasers. For example, a laser may be used to create a geometric pattern in skin by making the plurality of slits or apertures directly in the skin of a patient. Furthermore, an exemplary biological compliant scaffold formed in vivo in skin by imprinting the skin tissue with the plurality of apertures as described herein, is a way of programming the tissue to expand in areas where the scaffold is not expanded and contract in areas where the scaffold is expanded. Thus far, skin tissue has been made into an unexpanded biological compliant scaffold which allows for the scaffolds or tissue to expand. This can however be done in reverse; Imprinting tissue with a fully expanded scaffold and removing the material from the apertures, or selectively burning/treating said tissue within the apertures with an instrument such as a laser. This would allow for the scaffold to contract rather than expand. Such a scaffold would be useful in shortening bones to address limb length discrepancies or in common operations such as the ulnar shortening osteotomy. Furthermore, such a fully expanded scaffold could be imprinted in skin which would encourage the skin to tighten. This application may be useful in body contouring procedures including breast lifts or facial aesthetic procedures such a facelifts and neck-lifts. This technique is not limited to a scaffold made of skin. The plurality of apertures may be microscopic in scale, such as less than a millimeter in length, a micron or less to sub-micron range, or less than a micron in length. The apertures may also be larger for some applications, such as a few millimeters to a millimeter.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is also possible to imprint tissue with a differentially expanded scaffold which would precisely direct selective expansion and contraction on the same surface. An exemplary biological compliant scaffold may comprise a portion with a plurality of apertures configured to promote expansion or extension of the biological scaffold and may comprises a second portion configured to contract. A first portion of a biological compliant scaffold may comprise expanded apertures, such as expanded elongated apertures and a second portion may comprise a plurality of apertures that are not expanded. A first portion of a biological compliant scaffold may comprise unexpanded apertures, such as unexpanded elongated apertures and a second portion may comprise a plurality of apertures that are partially or fully expanded. The geometric pattern of apertures may comprise regions of elongated apertures in different degrees of expansion to promote reconfiguration of the biological material or scaffold.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Exemplary biological compliant scaffold skin grafts may be used to repair damaged skin, such as from burns, chemical damage, cuts or abrasions, for example. An exemplary biological compliant scaffold skin grafts may provide compliance in highly elongated areas, including the elbows, knees and the like. As mentioned, biological compliant scaffold skin grafts may be used in cosmetic procedures such as cleft palate surgeries and the like.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An exemplary biological compliant scaffold bone graft may be used to aid in the restructure of bone. In an Ilizarov technique, the two ends of the bone are slowly distracted and an in-vivo biological compliant scaffold bone may be created along a portion of the bone to improve the compliance of the bone and increase the rate of distraction. Alternatively, an in-vivo biological compliant scaffold bone may be used along a portion of the bone, instead of or in conjunction with a full thickness osteotomy to improve the compliance of the bone. Improved compliance may enable more strain of the for a given amount of stress or force on the biological compliant scaffold. The Ilizarov technique is used where one bone is shorter than another through injury, or birth. In some cases, the Ilizarov technique is used for cosmetic reasons, such as to make a person taller. In some cases, this technique may not just augment but actually obviate the need for the Ilizarov technique. These applications fall under the general category of osteogenic distraction that involves making complete osteotomies in bone to be expanded. By transforming the same bone into a biologic scaffold as described, using this plurality of apertures, such distraction techniques mat not require full osteotomies, or separation of the bone being altered, but rather a plurality of smaller partial osteotomies that may greatly reduce distraction times, and increase safety by creating inherently more stable expansion constructs.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An exemplary biological compliant scaffold bone graft may be used in a Cranioplasty technique to repair abnormal skull shapes. An ex-vivo biological compliant scaffold bone graft may be produced in a skull using a laser, bone scalpel or other suitable method to produce apertures through the skull or through a portion of the skull. This ex-vivo biological compliant scaffold bone may allow expanding or contracting of the cranial vault to treat pediatric growth malformations. In addition, this ex-vivo biological compliant scaffold method may be a more effective treatment to treat increased intra cranial pressure in adults from such conditions as hydrocephalus, intracranial mass or acute or chronic trauma. It is also possible to create a compliant meshed scaffold from the cranial vault in vivo without extricating the skull or removing it from its blood supply. Such techniques may augment current so called &#x201c;strip craniectomy&#x201d; procedures.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An exemplary biological compliant scaffold of bone may be a bone graft, osseous free flap, or vascularized in vivo bony structure having elongated apertures formed therein ex vivo or in vivo for osteoplasty. Osteoplasty is the branch of surgery concerned with bone shaping, repair, or bone grafting. It is the surgical alteration or reshaping of bone and may be used to relieve pain associated with metastatic bone disease. An in vivo bone biological compliant scaffold may include a pattern of elongated apertures in a closed configuration and/or in an expanded configuration, wherein the elongated apertures are an expanded scaffold. For example, for ulna shortening, a bone may be configured with a pattern of elongated apertures in an open state to encourage the bone to shorten. Note that an osteoplasty utilizing a pattern of elongated apertures, as described herein, may be used to shorten, lengthen, twist or otherwise remodel bone. An exemplary biological compliant scaffold may be a bone graft or flap having elongated apertures formed ex vivo or in vivo respectively for osteoplasty.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">These scaffolds may be part of computer guided osteotomy with pre bent plates for corrective osteotomies. Currently these osteotomies are a series of pre-planned full thickness bone cuts that then allow for the bones to be reconfigured in a predetermined way and affixed to a pre-bent plate, which may be computer aided in terms of determination of the pattern of osteotomies and/or control of a cutting implement, such as a laser, drill, saw, or knife to create the pattern of osteotomies. The biologic scaffold can render bones compliant and moldable, using a predetermined pattern of apertures, expanded, partially expanded, unexpanded or a combination thereof, obviating or reducing the need for full thickness osteotomies, and can be a part of the computer guided osteotomy and reshaping process. This is particularly valuable in face/mandible/skull reconstruction or correction and complex limb reconstruction/corrections.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">An exemplary biological compliant scaffold has a plurality of elongated apertures that are linear apertures extending between a pair of antinodes, or from a first antinode to a second antinode. Exemplary elongated apertures have a length to width ratio in a non-elongated state of about two or more, about three or more, about five or more and any range between and including the ratios provided. The length of the apertures may be microscopic such as less than a millimeter in length, including in the micron range to a micron or less, or sub-micron range. An exemplary biological compliant scaffold may consist of linear elongated apertures which may all be microscopic as defined herein. The length of the apertures may be larger however, such in the range of millimeters to about a millimeter.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The density of the plurality of elongated apertures configured in a pattern to produce geometric shapes or tiles may vary depending on the application, wherein the spacing between them, or inter-aperture distance between the apertures, is configured depending on the type of material and the amount of conformability desired. The repeat distance is the distance between adjacent elongated apertures from the same feature of the two adjacent elongated apertures, such as from a particular node to the same node on an adjacent elongated aperture. The inter-aperture distance and/or the repeat distance between adjacent elongated apertures may be microscopic in some applications such as less than a millimeter in length, including in the micron range to a micron or less, or sub-micron range. The size of the elongated apertures and/or the spacing and/or the repeat distance in one or more directions may change over the surface of a compliant scaffold to enable various amounts of conformance or elongation for irregular shaped surfaces, such as a breast or a support for in a brassiere.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The distance between nodes and antinodes of a compliant scaffold may be selectively altered, thereby changing the relative size of living hinges of those node antinode pairs that have been changed, which will also selectively alter the compliance of the meshed material or tiles between the apertures. Differential conformance within the same mesh allows for said mesh to alter the shape of the compliant object, material or tissue that the mesh contains. A compliant scaffold may therefore expand differentially depending on the specific geometry of the apertures, length of apertures, and distance between the apertures and particularly the distance between the node-antinode pairs. For instance, a sphere made of compliant of spongy material could be enveloped in a mesh, where selective alterations were made regarding certain node-antinode pairs. These selective areas may be more or less compliant. In this way the mesh may be pre-programmed to alter the shape of the matter it covers or contains. In such a state, the sphere (possessing spherical symmetry) could be made to adopt any number of other shapes with fewer planes of symmetry such as a teardrop shape, cylinder, cone, pyramid (radial symmetry) or even more complex shapes with fewer or no planes of symmetry.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The geometric pattern of a compliant scaffold may be applied to alter the structure or function of any underlying compliant material it is applied to, or an object may be pre-fabricated with the material of interest already enveloped in this mesh and that new composite object of underlying material and mesh may be used, applied or implanted wholesale. Such objects, once installed could then undergo further alterations to the mesh to fine tune its structure and function.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An exemplary compliant scaffold comprises a control geometric pattern of apertures having at least a portion of the apertures arranged in a non-uniform geometric pattern of apertures that is configured preferentially to expand in a pre-defined manner, wherein the geometric pattern is more easily expanded or expands to a greater degree in a first portion of the compliant scaffold and wherein a second portion of the compliant scaffold is harder to expand or expands to a lesser degree than said first portion. A control geometric pattern of apertures may have different length apertures, different spaces between apertures, different spacing between node-antinode pairs, different shaped and dimension tiles and the like. The changes in the pattern may be gradual to produce smooth transitions across an expanded surface.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An exemplary compliant scaffold configured for cosmetic implant, such as for breast augmentation, may have a non-uniform geometric pattern of apertures that is configured preferentially expand in a pre-defined manner, wherein the geometric pattern is more easily expanded or expands to a greater degree in a first portion of the compliant scaffold and wherein a second portion of the compliant scaffold is harder to expand or expands to a lesser degree than said first portion. A compliant scaffold with a non-uniform geometric pattern of apertures may be configured in a breast implant directly or into a cover configured to extend around a breast implant, or may be coupled to the tissue such that the tissue is preferentially expanded by the breast implant to form a desired shape. This same concept may be applied to other cosmetic implant areas, such as the face including the cheek or lips, butt, arms, calves, legs and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An exemplary biological compliant scaffold for breast augmentation and in particular to retain a breast implant may be made out of a biological material as described herein, a material that can be implanted into the body, which may include synthetic materials including polymers, such as fluoropolymers, metals such as titanium, stainless steel or nitinol, or acellular dermis xenograft, (pigskin) for example. The biological compliant scaffold may be attached to the tissue to produce differential compliance of the tissue in a desired shape. The biological compliant scaffold may be configured as a pouch that extends around a portion of a first and second side of a breast implant or may form an enclosure. The biological compliant scaffold may comprise an attachment flange or a portion around a perimeter that may be used to couple the biological compliant scaffold to the tissue. A surgeon may couple the biological compliant scaffold, such as a pouch to the tissue and then insert the breast implant. The pouch may then be closed such as by stitching the opening of the pouch closed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An exemplary biological compliant scaffold for cosmetic or reconstructive lifting procedures such as breast lifts, face lifts, body lifts and may be made out of a biological material as described herein, a material that can be implanted into the body, which may include synthetic materials including polymers, such as fluoropolymers, metals such as titanium, stainless steel or nitinol, or acellular dermis xenograft, (pigskin) for example. The biologic compliant scaffold may be attached to the tissue to produce differential compliance of the tissue in a desired shape. The biologic scaffold in breast lifting (mastopexy) or reduction procedures may be directly attached to the breast mound, to be formed or lifted, once the skin flaps have been developed and the breast mound dissected. Once attached to the chest, the compliant scaffold can be placed in the breast mound on any desired position on the chest (allowing for lift) and in any desired shape.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">This concept of preferentially expanding compliant scaffolds with a non-uniform geometric pattern of apertures may be applied in a wide array of applications including, but not limited to, garments, containers, bags, purses, support structures such as hammocks, canopies, and the like. In a garment application, the garment or an undergarment may comprise a layer of material that is a compliant scaffold with a non-uniform geometric pattern of apertures. The garment may then preferentially expand to produce a desired shape, such as to raise the buttocks or in lift and shape the breasts.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An exemplary biological compliant scaffold comprises a plurality of elongated apertures configured in a pattern to produce geometric shapes or tiles. In an exemplary embodiment, a substantial portion of the elongated apertures, such as 50% or more and preferably 80% or more, are arranged orthogonally to each other, wherein a first elongated aperture is orthogonal to a second elongated aperture configured on a first antinode end of said first elongated aperture. In an exemplary embodiment, a biological compliant scaffold consists essentially of, such as at least 90% or more, elongated apertures that are arranged orthogonally to each other.

In an I-configuration, a first elongated aperture is substantially orthogonal, within about 20 degrees of orthogonal, to a second elongated aperture configured on the first antinode end of said first elongated aperture and wherein said first elongated aperture is substantially orthogonal to a third elongated aperture configured on the second antinode end of said first elongated aperture.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">An exemplary biological compliant scaffold comprises a geometric pattern of elongated apertures and geometric shapes wherein the geometric shape has a plurality of corners and wherein each of said plurality of corners are bound by a node of separate elongated apertures. An exemplary biological compliant scaffold comprises a geometric pattern of elongated apertures and geometric shapes wherein the geometric shape is a rectangle and wherein the corners of the rectangle are bound by a node of four separate elongated apertures. An exemplary biological compliant scaffold comprises a geometric pattern of elongated apertures and geometric shapes wherein the geometric shape is a triangle and wherein the corners of the triangle are bound by a node of three separate elongated apertures, which may be a side of an adjacent triangular geometric shape.

In ex vivo biological material, a cutting template may be applied and used manually or may guide an automated cutting implement, such as an automatically controlled laser cutter.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A biological scaffold may have elongated apertures having one or more blanks, wherein the blanks are removed material that may be in a particular shape. A blank may be configured along the elongated aperture, such as being proximal to the extended end of an extension or proximal to an antinode configured on an extended end of the elongated aperture or may be configured along the length of the elongated aperture. A blank may be configured at the intersection of extensions of the elongated aperture or at a bi-node or tri-node, for example.

A solid compliant scaffold may have a geometric pattern of apertures that extend through the solid from a first side, through the compliant scaffold to another side, such as an opposing side when the apertures are straight line apertures. A solid compliant scaffold may be a polyhedron having planar surfaces or may have curved surfaces or be a combination of both. A solid compliant scaffold may be a rod or have a general rod shape, such as a bone. The through apertures may extend through the bone to allow for remodeling the bone and/or extending or lengthening the bone. A solid compliant scaffold may be a polyhedron and apertures may extend symmetrically through the polyhedron from a first side to an opposing second side. This type of solid three-dimensional compliant scaffold with elongated apertures may allow elongating within necking or narrowing of the compliant scaffold and may provide a more easily restructured or deformable compliant scaffold. The apertures may only extend a portion of a depth into a solid and three-dimensionally shaped compliant scaffold, such as a polyhedron or a three-dimensional compliant scaffold that having curved surfaces including a rod, cylinder or a sphere. Apertures may extend into a solid or three-dimensional compliant scaffold and intersect with each other to produce interconnected wedges of the three-dimensional compliant scaffold that can move independently from other wedges.

A biological compliant scaffold may be formed ex vivo by the formation of the plurality of elongated apertures in tissue or bone for example.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As shown throughout the figures, a node is represented as an black circle and an antinode is represented as a open circle.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary graft <b>11</b> comprises an elongated aperture <b>30</b> comprising a pair of nodes <b>20</b>, or node pair configured centrally between two antinodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>. A pair of nodes is an arrangement of two nodes next to each other on opposing sides of an elongated aperture. This pair of nodes comprises node <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. The elongated aperture has a first extension <b>41</b> extending from the node pair <b>20</b> to the first antinode <b>51</b> and a second extension <b>42</b> extending from the node pair to the second antinode <b>52</b>. As the biological compliant scaffold is elongated the nodes <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, of the elongated aperture <b>30</b> separate to form a diamond. As the biological compliant scaffold is stretched further the nodes separate further and the antinodes contract toward each other whereby the nodes become antinode and the antinodes become nodes. As the biological compliant scaffold is elongated further, the antinodes approach one another and the nodes are fully extended apart. This simple elongated aperture produces a maximally expanded square aperture when nodes and antinodes are equidistant. Further expansion of the nodes in the same relative direction leads to contraction of this maximum open area of the aperture with the antinodes moving closer to each other until in essence the nodes have become antinodes and the antinodes have become nodes. This is a reason why apertures not connected by node/antinode pairs contract in one direction when expanding in another.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a graft having an arrangement of apertures aligned with each other can be elongated but this causes contraction in the opposing direction. The nodes separate and the antinodes contract causing the graft material to neck in, or contract, in a direction perpendicular to the direction of elongation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an exemplary compliant scaffold <b>10</b> with an exemplary geometric pattern of I-shaped elongated apertures <b>70</b> comprising elongated apertures <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>33</b>, each having nodes <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> configured between a pair of antinodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> in a linear elongated aperture. The top figure shows the biological compliant scaffold without tension or elongation. The bottom figure shows the graft material being elongated, as indicated by the bold arrows. As the material is elongated, the nodes <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> of the two outer elongated apertures <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>, separate in the direction of the elongation, or the elongation axis <b>16</b>. The nodes of the center elongated aperture <b>32</b> also separate as the sides <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>, and <b>61</b>&#x2032;, <b>62</b>&#x2032; around the antinodes <b>21</b>&#x2032; and <b>22</b>&#x2032;, respectively, separate in the elongation axis. As the sides separate, the nodes <b>21</b>&#x2032;, <b>22</b>&#x2032; also separate in the cross-elongation axis <b>17</b>. The configuration of the antinodes of the center elongated aperture <b>32</b> proximal to the pairs of nodes <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; and <b>20</b>&#x2033;, of the outer elongated apertures <b>31</b>, <b>33</b>, causes this more uniform elongation of the biological compliant scaffold material without necking or contraction in the cross-elongation axis. The bottom compliant scaffold <b>10</b> is an expanded scaffold <b>94</b>. The inter-aperture distance <b>201</b> between adjacent elongated apertures is shown between the first elongated aperture <b>31</b> and the second elongated aperture <b>32</b>. This gap distance <b>200</b> may be a distance between a node and the closest antinode, which may be uniform or modified over a geometric pattern of apertures to produce differential compliance, as shown in later figures. As described herein, this space may be preferably on the same scale as the elongated aperture length <b>37</b>. When the gap distance is greater, the compliant scaffold may be stiffer or present a higher modulus for expansion of the scaffold. Also, the percent expansion may be reduced as a function of the area of the compliant scaffold. The compliant scaffold material between the antinode and node may act as a hinge, such as a living hinge, for the scaffold or tile and may include a different material of additional material from the rest of the compliant scaffold material. An elastomeric material may be configured as a hinge between the elongated apertures. A hinge may be configured between the elongated apertures including a mechanical or elastomeric hinge. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there is a significant distance between the antinode of one elongated aperture and the node of an adjacent elongated aperture. These distances can be adjusted from angstrom scale to any practical length. Increasing the node/adjacent antinode distance effectively decreases the ratio of expansion and decreases compliance. Such an adjustment leads to a stiffer mesh (with a higher young's modulus) that may be better matched to the young's modulus of nearby or connected materials or structures. Decreasing this distance makes the mesh more conformable.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an exemplary linear elongated aperture <b>30</b> having a pair of nodes <b>20</b> configured centrally along the aperture and pair of antinodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> configured on opposing ends of the aperture. A first antinode <b>51</b> is configured at the extended end of a first extension <b>41</b> from the pair of nodes and a second antinode <b>52</b> is configured at the extended end of a second extension <b>42</b> from the pair of nodes. As shown in the expanded version of the elongated aperture, a square shaped opening or aperture may be formed from the elongated aperture when elongated as indicated by the bold arrows. The two sides <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>, and <b>61</b>&#x2032;, <b>62</b>&#x2032; of the elongated aperture between the nodes and antinodes form the sides of the rectangle.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an exemplary elongated aperture <b>30</b> has two pairs of nodes <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; configured between two opposing antinodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>. Again, this is a linear elongated aperture having a first extension <b>41</b> from the first pair of nodes <b>20</b> to the first antinode <b>51</b> and a second extension <b>42</b> from the second pair of nodes <b>20</b>&#x2032; to the second antinode <b>52</b>. A node extension <b>45</b> extends between the two pairs of nodes <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;. As the elongated aperture is elongated, a hexagon shaped aperture is formed initially that may form into a square or rectangle, depending on the lengths of the extensions and node extensions. A first side <b>61</b> and a second side <b>62</b> of the aperture is formed on either side of the antinode <b>51</b> and a first side <b>61</b>&#x2032; and a second side <b>62</b>&#x2032; of the aperture is formed on either side of the antinode <b>52</b>. A first node side <b>65</b> and second node side <b>66</b> are formed between the two pairs of nodes, or more specifically, between nodes <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>&#x2032; and nodes <b>22</b> and <b>22</b>&#x2032;, respectively.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an exemplary Y-shaped aperture <b>74</b> has three antinodes configured around a centrally configured tri-node <b>25</b> which includes node <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>. Each of the antinodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> is configured at the extended end of an extension that extends from the tri-node <b>25</b>. A first antinode <b>51</b> is configured at the extended end of a first extension <b>41</b> from the tri-node, a second antinode <b>52</b> is configured at the extended end of a second extension <b>42</b> from the tri-node and a third antinode <b>53</b> is configured at the extended end of a third extension <b>43</b> from the tri-node. The three extensions are configured at a substantially equal circumferential distance from each other, or about 120 degrees apart plus or minus 20 degrees and more preferably within 10 degrees of 120 degrees. As this elongated aperture is elongated, as indicated by the bold arrows, the nodes <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b> separate from each other to form a triangular shaped aperture. As the elongated aperture is elongated further, a hexagonal shaped aperture is formed. This elongated aperture provides a high level of compliance in multiple directions. A side extends between each antinode and the two adjacent nodes, such as sides <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> extending between antinode <b>51</b> and nodes <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a cross-shaped aperture comprises two elongated apertures that intersect at a node <b>20</b>, or quad node <b>24</b>. The quad node <b>24</b>, being a configuration of four nodes located proximal to each other, separates into these four nodes, <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>&#x2032;, <b>22</b>, and <b>22</b>&#x2032; to form a rectangle upon expansion, as indicated by the bold arrows in the center figure. The antinodes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>51</b>&#x2032;, <b>52</b>&#x2032; are configured between the nodes. Further expansion results in a polygon having eight surfaces. The nodes are indicated by solid small circles while the antinodes are indicated by small circles.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a more complex aperture comprises a generally cross-shaped aperture with extensions from each of the extended ends of the cross. This complex shaped aperture produces tiles <b>92</b> within the quadrants of the apertures.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a skewed elongated aperture <b>76</b> comprises a first extension <b>41</b> from a pair of nodes <b>20</b> and a second extension <b>42</b> from the pair of nodes that extends at an offset angle <b>77</b> from alignment with the first extension, whereby they first and second extensions are not aligned, as is the case with a linear elongated aperture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As this skewed elongated aperture is expanded a triangle is initially formed, and then a rectangular shaped polygon aperture is formed; note that the sides may not be equal length and the angles between the sides may not be 90 degrees as is the case with a rectangle. Further expansion of the aperture results in a triangle.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, an exemplary biological compliant scaffold <b>10</b> comprises a plurality of Y-shaped apertures <b>74</b> configured with the antinodes proximal to a node to produce geometric shapes or tiles <b>92</b>, therebetween. As the graft is elongated the apertures open up and the tiles therebetween rotate to enable biaxial expansion. The tiles that are connected by a node antinode pair counter rotate and those not connected by a node antinode pair co-rotate. This combination of tile rotation and aperture expansion enables a generally uniform biaxially expansion. As shown the plurality of Y-shaped apertures <b>74</b> expand to partially expanded apertures <b>34</b> before being further expanded into fully expanded apertures <b>35</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the repeat distances <b>202</b>, <b>202</b>&#x2032; are shown in orthogonal directions. These repeat distances are the distances between the same features between adjacent features. The repeat distance in a first direction may be different from a repeat distance in a second or orthogonal direction, as shown. In some cases, the repeat distance in orthogonal directions may be substantially the same, or within about 20% of each other or even within about 10% of each other. As described herein the size of the elongated apertures and/or the repeat distance in one or more directions may change over the surface of a compliant scaffold.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, an exemplary in-vivo scaffold comprises a plurality of Y-shaped apertures <b>74</b> configured with the antinodes proximal to a node to produce geometric shapes or tiles <b>92</b>, in tissue, such as skin.
