Certain communication cables are formed with a multitude of metallic conductors (e.g., copper conductors), such as conductors formed into a plurality of individually insulated twisted pairs. Conventionally, the various conductors of a twisted pair cable are color-coded in order to facilitate identification of both pairs and the individual conductors. For example, the insulation for a first conductor in each twisted pair may be formed with a respective solid color while the second conductor in each twisted pair may be band-marked or striped with the same color as the corresponding first conductor. As another example, a plurality of twisted pairs may each include two conductors having insulation formed with different shades of a respective color, and each of the plurality of pairs may utilize a different color. Proper identification of the twisted pairs and individual conductors is desirable for proper installation of the cables.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the use of color additives in communication cables increases the cost of the cables and enhances the environmental impact of the cable. There have been recent customer demands to reduce or eliminate chemicals and materials within cables that have negative or harmful environmental impact. Minimizing, reducing, or eliminating color additives will therefore result in cables having higher environmental sustainability. Accordingly, there is an opportunity for improved twisted pair communication cables that reduce or eliminate colorant while still permitting proper identification of twisted pairs and/or individual conductors.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The detailed description is set forth with reference to the accompanying figures.

present disclosure are directed to twisted pair communication cables that are free of colorant or that include minimal amounts of colorant relative to conventional cables. A cable may include a plurality of twisted pairs of individually insulated conductors, and a jacket may be formed around the plurality of twisted pairs. The jacket may define a cable core in which the twisted pairs are positioned. As desired, the cable may optionally include a separator positioned between two or more of the twisted pairs, one or more shield layers, one or more dielectric separators positioned between the individual conductors of respective twisted pairs, and/or other suitable internal cable components. In certain embodiments, the cable may be formed to be free of colorant. In other words, no colorant is incorporated into the twisted pair insulation, the cable jacket, and/or other cable components. In other embodiments, the cable may be formed to be free of colorant within the cable core. Although limited colorant may be utilized to include information on the cable jacket, internal components of the cable (e.g., the twisted pairs, a separator, etc.) may be formed to be free of colorant. As desired in certain embodiments, the cable may optionally include physical indicia selectively formed on one or more cable components to facilitate identification of the plurality of twisted pairs and, in certain embodiments, identification of the individual conductors within each of the plurality of twisted pairs. Physical indicia may be formed on a wide variety of different cable components as desired in various embodiments, such as the twisted pair insulation, a separator, one or more shield layers, one or more dielectric separators, etc.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For purposes of this disclosure, the term &#x201c;colorant&#x201d; means any substance that is added or applied to a cable component in order to change the color of the cable component or the color on a surface of the cable component. Examples of suitable colorants include, but are not limited to, dyes, pigments, color additives, paints, inks, etc. In conventional cables, a colorant may be blended, compounded, or otherwise mixed with a base material before a cable component is formed. For example, a colorant (e.g., a dye, a color additive, etc.) may be mixed with one or more polymeric materials prior to twisted pair insulation, a separator, a cable jacket, or a layer of a cable component (e.g., an insulation layer, etc.) being extruded or otherwise formed. Other colorants (e.g., paints, inks, etc.) may be formed on a surface of a cable component.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the present disclosure may include cables and/or cable components that are free of colorant or that include limited colorant. A cable component that is &#x201c;free of colorant&#x201d; may include materials formed with their natural or virgin color and no colorants are applied to the surface of the cable component. In other words, the materials utilized to form the cable component (e.g., one or more polymeric materials utilized to form twisted pair insulation, etc.) and/or any layers of a multi-layer cable component (e.g., insulation having a foamed layer surrounded by a skin layer, etc.) are not blended, compounded, or otherwise mixed with any colorants. Additionally, no colorants (e.g., inks, paints, etc.) are applied to or formed on an outer surface of the cable component.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A cable component that includes &#x201c;limited colorant&#x201d; may be formed from materials having their natural or virgin color. Much like components that are &#x201c;free of colorant&#x201d;, the materials utilized to form the cable component and/or any layers of a multi-layer cable component are not blended, compounded, or otherwise mixed with any colorants. However, a relatively small or limited amount of colorant may be applied to or formed on an outer surface of the cable component to facilitate identification of cable components, product identification, standards compliance, etc. For example, limited amounts of colorant may be formed on one or more internal cable components (e.g., twisted pair insulation, a separator, etc.) to facilitate identification of the twisted pairs and/or identification of the individual conductors within one or more twisted pairs. As another example, limited amounts of colorant (e.g., a print string, etc.) may be formed on a cable jacket to provide a customer reasonable required identification information for the cable, such as a product name and/or compliance information for one or more applicable cable standards. For purposes of this disclosure, a cable component that includes &#x201c;limited colorant&#x201d; may have colorant formed or applied to five percent (5.0%) or less of the surface area of an outer surface of the cable component. In this regard, valuable identification information may be provided while limiting an amount of relatively harmful and/or environmentally impactful materials incorporated into the cable. In other embodiments, a cable component that includes &#x201c;limited colorant&#x201d; may have colorant formed or applied to ten percent (10.0%) or less, fifteen percent (15.0%) or less, of twenty percent (20.0%) or less of the surface area of an outer surface of the cable component.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For purposes of this disclosure, the term &#x201c;physical indicia&#x201d; means any suitable surface variations or other suitable identifiers utilized to visually and/or tactilely identify or distinguish between a plurality of twisted pairs incorporated into a cable and/or to identify or distinguish between the individual conductors of one or more of the plurality of twisted pairs. According to an aspect of the disclosure, the physical indicia may be formed or incorporated into a cable without the use of colorant or with only limited colorant. Additionally, the physical indicia allow twisted pairs and/or individual twisted pair conductors to be identified without the conventional use of colored insulation (i.e., insulation that is compounded with a colorant or coated with a colorant). As a result, cables may be formed that have reduced colorant, that include approximately zero colorant, or that are completely free of colorant. These cables may have reduced environmental impact and potentially lower cost relative to conventional cables while still permitting proper identification of twisted pairs and/or individual conductors.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to an aspect of the disclosure, physical indicia may optionally be provided in order to facilitate identification of each of the plurality of twisted pairs in a cable. In certain embodiments, separate physical indicia corresponding to each of a plurality of twisted pairs may be provided. In other embodiments, physical indicia for a subset of the plurality of twisted pairs may be provided so long as identification of the remaining twisted pairs (i.e., the twisted pairs that do not have associated physical indicia) can be determined or derived. As an example, with a cable having four twisted pairs, physical indicia may be provided for at least two of the four twisted pairs. Identification of two pairs will permit a technician or installer to identify the remaining two twisted pairs based on their positions relative to the two pairs having associated physical indicia.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A wide variety of suitable types of physical indicia may be incorporated into a cable. These physical indicia may be formed on a wide variety of suitable cable components. Examples of suitable physical indicia that may be incorporated into a cable component include, but are not limited to: (i) surface variations formed on an outer surface of the cable component, such as raised portions (e.g., bumps, ridges, raised alphanumeric characters, raised symbols, embossing, etc.), indentions or indented portions (e.g., divots, grooves, indented alphanumeric characters, indented symbols, impressions, etc.), and/or texturing; (ii) removed portions from a surface of a cable component, such as gaps or holes formed through a cable component or portion of a cable component; and/or (iii) indicia that include limited colorant formed on an outer surface of a cable component. In the event that physical indicia include the use of limited colorant, the physical indicia may be formed from either a single colorant or from a plurality of different colorants. Additionally, physical indicia may be formed or positioned on any suitable components or combination of components within a cable. In various embodiments, physical indicia may be formed on the insulation of two or more twisted pairs, on a separator positioned between two or more twisted pairs, on one or more shield layers (e.g., individual shield layers formed around twisted pairs, etc.), and/or on dielectric separators positioned between the individual conductors of twisted pairs. Non-limiting examples of various physical indicia are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with example cable components on which the physical indicia may be formed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A wide variety of suitable methods or techniques may be utilized to form physical indicia as desired in various embodiments. In certain embodiments, physical indicia may be formed via extrusion when a cable component (e.g., twisted pair insulation, a separator, etc.) is formed.

For example, a surface of a cable component may be punched, stamped, impressed, or cut in order to form one or more physical indicia. In yet other embodiments, physical indicia may be formed by applying limited amounts of one or more colorants to a cable component via any suitable techniques, such as printing, spraying, etc.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In certain embodiments, a twisted pair communication cable may include a plurality of twisted pairs that are positioned within a cable core defined by an outer jacket.

Additionally, in certain embodiments, the cable may be formed to be completely free of colorant. In other words, no colorant is incorporated into any of the components of the cable. In other embodiments, the internal components of the cable positioned within the cable core (e.g., the twisted pairs, a separator, one or more shield layers, the dielectric separators etc.) may be free of colorant, and the jacket may include limited colorant. In other words, the jacket may be formed from one or more polymeric materials that are not blended or compounded with any colorant, and only limited colorant may be utilized on an outer surface of the jacket to provide required or necessary product identification, standards compliance, and/or other information. As desired, one or more physical indicia that are free of colorant may be incorporated into the cable. For example, physical indicia may optionally be formed on twisted pair insulation, a separator, two or more shield layers, and/or two or more dielectric separators as described herein. In other embodiments, the cable may be formed without any physical indicia that identify the twisted pairs and/or individual conductors within the twisted pairs.

Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> are cross-sectional views of example cables <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> that may be formed with reduced, colorant, minimal colorant, or to be free of colorant, according to illustrative embodiments of the disclosure. The illustrated example cables <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> have different combinations of internal components. For example, various twisted pair communication cables may include a separator, any number of suitable shield layers (e.g., individual shield layers, an overall shield, etc.), dielectric separators, positioned between the individual conductors of one or more twisted pairs, etc. A wide variety of other suitable cable constructions having other combinations of internal components may be formed in addition to the illustrated example cables. Further, according to an aspect of the disclosure, any number of internal cable components may include physical indicia that facilitate identification of the twisted pairs incorporated into a cable and/or the individual conductors of the twisted pairs while allowing colorant in the cable to be eliminated, reduced, or minimized.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, the example cables <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> are illustrated as twisted pair communication cables. However, other types of cables may be formed having reduced colorant and physical indicia to facilitate identification of transmission media. These cables may include any suitable transmission media including but not limited to, one or more optical fibers, one or more coaxial cables, one or more power conductors, one or more electrical conductors, etc. Additionally, in certain embodiments, a cable may be formed as a hybrid cable that includes a plurality of different types of transmission media. For example, a cable may include a combination of twisted pairs and other transmission media (e.g., optical fibers, etc.). Additionally, cables formed in accordance with the present disclosure may be utilized in a wide variety of suitable operating environments. For example, embodiments of the disclosure may be utilized in association with horizontal cables, vertical cables, flexible cables, equipment cords, cross-connect cords, plenum cables, riser cables, or any other appropriate types of cables.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a cross-section of a first example cable <b>100</b> that may be formed with reduced, minimal, or no colorant is illustrated. The cable <b>100</b> may include a plurality of twisted pairs of individually insulated conductors <b>105</b>A-D, and an outer jacket <b>110</b> may be formed around the plurality of twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D. As desired in various embodiments, the cable <b>100</b> may additionally include a separator positioned between two or more of the plurality of twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D, one or more suitable shield layers, and/or any other suitable internal components.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Any number of twisted pairs may be utilized as desired in the cable <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cable <b>100</b> may include four twisted pairs <b>105</b>A, <b>105</b>B, <b>105</b>C, <b>105</b>D. Each twisted pair (referred to generally as twisted pair <b>105</b>) may include two electrical conductors, each covered with respective insulation. The electrical conductors of a twisted pair <b>105</b> may be formed from any suitable electrically conductive material, such as copper, aluminum, silver, annealed copper, gold, a conductive alloy, etc. In certain embodiments, one or more electrical conductors may also be coated with another material (e.g., tinned copper, etc.) Additionally, the electrical conductors may have any suitable diameter, gauge, and/or other dimensions. Further, each of the electrical conductors may be formed as either a solid conductor or as a conductor that includes a plurality of conductive strands that are twisted together.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The twisted pair insulation may include any suitable dielectric materials and/or combination of materials. Examples of suitable dielectric materials include, but are not limited to, one or more polymeric materials, one or more polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, etc.), one or more fluoropolymers (e.g., fluorinated ethylene propylene (&#x201c;FEP&#x201d;), melt processable fluoropolymers, MFA, PFA, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (&#x201c;ETFE&#x201d;), ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene (&#x201c;ECTFE&#x201d;), etc.), one or more polyesters, polyvinyl chloride (&#x201c;PVC&#x201d;), one or more flame retardant olefins, a low smoke zero halogen (&#x201c;LSZH&#x201d;) material, etc.), nylon, polyurethane, neoprene, cholorosulphonated polyethylene, flame retardant PVC, low temperature oil resistant PVC, flame retardant polyurethane, flexible PVC, or a combination of any of the above materials. In various embodiments, twisted pair insulation may be formed from one or multiple layers of insulation material. A layer of insulation may be formed as solid insulation, unfoamed insulation, foamed insulation, or other suitable insulation. As desired, combinations of different types of insulation may be utilized. For example, a foamed insulation layer may be covered with a solid foam skin layer. As desired with foamed insulation, different foaming levels may be utilized for different twisted pairs in accordance with twist lay length to assist in balancing propagation delays between the twisted pairs. Additionally, the insulation may be formed with any suitable thickness, inner diameter, outer diameter, and/or other dimensions. As desired in certain embodiments, insulation may additionally include a wide variety of other materials, such as filler materials, smoke suppressant materials, flame retardant materials, etc.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to an aspect of the disclosure, the twisted pair insulation may be extruded, foamed, or otherwise formed around the conductors without any colorant being blended, compounded, or otherwise mixed with the one or more polymeric materials utilized to form the insulation and/or any layers of the insulation. In other words, one or more polymeric materials may be extruded or otherwise formed around the conductors with their natural color. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the twisted pair insulation may be &#x201c;free of colorant&#x201d; with no colorant formed on an outer surface of the insulation. In other embodiments, the twisted pair insulation may be formed with &#x201c;limited colorant&#x201d; on its outer surface.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain embodiments, the insulation utilized in each of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D may be formed from similar materials. For example, in a plenum cable, each of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D may include FEP insulation. In other embodiments, at least two of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D may utilize different insulation materials or combinations of materials. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the insulation utilized on the two individual conductors of a twisted pair <b>105</b> may be formed from the same material. In other embodiments, the two individual conductors that make up a twisted pair <b>105</b> may utilize different insulation materials. These different materials may include different polymeric materials or different types of the same or similar polymeric materials. In certain embodiments, a first conductor in a twisted pair <b>105</b> may be insulated with a first polymeric material, and a second conductor in the twisted pair <b>105</b> may be insulated with a second polymeric material different than the first polymeric material. For example, a first conductor may be insulated with FEP, and a second conductor may be insulated with a second polymeric material different from FEP. As another example, a first conductor may be insulated with a first FEP material, and a second conductor may be insulated with a second FEP material different than the first FEP material. In certain embodiments, even in their natural or uncolored states, the different polymeric materials utilized within a twisted pair <b>105</b> (i.e., the first and second polymeric materials) may be visually distinguishable from one another. For example, two different polymeric material or two different FEP materials may be visually distinguishable from one another. The visual differences between the two materials may facilitate identification of the individual conductors of a twisted pair <b>105</b>. Additionally, to the extent that different materials are utilized as insulation for the individual conductors of a twisted pair <b>105</b>, the cable design may be optimized in order to account for electrical performance differences between the different materials. For example, the different materials may be formed with different thicknesses, foam rates, or other dimensions in order to balance electrical performance.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each twisted pair <b>105</b> can carry data or some other form of information, for example in a range of about one to ten Giga bits per second (&#x201c;Gbps&#x201d;) or other suitable data rates, whether higher or lower. In certain embodiments, each twisted pair <b>105</b> supports data transmission of about two and one-half Gbps (e.g. nominally two and one-half Gbps), with the cable <b>100</b> supporting about ten Gbps (e.g. nominally ten Gbps). In certain embodiments, each twisted pair <b>105</b> supports data transmission of up to about ten Gbps (e.g. nominally ten Gbps), with the cable <b>100</b> supporting about forty Gbps (e.g. nominally forty Gbps).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each twisted pair <b>105</b> may also be formed with any suitable twist lay. In certain embodiments, each of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D may be formed with similar or approximately equal twist lays. In other embodiments, a desired number of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D may be formed with different respective twist lays. For example, each of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D may have a different twist lay. The different twist lays may function to reduce crosstalk between the twisted pairs, and a wide variety of suitable twist lay configurations may be utilized. In certain embodiments, the respective twist lays for the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D may be selected, calculated, or determined in order to result in a cable <b>100</b> that satisfies one or more standards and/or electrical requirements. For example, twist lays may be selected such that the cable <b>100</b> satisfies one or more electrical requirements of a Category 5, Category 5e, Category 6, Category 6A, or other suitable standard. Twist lays may also be selected in order to satisfy a wide variety of other electrical requirements as desired in various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In certain embodiments, the differences between twist lays of twisted pairs that are circumferentially adjacent one another (for example the twisted pair <b>105</b>A and the twisted pair <b>105</b>B) may be greater than the differences between twist lays of twisted pairs that are diagonal from one another (for example the twisted pair <b>105</b>A and the twisted pair <b>105</b>C). As a result of having similar twist lays, the twisted pairs that are diagonally disposed can be more susceptible to crosstalk issues than the twisted pairs that are circumferentially adjacent; however, the additional distance between the diagonally disposed pairs may limit the crosstalk. Thus, the different twist lays and arrangements of the pairs can help reduce crosstalk among the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D. As desired, the plurality of twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D may be twisted together with an overall twist or bunch. Any suitable overall twist lay or bunch lay may be utilized. Further, in certain embodiments, each of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D may be twisted in the same direction (e.g., clockwise, counterclockwise, etc.). In other embodiments, at least two of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D may be twisted in opposite directions. Additionally, an overall twist may be formed in any suitable direction. Indeed, a wide variety of suitable twist lays and twist directions may be utilized as desired in various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As desired in certain embodiments, one or more suitable bindings or wraps may be wrapped or otherwise formed around the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D once they are twisted together. Additionally, in certain embodiments, multiple grouping of twisted pairs may be incorporated into a cable. As desired, each grouping may be twisted, bundled, and/or bound together. Further, in certain embodiments, the multiple groupings may be twisted, bundled, or bound together.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In certain embodiments, physical indicia may be selectively formed on the respective outer surfaces of the insulation of two or more of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D. Respective physical indicia may be formed on any desired number of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D to facilitate identification of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D and/or the individual conductors of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D. In an example cable <b>100</b> that includes four twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D, physical indicia may be formed on two, three, or four of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D for identification purposes. If at least two of the twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D are identified, a technician or installer may be able to determine the identities of the remaining twisted pairs <b>105</b>A-D. In the event that a cable <b>100</b> includes more or less than four twisted pairs, physical indicia may be formed on any suitable number of the twisted pairs for identification purposes. For example, in a two pair cable, physical indicia may be formed on at least one pair. As another example, in a cable with more than four pairs, physical indicia may be formed on at least two pairs. The physical indicia may facilitate, at a minimum, identification of two twisted pairs and identification of the arrangement of the twisted pairs (e.g., identification of two pairs and a direction in which the twisted pairs are arranged, etc.) such that the identities of the remaining pairs may be determined.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Within a given twisted pair <b>105</b>, physical indicia may be formed on the insulation of one or both of the individual conductors of the twisted pair <b>105</b>. The physical indicia may facilitate identification of the twisted pair <b>105</b> and/or identification of the individual conductors included in the twisted pair <b>105</b>. Conventionally, twisted pairs incorporated into a cable are color-coded such that one conductor has a main color (e.g., blue, orange, green, brown, etc.) and the other conductor is either white, has a white stripe in combination with the main color, or is another shade of the main color (e.g., light blue, etc.). In an example four pair cable <b>100</b>, physical indicia may be formed on either the conductors that correspond to conventional main color conductors or on the conductors that correspond to conventional white conductors, thereby facilitating visual (and/or tactile) identification of the two conductors. In other example embodiments, different physical indicia may be formed on both conductors of the various twisted pairs. In yet other example embodiments, physical indicia may be formed on a subset of the pairs of a cable to facilitate pair identification, and a different technique (e.g., visually distinguishable uncolored insulation materials, etc.) may be utilized to facilitate identification of individual conductors.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additionally, physical indicia may be selectively formed at a wide variety of suitable locations along an outer periphery of a cable component, such as twisted pair insulation. In certain embodiments, physical indicia may be formed on an entire outer surface of a cable component. For example, a cable component (e.g., the insulation of a twisted pair conductor, etc.) may be textured on its entire outer surface. In other embodiments, physical indicia may be formed on a portion of an outer surface of a cable component. In certain embodiments, physical indicia may be continuous along a longitudinal length of a cable component. For example, a portion of a cable component (e.g., a prong or fin of a separator, etc.) may be textured continuously along a longitudinal length. As another example, one or more longitudinally continuous ridges or grooves may be formed on an outer surface of a cable component. As yet another example, lines or other physical indicia formed with limited colorant may be longitudinally continuous.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In other embodiments, physical indicia may be formed at longitudinally spaced locations along a longitudinal length of a cable component. For example, longitudinally spaced sections of an outer surface of a cable component may be textured. As another example, portions of ridges, grooves, or lines using limited colorant may be formed at longitudinally spaced locations with gaps between the spaced portions or sections. As another example, indentions, divots, alphanumeric characters, symbols, or indicia formed with limited colorant may be positioned at longitudinally spaced locations along a longitudinal length of a cable component. As yet another example, portions of a surface of a cable component may be selectively removed at longitudinally spaced locations in order to form physical indicia. Indeed, a wide variety of suitable configurations of physical indicia may be utilized.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the event that physical indicia are formed at longitudinally spaced locations, a wide variety of suitable gaps or spacings in the longitudinal direction may be positioned between adjacent physical indicia. Examples of suitable gaps include, but are not limited to, approximately 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.9, or 1.0 meters, a gap included in a range between any two of the above values, or a gap included in a range bounded on either a minimum or maximum end by one of the above values. In certain embodiments, the gaps or spacings may be selected to facilitate a technician being able to visually and/or tactilely identify the twisted pairs during cable installation without having to strip an undesirable amount of the cable. In certain embodiments, the gaps or spacings between longitudinally spaced physical indicia may have similar lengths or be arranged in accordance with a pattern. In other embodiments, the gaps or spacings may be arranged in a random or pseudo-random manner.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Additionally, the individual physical indicia or sections of physical indicia (e.g., alphanumeric characters, symbols, dots, series of surface variations, sections of ridges or lines, etc.) that are longitudinally spaced from one another may each be formed with any suitable longitudinal length. For example, physical indicia may have longitudinal lengths of approximately, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, or 2.0 meters, a length included in a range between any two of the above values, or a length included in a range bounded on either a minimum or maximum end by one of the above values. In certain embodiments, a plurality of physical indicia selectively formed on a cable component may have similar longitudinal lengths, such as longitudinal lengths arranged in accordance with a pattern. In other embodiments, at least two physical indicia formed on a cable component may have different longitudinal lengths. As desired, longitudinal lengths may be arranged in a random or pseudo-random manner.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Physical indicia can occupy any suitable percentage of the surface area of a cable component's outer surface. As set forth above, certain physical indicia may occupy an entire outer surface of cable component. Other physical indicia may occupy less than the entire outer surface.

In yet other embodiments, a surface of side on which physical indicia are formed (e.g., physical indicia formed with limited colorant, surface variations, etc.) may be utilized to identify individual conductors of a twisted pair.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">As desired in various embodiments, any suitable combination of physical indicia illustrated and/or described herein for various cable components may be utilized. For example, a cable component (e.g., twisted pair insulation, a separator, etc.) may utilize a combination of raised, indented, textured, limited colorant, and/or other suitable physical indicia. Additionally, any suitable combination of cable components may include respective physical indicia as desired in various embodiments. The various cable components and associated physical indicia illustrated herein are provided by way of non-limiting example only.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram <b>1800</b> of an example cable <b>1805</b> and an associated testing device that may be utilized in conjunction with the cable in order to facilitate identification of twisted pairs and/or individual conductors within the twisted pairs.
