Specifically, the syringe with safety mechanism may be constructed such that the needle cover (outer sleeve) can be displaced (slid) toward the needle relatively with respect to the syringe as far as a protection position where the needle is surrounded, after use of the syringe. When the needle cover is slid to the protection position and thereafter the needle cover returns to a use position where the needle is exposed, however, inadvertent prick or the like may occur. In addition, if the needle cover is displaced toward the protection position due to vibration during transport or the like before use, that is, before removal of the needle cap, it becomes difficult to remove the needle cap at the time of use.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a syringe with safety mechanism capable of suppressing displacement of a needle cover from a protection position to a use position.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A syringe with safety mechanism according to one aspect of this invention includes a syringe, a needle connected to a tip end portion of the syringe, a holder fixed to the syringe, and a needle cover displaceable relatively with respect to the syringe along an axial direction of the syringe from a use position where the needle is exposed toward a protection position where the needle is surrounded. The holder includes a locking portion that locks the needle cover at the use position from a radially inner side of the needle cover to hold the needle cover at the use position and locks the needle cover at the protection position from the radially inner side to hold the needle cover at the protection position. At least one member of the holder and the needle cover includes a protruding portion that protrudes toward the other member of the holder and the needle cover and the other member includes a restriction portion that abuts on the protruding portion to restrict relative displacement of the needle cover with respect to the syringe along the axial direction of the syringe from the protection position toward the use position.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to this invention, a syringe with safety mechanism capable of suppressing displacement of a needle cover from a protection position to a use position can be provided.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a syringe with safety mechanism in one embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a state where a cap has been removed from the syringe with safety mechanism shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a state where a needle cover is located at a protection position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view in a state where a guide protrusion abuts on an abutment surface.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the syringe with safety mechanism shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a state where the cap has been removed as compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a state of slight displacement toward a needle cover protection position as compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a state where the needle cover is located at the protection position.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view of a holder.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view along the line X-X shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view along the line XI-XI shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a perspective view of the holder and the needle cover in a state where the needle cover is located at a use position.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view along the line XIII-XIII in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a state of slight displacement of the needle cover toward the protection position from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a perspective view of the holder and the needle cover in a state where the needle cover is located at the protection position.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a state of displacement of the needle cover toward the use position along an axial direction from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An embodiment of this invention will be described with reference to the drawings.
