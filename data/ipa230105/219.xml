The band length can therefore be changed by pushing the second band <b>12</b> toward the buckle cover <b>40</b> or pulling the second band <b>12</b> from the buckle cover <b>40</b> to cause the slide plate <b>50</b> to slide. The band length can thus be readily adjusted with no button operation.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Furthermore, since the buckle <b>1</b> is formed of a small number of parts, the buckle <b>1</b> can be readily assembled, and the cost of the buckle <b>1</b> can be reduced.

The first facing surface <b>631</b> and the second facing surface <b>632</b>, which face the first perpendicular surface <b>531</b> and the second perpendicular surface <b>532</b>, respectively, are surfaces perpendicular to the sliding direction.

The movement of the slide plate <b>50</b> in the sliding direction can therefore be restricted. The slide plate <b>50</b> therefore does not move unless the swing arm <b>60</b> is rotated in the second rotational direction R<b>2</b> by using the outer plate <b>30</b> of the folding member <b>2</b>. That is, unintentional movement of the slide plate <b>50</b> and change in the band length can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the state in which the folding member <b>2</b> is folded and accommodated in the buckle cover <b>40</b>, when the front surface of the folding member <b>2</b>, that is, the front surfaces of the middle plate <b>20</b> and the outer plate <b>30</b> come into contact with the rear surface of the operation strip <b>64</b>, rotation of the swing arm <b>60</b> in the second rotational direction R<b>2</b> can be restricted, whereby the engagement of the engagement click <b>63</b> with the groove section <b>53</b> can be maintained. Therefore, with the band worn around the user's wrist or any other body site, the state in which the slide plate <b>50</b> is not allowed to slide, that is, the band length cannot be adjusted can be reliably maintained. An unintentional change in the length of the band worn on the user can therefore be reliably avoided.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Furthermore, when the folding member <b>2</b> comes into contact with the operation strip <b>64</b> of the swing arm <b>60</b>, rotation of the swing arm <b>60</b> in the second rotational direction R<b>2</b> can be restricted, whereby the simple structure can reliably restrict the rotation of the swing arm <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Furthermore, since the operation strip <b>64</b> can have a relatively large area, the contact area where the operation strip <b>64</b> comes into contact with the accommodated folding member <b>2</b> can also be a large area. The rotation of the swing arm <b>60</b> can therefore be reliably restricted by reliably causing the operation strip <b>64</b> to come into contact with the folding member <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The operation strip <b>64</b> is disposed on the side facing the torsional spring <b>65</b> and the rear surface of the lock member <b>80</b> and can hide the torsional spring <b>65</b> and the lock member <b>80</b>, whereby the appearance of the buckle <b>1</b> can be simplified when the user looks at the rear side thereof, and the aesthetic appeal thereof can be improved. Furthermore, when the user looks at the rear side of the buckle <b>1</b>, the engagement click <b>63</b> of the swing arm <b>60</b> is hidden behind the slide plate <b>50</b>, and the groove sections <b>53</b> of the slide plate <b>50</b> are also not exposed to the rear side of the buckle <b>1</b>. Also in this regard, the appearance of the rear side of the buckle <b>1</b> can be simplified, and the aesthetic appeal thereof can be improved.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The buckle <b>1</b> includes the torsional spring <b>65</b>, which urges the swing arm <b>60</b> in the first rotational direction R<b>1</b>. Rotating the outer plate <b>30</b> in the fourth rotational direction R<b>4</b> therefore causes the protruding sections <b>35</b> of the outer plate <b>30</b> that is in contact with the protrusions <b>641</b> of the operation strip <b>64</b> to be separate from the protrusions <b>641</b> of the operation strip <b>64</b>. The urging force produced by the torsional spring <b>65</b> then rotates the swing arm <b>60</b> in the first rotational direction R<b>1</b>, allowing the engagement click <b>63</b> to engage with a groove section <b>53</b>. The engagement click <b>63</b> is thus allowed to immediately engage with the groove section <b>53</b>. Therefore, there is no need to manually rotate the swing arm <b>60</b> in the first rotational direction R<b>1</b> by rotating the folding member <b>2</b>, and unintentional movement of the slide plate <b>50</b> during the rotation and the resultant change in the adjusted band length can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Since the folding member <b>2</b> is provided with the hook <b>21</b>, and the lock member <b>80</b>, which is moved to the locked position where the hook <b>21</b> is locked and to the unlocked position where the hook <b>21</b> is unlocked, is provided, moving the lock member <b>80</b> reliably achieves the state in which the folding member <b>2</b> is folded and accommodated in the buckle cover <b>40</b> so that the folding member <b>2</b> is locked, and the state in which the folding member <b>2</b> is detached from the buckle cover <b>40</b> so that the folding member <b>2</b> is unlocked. Since the lock member <b>80</b> moves to lock or unlock the hook <b>21</b>, durability of the buckle cover can be improved as compared, for example, with a case where the locked and unlocked states are achieved by deforming the sidewall sections or any other portion of the buckle cover.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The single torsional spring <b>65</b> serves as both the spring that urges the swing arm <b>60</b> in the first rotational direction R<b>1</b> and the spring that urges the lock member <b>80</b> to the locked position. Furthermore, the first button <b>71</b> and the second button <b>72</b> are urged in opposite directions when the lock member <b>80</b> is moved to the locked position. Therefore, the number of parts can be reduced, and the assembly can be readily performed, so that the cost can be reduced as compared with a case where separate springs urge the swing arm <b>60</b> and the lock member <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Since the guide grooves <b>44</b> are formed in the buckle cover <b>40</b>, and the plate section <b>51</b> of the slide plate <b>50</b> is inserted into the guide grooves <b>44</b>, the slide plate <b>50</b> moves stably without rattling. The band length can thus be adjusted in a stable, smooth manner. The guide grooves <b>44</b> are formed in the direction X<b>1</b> only to a position halfway along the first sidewall section <b>42</b> and the second sidewall section <b>43</b>, whereby the movement of the slide plate <b>50</b> in the direction X<b>1</b> can be restricted. The movement restriction prevents the slide plate <b>50</b> from colliding with and damaging the swing arm <b>60</b> and other components.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The slide plate <b>50</b> is provided with the movement restriction section <b>54</b>, which can restrict the movement of the slide plate <b>50</b> in the direction X<b>2</b>.

For example, the engagement click <b>63</b> may have a triangular cross-sectional shape, and the groove sections <b>53</b> may each have an inverted triangular cross-sectional shape in accordance with the shape of the engagement click <b>63</b>. The groove sections <b>53</b> and the engagement click <b>63</b> do not need to necessarily have the same cross-sectional shape. The cross-sectional shapes of the groove sections <b>53</b> and the engagement click <b>63</b> only need to allow the engagement click <b>63</b> to engage with the groove section <b>53</b> to restrict the movement of the slide plate <b>50</b> when the swing arm <b>60</b> is rotated in the first rotational direction R<b>1</b>. Furthermore, the cross-sectional shapes of the groove sections <b>53</b> and the engagement click <b>63</b> only need to allow the engagement click <b>63</b> to disengage from the groove section <b>53</b> to cancel the restriction of the movement of the slide plate <b>50</b> when the swing arm <b>60</b> is rotated in the second rotational direction R<b>2</b> by rotating the protruding sections <b>35</b> of the outer plate <b>30</b> with the protruding sections <b>35</b> pressed against the operation strip <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The configuration that restricts the rotation of the swing arm <b>60</b> in the second rotational direction R<b>2</b> is not limited to the configuration in which the front surface of the folding member <b>2</b> is caused to come into contact with the rear surface of the operation strip <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">For example, the rotation of the swing arm <b>60</b> may be restricted by providing the folding member <b>2</b> with a protruding element that comes into contact with the linkage wall <b>612</b> when the folding member <b>2</b> is accommodated in the buckle cover <b>40</b> to restrict the rotation of the swing arm <b>60</b> in the second rotational direction R<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The configuration that locks the folding member <b>2</b> is not limited to the configuration using the hook <b>21</b> including the click section <b>23</b> and the sliding lock member <b>80</b>. For example, the folding member <b>2</b> may be provided with a lock pin having a shaft section and an umbrella section located at the front end of the shaft section and having a diameter greater than that of the shaft section, and a button unit provided in the buckle cover <b>40</b> may be used to lock or unlock the lock pin. That is, the folding member <b>2</b> only needs to be locked with the folding member <b>2</b> accommodated in the buckle cover <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the embodiment described above, the torsional spring <b>65</b> produces the urging force for rotating the swing arm <b>60</b> and the urging force for moving the lock member <b>80</b> to the locked position, and the urging forces may instead be produced by separate springs. Furthermore, a spring that moves the lock member <b>80</b> to the locked position and a spring that urges the first button <b>71</b> and second button <b>72</b> in opposite directions may be provided separately.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Moreover, the spring that urges the swing arm <b>60</b> in the first rotational direction R<b>1</b> may not necessarily be provided. That is, the reason for this is that the swing arm <b>60</b> can be rotated in the first rotational direction R<b>1</b> to cause the engagement click <b>63</b> to engage with the groove section <b>53</b> by causing the folding member <b>2</b> to come into contact with the operation strip <b>64</b> when the folding member <b>2</b> is folded and accommodated in the buckle cover <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The slide plate <b>50</b> is not necessarily guided along the guide grooves <b>44</b> of the buckle cover <b>40</b>.

The slide plate has a plurality of groove sections provided along the longitudinal direction. The swing arm includes a base rotatably supported by the buckle cover, an arm section extending from the base toward the slide plate, an engagement click provided at the arm section and engageable with any of the groove sections of the slide plate, and an operation strip extending from the base toward the side opposite to the arm section. The swing arm is supported rotatably in a first rotational direction in which the engagement click engages with any of the groove sections and in a second rotational direction in which the engagement click separates from the groove section. The folding member includes a protruding section that comes into contact with the operation strip to rotate the swing arm in the second rotational direction when the folding member is rotated relative to the buckle cover.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure allows the folding member to be detached from the buckle cover and rotated to cause the protruding section of the folding member to come into contact with the operating strip of the swing arm. The swing arm can then be rotated in the second rotational direction to separate the engagement click of the swing arm from the groove section of the slide plate. The band length can therefore be changed by causing the slide plate to slide, whereby the band length can be readily adjusted without any button operation.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Furthermore, since the buckle is formed of a small number of parts, the buckle can be readily assembled, and the cost thereof can be reduced. Moreover, the band length can be adjusted in multiple steps in accordance with the number of groove sections by the distance between the groove sections in each step, whereby the band length can be readily fit the user's wrist or any other body site.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, it is preferable that the groove sections are each segmented by a first perpendicular surface and a second perpendicular surface perpendicular to the sliding direction of the slide plate, and that the engagement click has a first facing surface facing the first perpendicular surface and a second facing surface facing the second perpendicular surface with the engagement click engaged with the groove section.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the groove sections each have the first perpendicular surface and the second perpendicular surface perpendicular to the sliding direction of the slide plate, and the engagement click has the first facing surface and the second facing surface. The first facing surface and the second facing surface, which face the respective perpendicular surfaces, are surfaces perpendicular to the sliding direction. Therefore, when a force in the sliding direction acts on the slide plate with the engagement click engaging with any of the groove sections, the first perpendicular surface comes into contact with the first facing surface, or the second perpendicular surface comes into contact with the second facing surface, so that movement of the slide plate in the sliding direction is restricted. The slide plate therefore does not move unless the swing arm is rotated in the second rotational direction by the folding member. Unintentional movement of the slide plate that changes the band length can therefore be avoided.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure, it is preferable that the folding member restricts rotation of the swing arm in the second rotational direction with the folding member accommodated in the buckle cover.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure can restrict rotation of the swing arm in the second rotational direction with the folding member folded and accommodated in the buckle cover, for example, by causing the folding member to come into contact with the operating strip of the swing arm, whereby the engagement between the engagement click and the groove section can be maintained. Therefore, in the state in which the band is worn around the user's wrist or any other body site, the slide plate is not allowed to slide. That is, the state in which adjustment of the band length is not allowed can be reliably maintained, whereby a situation in which the band length changes when the band is worn can be reliably avoided.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Furthermore, for example, when the folding member comes into contact with the swing arm, rotation of the swing arm in the second rotational direction can be restricted, whereby the simple structure can reliably restrict the rotation of the swing arm.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">It is preferable that the buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure includes a spring that urges the swing arm in the first rotational direction.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The buckle according to the aspect of the present disclosure includes a spring that urges the swing arm in the first rotational direction. Therefore, when the folding member is rotated to cause the protruding section of the folding member in contact with the operating strip of the swing arm to separate from the operating strip, the urging force produced by the spring rotates the swing arm in the first rotational direction, and the engagement click can engage with the groove section. The engagement click can thus immediately engage with the groove section.
