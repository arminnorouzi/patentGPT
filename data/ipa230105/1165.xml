One example of such an ailment is Hydrocephalus, which results from excess Cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless body fluid produced primarily in the choroid plexus of the ventricles of the brain. This fluid acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. CSF is constantly being produced and reabsorbed within the body, with absorption occurring primarily in the arachnoid granulations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hydrocephalus (&#x201c;increased water on the brain&#x201d;) is a condition characterized by an imbalance between a relatively greater production rate of CSF and a relatively lesser absorption rate of said CSF such that there is an excess of CSF. The condition typically results in increased intracranial pressure which may be accompanied by a wide variety of secondary symptoms, including headaches, vomiting, nausea, papilledema, sleepiness, seizures and coma. Highly elevated intracranial pressure may even result in uncal or tonsillar herniation, and brain stem compression.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional treatments for hydrocephalus included drainage of excess CSF, with early treatments having been first described in the tenth century. More modern treatments include CSF diversion. Specifically, between 1898 and 1925, there were developed a variety of shunts for diverting CSF from the lumbar cistern to the peritoneum, and from the ventricle to the peritoneum, venous system, pleural cavity, and ureter. Early CSF diversion shunts had a high failure rate, due mainly to inadequate implant materials. Treatment success rates have since improved with the development of silastic tubing and artificial valves, as well as adjustable, self-regulating valves and antisiphon devices. Currently, CSF diversion remains the common treatment method with shunting of CSF from the ventricle to a variety of body cavities, most commonly the peritoneal cavity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, CSF diversion via current shunting methods remains suboptimal. The most common type of shunting (ventriculoperitoneal, or VP shunting) typically includes tunneling a considerable length of tubing under the skin and into the peritoneum. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one example of VP shunting, wherein a ventricular catheter is inserted into the ventricles and connected with a shunt valve that is in turn connected to a peritoneal catheter that is tunneled behind the ear and through the subcutaneous tissue of the neck and thorax and into the peritoneal cavity. This approach to CSF shunting presents risks of infection, occlusion, disconnection, migration, discomfort, pseudocyst formation, bowel injury and other issues. Furthermore, there remains a relatively high failure rate of such shunts, with an over 50% rate of shunt revision being observed in some series. See Reddy G K: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery and the incidence of shunt revision in adult patients with hemorrhage-related hydrocephalus, Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 114, 1211-1216, 2012; and Alleyne C H, Hassan M, Zabramski J M: The efficacy and cost of prophylactic and periprocedural antibiotics in patients with external ventricular drains, Neurosurgery 47:1124-1129, 2000.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for a method and device for removing excess CSF that presents reduced risks to the patient, as well as reduced risks of failure and shunt revision. Preferably, an improved method and device for removing CSF will also be applicable for safely removing other fluids from a patient, including other fluids that may accumulate in the brain or fluids that may accumulate in other portions of the body.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is inclusive of a method of removing excess fluid from the body and a device therefore. The method and device are applicable for use in removing excess CSF in the treatment of hydrocephalus, and the following disclosure describes the invention in the context of such a treatment, though the invention is not limited to that specific treatment and may be used in the treatment of a number of other ailments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method according to the present invention includes treating hydrocephalus by drawing excess CSF from the ventricles of a patient's brain in a bulk liquid form, and directing that excess CSF toward a subcutaneous space, where the excess CSF may be converted from the bulk liquid form into another form that is readily evaporated or diffused through the subject's skin. More specifically, a ventricular catheter inserted in the ventricles of the subject's brain may withdraw excess CSF and deliver it to an atomizer implanted in a subcutaneous space between the subject's skull and scalp. The atomizer disposes of CSF through fine atomization and vapor transport processes. More specifically, the atomizer converts CSF fed thereto a bulk liquid form to a low-velocity aerosol of ultrafine CSF droplets measuring below 10 microns in diameter. Due to their extremely small size, and reduced pressure in the subcutaneous cavity, the ultrafine CSF droplets evaporate at a body temperature of 37&#xb0; C. Remaining CSF vapors are disposed by absorption into a capillary bed and bloodstream of the subject and/or by diffusion through subject's scalp and skin as perspiration.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A device according to the present invention is in the form of a subcutaneous atomizer having a housing with an inlet that opens toward a reservoir for receiving CSF in a bulk liquid form and an outlet for outputting a CSF aerosol. An aerosol generator is provided in the housing for outputting a CSF aerosol and fluid conveyor is joined to the aerosol generator and extends into the reservoir for transferring bulk liquid CSF from the reservoir to the aerosol generator. The device is adapted for connection with a ventricular catheter in a manner to provide fluid communication with the housing inlet for feeding bulk liquid CSF to the housing reservoir. A power source and controller are provided for driving the fluid conveyor and/or aerosol generator to transfer bulk liquid CSF from the reservoir to the aerosol generator and to convert CSF from a bulk liquid into a low-velocity aerosol of ultrafine CSF droplets.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one example, the aerosol generator is a piezoelectric transducer having a perforated mesh, the perforated mesh being positioned at the outlet of the housing and dimensioned such that the CSF aerosol output therethrough comprises droplets having diameters measuring between about 0.5 to 10 microns, preferably between about 0.5 to 5 microns, and more preferably between about 0.5 to 2.5 microns. The fluid conveyor may be any structure or medium suitable for transferring bulk liquid CSF, examples of which may include a spring-loaded porous wick and a silica gel structure. The controller may include a power source, as well as a variable energy module adapted to vary power output to the aerosol generator between two or more power settings, which may include a zero-power setting for powering off the device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another example, the aerosol generator is a piezoelectric transducer that is inclusive of a metal plate in which low frequency surface vibrations can be induced. Construction of such a piezo-plate example may include positioning a metal plate at the center of a piezoelectric transducer similar to the mesh example; or by using a piezoelectric metal plate in place of the combined transducer and mesh in the mesh example. In this example, the metal plate may be made to vibrate sufficiently to generate an aerosol comprising droplets having diameters measuring between about 0.5 to 10 microns, preferably between about 0.5 to 5 microns, and more preferably between about 0.5 to 2.5 microns. As with the mesh example, the fluid conveyor may also be any structure or medium suitable for transferring bulk liquid CSF, including a spring-loaded porous wick or a silica gel structure; though in this example the fluid conveyor will be constructed to deliver bulk liquid CSF to a top surface of the metal plate, rather than through a mesh structure. As with the mesh example, the controller may include a power source, as well as a variable energy module adapted to vary power output to the aerosol generator between two or more power settings, which may include a zero-power setting for powering off the device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed. The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the invention; are incorporated in and constitute part of this specification; illustrate embodiments of the invention; and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further features and advantages of the invention can be ascertained from the following detailed description that is provided in connection with the drawings described below:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a conventional ventriculoperitoneal shunting assembly;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of an atomizer according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a first example of a cranial implant comprising the atomizer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows a second example of a cranial implant comprising the atomizer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an implanted atomizer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in a subject;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an implanted atomizer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communicating with a first external device;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows an implanted atomizer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> communicating with a second external device;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows transmitters of the second external device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic representation of a first prototype of an atomizer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> are schematics representations of comparative results from testing the first prototype, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> representing a greater absorption of aerosolized fluid, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> representing a greater evaporation and diffusion of aerosolized fluid;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic representation of a second prototype of an atomizer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a graphical representation of comparative results from testing the second prototype, showing percentages of aerosolized fluid diffused and percentages of aerosolized fluid absorbed;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a graphical representation of a relationship between power input and mist rate; and</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a graphical representation of a relationship between droplet evaporation and time.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The following disclosure discusses the present invention with reference to the examples shown in the accompanying drawings, though does not limit the invention to those examples.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention is inclusive of a novel method for treating hydrocephalus that is expected to obviate the need for tunneling a catheter through the subcutaneous tissues of a subject's neck, thorax and peritoneal cavity, and a device for effecting such treatment method.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The method includes drawing excess CSF from the ventricles of a patient's brain in a bulk liquid form, converting the CSF from the bulk liquid form into a low-velocity CSF aerosol of ultrafine CSF droplets, and disposing of the CSF aerosol through biological processes. Specifically, due to their extremely small size, and reduced pressure in the subcutaneous cavity, the ultrafine CSF droplets are evaporated at a body temperature of 37&#xb0; C. The remaining CSF vapors are absorbed into a capillary bed and bloodstream of the subject and/or by diffused through the subject's scalp and skin as perspiration.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The device includes a subcutaneous biological atomizer that effects CSF disposal through fine atomization and vapor transport processes. More specifically, the atomizer converts CSF fed thereto from a bulk liquid form into a low-velocity aerosol of ultrafine CSF droplets measuring below 10 microns in diameter. The atomizer includes a housing having an inlet for the introduction of CSF in a bulk liquid form and an outlet for the ejection of CSF in an aerosol form. The housing inlet is in fluid communication with a reservoir that supplies fluid to a fluid conveyor extending from the reservoir to an aerosol generator. A controller and power source are provided for effecting transfer of CSF along the fluid conveyor, from the reservoir to the aerosol generator, and driving the aerosol generator to convert CSF from a bulk liquid into an aerosol of ultrafine CSF droplets. The atomizer may be realized in a number of different constructions.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When implanted in a subject, as a cranial implant, the subcutaneous atomizer will be positioned against the skull and below the scalp of a subject, and joined with a fluid feed transport that is adapted for transporting CSF from the subject and into the atomizer. The CSF feed transport may be provided in the form of a ventricular catheter, with a first end inserted into the ventricles of the subject and a second end joined in fluid communication with the inlet of the atomizer housing.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows one example of an atomizer <b>1</b> that is inclusive of a housing <b>10</b> having an inlet <b>12</b> at one end and an outlet (covered by a perforated mesh <b>30</b>) at another end. A controller <b>14</b> is provided with a power source <b>15</b> and circuitry for generating and outputting electrical signals. In this example, an aerosol generator is provided in the form of a piezoelectric mesh transducer that includes a piezoelectric transducer <b>20</b> and a perforated mesh <b>30</b> that is adapted to vibrate in response to electrical signals received from the controller <b>14</b>. The perforated mesh <b>30</b> is positioned at the center of the transducer <b>20</b> to align with the housing outlet.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Though not shown in the figures, the housing may include an upper surface that covers the piezoelectric mesh transducer, and which contains a large number of holes therein for dispersal of the CSF aerosol ejected through the mesh <b>30</b>. The holes in the upper surface may be dispersed over an upper region of the upper surface so as to align with the perforations of the mesh <b>30</b> and enable a direct flow of ejected CSF aerosol from the mesh <b>30</b> through the holes in the upper surface and/or the holes in the upper surface may be dispersed around a periphery of the upper surface so as to be oriented at an angle relative to the perforations of the mesh <b>30</b> and thereby require a redirection of the ejected CSF aerosol so as to promote distribution of the CSF aerosol to a greater region outside the atomizer <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, a spring-loaded porous wick <b>40</b> is provided as a fluid conveyor that is joined with and extends downward from the mesh <b>30</b> and into a reservoir <b>50</b>. The wick <b>40</b> is dimensioned and positioned to extend into the reservoir <b>50</b> to such a length that a bottom end <b>42</b> thereof is substantially near to a bottom surface of the reservoir <b>50</b>. This arrangement of the wick <b>40</b> promotes submersion of the bottom end <b>42</b> below the surface of even a minimal volume of CSF in the reservoir <b>50</b>, thereby enabling processing of even minimal volumes of CSF. In this example the inlet <b>12</b> is provided adjacent to the reservoir <b>50</b> so as to enable immediate introduction of CSF feed directly to the reservoir <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another example, the aerosol generator may instead be constructed with a metal plate in which low frequency surface vibrations may be induced. Such a construction may be similar to that of the mesh construction, though replacing the mesh <b>30</b> at the center of the piezoelectric transducer <b>20</b> with a solid plate. Alternatively, both the transducer <b>20</b> and the mesh <b>30</b> may be replaced by a piezoelectric metal plate. Vibration of the metal plate produces waves on the free surface of the plate, with droplets breaking off from the wave crests when wave amplitude is above a critical value.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The metal plate example would require a variation to the fluid conveyor (e.g., the porous wick, silica gel, etc.) to deliver bulk liquid to a top surface of the metal plate&#x2014;e.g., by wrapping the wick <b>40</b> around an edge of the metal plate. In one construction of the metal plate example, the reservoir <b>50</b> may be constructed as a circular reservoir extending around a perimeter of the atomizer <b>1</b>, with the aerosol generator positioned at a center of the atomizer <b>1</b> and separated from the reservoir <b>50</b> by a vertically oriented dividing wall. The dividing wall may include an opening through which the fluid conveyor extends, with the fluid conveyor adapted to transport bulk liquid CSF from the reservoir <b>50</b> to the metal plate of the aerosol generator.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preference may be given to either the mesh or metal plate constructions. Regardless of the construction chosen, the aerosol generator is adapted to generate an aerosol comprising droplets having diameters measuring between about 0.5 to 10 microns, preferably between about 0.5 to 5 microns, and more preferably between about 0.5 to 2.5 microns&#x2014;be it by atomizing through a mesh structure, off a vibrating surface, or otherwise. However, as the desired size of droplets decreases, preference might be given to use of the metal plate example over the mesh example, as an increased possibility of pore clogging may be observed with reduced pore sizes that would be required for achieving smaller droplet sizes (e.g., 5 microns or less). Also, it is expected that atomization via surface vibrations with a metal plate example would require less energy than atomization by forcing fluid through pores in a mesh example, and that the surface vibrations of a metal plate example will likely produce relatively shorter plumes of lower momentum as compared to a mesh example.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The power source <b>15</b> may be provided in a number of different forms, including a power-storage source or a power-relay source. For example, the power source <b>15</b> may be a removable and replaceable battery-type power source. In such an example, the power source <b>15</b> will preferably be positioned behind a releasable panel in a surface of the housing <b>10</b>. This will permit the atomizer <b>1</b> to be implanted in a subject with the releasable panel oriented outwardly from the subject's skull so as to reside just below the scalp of the subject. In this way, if needed, the power source <b>15</b> may be removed and replaced with a new power source via a simple incision in the subject's scalp to expose the releasable panel, thereby enabling opening of the panel and removal and replacement of the power source <b>15</b>, followed by replacement of the releasable panel and stitching of the subject's scalp. In some examples, such a releasable panel may extend along an entire surface of the atomizer housing <b>10</b>, so as to permit access to all components within the housing <b>10</b>, thereby enabling repair and/or replacement of any component therein.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another example, the power source <b>15</b> may be a rechargeable power source adapted to convert energy from a source external to the atomizer <b>1</b>, and external to the implant, into an energy for storage and use within the atomizer <b>1</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the power source <b>15</b> may be an inductive power source adapted to convert electromagnetic signals received from an external device <b>200</b>, outside the subject, into electrical energy for storage within the atomizer <b>1</b>. In such examples, the rechargeable power source <b>15</b> and external device <b>200</b> will be synced for dedicated communication without interference by other unrelated devices and signals, and charging of the power source <b>15</b> will require that the external device <b>200</b> be brought into close proximity of the power source <b>15</b>. The external device <b>200</b> may be a wearable device, and may be affixed to a clothing item such as a headband or hat for positioning near to the implanted atomizer <b>1</b>. The external device <b>200</b> may instead be affixed to a non-wearable item that is regularly positioned near to the implanted atomizer <b>1</b>, such as a pillow or headrest of a seat.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another variation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the power source <b>15</b> may be adapted to convert electromagnetic signals received from an external device <b>200</b>&#x2032; that is provided in the form of a drive unit <b>210</b> that outputs electromagnetic signals through a transmitter <b>214</b> that is adapted for placement on the patient's skin, proximate to the implanted atomizer <b>1</b>. The transmitter <b>214</b> may be provided in the form of an electrode having an inner induction coil and an outer adhesive layer that enables repeated adherence and removal of the transmitter <b>214</b> directly to the patient's skin, proximate to the implanted atomizer <b>1</b>. The adhesive layer may include a gel, solution, and/or paste having conductive properties that promotes transmission of electromagnetic signals, such as those known to be used with Electroencephalography (EEG) probes. This variation of the external device may be desirable in instances where the subject wishes to use an external device without having to maintain the entire external device beside their head and/or without requiring use of an accessory piece of apparel to conceal the external device. By providing the external device <b>200</b>&#x2032; with a drive unit <b>210</b> in the form of a remote body that is separate from the transmitter <b>214</b>, the subject may wear the transmitter <b>214</b> without having to place the power source of the drive unit <b>210</b> beside their head. Also, if the implanted atomizer <b>1</b> is positioned behind the subject's ear, a subject wearing the external device <b>200</b>&#x2032; may, on casual inspection, appear merely as though they are wearing a common earphone joined to a telecommunications or other entertainment device, thereby providing the subject with an increased comfort in their outward appearance if choosing to use the external device in a public setting. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the transmitter <b>214</b> may be adapted for releasable connection with the transmission wire <b>212</b>, for example by male/female connectors <b>216</b>/<b>218</b>, so as to readily permit replacement of the transmitter <b>214</b> in the event the inner induction coil and/or outer adhesive layer break or otherwise become unusable. The drive unit <b>210</b> may also be adapted for releasable connection with the transmission wire <b>212</b>, for example by male/female connectors, so as to readily permit replacement of the transmission wire <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another example, the rechargeable power source <b>15</b> may be a kinetically rechargeable power source adapted to convert kinetic energy from the subject's movements (e.g., walking, head movements, etc.) into electrical energy. As another example, the rechargeable power source <b>15</b> may be a solar-cell rechargeable power source adapted to convert light energy (e.g., natural or artificial light rays) into electrical energy. In examples employing a solar-cell rechargeable power source, an outer surface of the atomizer housing <b>10</b> may be made to incorporate photovoltaic cells, and the atomizer <b>1</b> may be implanted such that the photovoltaic cells protrude through the scalp or reside at a minimal subcutaneous depth below the scalp, so as to promote the capture of light energy that penetrates an outer layer of the scalp.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In yet further examples, the power source <b>15</b> may be provided as a power relay source adapted to receive and relay energy from an external power source, without requiring any internal storage of energy within the atomizer <b>1</b>. For example, a power relay source may be provided in the form of a transducer adapted to convert energy from a source external to the atomizer <b>1</b> into an energy for immediate transmittal to components of the atomizer <b>1</b>. Such a power relay source may be provided with similar constructions as previously discussed relative to rechargeable type power sources, with the relay of power from the power source <b>15</b> requiring an external device <b>200</b>/<b>200</b>&#x2032; be brought into close proximity of the power source <b>15</b>, though without the power source acting to storing energy within the atomizer <b>1</b>. For example, the power source <b>15</b> may be an inductive energy transducer (e.g., a Hall sensor) adapted to convert an electromagnetic signal received from an external device <b>200</b>/<b>200</b>&#x2032;, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>A</figref>, into electrical energy that is immediately output for driving one or more components of the atomizer <b>1</b>. In some examples, a power-relay source may be incorporated directly into one or more components of the atomizer <b>1</b>, without need for a separate, independent power source. For example, in a construction such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the piezoelectric transducer <b>20</b> of the aerosol generator could be adapted as a piezoelectric crystal having a specific resonance frequency such that the transducer <b>20</b> may directly receive and convert energy signals from an external device <b>200</b>/<b>200</b>&#x2032; that is adapted to output an electromagnetic signal at the specific resonance frequency. In such an example, the atomizer <b>1</b> may be constructed without need of a separate power source <b>15</b>, which may either be omitted from the device or provided as a back-up redundancy. It is also contemplated that a power relay source may be provided in the form of a kinetic energy transducer or a solar-energy transducer, similar to the discussions above relative to rechargeable type power sources, though without the need for storing energy within the atomizer <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The controller <b>14</b> provides signals to control the various components of the atomizer <b>1</b>, which may include outputting signals to control the fluid conveyor to effect transfer of CSF from the reservoir <b>50</b> to the aerosol generator and/or outputting signals to control the aerosol generator to effect conversion of CSF from a bulk liquid to an aerosol of ultrafine CSF droplets. One benefit of an atomizer <b>1</b> such as that shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is that the controller <b>14</b> need only transmit signals to the aerosol generator, which is provided in the form of a piezoelectric mesh transducer. Specifically, the controller <b>14</b> may output signals to effect vibration of the piezoelectric transducer <b>20</b>, which in turn will cause a pumping action in the spring-loaded wick <b>40</b> that is joined to the mesh <b>30</b> at the center of the transducer <b>20</b>, the pumping action being effective to convey CSF up the wick <b>40</b> and toward the mesh <b>30</b>. This simplifies the device by foregoing any need for the controller <b>14</b> to transmit signals to effect transfer of CSF along the fluid conveyor, as the aerosol generator is effectively operable to pull CSF through the fluid conveyor. Nonetheless, in other examples, a more sophisticated fluid conveyor may be employed and the controller <b>14</b> may operate to transmit signals to both the fluid conveyor and the aerosol generator for separately controlling the transfer of CSF along the fluid conveyor and the conversion of CSF at the aerosol generator. In examples where the fluid conveyor and the aerosol generator are controlled separately, it is preferable the controller <b>14</b> be further adapted to synchronize a transport rate of CSF along the fluid conveyor and a conversion rate of CSF at the aerosol generator so as to ensure a steady state operation of the atomizer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The controller <b>14</b> may further include a variable energy module <b>16</b> that is operable to vary the power output from the controller <b>14</b> to the one or more components controlled by the controller <b>14</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a variable energy module <b>16</b> may control the power output of the controller <b>14</b> to the transducer <b>20</b> between several different settings, including for example output voltages of 2.3 V DC, 3 V DC, and 5V DC at frequencies from approximately 110 kHz to approximately 120 kHz. When using a piezoelectric metal plate, the frequencies may range from approximately 40 kHz to approximately 120 kHz. The metal plate example is capable of generating aerosols at lower energy and frequency levels than the mesh example, though the droplets tend to shift to larger sizes at these lower levels. Droplets measuring approximately 10 microns or less are possible with the metal plate example at approximately 100 kHz. The variable energy input module <b>16</b> may be operable to change the power output in response to a user input and/or based on automated processing.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Non-limiting examples of constructions that may permit a user input to the variable energy module <b>16</b> may include: a knob on an external surface of the housing <b>10</b> that is adapted to protrude through the subject's skin, and which may be adjusted by manual rotation; a pressure switch on an external surface of the housing <b>10</b> that is adapted to reside under the subject's skin, and which may be adjusted by manual compressions applied to the subject's skin; and a wireless receiver contained within the housing <b>10</b>, and which is operable to receive signals from an external wireless transmitter. In examples employing a wireless receiver, the external transmitter for communicating therewith may be contained in an external device <b>200</b>/<b>200</b>&#x2032;, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>A</figref>, which may be provided in the form of a communications device dedicated solely to communicating with the receiver of a specifically synced atomizer <b>1</b> (e.g., a dedicated radio transmitting device); or which may be provided in the form of a general purpose communications device that is adaptable to a multitude of different uses, including uses not related to the atomizer <b>1</b>, though which is capable of syncing with the receiver of a specific atomizer <b>1</b> via a downloadable software application (e.g., an applications executing device, such as a smartphone, with a secure software application downloaded thereto).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A non-limiting examples construction in which the variable energy module <b>16</b> may operate to automatically change a power output of the controller <b>14</b> include the use of pre-programmed operational times, and the determination of CSF volume and volumetric changes within the reservoir <b>50</b>. Examples employing pre-programmed operational times may be beneficial for subjects that experienced heightened production levels of CSF, as such a condition may require regular intervals of CSF removal at predetermined rates. In examples where atomizer operation is automated based on determinations of CSF volume, there may be employed one or more sensors. As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the atomizer <b>1</b> may include one or more fluid sensors <b>17</b><i>a</i>-<b>17</b><i>c </i>positioned within the housing <b>10</b> and adapted for detecting one or more a fluid levels of CSF contained in the reservoir <b>50</b> and for outputting signals to the variable energy module <b>16</b> indicative of determined fluid levels. In such an example, the variable energy module <b>16</b> is operable to vary the power output of the controller <b>14</b> to correspond with changes in the determined volume of CSF within the reservoir <b>50</b>, which may correspond with a low fluid level indication from sensor <b>17</b><i>a</i>, an intermediate fluid level indication from sensor <b>17</b><i>b</i>, and a high fluid level indication from sensor <b>17</b><i>c</i>. The variable energy module <b>16</b> could then adjust the transport and conversion rates of CSF to correspond with a determined volume of CSF in the reservoir <b>50</b>, thereby enabling control of the atomizer <b>1</b> to correspond with variations of CSF production based on the subject's condition.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some examples a multitude of fluid sensors <b>17</b><i>a</i>-<b>17</b><i>c </i>may be arranged in varying positions and orientations the atomizer housing <b>10</b> to ensure adequate fluid level readings are obtained despite tilting of the atomizer <b>1</b> (e.g., as when a subject changes between standing and resting positions). For example, though the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows three sensors <b>17</b><i>a</i>-<b>17</b><i>c </i>positioned along a single vertical wall adjacent to the reservoir <b>50</b>, in other constructions there may be provided a number of fluid sensors positioned at the base surface of the reservoir <b>50</b>, while a number of fluid sensors are also positioned at a base surface of a first wall adjacent to the reservoir <b>50</b>, and further while a number of fluid sensors are further positioned at a base surface of a second wall adjacent to the reservoir <b>50</b>. Distribution of various sensors along a number of different walls of the housing <b>10</b> would facilitate accurate fluid level readings despite a tilting of the atomizer <b>1</b> in one direction or another&#x2014;the accuracy of these readings could be yet further enhanced by adapting the controller <b>14</b> to perform a comparative analysis of signals that are received concurrently from multiple sensors.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The sensors <b>17</b><i>a</i>-<b>17</b><i>c</i>, and the signals output to the variable energy module <b>16</b> therefrom, may also be used to synchronize a transport rate of CSF along the fluid conveyor and a conversion rate of CSF at the aerosol generator in examples where the fluid conveyor and the aerosol generator are controlled separately.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some examples, the variable energy module <b>16</b> may be adapted to vary the power output of the controller <b>14</b> based on both user input and detected fluid volume, thereby enabling a user to adjust the rate of CSF conversion and misting as desired, while also setting one or more thresholds as safeguards to ensure adequate CSF conversion and misting to prevent accumulation of excess CSF in the reservoir <b>50</b>. Both the user based and fluid level based controls may include a zero power setting such that the atomizer <b>1</b> may be powered down in response to either a user input or a determination that a CSF fluid level is below a predetermined threshold.

Within the airtight column <b>92</b>, joined to a bottom surface of the atomizer <b>91</b>, there was arranged a mist column <b>60</b>&#x2033; constructed from a cylindrical mesh having a cadaver skin sample wrapped therearound. At a bottom end of the mist column <b>60</b>&#x2033;, opposite the atomizer <b>91</b>, there was positioned a collecting cap <b>95</b>. In this second prototype the atomizer <b>91</b> was powered by a USB connection <b>96</b>, though any suitable power source could have been used, including a battery.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">Three separate tests were run with this second prototype. In each instance, the skin sample was weighed before being wrapped around the cylindrical mesh to construct the mist column <b>60</b>&#x2033;, and the atomizer <b>91</b> was weighed along with the water. Misting was performed for a continuous five minutes, during which time there was observed a fogginess forking on the airtight column <b>92</b>. This fogging is considered to have resulted from the vaporized mist diffusing through the skin sample and condensing on the inner surface of the airtight column <b>92</b>, and is considered to further support the conclusion that an aerosolized CSF mist will diffuse through a subject's skin as sweat or perspiration. After conclusion of the five minute trial period, weighing was made of the skin sample, the atomizer with water, and the collecting cap <b>95</b> with condensed water. From these measurements, there was the calculated the mass of water misted by the atomizer <b>91</b>, the mass of water absorbed in the skin sample, and the mass of water condensed in the collecting cap <b>95</b>. There was then further calculated the mass of water that diffused through the skin, which was calculated based on the difference between mass misted and the sum of the mass collected in the collecting cap <b>95</b> and the mass absorbed in the skin sample.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a graphical representation of the test results, showing the percentage of vapor that diffused through the skin sample and the percentage of vapor that was absorbed by the skin sample in each test of the second prototype. These results show that diffusion through the skin sample was the predominant mechanism of disposing of the water vapor, and suggest that diffusion will likewise be the predominant mechanism for disposing of CSF from a subject in the form of sweating/perspiration through the subject's skin. However, without being bound by theory, it is considered the absorption percentages observed in testing the second prototype might be relatively &#x201c;reduced&#x201d; due to the use of cadaver skin, as the use of dead tissues without blood circulation may be causing diffusion to play a more significant role, and greater absorption percentages might be realized with a real-life subject. It is also considered that the variations from test to test might be due to statistical variations in the experimental conditions and the sample skins.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a graphical representation showing a relationship between changes in mist rate with variations in input power (Watts) for a wireless cranial implant, as observed during testing of the second prototype. With recognition of such a relationship, it's possible to construct a cranial implant to have an adjustable mist rate by providing a user input for changing the mist rate, such as a power knob on an external transmitter. Alternatively, in a simplified form, a preferred mist rate may be determined for a particular subject's needs, and a cranial implant may be constructed operate under a preset power input for achieving the preferred mist rate for that subject's specific needs. In such a simplified construction, the controller may be adapted to switch the atomizer to a depowered state when it is determined that no fluid is being conveyed along the fluid conveyor (e.g., when a fluid sensor signals that the wick is in a dried state based on a charge conductivity of the wick).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows droplet evaporation, as calculated for a single droplet (approximation), using Professor Brian Spaulding's d<sup>2</sup>-law of evaporation. As can be seen, a droplet measuring below 10 microns in diameter takes approximately 0.01 seconds to evaporate, and a droplet measuring below 5 microns in diameter takes approximately a millisecond to evaporate. At temperatures approximating the human body, it is expected that a majority of CSF aerosol droplets ejected by an implanted atomizer may evaporate instantaneously and completely as they are ejected, with remaining vapor being absorbed in capillary bed and transported into the bloodstream and/or diffused through the subject's skin as perspiration.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">Although the present invention is described with reference to particular embodiments, it will be understood to those skilled in the art that the foregoing disclosure addresses exemplary embodiments only; that the scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments; and that the scope of the invention may encompass additional embodiments embracing various changes and modifications relative to the examples disclosed herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereto.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">Though the foregoing disclosure addresses examples of the method and device as applied to remove CSF in the treatment of hydrocephalus, methods and devices according to the present invention are not limited to those examples and may instead be used to remove other bodily fluids in effecting other treatments.
