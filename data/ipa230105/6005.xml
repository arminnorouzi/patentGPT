display.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic devices are released in various sizes according to their functions and user preferences, and technical research is being carried out to relatively increase the area of a display that displays a screen on the front surface (front side) of an electronic device in order to secure wide visibility and convenience of operation even if the electronic device has a fixed size. As the area of the display in the electronic device is relatively increased, a camera module or a sensor module disposed near an edge or an upper corner of the front surface of the electronic device may be disposed in a portion of a hole provided in the display. When an optical sensor (e.g., a camera module or a sensor module) disposed in the hole of the display is affected by light exposed by the display, the camera module or the sensor module may not function normally. In addition, a flare phenomenon may occur in the camera lens due to light incident through the periphery (edge) of the hole. In addition, it is necessary to prevent a boundary between the optical sensor disposed in the hole of the display and a plurality of panels disposed in the display from being visible. Therefore, in order to block the light exposed by the display, to prevent a flare phenomenon caused by external light, and to improve the aesthetics of the electronic device, a printed pattern (e.g., a black matrix (BM)) may be disposed on one surface of a plurality of layers of the display.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, the display may include a cover window for protecting the plurality of layers of the display. A bar-type display adopts tempered glass as a protective window. However, since the cover window of a flexible display requires flexibility, it is difficult to use non-flexible tempered glass as a material for the cover window of the flexible display. Therefore, research on the cover window of a flexible display is being carried out, and polyimide (PI) or ultra-thin glass (UTG) that is flexible while maintaining the existing tempered glass characteristic has been adopted as the cover window of a flexible display.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, in a flexible display including a cover window of, for example, polyimide or UTG, an adhesive having a flexible property (e.g., a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) or an optical clear adhesive (OCA)) may be disposed between a plurality of respective layers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the flexible display, a protective layer may be disposed above or above and below the cover window in order to protect the cover window of, for example, PI or UTG, and a printed pattern may be disposed on one surface of the protective layer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to the printed pattern disposed on one surface of the protective layer, a step as high as the height of the printed pattern may occur on the flexible display. The step occurring due to the printed pattern may cause a decrease in flatness (e.g., a value indicating flatness) of the flexible display, deformation of at least a portion of the flexible display, or deformation of the adhesive. As a result, when a camera function is executed by the user using the camera module or the sensor module disposed in a portion of the hole of the flexible display, local image quality deterioration may occur.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the disclosure provide an electronic device including a display wherein it is possible to prevent and/or reduce image quality from being deteriorated by a decrease in flatness of a display due to a printed pattern.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to various example embodiments of the disclosure, an electronic device may include: a housing, a display visible to the outside of the electronic device, wherein the display includes a plurality of layers at least one of which includes an opening area, an optical sensor at least a portion of which is disposed in the opening area, and a printed pattern disposed to correspond to the opening area and having a ring shape, wherein the printed pattern may be disposed on a top surface or a bottom surface of a first layer that does not include the opening area among the plurality of layers, and wherein a portion of the ring shape may have a first height, and a remaining portion of the ring shape may have a second height higher than the first height.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to various example embodiments of the disclosure, a display device may include: a layer structure including a plurality of layers, wherein at least one of the plurality of layers includes an opening area, an optical sensor disposed in at least a portion of the opening area, and a printed pattern disposed to correspond to the opening area and having a ring shape, wherein the printed pattern may be disposed on a top surface or a bottom surface of a first layer that does not include the opening area among the plurality of layers, and wherein a portion of the ring shape may have a first height, and a remaining portion of the ring shape may have a second height higher than the first height.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to various example embodiments, an image and/or a moving picture acquired using the camera module or the sensor module disposed in a portion of the opening area provided in the display can be made to have a uniform resolution as a whole without being deteriorated in image quality.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to various example embodiments, by arranging the printed pattern on one surface of the plurality of layers of the display, it is possible to prevent and/or reduce the flatness of the display from being deteriorated while achieving an effect of improving the aesthetics.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above and other aspects, features and advantages of certain embodiments of the present disclosure will be more apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a diagram illustrating an electronic device in an unfolded state according to various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a diagram illustrating the electronic device in a folded state according to various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the electronic device according to various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a display including a printed pattern taken along line A-A&#x2032;
