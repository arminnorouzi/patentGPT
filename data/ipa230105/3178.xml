application claims under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119(a) the benefit of priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0085212, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a fuel evaporation gas treatment system for a vehicle, and more particularly to a fuel evaporation gas treatment system for a vehicle capable of solving problems such as failure to satisfy evaporation gas regulations and generation of a fuel smell due to the inability to purge a fuel evaporation gas when a turbocharger is operated in a vehicle equipped with a turbocharger.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, the fuel system for a vehicle includes a fuel tank for storing fuel, a fuel pump module for supplying the fuel stored in the fuel tank to an engine, a fuel filter for removing foreign substances from the fuel supplied to the engine, and a fuel line for transferring fuel, including a fuel supply line and a fuel return line.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, the fuel system for a vehicle further includes a fuel evaporation gas treatment system for treating and controlling fuel evaporation gas (HC gas) generated in the fuel tank. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows the configuration of a fuel evaporation gas treatment system. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, reference numeral &#x2018;<b>1</b>&#x2019; denotes a fuel tank, reference numeral &#x2018;<b>2</b>&#x2019; denotes a fuel pump module installed in the fuel tank <b>1</b>, and reference numeral &#x2018;<b>3</b>&#x2019; denotes a filler neck assembly for injecting fuel into the fuel tank.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown therein, the fuel evaporation gas treatment system includes a canister <b>10</b> for adsorbing and collecting a fuel evaporation gas generated in the fuel tank <b>1</b>, an air filter <b>13</b> for removing foreign substances from the air sucked into the canister <b>10</b>, a canister close valve <b>12</b> for opening and closing a pipe (an ambient atmosphere line) <b>11</b> between the canister <b>10</b> and the air filter <b>13</b>, and a purge control solenoid valve (PCSV) <b>15</b> for opening and closing a pipe (a purge line) <b>14</b> between the canister <b>10</b> and the engine intake system <b>4</b> or adjusting the extent of opening of the pipe.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Describing the configuration thereof in more detail, a gas resulting from evaporation of fuel, that is, a fuel evaporation gas including fuel components such as hydrocarbon (HC) and the like, is generated in the fuel tank <b>1</b>. Accordingly, in order to prevent air pollution due to the fuel evaporation gas generated in the fuel tank <b>1</b>, a canister <b>10</b> for collecting and storing the fuel evaporation gas from the fuel tank is installed in the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The canister <b>10</b> is configured such that a case thereof is filled with an adsorbent material capable of adsorbing the fuel evaporation gas moved from the fuel tank <b>1</b>, and the adsorbent material that is widely used therefor is activated carbon. The activated carbon functions to adsorb fuel components, that is, hydrocarbons (HC) or the like, in the fuel evaporation gas introduced into the case of the canister <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The canister <b>10</b> adsorbs the fuel evaporation gas to the adsorbent material in the state in which the engine is stopped. Also, when the engine is run, the canister <b>10</b> desorbs the fuel evaporation gas adsorbed to the adsorbent material using the pressure of the air sucked from the outside (ambient atmosphere) to thus supply the desorbed gas together with the air to the engine intake system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The operation of sucking the collected fuel evaporation gas from the canister <b>10</b> into the engine is called a purge operation, and the gas that is sucked from the canister into the engine is called purge gas. The purge gas may be a gas in which fuel components such as hydrocarbons (HC) or the like desorbed from the adsorbent material of the canister and air are mixed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The PCSV <b>15</b> for controlling a purge operation is installed in the purge line <b>14</b>, which is the pipe connecting the canister <b>10</b> and the engine intake system <b>4</b>. The PCSV <b>15</b> is opened upon a purge operation while the engine is running. The fuel evaporation gas generated in the fuel tank <b>1</b> is collected in the canister <b>10</b>, purged to the engine intake system <b>4</b> through the PCSV <b>15</b> in an open state while the engine is running, and then burned in the engine.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The PCSV <b>15</b> is controlled by a control unit (not shown), for example, an engine control unit (ECU). The control unit controls opening or closing of the PCSV <b>15</b> (turns on/off the purge operation) or the extent of opening (gas flow rate) of the PCSV depending on the conditions under which the vehicle is being driven in order to control the fuel evaporation gas.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">More specifically, the canister <b>10</b> includes a case filled with an adsorbent material (e.g. activated carbon). The case includes a loading port <b>10</b><i>a </i>connected to the fuel tank <b>1</b> and configured to introduce the fuel evaporation gas from the fuel tank, a purge port <b>10</b><i>b </i>connected to the engine intake system <b>4</b> and configured to supply the fuel evaporation gas to the engine side, and an ambient atmosphere port <b>10</b><i>c </i>connected to the air filter (canister filter) <b>13</b> and configured to suck air from the ambient atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The loading port <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the canister <b>10</b> is connected to the fuel tank <b>1</b> through a loading line <b>16</b>, and the purge port <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the canister is connected to the engine intake system <b>4</b> through the purge line <b>14</b>. An ambient atmosphere line (vent line) <b>11</b>, which is the pipe connected to the air filter <b>13</b>, is connected to the ambient atmosphere port <b>10</b><i>c </i>of the canister.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A partition wall (not shown) is provided in the inner space of the case in order to partition a space in which the ambient atmosphere port <b>10</b><i>c </i>is located from a space in which the purge port <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the loading port <b>10</b><i>a </i>are located. Accordingly, while the fuel evaporation gas introduced from the fuel tank <b>1</b> through the loading port <b>10</b><i>a </i>passes along the inner space partitioned by the partition wall, fuel components, that is, hydrocarbons (HC), are adsorbed onto the adsorbent material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Also, when the PCSV <b>15</b> is opened by the control unit while the engine is running and the suction pressure, namely the engine negative pressure, acts on the inner space of the canister <b>10</b> through the purge port <b>10</b><i>b </i>from the engine intake system <b>4</b>, air is sucked through the air filter <b>13</b> and through the ambient atmosphere port <b>10</b><i>c</i>, and the gas desorbed from the adsorbent material by the air is discharged through the purge port <b>10</b><i>b </i>and sucked into the engine intake system <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this way, for the purge operation in which the fuel component such as hydrocarbon or the like is desorbed from the adsorbent material in the canister <b>10</b> and is then sucked into the engine intake system <b>4</b>, the engine negative pressure has to act on the canister <b>10</b> through the purge line <b>14</b> and the purge port <b>10</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Meanwhile, even when the vehicle is equipped with the fuel evaporation gas treatment system, a problem in which a fuel smell occurs in the vehicle occurs. Specifically, when the vehicle is stopped, the fuel evaporation gas (HC gas) is released to the outside, so the driver or passenger may detect a fuel smell. Such a fuel smell mainly occurs under hot and high conditions, and in particular, the driver or passenger may easily smell the fuel when the vehicle is stopped.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Under hot conditions in which the outdoor temperature is high, the transfer of external heat such as engine heat, exhaust heat, geothermal heat, etc. increases, thereby increasing the internal temperature of the fuel tank, and vapor pressure decreases under high conditions. Accordingly, the amount of fuel evaporation gas (HC) that is generated increases in the fuel tank, and when the amount of fuel evaporation gas that is generated increases, the collection capacity of the canister is exceeded, and thus the fuel evaporation gas may be discharged to the outside. Ultimately, the driver or the passenger may smell the fuel evaporation gas (fuel smell) released to the outside when the vehicle is stopped.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, in a vehicle equipped with a turbocharger, when the turbocharger is operated (supercharged), positive pressure, rather than negative pressure, is formed in the engine intake system, so the suction of fuel evaporation gas by the negative pressure does not occur, making it impossible to purge the fuel evaporation gas collected in the canister. As described above, when the fuel evaporation gas is not consumed in the engine due to impossibility of purging, the amount of the fuel evaporation gas present in the fuel tank may increase, and the likelihood of the amount of the fuel evaporation gas exceeding the collection capacity in the canister may increase.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Hence, the vehicle may fail to satisfy evaporation gas regulations under hot weather conditions with a high outdoor temperature, and a fuel smell may occur in the vehicle due to the release of the fuel evaporation gas to the outside. Accordingly, there is a need for a technology capable of alleviating problems due to the generation of the fuel smell.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Therefore, the present disclosure has been made keeping in mind the problems encountered in the related art, and an objective of the present disclosure is to provide a fuel evaporation gas treatment system for a vehicle capable of solving problems such as failure to satisfy evaporation gas regulations and generation of a fuel smell due to the inability to purge a fuel evaporation gas when a turbocharger is operated in a vehicle equipped with a turbocharger.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The objectives of the present disclosure are not limited to the foregoing, and objectives not

Ultimately, the fuel evaporation gas adsorbed in the canister <b>10</b> is sucked into the inner passage <b>142</b> of the ejector <b>140</b> through the recovery port <b>10</b><i>d</i>, the recovery line <b>17</b>, the suction port <b>112</b>, the suction hose <b>123</b>, the check valve <b>124</b>, and the suction inlet <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Also, the fuel evaporation gas sucked into the ejector <b>140</b> passes through the inner passage <b>142</b> of the ejector <b>140</b> together with the fuel as the driving fluid, and is discharged and recovered into the fuel tank <b>1</b> via the nozzle <b>145</b> of the ejector <b>140</b>. In this way, the ejector <b>140</b> acts as a kind of jet pump in a manner in which the fuel evaporation gas is sucked from the outside and is then transferred to the inside of the fuel tank <b>1</b>, in addition to generation of negative pressure therein using the fuel delivered by the fuel pump <b>120</b> as the driving fluid.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">On the other hand, when the pump control unit <b>160</b> outputs a control signal for closing the recovery control valve <b>150</b> so that the fuel, which is the driving fluid, is not supplied to the ejector <b>140</b>, the driving circuit unit performs control so that the current of the battery is not applied to the solenoid <b>151</b> in response to this control signal. Accordingly, the solenoid <b>151</b> is not electrically charged, and thus the plunger <b>152</b> descends downwards due to the elastic restoring force of the return spring <b>155</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the plunger <b>152</b> descends in this way, the valve body <b>154</b> closes the fuel passage of the ejector <b>140</b>. Even when the fuel pump <b>120</b> is operated, the fuel delivered by the fuel pump <b>120</b> is not supplied to the inner passage <b>142</b> of the ejector <b>140</b>, so the ejector <b>140</b> does not operate, and the fuel evaporation gas adsorbed in the canister <b>10</b> is not sucked into the ejector <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The configuration of the sub-purge system newly added in the fuel evaporation gas treatment system according to the embodiment of the present disclosure is specified above. Hereinafter, the control and operation of the sub-purge system are described in more detail.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref> show a fuel supply state and a purge operation state depending on whether or not a turbocharger is operated in the fuel evaporation gas treatment system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the turbocharger which is not operated and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the turbocharger which is operated.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref> show the state of movement of the fuel discharged from the fuel pump <b>120</b> through the 3-way connector <b>121</b> in the fuel evaporation gas treatment system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> showing the turbocharger which is not operated and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> showing the turbocharger which is operated.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a purge operation process in the fuel evaporation gas treatment system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>10</b> to <b>14</b></figref>, the fuel supply state, the purge operation state, and the purge operation process depending on whether or not the turbocharger is operated are described below.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">First, when predetermined conditions for operation of the turbocharger are satisfied, the engine control unit initiates control for operation of the turbocharger, and simultaneously transmits a turbocharger operation signal to the pump control unit <b>160</b>. Also, a flow rate signal representing a fuel flow rate required for the engine while the engine is running is generated and output from the engine control unit. Accordingly, the pump control unit <b>160</b> receives the turbocharger operation signal and the flow rate signal.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Then, the pump control unit <b>160</b> increases the duty value of the PWM signal for driving the pump motor by a predetermined amount in consideration of the rate at which fuel is to be supplied to the ejector <b>140</b>, in addition to the fuel flow rate required for the engine <b>7</b> during operation of the turbocharger. In the state of running of the engine in which the turbocharger is operated, fuel must be supplied both to the engine <b>7</b> and to the ejector <b>140</b>, so the duty value of the PWM signal for driving the pump motor is increased. Accordingly, the driving speed (rpm) of the fuel pump <b>120</b> increases compared to when the turbocharger is not operated, and ultimately, the fuel may be supplied at a flow rate obtained by combining the fuel flow rate required for the engine <b>7</b> and the predetermined rate at which fuel is to be supplied to the ejector <b>140</b>, by the fuel pump <b>120</b> (S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Also, in the state of operation of the turbocharger, the pump control unit <b>160</b> performs control so that the recovery control valve <b>150</b> is opened (S<b>13</b>). Specifically, the solenoid valve, which is the recovery control valve <b>150</b>, is turned on, and the pump control unit <b>160</b> generates and outputs a control signal for applying current to the solenoid <b>151</b>. When the current is applied to the solenoid <b>151</b> in this way, the plunger <b>152</b> of the solenoid valve is pulled upwards by the electromagnetic force of the solenoid <b>151</b> and ascends. As such, the inner passage of the inlet <b>143</b> and the inner passage (fuel passage) of the ejector <b>140</b> are opened while the valve body <b>154</b> ascends.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">When the solenoid valve, which is the recovery control valve <b>150</b>, is opened in this way, some of the fuel delivered by the fuel pump <b>120</b> is supplied as a driving fluid to the ejector <b>140</b>, so the ejector <b>140</b> is operated. As such, the remaining fuel except for some fuel supplied to the ejector <b>140</b>, among the fuel delivered by the fuel pump <b>120</b>, is supplied to the engine <b>7</b>, and the fuel is simultaneously supplied to the engine <b>7</b> and the ejector <b>140</b> by the fuel pump <b>120</b> (S<b>14</b>).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">When the ejector <b>140</b> is operated in this way, the sub-purge system is operated. Specifically, while the fuel supplied as a driving fluid by the fuel pump <b>120</b> passes through the inner passage <b>142</b> of the ejector <b>140</b> at a high speed, the negative pressure serving as the purge power source is generated in the inner passage <b>142</b> of the ejector <b>140</b> (S<b>15</b>), and the fuel evaporation gas collected in the canister <b>10</b> may be sucked into the inner passage <b>142</b> of the ejector <b>140</b> by this negative pressure. The fuel evaporation gas thus sucked moves toward the nozzle <b>145</b> together with the fuel in the inner passage <b>142</b> of the ejector <b>140</b>, and is then discharged into the fuel tank <b>1</b> through the nozzle (S<b>16</b>).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the state in which the turbocharger is operated, the fuel evaporation gas in the canister <b>10</b> is sucked by the negative pressure of the ejector <b>140</b> and is then purged to the inside of the fuel tank <b>1</b>, so conventional problems in which the fuel evaporation gas exceeding the collection capacity of the canister is released outside the vehicle may be solved. Moreover, problems such as failure to satisfy vehicle evaporation gas regulations and generation of a fuel smell may be solved.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Meanwhile, in the state of running of the engine in which the turbocharger is not operated, the driving speed (rpm) of the fuel pump <b>120</b> is controlled by the pump control unit <b>160</b> to supply only the fuel flow rate required for the engine based on the flow rate signal received from the engine control unit.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Also, in the state in which the turbocharger is not operated, the pump control unit <b>160</b> performs control so that the recovery control valve <b>150</b> is closed. Specifically, the solenoid valve, which is the recovery control valve <b>150</b>, is controlled in an off state (S<b>17</b>). When the solenoid valve is controlled in the off state in this way, the fuel serving as the driving fluid is not supplied to the ejector <b>140</b>, and negative pressure is not generated inside the ejector <b>140</b> (S<b>18</b>). Moreover, because the ejector <b>140</b> is not operating, the purge power source at this time is the engine negative pressure, and the fuel evaporation gas collected in the canister <b>10</b> is sucked into the engine <b>7</b> by the engine negative pressure and is then burned (S<b>19</b>).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">As described above, according to the fuel system of the present disclosure, even when the turbocharger is operated, the fuel evaporation gas collected in the canister may be sucked by the negative pressure generated in the ejector and purged into the fuel tank, ultimately satisfying vehicle evaporation gas regulations as well as solving problems related to the generation of a fuel smell.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Moreover, since the fuel is ejected at a high pressure into the fuel tank using the ejector, vaporization of the fuel may be induced in the fuel tank. Specifically, the fuel ejected into the fuel tank may be vaporized, whereby, when the temperature and pressure in the fuel tank are high, an effect of decreasing the temperature and pressure due to latent heat of evaporation may be expected.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">As is apparent from the above description, in the fuel evaporation gas treatment system according to the present disclosure, the fuel evaporation gas collected in the canister is sucked by the ejector during operation of the turbocharger and is recovered into the fuel tank, thereby solving conventional problems such as failure to satisfy evaporation gas regulations and generation of a fuel smell due to the inability to purge a fuel evaporation gas.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The present disclosure has been described in detail with reference to preferred embodiments thereof. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles or spirit of the present disclosure, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
