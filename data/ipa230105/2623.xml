The requirements concerning the corrosion prevention to be achieved are very stringent, especially as the manufacturers often give a guarantee against rust perforation over many years. Such corrosion prevention is normally achieved by coating the components, or the substrates used in their manufacture, with at least one coating apt for the purpose.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0003">A disadvantage of the known coating methods, particularly affecting the known methods employed within the automobile industry, is that these methods normally envisage a phosphatizing pretreatment step, in which the substrate for coating, after an optional cleaning step and before a deposition coating step, is treated with a metal phosphate such as zinc phosphate in a phosphatizing step, to ensure adequate corrosion prevention. This pretreatment normally entails the implementation of a plurality of method steps in a plurality of different dipping tanks with different heating. During the implementation of such pretreatment, moreover, waste sludges are produced, which burden the environment and must be disposed of. On environmental and economic grounds, therefore, it is especially desirable to be able to forgo such a pretreatment step, but nevertheless to achieve at least the same corrosion prevention effect as achieved using the known methods. Modern thin film pretreatment technologies based on conversion layers based on zirconium show clear advantages concerning number of process steps, energy consumption and sludge formation and represent an alternative to the phosphatization, but the protection performance is in most cases not equivalent due to a missing active corrosion protection that actively protects the substrate by leachable and mobile components (like phosphate) which form a protection layer in the defect.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">Furthermore, in many cases there is an insufficient corrosion protection on multi-metal substrates, such substrates comprising surface areas of different metal composition. In many cases, particularly in automotive coatings, substrates composed of different metals are preassembled to workpieces, particularly automotive parts such as auto bodies, which are subsequently coated in an electrodeposition coating method.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">In other cases, it is intended to coat substrates composed of only one metal or one type of alloy in the same electrodeposition bath.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">Particularly important is the ability of electrodeposition coating materials (i.e. electrodeposition paints) to employ the therewith coated substrates with anticorrosive properties on a large variety of metallic substrates, particularly aluminum substrates.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">Corrosion of aluminum differs from the corrosion of iron containing substrates significantly. Particularly filiform corrosion is often observed on aluminum-based substrates such as pure aluminum or aluminum alloys.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">Therefore, a need exists for electrodepositable coating compositions for coating of electrically conductive substrates with an electrodeposition coating material that permits&#x2014;especially with a view to forgoing the normally implemented phosphatizing pretreatment step&#x2014;a more economic and more environmental coating method than conventional coating compositions used, while being nevertheless suitable at least in equal degree for achieving the corrosion prevention effect necessary for such compositions.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention, to provide a coating composition for coating of an electrically conductive substrate that has advantages over the coating compositions known from the prior art. It is an object of the present invention to provide coating compositions which permit a more economic and/or environmentally friendly coating method than conventional coating compositions used. Moreover, it is an object of the present invention, to provide a method which allows more economic and/or environmentally friendly coating than conventional coating methods, which, in other words, makes it possible, for example, to forgo the phosphatizing which must normally be carried out by means of a metal phosphate even prior to deposition coating, but with which, nevertheless, at least the same, and more particularly an enhanced, corrosion prevention effect can be achieved compared to the normal methods.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">Particularly, aluminum-based substrates should be protected from corrosion, while the coating materials should also preferably be suitable to employ corrosion resistance to other metallic substrates such as different kinds of steel.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">While the known art often makes use of anticorrosive pigments or specific organometallic or metal containing catalyst to enhance crosslinking efficiency in such electrodeposition paints, it was the aim of the present invention to achieve excellent anticorrosive properties with electrodepositable coating materials by adding specific water soluble organic compounds, even compounds occurring in nature or simple derivatives of such compounds and therefore being environmentally non-problematic.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">While a treatment composition for steel is know from EP 0 298 150 A1, thus not being an electrodepositable coating composition, said composition contains a quercetin derivative of monogalloylellagic acid. However, such composition does not contain crosslinkable binders and crosslinkers and contains significant amounts of phosphoric acid and zinc phosphate both known to act as anticorrosive compounds, but also known as unwanted impurities in electrodeposition paints.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">From DE 196 23 274 A1 and EP 3 156 522 A1 tin electroplating bathes are known which contain different organic, particularly flavonoid compounds and glycosides thereof. However, other than in electrodeposition of a coating material, electroplating leads to the formation of a tin plating film and no organic binders are deposited and crosslinked afterwards.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,348 B1 discloses rust preventive compositions, particularly a method for preventing Zn-based metallic coating formed on a base from rusting. On a first coating film comprising a silicic acid compound and an aromatic amine-based condensation product, a second coating film containing a phosphoric acid compound, an organic compound an organic polymer is formed, where the organic compound can be a polyhydroxyfunctional natural organic compound. However, this second coating composition does not contain a cathodically electrodepositable crosslinkable resin and a crosslinker.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">Further, it is particularly preferred that electrodepositable coating compositions should not contain phosphoric acid or its salts.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">It was the aim of the present invention to overcome the afore-mentioned drawbacks and to provide an electrodepositable coating material which is apt to provide corrosion protection to different metal substrates and preferably multi-metal substrates, particularly to aluminum comprising substrates even without pre-treatment such as conversion coating like phosphatizing.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0017">The problems to be solved by the present invention were solved by providing an electrodepositable coating material comprising<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">i. one or more cathodically electrodepositable resins (A);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0019">ii. one or more crosslinking agents (B);

The respective ingredients and further components are described below in more detail. Electrodepositable coating compositions are inherently aqueous coating compositions (i.e. water-based coating compositions), since changes in the pH value during the electrodeposition process mandatorily involve the reaction of water at the substrate cathode with electrons, thus producing hydroxide ions and hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0041">Since the electrodepositable coating compositions of the present invention comprise at least one cathodically electrodepositable resin (A), the electrodepositable coating compositions are so-called cathodically electrodepositable coating compositions and the coating process is a so-called cathodic electrodeposition coating process.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0042">It is also inherent to the electrodeposition process that no premature curing between the cathodically electrodepositable resin (A) and the crosslinking agent (B) occurs. Therefore, such compositions do not cure at typical coating bath temperatures such as temperatures up to 40&#xb0; C., but only at more elevated temperatures as for example &#x2265;80&#xb0; C., more preferably &#x2265;110&#xb0; C., very preferably &#x2265;130&#xb0; C., and particularly preferably &#x2265;140&#xb0; C., such as from 90&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C., preferably from 100 to 250&#xb0; C., more preferably from 125 to 250&#xb0; C., and most preferably from 150 to 200&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0043">Cathodically Electrodepositable Resin (A)</p><p id="p-0033" num="0044">An electrodeposition coating material generally contains a cathodically electrodepositable resin (A) which comprises functional groups that are reactive with a crosslinking agent (B). The functional groups being reactive with the crosslinking agent are preferably hydroxyl groups. Thus, the cathodically electrodepositable resin (A) is preferably a hydroxyl group containing cathodically electrodepositable resin (A).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0045">A variety of such resins are known, including without limitation, epoxy-amine resins, polyesters, polyurethanes, and vinyl resins such as polyacrylate resins, and polybutadiene resins. Many electrocoating applications, including automotive applications, typically use an electrodepositable resin that is cathodically electrodepositable, i.e., it has protonated basic groups (e.g., primary, secondary, or tertiary amine groups) or quaternary groups (e.g., ammonium groups). In a cathodic electrocoating process, the article to be coated is the cathode.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0046">Epoxy-Amine Based Electrodepositable Resins</p><p id="p-0036" num="0047">In a preferred embodiment, the resin is an epoxy resin with amine groups. Amino-epoxy resins (also called epoxy-amine resins) may be prepared from resins having a plurality of epoxide groups, which may be reacted with one or more polyfunctional, preferably difunctional, extender compounds and with one or more amine compounds. Epoxy-amine resins comprise besides the amine groups also hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl groups are typically formed by an epoxy-ring-opening reaction of the amine compound with the epoxide-groups of the resin having the plurality of epoxide groups. The hydroxyl groups serve as functional groups being reactive with the crosslinking agent (B).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0048">Nonlimiting examples of resins with a plurality of epoxide groups include diglycidyl aromatic compounds such as the diglycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols such as 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (bisphenol A), 2,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)-propane, 4,4&#x2032;-dihydroxybenzophenone, dihydroxyacetophenones, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenylene)ethane, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) methane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-isobutane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxy-tert-butylphenyl) propane, 1,4-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine, 2-methyl-1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, bis-(2-hydroxynaphthyl)-methane, 1,5-dihydroxy-3-naphthalene, and other dihydroxynaphthylenes, catechol, resorcinol, and the like, including diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A and bisphenol A-based resins.

When the resin has basic groups, such as amine groups, the resin is salified with an acid. Usually, the principal resin and the crosslinking agent are blended together before the resins are dispersed in the water. Examples of suitable neutralizing agents for the potentially cationic groups are organic and inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, dimethylolpropionic acid, citric acid or sulfonic acids, such as amidosulfonic acids and alkanesulfonic acids, such as methanesulfonic acid, for example, more particularly formic acid, acetic acid or lactic acid. The acid is used in an amount sufficient to neutralize enough of the amine groups of the principal resin to impart water-dispersibility to the resin. The resin may be fully neutralized; however, partial neutralization is usually sufficient to impart the required water-dispersibility. &#x201c;Partial neutralization&#x201d; means that at least one, but less than all, of the salifiable groups on the resin are neutralized. By saying that the resin is at least partially neutralized, it is meant that at least one of the salifiable groups on the resin is neutralized, and up to all such groups may be neutralized. The degree of neutralization that is required to afford the requisite water-dispersibility for each resin will depend upon its chemical composition, molecular weight, and other such factors and can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art through straightforward experimentation.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0066">Crosslinking Agents (B)</p><p id="p-0056" num="0067">Besides the at least one cathodically electrodepositable resin (A), the electrodepositable coating material comprises at least one crosslinking agent (B) which permits a crosslinking reaction with the reactive functional groups of the resin (A).

The maximum and average thread lengths in [mm] are measured. The values are average values over 3 samples (averages of measurements carried out on cuts in lateral direction and cuts in longitudinal direction).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0191">Copper Accelerated Salt Spray Test (CASS Test)</p><p id="p-0160" num="0192">The CASS test is used for determining the corrosion resistance of a coating on a substrate. In accordance with DIN EN ISO 9227 (09-2012) the samples under analysis are in a chamber in which there is continuous misting of a 5% strength common salt solution, the salt solution being admixed with acetic acid and copper chloride, at a temperature of 50&#xb0; C. over a duration of 240 hours with controlled pH. The spray mist deposits on the samples under analysis, covering them with a corrosive film of salt water. Prior to the CASS test, the coating on the samples for investigation is scored down to the substrate with a blade incision (Scratch Master 1 mm blade, 75 &#x3bc;m). The samples are investigated for their level of under-film corrosion in accordance with DIN EN ISO 4628-8 (03-2013), since the substrate corrodes along the score line during the CASS test. As a result of the progressive process of corrosion, the coating is undermined to a greater or lesser extent during the test. The extent of undermining in [mm] is a measure of the resistance of the coating. The values are average values of 3 panels.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0193">Preparation of Catechol Derivative Containing Electrodeposition Coating Materials</p><p id="p-0162" num="0194">The catechol derivative containing electrodeposition coating materials were prepared by dispersing a pigment paste (BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany) into a commercially available epoxy-resin based electrodeposition coating material (Cathoguard&#xae; 800; BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany).</p><p id="p-0163" num="0195">The ingredients of the electrodeposition coating material are shown in Table 1</p><p id="p-0164" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Electrodeposition Coating Material</entry></row><row><entry>(Electrodeposition Bath)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Amount in </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>parts by </entry></row><row><entry>Position</entry><entry>Ingredient</entry><entry>weight</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>Cathoguard&#x2009;&#xae; 800*</entry><entry>42.20</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>pigment paste</entry><entry>6.10</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>water</entry><entry>51.20 &#x2212; x</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>Catechol derivative</entry><entry>x</entry></row><row><entry>5</entry><entry>edge protection agent</entry><entry>0.50</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>100.00</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="left" id="FOO-00001">*obtainable from BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0165" num="0196">First, positions 1 and 2 of Table 1 were mixed.
