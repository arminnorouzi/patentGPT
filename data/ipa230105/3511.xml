This can provide information about the depth range at which an acceptably focused image can be expected in the investigations. This is important, among other things, if the object to be measured cannot be placed easily and deterministically in the optical structure or in front of a lens of the optical structure, if the specimen to be observed are also extended in depth, or can move (fast). Examples include studies of droplet sprays or impact of droplets on surfaces, as well as the study and tracking of particles and organisms in microchannel flows. In these applications, auto-focus and multi-focus methods using methods of a sensor, a lens, or using fluid lenses are usually not feasible due to the speed of the focusing method.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some cases, especially with very expensive microscopes, a simple calibration object, e.g. a line pattern, can be shifted in depth via a very precise shifting mechanism. The upper and lower shifting points at which the sharpness of the calibration patterns are barely acceptable define the range of the depth of field.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the depth of field (DOF) can also be determined mathematically, see, for example: Merklinger, H. M: The INs and OUTs of FOCUS (v1.03e). Published by the author. pg. 13 et seqq.

Other constants that enter into the equations are the focal length f, the f-number N and the distance of the focal point D in front of the lens. Since optical systems in the scientific field sometimes do not allow the unambiguous definition of the parameters so easily, an experimental determination of the depth of field is often almost essential.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0007">It is therefore the task of the invention to simplify the experimental determination of the depth of field of an optical structure and to improve its accuracy. This task is solved by a device and a method with the features given in the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are the subject of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0008">Thus, in one aspect, the invention particularly relates to a measuring device for determining a depth of field of an optical structure, in particular a light microscope. For this purpose, the measuring device comprises a device body with a measuring axis, wherein the device body is formed such that it can be placed securely in a measuring position on an specimen-side deposit plane (in particular a microscope slide plane) of the optical structure such that the measuring axis of the device body coincides with an (specimen-side) optical axis of the optical structure. In particular, the device body preferably has a base area for this purpose, which is used to park the measuring device in the optical structure in the measuring position. Due to the stable parking, the measuring device can be moved into the measuring position for an accurate measurement of the depth of field in a reproducible manner</p><p id="p-0013" num="0009">In order to be able to carry out a measurement of the depth of field, the device body has a measuring scale plotted along a scale line such that the scale line with the direction of the measuring axis encloses a scale angl &#x3c6; greater than 0&#xb0; (preferably at least about 10&#xb0;, more preferably at least about 20&#xb0;, even more preferably at least about)30&#xb0; and smaller than 90&#xb0; (preferably not more than about 80&#xb0;, even more preferably not more than about 70&#xb0;, even more preferably not more than about)60&#xb0; and the measuring scale in the measuring position of the device body can be optically detected by the optical structure for determining the depth of field. In other words, in the measuring position of the measuring device or measuring body, the measuring scale is visible and readable through the optical structure. For this purpose, the device body is preferably at least partially optically transparent along the measuring axis. This can be achieved by the device body being open or comprising an opening in the optically transparent area, or by the volume material of the device body being optically transparent in this area, e.g. in the form of glass. In particular, the device body may comprise or consist essentially of glass.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0010">The measuring position thus determines the position of the measuring device relative to the optical structure or within the optical structure in which the depth of field can be determined. In particular, the measuring position is determined by an specimen-side focal point of the optical structure, i.e. the area in which an specimen to be examined is sharply imaged by the optical structure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">The measuring device is designed in such a way that the focal point of the optical structure on the specimen side lies in the area of the scale line when the measuring device is in the measuring position. The scale line can represent an optically not separately marked line, which (only) describes the course of the measuring scale. In a preferred embodiment, however, the scale line can also be designed as an optically visible (continuous or partially interrupted) line (for example, as part of the measuring scale).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0012">By placing the measuring scale at an angle (as oblique) relative to the optical axis of the optical structure, the measuring scale extends simultaneously in an axial direction component of the optical structure and in a lateral direction. Thus the measuring scale (due to an axial course along the scale line) passes in particular through the entire focus range of the optical structure, i.e. in particular between a near limit and a far limit of the focus range. At the same time, the measuring scale (due to a lateral course along the scale line) can be read and evaluated through the optical structure. This makes it possible to read off the depth of field very accurately and with good reproducibility, from a single, instantaneous image of the measuring scale by the optical structure (e.g. by a single glance or a single snapshot),In particular, it is therefore not necessary to shift the focal plane of the optical structure for the purpose of measuring the depth of field.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0013">In a preferred embodiment, the device body comprises an optically transparent block or it is formed by such a optically transparent block, inside which the measuring scale is formed. The device body or the optically transparent block is considered to be optically transparent in particular if light in at least one measurement wavelength range (which is used in particular as the wavelength range of an optical measurement by means of the optical assembly), which runs out from the measuring scale, to a proportion of at least 50%, preferably at least 75%, even more preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95% of the light power leaves the measuring device in the direction of the measuring axis (towards the optical structure).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0014">Particularly preferably, the measuring wavelength is in the visible range, especially in a range of about 380 nm to 780 nm. In a preferred embodiment, the optically transparent block comprises glass or, preferably, is formed substantially of glass. Soda-lime glass, for example, is a preferred glass material. In a further aspect, Schott glass N-BK7 &#xae; in particular may be considered.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0015">The device body is thus formed in particular with an optical transparent block with the base area, a light emission surface and the measuring axis perpendicular to the base area and to the light emission surface such that the device body can be placed in the measuring position with the base area stationary on the deposit plane of the optical structure in such a way that the measuring axis of the device body coincides with the optical axis of the optical structure, wherein the device body in the interior of the optically transparent block comprises the measuring scale applied along the scale line such that the scale line with the direction of the measuring axis encloses the said scale angle and the measuring scale in the measuring position of the device body can be optically detected by the optical structure for the determination of the depth of field in that the light detected by the optical structure passes from the measuring scale through the light exit surface.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the optically transparent block is formed as a preferably straight, in particular four-sided prism, particularly preferably as a cube. This is particularly preferred and very useful when the deposit plane of the optical structure is perpendicular to its (specimen-side) optical axis, and when the measuring axis of the measuring device is perpendicular to a base area of the prism. This makes it possible to ensure that the light emanating from the measuring scale leaves the device body, in particular the optically transparent block, essentially symmetrically in the direction of the optical structure, thus achieving reading and evaluation of the sharpness representation of the measuring scale that is as distortion-free as possible and thus low in error.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0017">In a preferred embodiment or application of the invention, the optically transparent block is formed as a microscope slide, in particular as an specimen micrometer.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0018">In this context, a microscope slide is considered to be a carrier on which small objects (specimen) are (can be) observed microscopically, in particular by light microscopy. Such microscope slides are conventionally available in size and materials, and as microscope slides for light microscopy they often consist of a glass plate (also supporting glass) of size 76 mm&#xd7;26 mm (DIN ISO 8037-1), and this size is also used for the transparent block in a preferred embodiment of the invention. Alternatively, the sizes 76 mm&#xd7;52 mm, 76 mm&#xd7;51 mm, 76 mm&#xd7;38 mm, 76 mm&#xd7;25 mm, 48 mm&#xd7;28 mm and/or 46 mm&#xd7;27 mm are preferred. In this case, values in the range of about 0.5 mm to about 3 mm, especially preferably up to about 2 mm, particularly preferably in the range of about 1 mm to about 1.5 mm are used as slide thickness. In the embodiment as a specimen micrometer, an additional (lateral or flat) micrometer scale is provided in or on the microscope slide, which is provided in particular in addition to the measuring scale used to measure the depth of field and, in particular, runs perpendicular to the measuring axis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0019">Particularly preferably, the scale line runs along a straight line which, with a normal direction to a base area of the transparent block (in particular the prism), encloses the scale angle &#x3c6;, which preferably lies in a range from about 30&#xb0; to about 60&#xb0;, particularly preferably in a range from about 40&#xb0; to about 50&#xb0;, most preferably at about 45&#xb0;. In particular, in this embodiment it is especially advantageous if the measuring scale at an optical refractive index n of the optically transparent block has periodic distances d along the scale line according to</p><p id="p-0024" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>d=n</i>10<sup>&#x2212;m</sup><i>L/</i>cos &#x3c6;&#x2003;&#x2003;(5)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0025" num="0000">marked with an integer m as a decade multiple of a standardized unit of length L. Particularly preferably, the standardized unit of length is 1 meter according to the SI international system of units. With this scaling, the periodic distances correspond essentially to equivalent axial distances d&#x2032;<sub>a</sub>=10<sup>&#x2212;m</sup>L in vacuum (or approximately in air).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0020">They thus represent a direct measure of the depth of field in vacuum or air in the standardized unit of length L or in a decadic multiple thereof. This enables the effective depth of field of the optical structure in air or vacuum to be directly and easily detected. For example, at L=1 m and m=6, the depth of field can be read in units of &#x3bc;m. Of course, it is possible that the measuring scale marks periodic subdivisions of these distances into, for example, 2 or 5 equal subsections in addition to these periodic distances d. Particularly preferably, the measuring scale comprises a numerical labeling, which considerably simplifies the reading or counting through of the marked periodic distances.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0021">This scaling is basically also applicable if the device body is open at least in the area between the measuring scale and the lens of the optical structure, or at least the measuring scale itself is not covered by an optical medium such as glass. In this case the refractive index n is the refractive index of the surrounding medium (e.g. air or about 1).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0022">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the measuring scale is formed as an internal laser engraving. The technique of internal laser engraving is well established, particularly for glass, and can be applied very efficiently in the context of the present invention. Thus, the measuring scale in the device body is particularly protected and is not damaged during use.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0023">In a further aspect, the invention relates to a measurement method for determining a depth of field of an optical structure. The method comprises first providing an optical dispersing medium in a measuring area around the specimen-side focal point of the optical structure, i.e. where the depth of field of the optical structure is to be measured. Preferably, providing an optical dispersing medium comprises introducing fog and/or smoke into the measurement area around the specimen-side focal point of the optical structure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0024">Furthermore, the method comprises projecting a measurement scale along a scale line within the measurement range such that the scale line includes with the direction of the specimen-side optical axis of the optical structure a scale angle &#x3c6; greater than 0&#xb0; (preferably at least about 10&#xb0;, more preferably at least about 20&#xb0;, even more preferably at least about)30&#xb0; and smaller than 90&#xb0; (preferably not more than about 80&#xb0;, even more preferably not more than about 70&#xb0;, even more preferably not more than about)60&#xb0; and the measuring scale is optically detectable by the optical structure for determining the depth of field. In particular, the measurement scale becomes detectable by the light dispersing from the optical dispersing medium for the optical structure. In particular, the measurement scale is projected into the measurement area as a 3-dimensional light or laser projection in the manner of a hologram, with the light being dispersed by the optically dispersing medium and detected by the optical structure. The optical dispersing medium is preferably only dense enough to cause sufficient dispersing of the projected light in the area of the projected measuring scale, but to allow the dispersed light representing the measuring scale to be detected for the most part outside the measuring range for the optical structure. The predominant part of the light of the projected measuring scale should therefore preferably be detectable by the optical structure without further dispersion.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0025">Finally, the method comprises a detection of the limits of the area of the projected measurement scale which is shown as sharp by the optical structure within the scope of a tolerance criterion. These limits represent, in particular, the near limit and the far limit of the sharpness range and are identified by the fact that there the measuring scale itself passes from an out-of-focus to a sharp range (or vice versa).

In the illustrated example, the optical structure relates to an optical microscope having a plurality of interchangeable lenses <b>104</b> mounted in an lens nosepiece. The respective active lens <b>104</b> defines an (specimen-side) optical axis <b>102</b> of the optical structure <b>100</b>. In order to microscope a specimen, the specimen is positioned, in particular deposited, on a microscope slide device <b>106</b> of the optical structure. Now, to determine the depth of field of the optical structure, conventionally, for example, a conventional calibration pattern <b>108</b> is placed on the microscope slide device <b>106</b> such that the calibration pattern <b>108</b> is substantially parallel to a focal plane of the optical structure <b>100</b>. By moving the microscope slide device <b>106</b> parallel to the optical axis <b>102</b>, the calibration pattern <b>108</b> can be brought into the focal plane of the optical structure <b>100</b>, where it is sharply imaged by the optical structure (within its optical resolution). An image sharpness that is still sufficient within a specified or desired tolerance is also achieved in a vicinity of the focal plane. The axial extent of this environment along the optical axis <b>102</b> is considered the depth of field. To determine this depth of field, the calibration pattern <b>108</b> is conventionally displaced between the two limits of focus (a near limit and a far limit, respectively on this side and on the other side of the focal plane) by means of the microscope slide device <b>106</b>, and the axial displacement required for this is determined. This is usually performed by a user who assesses the respective impression of sharpness at the near or far limit and thus determines the respective position at the near or far limit in succession. Since the two positions are approached one after the other, the two sharpness impressions cannot be compared directly next to each other, so that a slightly different sharpness setting can occur here. In addition, this procedure requires a correspondingly accurate calibration of the axial displacement path of the microscope slide device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0037">In comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a preferred embodiment of an approach according to the invention for the same optical structure <b>100</b>. For this purpose, instead of a conventional calibration pattern <b>108</b>, a measuring device <b>10</b> is placed on the microscope slide device <b>106</b> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In particular, this measuring device <b>10</b> is placed in a stationary manner on the microscope slide device <b>106</b> by means of a base area such that a measuring axis of the measuring device substantially coincides with the optical axis <b>102</b> of the optical structure <b>100</b>. In the embodiment shown, the measuring device comprises a cuboid device body (block) within which a measurement scale <b>18</b> is formed obliquely or diagonally such that the measurement scale runs along a scale line (preferably a straight line), the scale line enclosing with the direction of the measuring axis (i.e. with the direction of the optical axis <b>102</b>) a scale angle &#x3c6; greater than 0&#xb0; and less than 90&#xb0;. In addition, the device body (block) is transparent, in particular, such that the measurement scale can be viewed through the activated lens <b>104</b>. Now the microscope slide device <b>106</b> is preferably positioned in such a way that the scale line of the measuring device intersects the focal plane of the optical structure <b>100</b> in the region of the optical axis <b>102</b>. In other words, the measurement scale <b>18</b> preferably passes through the focal plane of the optical structure <b>102</b> in the region of the measuring axis (i.e., in the region of the optical axis <b>102</b>)&#x2014;and such that it also passes through both the near limit and the far limit of the focus range of the optical structure while still within a field of view of the optical structure. This can be achieved in particular by selecting the scale angle &#x3c6; small enough, i.e. preferably not greater than about 65&#xb0;. Conversely, it is advantageous if the scale angle &#x3c6; is not selected too small, since otherwise the points of passage of the measurement scale or scale line through the near and far limits of the focus range within the field of view are so close together that reading is difficult, which can then also impair the reliability of the evaluation and thus the achievable accuracy. Preferably, the scale angle &#x3c6; is not smaller than about 25&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0038">With a procedure according to the invention, an evaluation of the depth of field can thus be carried out after positioning the measuring device once with a single glance or on the basis of a single image recording, without having to carry out a displacement of a calibration pattern during or in between.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically shows a perspective view of a measuring device <b>10</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the measuring device <b>10</b> consists essentially of a preferably glass, cube-shaped device body <b>12</b>, inside of which a corresponding measurement scale <b>18</b> is embedded along a diagonal scale line <b>16</b>. Preferably, the scale line <b>16</b> in this case runs as a straight line between the centers of two diagonally opposite cube edges. Preferably, the measurement scale <b>18</b> lies within a plane which is defined by the two diagonally opposite edges of the cube. The measurement scale <b>18</b> marks positions and distances in at least one direction parallel to the scale line. An exemplary embodiment of such a measurement scale is shown below.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0040">For the application of this measuring device <b>10</b>, the cube can be placed with one side surface, the base area <b>20</b>, stationary. This is particularly the case when the specimen-side optical axis of the optical structure to be measured is vertical. Here, for example, the central perpendicular to the base area forms a measuring axis <b>14</b> of the measuring device <b>10</b>, which can be brought into line with the said optical axis of the optical structure. As a result, the measurement scale <b>18</b> can be optically detected along the measurement axis by the optical structure such that light detected by the optical structure passes from the measurement scale substantially symmetrically about the measuring axis through a light exit surface <b>22</b> of the device body <b>12</b>. Since the measurement axis <b>14</b> in a device body with a prismatic shape (in particular in the form of a straight prism), especially in a cube, is also perpendicular to the light-emitting surface <b>22</b> exactly when it is perpendicular to the base area <b>20</b>, distortions of the measurements due to the refraction of light at the light-emitting surface are minimized</p><p id="p-0047" num="0041">The material of the device body <b>12</b> is preferably a dimensionally stable material that is transparent in the range of visible light. For example, glass is suitable for this purpose. The measuring scale can be produced, for example, by laser-induced internal glass engraving. Both the glass cube itself can be produced with very high quality in terms of material homogeneity, surface planarity and angles. In addition, glass is mechanically, thermally, optically and chemically stable and quite durable over time. Laser internal engravings can also be produced with very high precision. Finally, such glass interior engravings are protected and resistant to external influences.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> show the embodiment of an exemplary measuring scale <b>18</b>, such as can be used in a cube-shaped measuring device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a parallel projection of the measurement scale in one direction along the measurement axis, i.e. the view of the measurement scale that can be observed from the direction of the optical structure. In this preferred embodiment, the measurement scale even comprises two (substantially parallel) sub-scales <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b. </i>In one embodiment, it is conceivable that the two subscales in the measuring position of the measuring device can be detected simultaneously by the optical structure. Alternatively or additionally, it is also possible that the measuring device is shifted perpendicular to the optical axis of the optical structure in such a way that selectively one of the two measuring scales is detected for determining the depth of field.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows an enlarged section of the measurement scale <b>18</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> in the area marked there A. The two partial scales <b>18</b><i>a, </i><b>18</b><i>b </i>run parallel to each other and parallel to the scale line. The entire measurement scale <b>18</b> lies substantially in a plane extending as a spatial diagonal, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> as a section through the device body (as a cube) along line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. A scale line in this case can be understood as any line that runs along the slope of this plane. Along such scale lines, the subscales mark periodic distances, which are labeled &#x201c;0.1&#x201d; in the projection of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. At least in the case of a straight scale line as in this case, the periodicity of the markings along the scale line also represents a periodicity of these markings with respect to their respective position in the direction parallel to the measurement axis&#x2014;and thus in the measurement position parallel to the optical axis of the optical structure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0044">In addition, the markings can also be detected and distinguished in the image field of the optical structure at least when they are in the focus range of the optical structure. In this way, the limits of the sharpness range can be determined in the image field of the optical structure as the outermost markers that are still (sufficiently) sharp. Due to the periodicity of the distances between the markings, it is thus very easy to count or directly read off the total size of the area of focus, i.e. a measure of the depth of field. Direct reading is preferably supported and simplified by labeling the markings (with numbers). In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, for example, the two sub-scales are shifted relative to each other by half of their periodic distances in order to improve the resolution of the entire measurement scale 18.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0045">The measurement scale is thus inserted along the scale line or measurement section in such a way that it runs diagonally and permits optical measurement of the depth of field for both incident light and transmitted light setups. The measurement scale can be adjusted and labeled so that the depth of field can be read directly. This is comparable to measuring a linear dimension. A conversion by means of angles due to possible projections is therefore not necessary.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0046">Using the previously described equations (1)-(4), the depth of field in air can be calculated analytically.

It can be shown using equation (9) that the focal plane shifts backward or away from the lens for the case n<sub>2</sub>&#x3e;n<sub>1</sub>. This behavior applies analogously to the front and rear focal points and the front and rear focus limits, respectively, which are defined in particular by the enveloping rays. Using the corresponding angles in equation (9), the exact position of the depth of field can thus be calculated.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0050">It can be assumed that the depth of field is dependent on the refractive index to the same extent as given for the shift of the focal point in equation (8). The scale for determining the depth of field can thus be defined according to two criteria. It can be defined as a universally valid scale where the values of the depth of field can be read. By inserting the read values into equation (7) or (9), the exact depth of field can be calculated.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0051">Alternatively, and particularly preferably, the measuring device and scale can be accurately designed for a particular measurement task using equations (7) and (9), respectively. The scale then already contains absolute values of the depth of field, so that the appropriate linear dimensions can be determined directly when reading off the scale. In particular, an example of this is shown in equation (5). For example, when using a medium with the refractive index n<sub>2</sub>=1.5, markings on the measuring scale representing a measure of a depth of field of 1mm are preferably placed at a geometric distance of about 2.1 mm from each other in the case of a scale angle of 45&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0052">A possible optical image of an exemplary measurement scale as it could be used in a measuring device according to the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In this example, the measurement scale again comprises two sub-scales, each scale section of which is a marker of periodic distances, in particular shorter and longer lines. For example, the longer lines with digits can be understood as representing position with mutual axial distances of 1 mm The shorter lines in between could represent position with mutual axial distances of 0.1 mm in one sub-scale and 0.05 mm in the other sub-scale. The marking with numbers makes counting and measuring even easier.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0053">In particular, it can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> that a central region of the measurement scale, namely that located in the specimen space near the focal plane, is shown in focus in the image area.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0054">As the distance from the sharpest point increases, the measurement scale is further and further away from the focal plane and passes through the limits of the focus range. These limits and their distance to each other can be read at a glance or in a single image of the measurement scale through the optical structure without mechanical displacement of the measuring device after one-time positioning.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0055">As mentioned above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> represents a sectional view through the device body. In it, exemplary side lengths of 25 mm of a corresponding cube are indicated. Particularly preferably, the side length of the device body, especially in the case of a cube shape, is in the range of about 5 mm to about 40 mm At this size, the device body is large enough to handle well manually and small enough for many applications.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0056">However, especially for applications in the field of microscopy with high magnifications and very short focal lengths and focal distances, it is also desirable to be able to use smaller or thinner measuring devices. Exemplary variants of such measuring devices for microscopes with high magnification are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Thus, in these preferred embodiments, the device body is particularly in the form of a small microscope slide plate. It is even particularly preferred to design the device body also according to the size and material of standardized microscope slide plate. It is even possible to use such already existing microscope slide plates directly as device bodies and to provide them, for example by laser engraving, with a corresponding measurement scale which, when the device body is placed on a microscope slide device, then runs at an angle of more than 0&#xb0; and less than 90&#xb0;, particularly preferably in the range between about 30&#xb0; and about 60&#xb0; relative to the optical axis of the microscope lens and can be read directly through the microscope. Such measuring devices in the dimension of microscope slide plates are on the one hand very easy to handle and on the other hand highly compatible with the microscope slide plates of many microscopes. They are especially suitable for optical structures with very short focal lengths.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0057">The particular embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> even has a recess in a central region of the light-emitting surface <b>22</b> to accommodate an immersion liquid. The measurement scale is preferably arranged between this recess and the opposite base area <b>20</b>. Thus, this embodiment is also directly applicable for immersion microscopy by filling the well with an immersion liquid.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0058">With the method according to the invention, the depth of field can be determined with particularly high accuracy and reproducibility and with little effort. For example, glass bodies can be manufactured as device bodies and thus as carriers of the measuring scale with high accuracy. Laser-assisted (holographic) insertion of the measuring scale in particular is also possible with very high accuracy. Overall, this allows manufacturing tolerances that are below the resolution limits of the measuring equipment to be calibrated. At the same time, the measuring devices according to the invention can be manufactured very cost-effectively. Due to the laser technology that can be used, almost free size scaling is possible, so that calibration and measurement devices can be manufactured in a size scale of a few hundred micrometers up to several centimeters. High-quality manufactured glass bodies (e.g. cuboids or cubes) also have very high edge and surface parallelism. In addition, the measurement scale (calibration pattern) has a known and very precisely manufactured angle, so that angular and distance errors are practically excluded or negligible if the measuring device is well placed in the measuring section.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0059">However, the invention does not only concern the possibility of embedding a calibration pattern or a measurement scale into a fixed pattern carrier, but rather in general the 3-dimensional or holographic insertion of a characteristic calibration and measurement pattern, for example a (length) scale and possibly further patterns common from image processing (siemens star, line pairs, etc.), into a measurement space or specimen space, which is detected by an optical structure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0060">This can also be achieved, for example, the introduction of a light projection (or hologram) in smoke, liquid mist. Especially when using such a method according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, no fixed pattern carrier is required. This is particularly useful when the specimen space (measuring room) is very limited in space or very difficult to access for arranging or even fixing a sampled fixture due to the nature of the measurement to be made there.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0061">For holograms or 3D light projections in liquid mist, smoke or similar, the arrangement is otherwise to be considered analogously. When the pattern is introduced in this way, there are also analogous advantages to using a measuring device according to the invention. By means of a simple image, a measurement of the depth of field can be performed immediately, without moving the specimen carrier or camera. Due to the light or laser technology used, almost free size scaling is possible even with a projection in smoke, liquid mist, or similar. Thus, an optical magnification setup (e.g. for microchannel flow) can be calibrated and measured in the same way as an optical reduction setup (e.g. for droplet experiments).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0062">Preferred areas of application for a measurement method according to the invention for determining a depth of field of an optical structure by projecting a measurement scale into an optically dispersing medium are, for example, pressure chambers in which a spray is to be measured. In certain measurements, the deviation of particles from the focal plane is used to determine the position of particles in depth. Therefore, an accurate knowledge of the depth of field is quite crucial for such measurements. With the method according to the invention, for example, the depth of field can be re-measured very easily and quickly (especially without opening the pressure chamber) when the optics are changed or the optical structure is changed. In particular, the spray already present in the pressure chamber can be used as an optically dispersing medium. Through an optical window in the pressure chamber, the measurement scale can be projected into the pressure chamber by light projection such that the optical structure can detect this measurement scale due to the light dispersing by the optically dispersing medium.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0063">Other particularly preferred areas of application for a method according to the invention concern PIV measurements (particle image velocimetry) or measurements of flows in ducts. Especially in many measurement constellations for flow measurement, it is very difficult or even impossible to measure the depth of field with a movable calibration pattern either due to the internal geometry of the flow arrangements or due to the external geometric boundary conditions. Thus, it is already difficult or hardly possible to bring the calibration pattern into the correct position in the area of the focal plane at all. Moving this along the optical axis in a controlled manner in order to measure the sharpness limits is very difficult or only possible with great inaccuracies.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0064">In technical plants and also in scientific investigations, pipe flows of various kinds are very often measured. Measurement techniques such as PIV, shadowgraphs or schlieren are often used here. A particularly challenging example is the measurement of a round, conical vortex tube made of Plexiglas. Due to the conically opening inner diameter, the wall thickness is locally different. For the measurement, a LASER section through the tube illuminates the plane to be measured. The plane of the LASER section can be shifted as desired. One or two cameras with appropriate optics take the necessary images. The problem for a measurement of the depth of field of the camera(s) in this application is the accessibility into the vortex tube. For example, the tube is typically a complete, non-openable (Plexiglas) tube with dimensions of, for example, approx. 5-15 cm for the diameter and a length of 1.5 m.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0065">Commercially, calibration plates for such tubes are usually only available as custom-made products. The effort and thus the costs of an individual production of calibration plates are extremely high due to the accuracy requirements. Moreover, holding the calibration plates in zthe middle of the tube is very challenging and precise adjustment of the position is also almost impossible. It is under such conditions that the method according to the invention can show its potential by light projection of a measurement scale into the measuring chamber. But even the use of a measuring device according to the invention can in this case already bring substantial advantages, since here no controlled mechanical displacement of a calibration pattern has to be performed during the measurement of the depth of field. The measuring device only has to be positioned once. For this purpose, the device body can also be adapted to the inner shape of the tube.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0066">In the following, error limits and their possible reduction are still discussed. In particular, the error of the measuring device is composed of the geometric errors generated by inadequacies of the device body (e.g. glass cube) as pattern carrier and the patterns introduced as measurement scale along the scale line. This includes in particular the geometric error due to imperfect shape of the fixture body using the example of a glass cube as pattern carrier. The following influencing variables play a role:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0067">Surface flatness: typical values: &#xb1;0.08 &#x3bc;m</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0068">Surface parallelism: very high accuracies are also achievable here.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0076" num="0069">As an alternative consideration, the beam deviation data for beam splitter cubes can be used for comparison here. This is a much more difficult fabrication because there is a bonded interface between two prisms arranged to form a cube. The typical value for the deviation of the orthogonal laser beam are assumed here to be &#x3c;&#xb1;5 arcmin</p><p id="p-0077" num="0070">If the pattern is not carried by a glass body but is introduced by projection alone, e.g. in smoke, the accuracies of the projecting pattern generator have to be considered. No lump-sum estimate can be given here. However, due to mechanically high-quality constructions, these tolerances are also extremely small.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the error calculation due to angular errors when viewing the patterns. Here, any refraction of the non-orthogonal light beam at the boundary surface of the pattern carrier is neglected due to the very small angles of well below one degree (&#x394;&#x3b8;&#x3c;&#x3c;1&#xb0;) to be expected.

This thus corresponds to approx. 30-45 points per millimeter. At the lower resolution of 800 dpi, a maximum error of &#xb1;32 &#x3bc;m can thus be assumed. At a resolution of 1200 dpi, this corresponds to only &#xb1;21 &#x3bc;m. Such an error in determining the depth of field is perfectly adequate for most metrological tasks. As an example: With a depth of field of about 500 &#x3bc;m, as the measurement setup of an exemplary drop test rig with very high optical magnification has, the error is 4.2%. Other, more commonly used test stands have greater depths of field, e.g. in the range of 25 mm, so that the error is only 0.084%. Depths of focus of several centimeters are also common in experimental test rigs for heat transfer tests. In addition to the commercially available equipment, it has already been possible in academia to create cavities in the glass that have a spacing of only 6 &#x3bc;m, which can therefore reduce the error even further.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0075">In case of holographic insertion by means of a beamer or similar devices, the considerations here are analogous and therefore depend on the pixel/voxel size and the DPI resolution of the pattern generating generator. The total error is dominated in particular by the insertion of the pattern into the measurement section or specimen space. Here, for example, the errors can be in the range of up to about &#xb1;30 &#x3bc;m, which is perfectly sufficient for measuring the depth of field. Other measures for determining the depth of field have significantly higher errors with comparable effort, for example when using a meter scale (approximately one division unit of the scale, e.g. &#xb1;500 &#x3bc;m). In this case, it is not possible to measure the depth of field because the error is of the same scale as the depth of field itself.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">LIST OF REFERENCE NUMERALS</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0076"><b>10</b> Measuring device</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0077"><b>12</b> Device body, block</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0078"><b>14</b> Measuring axis</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0079"><b>16</b> Scale line</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0080"><b>18</b> Measurement scale</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0081"><b>20</b> Base area</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0082"><b>22</b> Light emission surface</li>    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0083"><b>100</b> Optical structure</li>    <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0084"><b>102</b> Optical axis</li>    <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0085"><b>104</b> Lens</li>    <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0086"><b>106</b> Microscope slide device</li>    <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0087"><b>108</b> Conventional calibration pattern</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001 MATH-US-00001-2 MATH-US-00001-3" nb-file="US20230003512A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="19.39mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003512A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230003512A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="13.04mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003512A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00003" nb-file="US20230003512A1-20230105-M00003.NB"><img id="EMI-M00003" he="3.13mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003512A1-20230105-M00003.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00004" nb-file="US20230003512A1-20230105-M00004.NB"><img id="EMI-M00004" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003512A1-20230105-M00004.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00005" nb-file="US20230003512A1-20230105-M00005.NB"><img id="EMI-M00005" he="5.67mm" wi="7.79mm" file="US20230003512A1-20230105-M00005.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="table" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
