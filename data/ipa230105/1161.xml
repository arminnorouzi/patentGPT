A variety of causes for inconsistent results from DCB for the treatment of BTK PAD have been proposed by leaders in the field, such as: the high prevalence of intimal and medical calcification in BTK lesions that creates a physical barrier to effective drug penetration into the adventitia of the vessel, resulting in the inability to effectively inhibit a key contributor to the restenosis cascade; limited dosage from smaller drug-coated balloons; and wash-off of the drug from the balloon surface during device delivery to the target lesion site.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To address these limitations, recent attempts have been made at treating BTK PAD and CLI with an infusion catheter following primary angioplasty and/or primary atherectomy intervention. Yet inherent limitations remain with current infusion catheter systems, inclusive but not limited to, the use of a single infusion channel, single needle, and/or a fixed length single needle approach. Due to the limitations of existing infusion catheter systems, treating longer lesions can be time consuming, inherently user dependent, and inconsistent in coverage of the delivered therapy, both circumferentially and longitudinally along the length of the lesion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Approaches are needed that address one or more of the deficiencies set forth above.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, it may be desirable to deliver one or more fluids to different depths of the vessel wall.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This disclosure is related to intravascular delivery of agents for the treatment of peripheral artery disease.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One aspect of the disclosure is an intravascular apparatus adapted for delivery of a fluid.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this aspect, the apparatus may comprise an inflatable balloon having an inflated cylindrical configuration.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this aspect, the apparatus may comprise an expandable infusion scaffold comprising one or more primary spines disposed about an outer cylindrical surface of the inflatable balloon.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this aspect, the one or more primary spines may comprise a plurality of primary radial openings therethrough, each of the plurality of primary radial openings associated with a needle that has a delivery configuration within a primary spine lumen of the primary spine in which a distal tip of the needle is radially constrained by the primary spine, and a deployed configuration in which the needle extends radially outward from the associated primary opening after the needle is advanced axially relative to the primary spine to facilitate delivery of a primary agent from the needle.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this aspect, one or more primary spines may further comprise one or more secondary openings therethrough that are not associated with a needle and are not adapted to deploy a needle therefrom, and wherein the one or more secondary openings are in communication with the primary spine lumen to facilitate delivery of a secondary agent through the primary spine lumen and out of the one or more secondary openings.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this aspect, the inflatable balloon may have a tapered proximal end and a tapered distal end, and wherein the cylindrical configuration of the balloon is in between the tapered proximal and distal ends.

id="p-0094" num="0093">The disclosure herein is related to methods, devices and systems for the delivery of one or more therapeutic agents for the treatment of peripheral artery disease. The methods, devices and systems herein are adapted to efficiently and reliably deliver the desired dose of an agent to a target region of adventitial tissue, particularly compared to existing drug coated balloons (DCB), drug eluting stents (DES), and single-needle delivery devices. Additionally, the methods, devices and systems herein are also adapted to efficiently and reliably deliver the desired dose of an agent to a shallower depth in the vessel wall, such as to the intimal layer. When treating PAD, it may be beneficial to deliver first and second agents to different depths within the vessel wall for different therapeutic purposes. For example only, an anti-recoil therapeutic agent may be exposed to the vessel wall, optionally into the intima, to provide an anti-recoil therapy, while an anti-restenosis therapeutic agent may be delivered into the media and/or adventitia to provide an anti-restenosis therapy. A therapeutic agent delivered deeper into the vessel wall is generally referred to herein as a primary agent, while a therapeutic agent exposed to the vessel wall and delivered to a relatively shallower region of the vessel wall is generally referred to herein as a secondary agent.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Primary agents herein may comprise a single agent, or they may include more than one type of agent either combined or separate. Delivering primary agents out of the needles may include delivering more than one type of agent out of the needles in combination and simultaneously and/or delivering more than one type of agent separately. For example only, a primary agent may comprise first and second primary agents (or more), and wherein the first primary agent may be delivered before the second primary agent.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Similarly, secondary agents herein may comprise a single agent, or they may include more than one type of agent either combined or separate. Delivering secondary agents out of at least one of the secondary and primary openings may include delivering more than one type of agent out of the openings in combination and simultaneously and/or delivering more than one type of agent separately. For example only, a secondary agent may comprise first and second secondary agents (or more), and wherein the first secondary agent may be delivered before the second secondary agent.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Infusion devices herein may include a plurality of deployable needles, which are spaced axially (also referred to herein as longitudinally) and circumferentially apart around the infusion device, allowing more uniform circumferential coverage and a greater span of tissue along the lesion length to be targeted with a primary agent without having to move the infusion device within the vessel. It is of course understood that any of the treatments herein may include delivering a primary agent, after which the infusion device may be moved to a different location within the vessel before again delivering the same or a different primary agent, which is described above.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Additionally, infusion devices herein may be positioned against a vessel wall upon application of a radially outward force, which is generally described herein as a force applied by an inflatable member or balloon, although it is conceivable that non-inflatable members may alternatively be used. After the infusion device is apposed against the vessel wall, the needles can be deployed outward such that they pierce through the vessel wall and optionally into the adventitia layer of the vessel wall. Once the needles have been advanced into the wall and optionally into the adventitia, the desired therapeutic primary agent is delivered though the needles, out of the needles, and into the primary target tissue within the vessel wall. In some methods, the volume and rate of infusion may be controlled based on one or more of a desired lesion length and/or desired volume of agent infusion.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">One or more of any of the following primary therapeutic agents or types of agents, including but not limited to any combination thereof, may be delivered from the infusion devices herein during any of the methods of use herein: antiplatelet agents; anti-inflammatory agents; antiproliferative drugs as referred to as cell-proliferation inhibitors; immunosuppressants such as mTOR and IMDH inhibitors; anticoagulation drugs; antithrombotic agents; lipid-lowering drugs; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; regenerative agents; and stem cells. While the disclosure herein focuses on PAD, the device and systems herein may be used to treat alternative conditions, such as, for example only, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (&#x201c;COPD&#x201d;), which is described in U.S. Prov. App. No. 62/953,342, which is incorporated by reference herein in this regard. Agents that may be delivered to treat COPD, for example, include but are not limited to anti-inflammatory agents, receptor antagonists, and neurotoxins.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The disclosure that follows describes non-limiting exemplary infusion devices that are adapted and configured to deliver one or more primary therapeutic agents and provide one or more of the advantages set forth herein, such as efficiently delivering a desired volume or dose to a target region of tissue in the vessel wall. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>16</b></figref> may illustrate examples of infusion devices that do not include secondary openings, it is understood that any suitable feature or aspect of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>16</b></figref> and the disclosure that now follows may be incorporated into any apparatus and method of use herein that includes both primary openings and one or more secondary openings, whether those one or more secondary openings are disposed in a primary spine or an optional secondary spine. It is understood that any of the infusion spines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>16</b></figref> may be considered a primary infusion spine (or primary spine) even if not expressly referenced as a primary spine. It is also understood that certain disclosure that follows (with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>16</b></figref>) that is generally related to a spine may, however, apply to secondary spines herein, and may be incorporated into any suitable secondary spine herein. For example, disclosure that follows related to a material that may be used for spines herein may be applicable to primary and/or secondary spines. Additionally, for example, disclosure that follows related to openings in a spine may also be applicable to any of the secondary spines herein.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In this disclosure, the phrases &#x201c;primary spine&#x201d; and &#x201c;primary infusion spine&#x201d; (or similar phrases) refer to infusion spines that include at least one primary opening from which a needle is deployed. Primary spines herein may also include one or more secondary openings (described in more detail below), wherein the one or more secondary openings are not associated with a needle and thus a needle is not and cannot be deployed from a secondary opening. In this disclosure, the phrases &#x201c;secondary spine&#x201d; and &#x201c;secondary infusion spine&#x201d; (or similar phrases) refer to infusion spines that do not include any primary openings from a which a needle can be deployed. Secondary spines herein thus include one or more secondary openings and do not include any primary openings.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a distal region of an example of an infusion device. Infusion device <b>100</b> includes an expandable infusion scaffold <b>110</b> that includes at least first and second primary infusion spines <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, and <b>112</b><i>c </i>(three shown in this example), which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in expanded configuration with the infusion needles deployed. Unless indicated herein to the contrary, the infusion spines herein may also be referred to as a plurality of infusion spines. Infusion spines (both primary spines and optional secondary spines) are sized, positioned, and configured to be expandable by a generally radially outward force, which in this example is applied by an inflatable member <b>150</b>. Any of the inflatable members herein may include one or more of a compliant material (e.g., polyurethane or silicone), a non-compliant material (e.g., polyester or nylon), or a semi-compliant material. As shown, the primary infusion spines <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>and <b>112</b><i>c </i>are circumferentially spaced about an outer surface of the inflatable member <b>150</b> with a long axis (LA) of the infusion device when the primary spines are expanded. The long axis in this embodiment is also a long axis of the inflatable member <b>150</b>. In this example, the primary spines are parallel (or substantially parallel) with the long axis of the infusion device <b>100</b> and the inflatable member <b>150</b> when expanded, as shown. As used herein, the phrase substantially parallel in this context includes slight deviations from being parallel and includes spines that have configurations that still facilitate the efficient and effective delivery of therapeutic agent to the desired tissue. One of skill in the art will appreciate that substantially parallel as used in this context allows for some deviation from strictly parallel, such as at an angle of five or ten degrees relative to a long axis, for example.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Any of the primary spines shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>B</figref> may be replaced by an optional secondary spine, which are described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In this example the inflatable member has a cylindrical configuration when expanded, as shown. The term cylindrical as used in this context includes configurations that approximate a cylinder even if not perfectly cylindrical, which may be the case if a plurality of infusion spines are attached or engaging an outer surface of the inflatable member and the balloon does not have a perfectly cylindrical configuration when expanded. Additionally, an inflatable member may still be considered to have a cylindrical configuration even if the inflatable member has at least one end region that is tapered or has any other configuration that is not orthogonal with the long axis, such as the tapered distal and proximal ends of the inflatable member that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Additionally, for example, an inflatable member with a general dumbbell configuration may be considered to have a cylindrical configuration. Additionally still, when the description herein describes inflatable members having cylindrical configurations when expanded, it refers to the configuration the inflatable member would take after being expanded outside of a patient. This is meant to clarify that when expanded or inflated within a vessel of the patient, there may be one or more anatomical restrictions that prevent the inflatable member from transitioning to the cylindrical configuration it would assume if expanded outside of a patient, such as the configuration of the vessel wall in which the infusion device is placed. In both scenarios, the inflatable member in these examples is considered to have a cylindrical configuration when expanded.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The primary and optional secondary infusion spines herein may be connected (directly or indirectly) to the inflatable member, such as by bonding, adhesion, or using any other suitable technique for securing the spines to an inflatable member. In any of the examples herein, the spines may alternatively not be connected to the inflatable member, but they are still adapted to be expanded by inflation of the inflation member due to their proximity to the inflatable member. For example, the expandable infusion scaffold may be delivered on or over a balloon-based catheter in a compressed low-profile delivery state, and then expanded by dilating the balloon-based catheter at the intended location within the vessel.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary inflatable member <b>150</b> and an expandable infusion scaffold <b>110</b>, both in an expanded state or configuration. For delivery, the expandable infusion scaffold is in a collapsed delivery configuration in which the primary infusion spines are closer to adjacent primary spines than in the expanded state, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>. It is understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref> are an alternative embodiment, and the reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> is meant to illustrate an infusion scaffold in a collapsed delivery configuration (or at least a configuration in which it is not fully expanded). During delivery, the inflatable member is also in a lower profile unexpanded (and uninflated) collapsed delivery configuration. The internal volume of the inflatable member is also less in the delivery state than in the deployed state. Once the infusion device is delivered to the target location within a vessel, the inflatable member is inflated, which pressurizes the inflatable member. This expansion of the inflatable member causes the inflatable member to increase in a radial dimension and apply a force to the plurality of primary infusion spines that are disposed around the inflatable member. This causes the primary spines to expand radially and which also causes the relative circumferential distance between the primary spines to increase, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>. The expandable infusion scaffold is thus expanded towards the vessel wall by inflating and expanding the inflatable member.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The inflatable member may have a variety of collapsed states or configurations. For example, the inflatable member may be folded in one or more locations to facilitate its collapse, while in other embodiments the inflatable member may not have a particular or well-defined collapsed state.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The inflatable members herein are sized and configured such that when expanded, the plurality of infusion spines (primary spines and optional secondary spines) will be moved radially outward and in contact or substantial contact with the vessel wall. It is understood that due to some variability in vessel wall size, some portion of any of the infusion spines may not make direct contact with vessel wall. The inflatable member may be sized such that it may have a deployed diameter that is larger than an intended vessel size to help ensure that the infusion spines are in contact or substantial contact with the vessel wall. Maintaining sufficient pressure in the inflatable member such that the infusion spines are in substantial contact with the vessel wall can help support the needles as they are deployed and pierce through the vessel wall, which is described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Any of the expandable scaffolds herein may have infusion spines (primary and optionally secondary) that are optionally equidistantly spaced apart along their lengths, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, two infusion spines may be spaced apart 180 degrees around the inflatable member when the scaffold and infusion spines are expanded. Alternatively, three infusion spines may be spaced apart 120 degrees around the inflatable member when the scaffold and infusion spines are expanded. Alternatively, four infusion spines may be spaced apart 90 degrees around the inflatable member when the infusion spines are expanded, and so forth. In the collapsed delivery state, the infusion spines of the scaffold can also have the same general relative relationship even though they are closer together and not spaced as far apart.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">While equal spacing between spines may in some applications provide more complete delivery of an agent to target tissue around or in the vessel wall, in alternative examples the infusion spines may not all be equidistantly spaced apart around the inflatable member.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates a distal portion of an exemplary infusion device, wherein the expandable scaffold is not shown for clarity. In this example, the infusion device includes an inflatable member <b>1650</b>, which is shown inflated. A distal end of inflatable member <b>1650</b> is coupled to inner shaft or member <b>1670</b>, and a proximal end of inflatable member <b>1650</b> is coupled to outer shaft <b>1672</b>. The inner and outer shafts <b>1670</b> and <b>1672</b> define therebetween inflation fluid pathway <b>1674</b>, which is in fluid communication with an interior volume of inflatable member <b>1650</b>. The inner volume of inflatable member <b>1650</b> and fluid pathway <b>1674</b> are in fluid communication with a fluid inflation port, such as inflation port <b>1333</b> or inflation port <b>1433</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, and which are described in more detail below. Alternatively, the inflatable members herein may be secured to the infusion device in a manner that may be the same or similar to known balloon angioplasty catheters, examples of which are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,782,834 and U.S. Ser. No. 10/086,175, and which are incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. Any of the fluid delivery devices herein that include one or more primary spines and optional secondary spines may include features shown in and described relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Once the expandable inflation scaffold is expanded and in contact with (or at least substantially in contact with) or directly adjacent the vessel wall, each of a plurality of needles within a primary spine are deployed outward from a radial opening in the primary infusion spine, an example of which is labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as opening <b>516</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a plurality of needles deployed from the expandable infusion scaffold, and in this example shows a plurality of needles deployed from each of the primary infusion spines. Needles <b>114</b><i>a </i>are shown deployed from primary infusion spine <b>112</b><i>a</i>. Needles <b>114</b><i>b </i>are shown deployed from primary infusion spine <b>112</b><i>b</i>. Needles <b>114</b><i>c </i>are shown deployed from primary infusion spine <b>112</b><i>c</i>. In this merely illustrative example, there are three needles shown deployed from each of the primary infusion spines. In any of the embodiments herein, each primary infusion spine may be associated with from two to fifty needles, all of which can be deployed from a radial opening in the primary spine. As used in this context, the term associated refers to needles that are within any particular primary spine in a delivery state, and are deployable from that particular primary spine to pierce the vessel wall.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">When this disclosure refers to an infusion spine (primary and optional secondary), it is generally referring to one of the infusion spines of the expandable scaffold. Additionally, when a feature is described with respect to any particular or individual infusion spine, it is understood that all of the infusion spines of any particular scaffold may also have any or all of those features. The phrase infusion spine herein may be used interchangeably with the term spine.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The needles in any primary infusion spine herein are generally axially spaced apart, as shown in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>B and <b>5</b></figref>, for example. Spacing the needles axially apart can provide maximum coverage of the therapeutic agent along the length of the target lesion, which can increase the volume of tissue that may be targeted by using the infusion devices herein. Additionally, by having a plurality of primary infusion spines spaced around or about the device, with each infusion spine having a plurality of axially-spaced needles deployable therefrom, the infusion devices herein can ensure or increase the likelihood of delivering the agent to as much target tissue around the vessel as possible without having to rotate or move the infusion device to provide the desired circumferential coverage of the infused agent. It is of course understood that the infusion devices herein may also be moved in between episodes of agent delivery into the vessel wall. In these instances, the needles may be retracted, and the infusion device can be moved to a different location within the vessel or to a different vessel. The inflatable member and the scaffold are generally collapsed (at least partially) before moving the infusion device to a new location. It is also understood that devices herein may include a single primary spine, wherein a plurality of needles are associated with the single primary spine.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In any the infusion devices herein, any two axially spaced needles associated with a primary infusion spine may be spaced from 1 mm to 40 mm apart, such as from 5 mm to 35 mm apart, such as from 10 mm to 30 mm apart, such as from 15 mm to 20 mm apart.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In any of the infusion devices herein, any adjacent pair of three or more needles that are associated with a single primary infusion spine may be equidistantly spaced apart axially. Alternatively, any adjacent pair of three or more needles associated with a single primary infusion spine may not be equidistantly spaced apart axially. It is of course understood that any primary spine herein may only be associated with two needles, and this paragraph is only related to primary spines that may be associated with more than two needles.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some illustrative embodiments, any of the infusion devices herein may include from six to 50 needles total. For example, an infusion device with three primary spines, each associated with two needles, would have six needles total.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example in which primary infusion spines do not have the same lengths and do not have distal ends that extend as far distally as at least one other distal end. In this example, the lengths of all of the primary spines that are shown are different, and none of their distal ends are axially aligned. In any of the infusion devices herein, any of the primary spines may have lengths that are the same such that their distal ends are axially aligned with any other spine distal end. In this context, the term length generally refers to the portion of the spine that overlaps with the inflatable member rather than a portion of a spine that may also extend proximally from the inflatable member.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The needles in different primary spines may or may not be axially aligned. For example, the exemplary needle placement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows none of the needles being axially aligned with needles in circumferentially adjacent primary spines. Any of the needles in the different primary infusion spines, however, may be axially aligned. Likewise, the primary infusion spines may also be axially aligned. For example, the infusion device may have rows of needles, with the rows spaced apart axially along the length of the infusion device, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. A row as used in this context refers to two or more needles in different primary spines that are axially aligned. The apertures in the top and bottom spines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref> are axially aligned, which will cause the needles associated with the top and bottom primary spines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref> to be axially aligned when deployed.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In any of the infusion devices herein, the number of needles associated with each of the primary infusion spines may be the same. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of this, with three needles per primary infusion spine. In alternatives, the number of needles in each of the primary infusion spines may not be the same. For example, one primary spine may be associated with two needles, while a second primary spine may be associated with three needles. Any of the infusion devices herein may have an expandable scaffold with a plurality of primary spines, optionally wherein none of the primary spines has the same number of needles as any other primary spine.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrate an exemplary infusion device <b>200</b> with an expandable infusion scaffold <b>210</b> that includes a plurality of primary infusion spines <b>212</b> (one labeled as <b>212</b><i>a</i>).

As is described elsewhere herein, and incorporated into these embodiments, the expandable scaffold may take the form of various potential configurations designed to enable infusion lumen structural support and communication with the microneedles while also facilitating circumferential and longitudinal infusion of the intended agent to the target lesion.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In any of the infusion devices herein, the expandable infusion scaffold may comprise one or more infusion lumens extending in a longitudinal (axial direction; proximal-distal) or non-longitudinal pattern along at least a portion of the length of the balloon that is either integral to, or to be used in synergy with the infusion scaffold. Longitudinal in this context refers generally to at least a portion of an infusion lumen that is parallel with a longitudinal axis of inflatable balloon. In some embodiments, the scaffold may comprise one or more infusion lumens extending in a non-longitudinal pattern along at least a portion of the length of the balloon that is either integral to, or to be used in synergy with the infusion scaffold. Any of the infusion lumens herein may have one or more portions that extend longitudinally and one or more portions that extend non-longitudinally. Examples of a non-longitudinal configuration or pattern in this context include a spiral or helical configuration or other non-longitudinal pattern. For the sake of illustration, the following describes infusion lumens that run or extend longitudinally (axially) along at least a portion of the length of the scaffold. &#x201c;Longitudinally&#x201d; (and derivative thereof) and &#x201c;axially&#x201d; (and derivatives thereof) are generally used synonymously herein. &#x201c;Linear&#x201d; may also be used with longitudinal and axial when made in reference to a linear longitudinal or linear axial configuration, such as if parallel to a longitudinal (or long) axis of the infusion device or an inflatable member.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In some exemplary embodiments herein (such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>F</figref>), the microneedles are secured (e.g., directly attached, or attached via one or more intermediate components) to a rail or other elongate member that is loaded into and disposed in the primary infusion spine.

Needles that are secured to tracks or other elongate members herein may also enable the depth of needle deployment to be controlled or adjusted. For example, any of the rails herein may be in operable communication with an external portion (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>-<b>15</b>B</figref>), wherein one or more actuators (e.g., rotatable knobs, axially movable sliders) in the external portion may be adapted to be actuated to control the relative degree of motion of the rail track subassembly (e.g., axial translation), and thereby control the length of the needles that exit radially or somewhat radially outward from the infusion spine.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Any of the microneedles herein may also have one or more side holes or ports formed therein in addition to or alternatively to a port at a distal end of the needle. In variations of any of the embodiments herein, the needles may only have side holes and may not have a distal hole. Side ports or holes may enable concurrent infusion at more than one depth within the vessel wall. Exemplary benefits of having one or more side holes in the needle include, but are not limited to, enabling local delivery of the therapeutic agent or diagnostic agent into the medial layer of the vessel as well as deep into the adventitial layer of the vessel.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Any of the rails herein may also be referred to as a support shaft, any of which may be solid or have a lumen therein. The rails herein may be made of any number of potential materials such as nitinol or stainless steel onto which the needles can be bonded or attached (directly or indirectly), and which may optionally be slatted or laser cut along at least a portion thereof to provide enhanced trackability. Additionally, any of the rails herein may be comprised of more than one type of material along the length of the device. Any of the individual needles herein may include a first end that may be straight or linear and the other free end may be pre-formed (e.g., heat set) to take a perpendicular or near perpendicular configuration (e.g. 60-120 degrees) to the surface of the vessel when the needle is in its deployed state. A straight or linear section of a needle may be individually secured (e.g., directly attached) to an axially moveable member such as a rail, allowing the free end to be free to deform and assume its deployed shape (e.g., pre-set shape) as it exits the infusion spine opening.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Axial spacing between needles may be optimized based on the desired anatomical coverage of the agent within the vessel wall, along with spacing to facilitate optimal delivery and trackability of the infusion device to the target lesion.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In any of the embodiments herein, any number of distal ends of individual infusion spines (primary and optional secondary) may be axially staggered (or axially offset, or spaced axially) relative to any other infusion spine distal ends, further enhancing trackability of the distal end region of the device (an example of which is in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In any of the embodiments herein, at least two lumens may have distal ends that are axially aligned, but those distal ends may be axially spaced from one or more other infusion lumen distal ends. In this fashion, any number of infusion lumen distal ends may be axially aligned or axially staggered relative to any number of other infusion lumen distal ends. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the infusion lumens are circumferentially staggered or off-set around or about the scaffold and inflatable member, as well as having distal ends that are axially offset such that the corresponding infusion needles are offset. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the infusion lumens are circumferentially staggered or off-set around or about the scaffold and inflatable member, but axially aligned at the distal ends such that the corresponding infusion needles are axially aligned.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">As described elsewhere herein, the individual rail remains inside the respective primary infusion spine, serving as a mechanism by which to advance and retract the microneedles. One or more openings (or windows) in the primary infusion spine provide guidance (or a pathway) for the microneedle(s) to exit the infusion spine and can also be adapted to function as added structural support as the needle penetrates into the vessel wall. Any of the infusion spine windows or openings herein (which may also be described as &#x201c;space,&#x201d; and as such may be defined by surrounding structure in the infusion spine, for example) may be configured with a slight tented structure around the perimeter thereof to offer additional guidance and structural support, or they may be configured to be flat or concave relative to the cross-section of the infusion spine. The primary infusion spines herein may also be configured to have a structure located just distal or just proximal to an opening or window (the structure may define the surface(s) of the &#x201c;opening&#x201d;) that is configured to function as an additional intraluminal guide or ramp as the needle advances out of the infusion spine opening.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In any of the examples herein, advancement and retracting of one or more rails or support shafts, to which one or more microneedles are secured (directly or indirectly), may be enabled through a mechanical turn dial (or any other rotatable handle actuator) or any other mechanical actuation mechanism with intuitive settings to guide the user during deployment and retraction of the microneedles.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">In any of the examples herein, after the microneedles are deployed, infusion may be initiated using, for example only, a controlled mechanism of volume delivery based on the lesion length and desired volume of agent infused.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In any of the examples herein, the number of needles per primary infusion spine may be of any desired number, inclusive but not limited to the range of two to fifty microneedles per primary infusion spine. In some embodiments, the microneedles may be attached or otherwise secured by techniques such as welding, soldering, mechanical crimping, adhesive, or other techniques to a rail and/or fluid delivery lumen. The needles herein may be bonded directly to a fluid delivery lumen, or they be bonded to one or more intermediate elements such as a coupler. Further, as is described in more details elsewhere herein, the depth of needle deployment may be controlled or adjusted, for example, by utilizing one or more controls in an external portion of the device that may be adapted to control the relative degree of motion of the rail track or support shaft subassembly and thereby control the length of needle that exits radially or somewhat radially outward from the device.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">In some examples herein, each needle associated with a primary spine is in fluid communication with an individual and separate fluid delivery lumen along at least a portion of the catheter length.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Any of the fluid delivery lumens herein may have one of a variety of cross-sectional shapes inclusive of, but not limited to, round and kidney shaped. This may be done to help reduce the overall profile of the needle assembly without compromising the volume of agent that can be infused through the lumen(s). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a sectional view through one of three needles associated with a particular spine (spine not shown for clarity). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows exemplary rail <b>1023</b>, exemplary needle <b>1014</b> and fluid delivery lumens <b>1022</b> and <b>1024</b> that are in fluid communication with a second and third needle, respectively, which are not shown as they are axially spaced from needle <b>1014</b>. For example only, needle <b>1014</b> may be a proximal needle with two additional needles distal to needle <b>1014</b>. In this example, rail <b>1023</b> is mechanically crimped and has a non-circular outer profile as shown.

Any of the fluid delivery lumens and needles within a rail may be secured using a variety of potential techniques such as, without limitation, crimping, welding, soldering, potting, adhesive, or other techniques inclusive of a combination thereof. In any of these embodiments, any single needles may thus be in fluid communication with a unique or distinct fluid delivery lumen that is only in fluid communication with that particular needle and not any other needles. In alternatives, a plurality of needles may be in fluid communication with a first fluid delivery lumen, and a different needle may be in fluid communication with a second fluid delivery lumen.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">In any of the embodiments herein wherein the expandable scaffold is attached to the inflatable member, the scaffold and/or individual spines may be bonded to the balloon or secured between the balloon and an additional thin walled layer of material, for example.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">As disclosed elsewhere herein, in any of the embodiments herein, the infusion scaffold may be independent from the expansion balloon (not integrated therewith), yet is adapted to function in synergy with the expansion balloon. In these embodiments, the scaffold may be deployed prior to inflation of the balloon. For example, upon retraction of an outer scaffold sheath, the scaffold may be adapted to be self-expanding, partially self-expanding, or non-self-expanding. The expansion balloon may be then advanced within the scaffold and dilated to continue to or fully expand the infusion scaffold. The scaffold structure may be deployed passively by retracting an outer sheath (as would a self-expanding stent) or by a mechanical means activated in the handle of the device. The infusion scaffolds herein may be compatible with any off-the-shelf angioplasty balloon, and the balloon may optionally be drug-coated or uncoated. In some of these embodiments, the scaffold may be pre-loaded onto the expansion balloon (yet not attached thereto), with both delivered to the target lesion in unison, and the infusion scaffold may then be expanded as the dilatation balloon is expanded. The scaffolds herein may thus be at least partially deployed with an expansion balloon, but need not be bonded thereto.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">In alternative examples, the scaffolds herein may be independent without the use of an expansion balloon. For example, the scaffold may be deployed into a target vessel and expanded radially. Radial expansion may be accomplished passively by retracting an outer sheath (as would a self-expanding stent that is commonly used in the field) and/or by a mechanical mechanism activated in the handle of the device. In an exemplary embodiment, the infusion scaffold is configured and adapted to be expanded using a mechanical mechanism or approach that compresses parts of the infusion scaffold longitudinally. The needles may then be advanced, as is described in more detail herein.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">In some methods of use, the expandable scaffolds herein may be delivered about an inflatable member, either attached to the balloon or not. After the inflatable member and scaffold are delivered to the target location within a vessel, an inflation can be delivered to an inner volume within the inflatable balloon to cause its expansion. This balloon expansion applies a force to the expandable scaffold, causing the scaffold and spine to radially expand towards the vessel wall. The balloon can be expanded until the infusion device makes contact with the vessel wall. The needles may then be deployed from the spine opening and into the vessel wall, which is described in more detail elsewhere herein, and optionally by distally advancing one or more rails within the spines. The agent may then be delivered from a fluid source, through the one or more fluid delivery lumens, and out of the one or more needle ports and into the vessel wall optionally including the adventitia. The needles may be retracted by retracting one or more rails, and the scaffold and inflatable member may then be collapsed. The infusion device may then be recaptured (e.g., within a sheath or guide catheter) within a delivery sheath and removed from the patient or delivered to another location for a subsequent agent delivery process.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">The disclosure that follows is also related to the disclosure above related to intravascular devices adapted and configured for delivery of a therapeutic and/or diagnostic agent into a wall of a target vessel of a human patient. Any of the suitably combinable disclosure from above may be incorporated into the devices and methods that follow.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">As set forth above, while the primary spines and associated needles herein can be used to deliver a therapeutic agent relatively deep into the vessel wall (e.g., into the adventitia), it may also be beneficial to deliver an agent to less depth, such as onto the inner surface or into the intima of the vessel wall. The disclosure that follows facilitates delivery of one or more agents to different depth and into different layers of the vessel wall with the same device and without having to move the device within the vessel.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">In some embodiments, the device comprises a scaffold that includes both primary openings, from which needles are deployed, and secondary openings, from which a secondary agent is delivered without use of a needle. The needles facilitate deeper delivery of a primary agent, while the secondary openings facilitate delivery of a secondary agent to the intima layer of the vessel wall. This facilitates two therapeutic approaches to different regions of the vessel. In some exemplary uses, an anti-restenosis primary therapeutic agent may be delivered deeper with the needles, while an anti-recoil secondary therapeutic agent, such as one or more vasodilators, may be delivered to less depth to the intimal layer of the vessel. The secondary agent may be adapted to treat elastic recoil of the vessel (e.g., acute) in response to deploying the devices herein into contact with the vessel wall. In some examples, needles may be used to deliver a primary agent deeper into the vessel wall for a first therapy, and a secondary agent may be delivered through secondary openings to a shallower location in the vessel wall to treat a more acute condition such as elastic recoil. Any of the primary agents herein (which are delivered through needles) may be the same as the secondary agent, or the primary agent may be different than the secondary agent.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>C</figref> illustrates a portion of exemplary intravascular apparatus <b>1700</b>, which is shown with balloon <b>1702</b> inflated in a cylindrical configuration, and the expandable scaffold is expanded.

In some embodiments, the laser cuts in the spines may in fact constitute the one or more secondary openings in the spine, which allows the secondary agent to pass through the cut(s) and into the vessel wall. Laser cuts herein are examples of more generalized discontinuities in the wall of the spine, where the discontinuity is a secondary opening that facilitates weeping of the secondary agent therethrough.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Both primary and optional secondary spines may include one or more discontinuities (e.g., one or more cuts therein) therein that are secondary openings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a side view of spine <b>2104</b> (which could be a primary or secondary spine) illustrating a secondary opening <b>2106</b> in the form of a laser cut helical pattern that facilitates delivery of secondary agent <b>2110</b> out of the spine <b>2104</b>. In embodiments in which the spine has a laser cut pattern, part of the spine may be covered by a membrane to maintain fluid integrity, and the uncovered portion may act as the secondary opening. In these embodiments, the laser cut pattern may facilitate weeping of the secondary agent out of the secondary opening. In embodiments that include a laser cut pattern, a single, uninterrupted cut around the spine (e.g., in a helical configuration) may define a single secondary opening.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">The needles may be adapted to be in communication with a first agent source outside the patient, and secondary openings may be adapted to be in communication with a second agent source outside the patient.
