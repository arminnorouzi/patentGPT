In exemplary embodiments that are not shown, the tool <b>10</b> is supplied with electrical energy by means of a power cable instead of the electrical energy store <b>140</b> or in addition to the electrical energy store <b>140</b>. The control unit comprises electronic components, preferably interconnected on a printed circuit board to form one or more electrical control circuits, in particular one or more microprocessors.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the tool <b>10</b> is pressed against a substrate that is not shown (to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), a contact-pressure element, not specifically denoted, actuates the contact-pressure switch <b>170</b>, which as a result transmits a contact-pressure signal to the control unit <b>150</b> by means of the connecting line <b>171</b>. Triggered by this, the control unit <b>150</b> initiates a capacitor charging process in which electrical energy is conducted by means of the connecting line <b>141</b> from the electrical energy store <b>140</b> to the control unit <b>150</b> and by means of the connecting lines <b>301</b> from the control unit <b>150</b> to the capacitor <b>300</b> in order to electrically charge the capacitor <b>300</b>. For this purpose, the control unit <b>150</b> comprises a switching converter, not specifically denoted, which converts the electrical current from the electrical energy store <b>140</b> into a suitable charge current for the capacitor <b>300</b>.

Triggered by this, the control unit <b>150</b> initiates a capacitor discharging process, in which electrical energy stored in the capacitor <b>300</b> is conducted by means of the switching circuit <b>200</b> from the capacitor <b>300</b> to the drive <b>65</b>, in that the capacitor <b>300</b> is electrically discharged.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For this purpose, the switching circuit <b>200</b> schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises two discharge lines <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, which connect the capacitor <b>300</b> to the drive <b>65</b> and of which at least one discharge line <b>210</b> is interrupted by a normally open discharge switch <b>230</b>. The switching circuit <b>200</b> with the drive <b>65</b> and the capacitor <b>300</b> may form an electrical oscillating circuit. Oscillation of this oscillating circuit back and forth and/or negative charging of the capacitor <b>300</b> may potentially have an adverse effect on the efficiency of the drive <b>65</b>, but can be suppressed with the aid of a free-wheeling diode <b>240</b>.

The discharge switch <b>230</b> is preferably suitable for switching a discharge current with a high current intensity and is formed for example as a thyristor. In addition, the discharge lines <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> are at a small distance from one another, so that a parasitic magnetic field induced by them is as low as possible. For example, the discharge lines <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> are combined to form a busbar and are held together by a suitable means, for example a holder or a clip. In exemplary embodiments that are not shown, the free-wheeling diode is connected electrically in parallel with the discharge switch.

As soon as the piston rod <b>80</b> of the working piston <b>60</b> meets a head, not denoted any more specifically, of the fastening element <b>30</b>, the fastening element <b>30</b> is driven into the substrate by the working piston <b>60</b>. Excess kinetic energy of the working piston <b>60</b> is absorbed by a braking element <b>85</b> of a spring-elastic and/or damping material, for example rubber or an elastomer, by the working piston <b>60</b> moving with its piston plate <b>70</b> against the braking element <b>85</b> and being braked by the latter until it comes to a standstill.

The piston coil <b>541</b> can be electrically connected to a piston coil capacitor (not shown) in order during rapid discharge of the capacitor to have a current flowing through it.

In exemplary embodiments that are not shown, the piston coil is wound in the opposite direction relative to the stator coils. The piston coil <b>541</b> and the stator coils <b>551</b>, <b>552</b>, <b>553</b> preferably have in each case the same number of coil turns, so that the magnetic fields generated by the coils <b>541</b>, <b>551</b>, <b>552</b>, <b>553</b> are essentially equally strong.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The piston <b>520</b> preferably consists of a soft magnetic material, such as for example iron or an alloy thereof, for example steel.

The stator frame <b>535</b> surrounds the stator coils <b>551</b>, <b>552</b>, <b>553</b> and extends in a circumferential direction with respect to the working axis <b>501</b>. As a result, the magnetic fields generated by the stator coils <b>551</b>, <b>552</b>, <b>553</b> are intensified in the area of the piston coil <b>541</b> and the accelerating force between the stator <b>530</b> and the working piston <b>520</b> is increased.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The drive <b>510</b> is intended to drive the working piston <b>520</b> forward from a starting position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> along the working axis <b>501</b> toward the substrate (to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In the starting position, the piston coil <b>541</b> partially protrudes into the first stator coil <b>551</b> and is arranged offset forward relative to the first stator coil.

The piston coil <b>541</b> and the first stator coil <b>551</b> are supplied with current in opposite directions and therefore generate opposing magnetic fields, so that the piston coil <b>541</b> is accelerated forward out of the first stator coil <b>551</b>. As soon as the piston coil <b>541</b> has completely entered the second stator coil <b>552</b>, the piston coil <b>541</b> and the second stator coil <b>552</b> are supplied with current in opposite directions, so that the piston coil <b>541</b> is accelerated even further forward out of the second stator coil <b>552</b> after the piston coil <b>541</b> has been accelerated out of the first stator coil <b>551</b>.

The piston coil <b>541</b> has a piston coil outer diameter which is larger than a stator coil inner diameter of the first stator coil <b>551</b>.

By supplying current to the first piston coil <b>541</b> and the third stator coil <b>553</b> in the same direction, it is possible to accelerate the working piston <b>520</b> backward in order to move it into the starting position.
