Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the increase in demand for wireless data traffic after the commercialization of 4<sup>th </sup>generation (4G) communication systems, considerable efforts have been made to develop pre-5<sup>th </sup>generation (5G) communication systems or 5G communication systems. This is one reason why &#x2018;5G communication systems&#x2019; or &#x2018;pre-5G communication systems&#x2019; are called &#x2018;beyond 4G network communication systems&#x2019; or &#x2018;post Long-Term Evolution (LTE) systems.&#x2019; A 5G communication system defined by 3GPP is referred to as a new radio (NR) system. In order to achieve a high data transmission rate, 5G communication systems are being developed to be implemented in a super-high frequency band (millimeter wave (mmWave)), e.g., a band of 60 GHz. In order to reduce the path loss of radio waves in such a super-high frequency band and to increase a transmission distance of radio waves in 5G communication systems, various technologies are being studied, for example: beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), Full Dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antennas, analog beam-forming, and large-scale antennas, and such technologies have been applied to NR systems. In order to improve system networks for 5G communication systems, various technologies have been developed, e.g., evolved small cells, advanced small cells, cloud radio access networks (Cloud-RAN), ultra-dense networks, Device-to-Device communication (D2D), wireless backhaul, moving networks, cooperative communication, Coordinated Multi-Points (COMP), and interference cancellation. Also, for 5G communication systems, other technologies have been developed, e.g., hybrid frequency-shift keying (FSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) (FQAM) and Sliding Window Superposition Coding (SWSC), which are Advanced Coding Modulation (ACM) schemes, and filter Bank Multi Carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA), which are advanced access schemes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Internet has evolved from a human-based connection network, where humans create and consume information, to the Internet of Things (IoT), where distributed configurations, such as objects, exchange information with each other to process the information. Internet of Everything (IoE) technology is emerging, in which technology related to the IoT is combined with, for example, technology for processing big data through connection with a cloud server. In order to implement the IoT, various technological components are required, such as sensing technology, wired/wireless communication and network infrastructures, service interface technology, security technology, etc. In recent years, technologies including a sensor network for connecting objects, Machine to Machine (M2M) communication, Machine Type Communication (MTC), etc. have been studied. In the IoT environment, intelligent Internet Technology (IT) services may be provided to collect and analyze data obtained from objects connected to each other to create new value in human life. As existing information technology (IT) techniques and various industries converge and combine with each other, the IoT may be applied to various fields, such as smart homes, smart buildings, smart cities, smart cars or connected cars, smart grids, health care, smart home appliances, high quality medical services, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various attempts are being made to apply 5G communication systems to the IoT network. For example, technologies related to sensor networks, M2M communication, MTC, etc., are being implemented by using 5G communication technology including beam-forming, MIMO, array antennas, etc, The application of Cloud-RAN as a big data processing technology described above may be an example of convergence of 5G communication technology and IoT technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described above, various services may be provided due to the development of wireless communication systems, and thus, ways of effectively providing such services are required.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One or more embodiments of the disclosure effectively provide a service in a wireless communication system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, an operating method of a user equipment (UE) for time domain resource assignment of a data channel in a wireless communication system includes: receiving control information related to the time domain resource assignment of the data channel from a base station via a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) and upper layer signaling; and determining the time domain resource assignment of the data channel, based on the received control information, wherein the control information received via the PDCCH includes downlink control information (DCI) indicating the time domain resource assignment of the data channel.

The computer program instructions may be stored in a computer-usable or computer-readable memory capable of directing a computer or another programmable data processing apparatus to implement a function in a particular manner, and thus the instructions stored in the computer-usable or computer-readable memory may also be capable of producing manufacturing items containing instruction units for performing the functions described in the flowchart block(s). The computer program instructions may also be loaded into a computer or another programmable data processing apparatus, and thus, instructions for operating the computer or the other programmable data processing apparatus by generating a computer-executed process when a series of operations are performed in the computer or the other programmable data processing apparatus may provide operations for performing the functions described in the flowchart block(s).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, each block may represent a portion of a module, segment, or code that includes one or more executable instructions for executing specified logical function(s). it should also be noted that in some alternative implementations, functions mentioned in blocks may occur out of order. For example, two blocks illustrated successively may actually be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be performed in a reverse order according to the corresponding function.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Here, the term &#x201c;unit&#x201d; in the embodiments of the disclosure means a software component or hardware component such as a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), and performs a specific function. However, the term &#x201c;unit&#x201d; is not limited to software or hardware. The &#x201c;unit&#x201d; may be formed so as to be in an addressable storage medium, or may be formed so as to operate one or more processors. Thus, for example, the term &#x201c;unit&#x201d; may refer to components such as software components, object-oriented software components, class components, and task components, and may include processes, functions, attributes, procedures, subroutines, segments of program code, drivers, firmware, micro codes, circuits, data, a database, data structures, tables, arrays, or variables. A function provided by the components and &#x201c;units&#x201d; may be associated with the smaller number of components and &#x201c;units&#x201d;, or may be divided into additional components and &#x201c;units&#x201d;. Furthermore, the components and &#x201c;units&#x201d; may be embodied to reproduce one or more central processing units (CPUs) in a device or security multimedia card. Also, in the embodiments of the disclosure, the &#x201c;unit&#x201d; may include at least one processor.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Throughout the disclosure, the expression &#x201c;at least one of a, b or c&#x201d; indicates only a, only b, only c, both a and b, both a and c, both b and c, all of a, b, and c, or variations thereof.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Wireless communication systems have been developed from wireless communication systems providing voice centered services in the early stage toward broadband wireless communication systems providing high-speed, high-quality packet data services, like communication standards of high speed packet access (HSPA), long term evolution (LTE or evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA)). and LTE-advanced (LTE-A) of the 3GPP, high rate packet data (HRPD) and ultra mobile broadband (UMB) of 3GPP2, IEEE 802.16e or the like. Also, a 5th generation (5G) or new radio (NR) communication standard is being developed as a 5G wireless communication system.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As a representative example of a broadband wireless communication system, an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme is adopted for downlink (DL) or uplink (UL) of a 5G or NR system. More specifically, a cyclic-prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) scheme is adopted for the DL, and a discrete fourier transform spreading OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM) scheme is adopted for the UL in addition to the CP-OFDM scheme. The UL refers to a radio link through which a terminal (a user equipment (UE) or a mobile station (MS)) transmits data or a control signal to a base station (BS) (e.g, gNode B or eNode B), and the DL refers to a radio link through which a base station transmits data or a control signal to a UE. Such a multiple access scheme may generally assign and operate time-frequency resources including data or control information to be transmitted to each other to prevent the time-frequency resources from overlapping with each other, that is, establish orthogonality, thereby distinguishing the data or the control information of each user.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The 5G or NR system adopts a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme in which the data is retransmitted in a physical layer when a decoding failure occurs in initial transmission. In the HARQ scheme, when a receiver does not correctly decode the data, the receiver transmits negative acknowledgement (NACK) informing a transmitter of the decoding failure such that the transmitter retransmits the corresponding data in the physical layer. The receiver combines the data retransmitted by the transmitter with data of which decoding failed previously to improve data reception performance. In addition, when the receiver correctly decodes the data, the transmitter may transmit acknowledgment (ACK) informing the transmitter of the decoding success such that the transmitter may transmit new data.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Meanwhile, an NR access technology system that is new 5G communication is designed to allow various services to be freely multiplexed in time and frequency resources, and accordingly, reference signals such as waveform/numerology may dynamically or freely assigned as required by the service. In order to provide an optimal service to the UE in wireless communication, optimized data transmission by measuring channel quality and an interference amount is important. Therefore, accurate channel state measurement is essential. However, unlike 4G communication, in which channel and interference characteristics do not change significantly according to frequency resources, frequency and interference characteristics of 5G or NR channels change significantly according to service, and thus support of a subset in a level of a frequency resource group (FRG) capable of dividing and measuring the channel and interference characteristics is required. Meanwhile, a type of service supported in the 5G or NR system may be divided into categories, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). The eMBB is a service targeting high speed data transmission of large capacity data, the mMTC is a service targeting UE power minimization and access to multiple UEs, and the URLLC is a service targeting high reliability and low latency. Different requirements may be applied depending on the type of service applied to the UE.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Among the above services, because the URLLC aims at high reliability and low latency, there may be a need to transmit control information and data information that is transmittable on a physical channel at a low coding rate. In case of the control information, a control information repetitive transmission function is already introduced to an MTC or narrow band Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) service of LTE. The control information repetitive transmission function is introduced to provide high coverage for UEs having a small bandwidth, but a delay time is not sufficiently considered. Also, a minimum unit of a control information repetitive transmission is fixed to a subframe unit based on LTE. In order for the NR or 5G system to support the URLLC, a control information repetitive transmission mode needs to be introduced to increase reliability while requesting a low latency time. Accordingly, in the disclosure, a situation in which control information is repeatedly transmitted in a slot is basically considered. In addition, a situation in which control information is repeatedly transmitted over a slot boundary is also considered. Via an operation provided in the disclosure, a UE may detect control information transmitted from a base station quickly and with high reliability.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also, terms used below are defined in consideration of functions in the disclosure, and may have different meanings according to an intention of a user or operator, customs, or the like. Thus, the terms should be defined based on the description throughout the specification. In the disclosure, a controller may also be referred to as a processor.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Throughout the specification, a layer (or a layer apparatus) may also be referred to as an entity. Hereinafter, a base station is an entity that assigns resources of a terminal, and may be at least one of a gNode (gNB), an eNode B (eNB), a node B (NB), a BS, a wireless access unit, a base station controller, or a node on a network. Examples of a terminal may include a UE, an MS, a cellular phone, a smartphone, a computer, and a multimedia system capable of performing a communication function. In the disclosure, a is a wireless transmission path of a signal transmitted from a base station to a UE, and an UL is a wireless transmission path of a signal transmitted from a UE to a base station. Also, hereinafter, the disclosure is described with an example of an NR system, but is not limited thereto and embodiments of the disclosure may be applied to other various communication systems having a similar technical background or a similar channel form. Also, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that embodiments of the disclosure may be applied to other communication systems through some modifications without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the disclosure, general terms &#x2018;physical channel&#x2019; and &#x2018;signal&#x2019; may be used interchangeably with data or a control signal. For example, a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) is a physical channel through which data is transmitted, but in the disclosure, PDSCH may also be the data.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the disclosure, upper layer signaling is a method of transmitting a signal from a base station to a UE by using a DL data channel of a physical layer or from a UE to a base station by using an UL data channel of a physical layer, and may also be referred to as radio resource control (RRC) signaling or media access control (MAC) control element (CE).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Meanwhile, as the research on a next generation mobile communication system has been progressed recently, various methods for scheduling communication with a UE have been discussed. Accordingly, effective scheduling and data transmitting and receiving methods considering characteristics of the next generation communication system are required. In this regard, in order to provide a plurality of services to a user in a communication system, a method of providing each service within the same time period according to characteristics of the service and an apparatus using the method are required.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a diagram showing a transmission structure of a time-frequency domain that is a wireless resource region of a 5G or NR system.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in a wireless resource region, a horizontal axis denotes a time domain and a vertical axis denotes a frequency domain. In the time domain a minimum transmission unit is an OFDM symbol and N<sub>symb </sub>OFDM symbols <b>102</b> form one slot <b>106</b>. The length of subframe may be defined as 1.0 ms and the length of radio frame <b>114</b> may be defined as 10 ms. In the frequency domain, a minimum transmission unit is a subcarrier, and the bandwidth of an entire system transmission bandwidth may include total N<sub>BW </sub>subcarriers <b>104</b>. However, the specific numerical value may vary according to systems.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A basic unit of a time-frequency resource region is a resource element (RE) <b>112</b>, and may be indicated by an OFDM symbol index and a subcarrier index. A resource block (RB) <b>108</b> or a physical resource block (PRB) may be defined as the consecutive N<sub>symb </sub>OFDM symbols <b>102</b> in the time domain and as consecutive N<sub>RB </sub>subcarriers <b>110</b> in the frequency domain. Accordingly, one RB <b>108</b> may include N<sub>symb</sub>&#xd7;N<sub>RB </sub>REs <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Generally, a minimum transmission unit of data is an RB unit. Generally, in the 5G or NR system, N<sub>symb</sub>=14, N<sub>RB</sub>=12, and N<sub>BW </sub>and N<sub>RB </sub>may be proportional to the bandwidth of the system transmission bandwidth. A data rate increases in proportion to the number of RBs scheduled to a UE. In the 5G or NR system, a DL transmission bandwidth and an UL transmission bandwidth may be different from each other in case of a frequency division duplexing (FDD) system operating by distinguishing a DL and an UP in frequencies. A channel bandwidth indicates a radio frequency (RF) corresponding to the system transmission bandwidth. Table 1 below shows a correspondence between the system transmission bandwidth and the channel bandwidth defined in an LTE system that is 4G wireless communication before the 5G or NR system. For example, the LTE system of a 10 MHz channel bandwidth includes 50 RBs for a transmission bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="175pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Channel Bandwidth BW<sub>Channel </sub>[MHz]</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>1.4</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>20</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Transmission </entry><entry>6</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>50</entry><entry>75</entry><entry>100</entry></row><row><entry>Bandwidth</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Configuration</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>NRB</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">The 5G or NR system may operate in a channel bandwidth greater than that of LTE suggested in Table 1.

Also, according to an embodiment of the disclosure, repetition transmission may be configured only for PDCCH candidates having a certain PDCCH candidate index or certain AL values. For example, the same DCI may be repeatedly transmitted in CORESETs having a repetition relationship with respect to PDCCH candidates of which an index value corresponds to 1. As another example, the same DCI may be repeatedly transmitted in CORESETs having a repetition relationship with respect to all PDCCH candidates of which AL value is 16, Alternatively, the same DCI may be repeatedly transmitted in a combination of the above examples, for example, CORESETs in which only certain AL and certain indexes have a repetition relationship. A configuration method for such an operation may be divided into an implicit method and an explicit method. According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the implicit method may always apply a fixed value (for example, apply only an index 1 or an AL 16) or use a group of AL values or a group of PDCCH candidate indexes limited according to a repetition level (for example, apply only AL 16 when a repetition level is 2).</p><p id="p-0167" num="0154">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, CORESET <b>604</b> and CORESET <b>606</b> may have the repetition relationship <b>612</b> despite that CORESET <b>604</b> and CORESET <b>606</b> are CORESETs present in different slots, according to the repetition level and offset configuration information. The repetition relationship <b>612</b> may be configured by using other methods. According to an embodiment of the disclosure, CORESETs present in different slots may be restricted from having a repetition relationship according to a repetition level value. For example, when a repetition level is 2 or less, CORESETs having a repetition relationship may be present in different slots, but when the repetition level is 2 or more, CORESETs having a repetition relationship may be fixed to be always in the same slot. In this case, even when CORESETs having a repetition relationship applied by a repetition level or offset configuration are present in different slots, the base station and the UE may determine that CORESETs do not actually have a repetition relationship. The above description is only an example and may be applied to an operation considering an opposite situation.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0155">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the repetition-related parameters described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> may operate independently or only one of the repetition-related parameters may be present. The repetition-related parameter included in the CORESET configuration information described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may configure a situation in which all identical CORESETs except for time resources have a gap and repeatedly mapped by a repetition level in time. The repetition-related parameter included in the search space configuration information described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> may inform whether CORESETs have a repetition relationship or not may be notified via repetition level or offset information after slot level and mini-slot level search cycle configuration information included in the upper layer search space configuration information is configured.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0156">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, when there is no specific restriction in a situation where CORESETs described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are repeated, the UE may determine the number of PDCCH candidates for each AL, value according to upper layer search space information associated with each CORESET. For example, when the repetition level is 2 and the number of PDCCH candidates for all AL values for each COREET is 5, the total number of cases in which the same DCI may be repeatedly transmitted in terms of the UE is 25. Thus, the UE may perform blind combining and decoding for each number of cases. In terms of the UE, the number of blind decoding to be performed increases in proportion to the number of PDCCH candidates configured in the repetition level and CORESET. Thus, a condition of repeatedly transmitting the same DCI needs to be restricted under a separate condition. There may be various methods according to certain conditions for certain DCI to be present in each of repeating CORESETs.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0157">Method 1: Only the same PDCCH Candidate Indexes Allow Repetitive Transmission of the same DCI</p><p id="p-0171" num="0158">The UE may expect that the same DCI is repeatedly transmitted only for PDCCH candidates having the same PDCCH candidate index value for each CORESET. When a certain PDCCH candidate index value is not present in at least one CORESET, the UE does not expect repetitive transmission of the same DCI for the corresponding PDCCH candidate index value.

For example, when third CORESET with respect to total 5 CORESETs having repetition level 5 does not satisfy one of the above conditions, the UE may determine that DCI is repeatedly transmitted only to the remaining 4 CORESETs. In other words, the same DCI is repeatedly transmittable only to valid CORESETs satisfying the conditions from among CORESETs corresponding to a pre-set repetition level. As another example, example, when third CORESET with respect to total 5 CORESETs having repetition level 5 does not satisfy one of the above conditions, the UE may determine that DCI is repeatedly transmitted only to the remaining 4 CORESETs and a CORESET thereafter. In other words, the same DCI is repeatedly transmittable to CORESETs as much as a repetition level value satisfying the condition.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0168">However, the above methods are only an embodiment of the disclosure and may be variously modified. For example, according to an embodiment of the disclosure, the same DCI may not be repeatedly transmitted to CORESET that includes at least one of a certain PDCCH candidate index or a certain AL or that does not include at least one of the certain PDCCH candidate index or the certain AL.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0169">When the CORESET configuration information or the search space configuration information described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b> or <b>6</b></figref> includes the repetition level parameter, an additional operation for determining validity of actually repeated CORESETs may be required. For example, the certain PDCCH candidate may be or may not be repeatedly configured at a certain moment when repeated CORESETs cross a slot boundary, a certain CORESET resource is a reserved resource, or a synchronization signal or system information is transmitted via a physical broadcast channel (PBCH). Conditions for determining validity of repeated CORESETs are as follows.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0170">Condition 1: All repeated CORESETs are present in one slot</p><p id="p-0184" num="0171">In other words, when two CORESETs have a repetition relationship via configuration of a repetition-related parameter, it may be determined that there is no repetition relationship when the two CORESETs are present in different slots. For example, when upper layer information indicates that 5 CORESETs have a repetition relationship and when 3 CORESETs are included in nth slot and the remaining 2 CORESETs are included in n+1th slot, the same DCI may be allowed to be repeatedly transmitted only to the 3 CORESETs included in the nth slot or the same DCI may be allowed to be repeatedly transmitted to the 3 CORESETs included in the nth slot and the same DCI may be allowed to be repeatedly transmitted to the 2 CORESETs included in the n+1th slot.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0172">Condition 2: When a certain CORESET is unable to transmit a PDCCH candidate configured to be repeatedly transmitted, the same DCI for PDCCH candidates may be repeatedly transmitted with respect to the remaining CORESETs excluding the certain CORESET.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0173">However, the above conditions are only an embodiment of the disclosure and may be variously modified. For example, according to an embodiment of the disclosure, when repeatedly transmitted CORESETs cross a slot boundary, whether to repeatedly transmit the same DCI may be determined by comparing a value of a repetition level parameter and a threshold value. Here, the threshold value may be a value set via upper layer signaling or set by the UE. When the value of the repetition level parameter is greater than the threshold value, the same DO may not be repeatedly transmitted to the CORESET crossing the slot boundary. Also, when the repeatedly transmitted CORESETs do not cross the slot boundary or when the value of the repetition level parameter is smaller than the threshold value even when the repeatedly transmitted CORESETs cross the slot boundary, the same DCI may be repeatedly transmitted.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0174">Moreover, according to an embodiment of the disclosure, in the repeatedly transmitted CORESETs, it may be determined whether a CORESET overlaps a resource region with an original CORESET, a synchronization signal, or a PBCH. In the repeatedly transmitted CORESETs, when the CORESET overlaps the resource region with the original CORESET, the synchronization signal, or the PBCH, the same DCI may not be repeatedly transmitted to the overlapping CORESET.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0175">Also, according to an embodiment of the disclosure, when only some PDCCH candidates of the repeatedly transmitted CORESETs overlap, the same DCI may not be repeatedly transmitted to the remaining PDCCH candidates that do not overlap. Here, the same DCI may be repeatedly transmitted by using a PDCCH candidate having a greater AL value next to an AL value of the overlapping PDCCH candidate. For example, when a PDCCH candidate having an AL value 16 among the repeatedly transmitted CORESETs overlaps, the same DCI may not be repeatedly transmitted to the PDCCH candidate having the AL value is 16, the same DCI may be repeatedly transmitted to the PDCCH candidates having the remaining AL values, and the same DCI may be repeatedly transmitted by using a PDCCH candidate having another AL value, for example, a PDCCH candidate having a greater AL value 8 next to 16.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a diagram for describing a data resource assigning method in a situation in which control information according to some embodiments of the disclosure is repeatedly transmitted.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0177">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the same control information is repeatedly transmitted and received in two CORESETs <b>706</b> and <b>708</b>.

However, when the base station transmits the DCI to the UE without the time domain resource assignment field included in the DCI, the UE may need to determine PDSCH or PUSCH time domain resource information assigned via the DCI through another method.

For example, when the base station notifies a certain UE of the time domain resource for PUSCH scheduling, such as DMRS mapping=type A, K<sub>2</sub>=2, S=0, and L=7, via upper layer signaling, the UE may consider that the PUSCH scheduled by the DCI always follows DMRS mapping=type A, K<sub>2</sub>=2, S=0, and L=7.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0194">When some of PUSCH time domain resources scheduled in a TDD situation are DL, the UE may perform PUSCH transmission only for actual UL symbols.
