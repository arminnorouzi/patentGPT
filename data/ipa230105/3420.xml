Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is a broad array of configurations for the exchange of heat between a structure and a geothermal heat exchanger. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one example of a prior art geothermal environmental conditioning system <b>1</b>. As defined herein, geothermal environmental conditioning system <b>1</b> is a heating system and/or a heating and cooling system. The geothermal environmental conditioning system <b>1</b> or geothermal system <b>1</b> as defined herein includes a structure <b>2</b> that is in fluid communication with a heat pump <b>3</b> or other similar device that circulates the fluid in primary pipe <b>4</b> that are identified as supply pipe <b>4</b>A and primary return pipe <b>4</b>B. Supply pipe <b>4</b>A and return pipe <b>4</b>B are positioned below grade level <b>5</b> on a floor of a trench <b>6</b>. The floor of trench <b>6</b> is below the frost line depth. A plurality of heat exchange pipes <b>7</b> are located in a bore hole <b>8</b> and extend out of bore hole <b>8</b> into trench <b>6</b>. A prior art connector <b>9</b> is connected to each pipe of the plurality of pipes <b>7</b> and to supply pipe <b>4</b>A and/or return pipe <b>4</b>B that interface with heat pump <b>3</b>. The prior art connector <b>9</b> has the overall shape of a fan with an array of diverging pipes from a single source all aligned in a single plane. The geothermal system <b>1</b> defines a closed loop fluid heat exchange system between structure <b>2</b>, heat pump <b>3</b>, supply pipe <b>4</b>A, heat exchange pipe <b>7</b> and return pipe <b>4</b>B. The earth surrounding heat exchange pipe <b>7</b> or pipe <b>7</b> that is in bore hole <b>8</b> below the frost line depth and provides a stabilized thermal baseline for the exchange of heat compared to the above ground ambient environment. Pipes <b>7</b> can be positioned on a horizontal floor of trench <b>6</b> that is well below frost line depth or in a bore hole <b>8</b> that can extend hundreds of feet into the earth.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Geothermal systems <b>1</b> are particularly known for their superior performance in delivering energy conserving heating and/or cooling to homes, commercial businesses and industrial buildings in many climates when they can have extended lengths of pipe <b>7</b> for the enhanced exchange of heat. The design of geothermal systems includes singular extended lengths of pipe <b>7</b> for heat exchange with varying prior art connectors such as manifold type connectors <b>9</b> that divide the heat exchange flow into multiple pipes <b>7</b> each with a separate angular alignment. For example, geothermal system <b>1</b> can include prior art connector <b>9</b> that interfaces with supply pipe <b>4</b>A or another portion of pipe <b>7</b> on one end and divides the heat exchange fluid flow into multiple angularly diverging pipes <b>7</b> in the opposed end for the improved heat exchange performance of geothermal system <b>1</b>. A second prior art connector <b>9</b> connects to each pipe <b>7</b> and converges the heat exchange fluid flow from the multiple pipes <b>7</b> into single return pipe <b>4</b>B. See U.S. Pat. No. 9,127,858 to McKeown et al.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In contrast, prior art geothermal system <b>1</b> is a compact helical arrangement of pipes <b>7</b> and the use of prior art connector <b>9</b> with its wide diverging alignment of pipes <b>7</b> is difficult to work on and to connect the diverging alignment of pipes <b>7</b> in the bottom of a confined five (5) foot deep trench. This makes for an unnecessarily complex, time consuming and thereby expensive connection between pipes <b>7</b> and prior art connector <b>9</b> when there are no other manifold type prior art connector <b>9</b> options available for geothermal system <b>1</b> applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Both of the above approaches have been limited by the (1) increased cost of performing a sizable number of connections between pipes <b>7</b> and other pipes <b>7</b> and/or between pipes <b>7</b> and connectors <b>9</b> (or &#x201c;pipe <b>7</b> connections&#x201d;) under field conditions, (2) reduced reliability of making pipe <b>7</b> connections under field environment conditions such as those inside a five foot deep trench, (3) the prior art connector <b>9</b> diverging alignment requires unwinding and separating individual pipes <b>7</b> from their helical arrangement for an alignment with the diverging arrangement of prior art connector <b>9</b> making an overly complicated and time consuming pipe <b>7</b> connections in the field environment, (4) the increased likelihood of field pipe <b>7</b> connection errors which can result in the erroneous routing of the heat exchange fluid through multiple pipes <b>7</b> and decreased performance of geothermal system <b>1</b>. Thus, there is an inherent desire to improve the overall reliability and performance of geothermal systems <b>1</b> by moving as much of the pipe <b>7</b> connections as possible into the factory and away from the additional expenses and reduced reliability associated with field connections of pipe <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Pipe <b>7</b> connections under factory environmentally controlled conditions whether between various types of connectors <b>9</b> such as U-Bend and/or manifold connectors produce more reliable connections, can be more readily tested and as required economically repaired prior to arrival in the field for installation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Undesirable added expenses related to the installation of geothermal systems <b>1</b> include the length of the trenches <b>6</b> that are required to be dug for horizontal systems, the transportation of and connection of the pipes <b>7</b> at the installation site, and bore hole complications. Pipes <b>7</b> can include straight, semi-rigid and/or rigid pipes that have multiple limitations that include the transportation of long sections of pipe <b>7</b> and the manual labor required to unload, position, and connect the multiple extended length of pipes <b>7</b>. Similarly the overcoming of unfavorable bore hole conditions such as outcroppings and irregularities in the bore hole walls that cause geothermal systems <b>1</b> to hang up, for example, and water in the bore hole require specialized adaptions of weight to overcome.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The ideal geothermal system <b>1</b> is one that is produced, assembled, or preassembled in a factory environment for the reliability of the connections, is sufficiently flexible that it can be coiled into a compact arrangement for transportation, can be installed on site with a minimal number of pipe <b>7</b> connections in the field, and has the ability to be installed on site with the needed stiffness, protective coverings, and weight for geothermal system <b>1</b> to overcome the unfavorable bore hole conditions such as those identified herein above.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A new compact manifold connector <b>9</b> and new approaches to stiffen and add weight to the geothermal system <b>1</b> during installation in the bore hole are needed. The new compact manifold connector is needed for a compact helical arrangement of pipes <b>7</b> that does not diverge pipes <b>7</b> on different angles and combines the heat exchange flow of multiple pipes <b>7</b> in a bore hole <b>8</b> in a singular alignment with central conduit for connection to a larger diameter supply pipe <b>4</b>A and/or return pipe <b>4</b>B. The new approaches overcome unfavorable bore hole conditions during the installation of geothermal system <b>1</b> in a bore hole include for example the shielding of the distal end portion of the geothermal system <b>1</b>, an elongate and stiff weight located in the distal end portion of the geothermal system <b>1</b> that can overcome bore hole outcroppings and irregularities while staying aligned with the bore hole and penetrate through water to the bottom of the bore hole.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Heretofore there has not been a high efficiency compact and flexible arrangement of multiple pipes <b>7</b> for geothermal heat exchange that has been assembled in the factory, can be coiled for ease of transportation, uncoiled on site, installed pre-assembled into a bore hole with at least one fitting connected to a plurality of pipes and to lengths of primary pipes <b>4</b> and connected to the central conduit below grade in the bore hole, the fitting having a dimensional fit and form design for positioning in the borehole and the lengths of the primary pipes <b>4</b> extending from the borehole for connection directly to supply pipe <b>4</b>A and return pipe <b>4</b>B for geothermal heat exchange that further includes a stiff weight in the assembly and/or the ability to partially disassemble the geothermal system <b>1</b> at the installation site to install a desired type and amount of weight <b>100</b> into the distal end portion of the geothermal system <b>1</b> to overcome unfavorable bore hole conditions.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure is a novel structure of a geothermal heat exchange apparatus wherein the geothermal heat exchange apparatus is preassembled in a factory for installation into a bore hole and connection with the primary pipe for supply and the primary pipe for return of the heat exchange fluid. Specifically, the geothermal heat exchange apparatus includes the twisting of a plurality of pipes onto a central conduit and the connection of manifold fittings to the plurality of pipes in a compact minimum diameter form that can be inserted into a borehole. It is understood that while it is preferred to minimize the diameter of the borehole, there are applications in which the minimum diameter borehole is not necessarily the most desired or preferred approach for heat exchange. It can also be desirable to drill the borehole to a desired diameter vice the minimum diameter for the installation of the compact geothermal heat exchange apparatus. The pre-assembled structure of the geothermal heat exchange apparatus makes more efficient use of the borehole space by placing more pipe and at least one manifold fitting into the borehole in a compact spaced arrangement for heat transfer. The unique structural arrangement of the geothermal heat exchange apparatus creates additional surface area for heat transfer surface through flexible thin-walled pipes in a small diameter borehole. The twisted plurality of pipes is wrapped in helical arrangement that is in contact with the central conduit such that the interface between the plurality of pipes and the central conduit bind the plurality of pipes into a fixed position on the central conduit. In addition, bands or straps can be used to further connect the plurality of pipes on the central conduit. This structural arrangement also provides support for retaining the relative position of each pipe during installation in a relatively tight borehole. The flexible nature of the central conduit and the plurality of pipes in a twisted arrangement is easily coiled and transported in a roll to a job site.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An arrangement of flexible pipes for geothermal heat exchange is described that comprises a central conduit and a plurality of pipes. The central conduit has a tubular structure that includes a first end portion and an opposed second end portion. The central conduit defines an aperture in the first end portion that is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the central conduit and extends the first end portion and the second end portion.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each pipe of the plurality of pipes has a first end portion and an opposed second end portion. Each pipe has a tubular structure that preferably has a circular cross-section. The plurality of pipes is twisted around the central conduit in an approximately parallel arrangement and in an approximately fixed spaced separation that defines a gap between adjacent pipes. Each pipe of the plurality of pipes is positioned in direct contact with the central conduit. The second end portion of each pipe of the plurality of pipes is connected to a joint. The joint receives and redirects the flow from at least two supply pipes of the plurality of pipes to at least two return pipes of the plurality of pipes. The geothermal heat exchange apparatus is flexible and is coilable or can be coiled into a roll. The first end portion of each pipe of the plurality of pipes is adapted to connect to the at least one fitting and the at least one fitting connects through the primary pipes to an external environmental control system for the transfer of a liquid that is a heat exchange medium through the plurality of pipes. The plurality of pipes provides an extended arcuate pathway for the exchange of heat between the liquid and the earth. The external environmental control system at least includes heating and/or cooling.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The geothermal heat exchange apparatus is structured and pre-assembled for installation in a borehole. The geothermal heat exchange apparatus or apparatus includes a pre-assembled plurality of pipes in a twisted arrangement around a central conduit for geothermal heat exchange and connection to the primary pipes that provide fluid flow to the heat pump. The apparatus in one preferred embodiment comprises a central conduit, a plurality of pipes, at least one fitting and a joint. The central conduit or conduit has a first diameter, a first end portion that includes a first terminal end, a second end portion that is opposed to the first end portion, and the second end portion includes a second terminal end. The central conduit includes a center portion of that is continuous with and in fluid communication with the first end portion and the second end portion. The first end portion, central portion and second end portion define a through aperture that extends the length between the first terminal end and the second terminal end. The central conduit is flexible.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each pipe of the plurality of pipes has a first end portion, a center portion and an opposed second end portion. The first end portion is aligned with the central conduit and includes a first terminal end. The center portion is in direct contact with and has a helical arrangement around the central conduit. The center portion of the plurality of pipes is in fluid communication with the first end portion and the second end portion of the plurality of pipes. The second end portion of the plurality of pipes is aligned with the central conduit and includes a second terminal end. Each pipe defines an aperture that extends the length between the first terminal end and the second terminal end of the pipe. Each pipe of the plurality of pipes is flexible. The second end portion of the plurality of pipes is at least partially in direct contact with the central conduit. The plurality of pipes is bound to the central conduit by the helical arrangement. Bands can be used to further fix and bind the plurality of pipes to the central conduit. The plurality of pipes includes at least two pipes that are supply pipes and at least two pipes that are return pipes. Each pipe of the plurality of pipes has a second diameter that is less than the first diameter. The first end portion of each pipe of the plurality of pipes is connected to one fitting and the second end portion of each pipe of the plurality of pipes is connected to the joint.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The at least one fitting is a manifold connector. Each fitting has a first end portion that includes a first aperture and an opposed second end portion that includes at least two second apertures. The first aperture connects to a primary pipe and the at least two second apertures connect to at least two pipes of the plurality of pipes. The first aperture has a straight alignment and is in fluid communication with the first end portions of the at least two pipes. The at least two second apertures and first aperture of the at least one fitting and the second end portion of the at least two primary pipes connect in the first straight alignment. The first straight alignment is aligned with the central conduit. The at least one fitting is in direct contact with, connected to and is fixed in position on the first end portion of the central conduit. The first end portion of the central conduit extends beyond the at least one fitting.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The joint as defined herein can include one or more sub-assemblies such as fittings, connectors, and U-bends. The joint includes a first end portion and an opposing second end portion. The first end portion of the joint connects to the second end portion of the plurality of pipes. The joint provides fluid communication from the at least two pipes that are supply pipes of the plurality of pipes to at least two pipes that are return pipes of the plurality of pipes.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The at least one fitting of the apparatus can be further defined as at least two fittings or two fittings. In this preferred embodiment, each fitting is an identical manifold connector. Each fitting has a first terminal end and an opposed and aligned second terminal end. The first terminal ends of the fittings connect to one of the supply or return primary pipes and the second terminal ends of the fittings connect to the second terminal ends of at least two of the plurality of pipes that are supply pipes and at least two of the plurality of pipes that are return pipes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Alternatively, the at least one fitting can be a single manifold connector. The single fitting embodiment is in fluid communication with one primary pipe that is a supply pipe and one primary pipe that is a return pipe. The fitting is also in fluid communication with at least two pipes of the plurality of pipes that are supply pipes and at least two pipes of the plurality of pipes that are return pipes. The single fitting is configured for connection to the first end portion of the central conduit and positioning in the bore hole.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The joint in one embodiment includes two fittings.

A first terminal end of each fitting connects to one of the terminal ends of a U-bend. The U-bend connects the plurality of pipes that are supply pipes to the plurality of pipes that are return pipes.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The joint in another embodiment includes at least two fittings. The second end portions of the fittings connect to at least two pipes of the plurality of pipes that are supply pipes and at least two pipes of the plurality of pipes that are return pipes. The first end portions of the fittings are capped to terminate the fluid flow through the first aperture and redirect the fluid flow between the two pairs of at least two pipes of the plurality of pipes.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The joint with at least two fittings can include the positioning of each fitting in a staggered arrangement along the central axis of the apparatus or in a tandem arrangement on opposing sides of the central axis of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The joint can also be a manifold connector that includes a first end portion and an opposed second end portion. The first end portion connects to and is in fluid communication with the second terminal ends of the plurality of pipes. The second end portion includes a reservoir that is in fluid communication with at least two pipes that are supply pipes and at least pipes that are return pipes.

The geothermal heat exchange apparatus <b>10</b> includes the central conduit <b>12</b>, plurality of pipes <b>14</b>, at least one fitting <b>16</b> and at least one joint <b>18</b>. The plurality of pipes <b>14</b> is twisted onto central conduit <b>12</b> in the helical arrangement for the exchange of heat.

The at least two primary pipes <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B are connected to at least one fitting <b>16</b> for fluid communication with heat pump <b>3</b>. The at least one joint <b>18</b> connects the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> to form a continuous loop for geothermal heat exchange. Geothermal heat exchange apparatus <b>10</b> or apparatus <b>10</b> defines a first longitudinal axis-X aligned with the centerline of central conduit <b>12</b>. The elongate shape of the geothermal heat exchange apparatus defines a proximal direction as being from the at least one joint <b>18</b> to the at least one fitting <b>16</b> and the distal direction to be from the at least one fitting <b>16</b> to the at least one joint <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, central conduit <b>12</b> is a standard tubular conduit. Central conduit <b>12</b> or conduit <b>12</b> has a flexible structure that includes a first end portion <b>20</b> and a second end portion <b>22</b>. The first end portion <b>20</b> and second end portion <b>22</b> are opposed. First end portion <b>20</b> defines a first terminal end <b>24</b> and second end portion <b>22</b> defines a second terminal end <b>26</b>. Central conduit <b>12</b> defines an aperture <b>28</b> that extends between the first terminal end <b>24</b> and second terminal end <b>26</b>. Aperture <b>28</b> is a through hole that extends the length of central conduit <b>12</b>. In one preferred embodiment, the dimensions of central conduit <b>12</b> include an inside diameter of approximately one and nine-tenths (1.9) inches, outside diameter of approximately two and four-tenths (2.4) inches and a tubular wall thickness of approximately six hundred twenty five thousandths ( 1/16th or 0.0625) inches.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Central conduit <b>12</b> preferably has corrugated tubular walls that enhance the ability of central conduit to flex and form a circular or coiled shape. It is understood that the dimensions of the central conduit can vary depending upon the intended geothermal heat exchange application. The tubular wall of central conduit <b>12</b> can be solid or include a plurality of apertures <b>29</b>. The shape of apertures <b>29</b> is shown as being circular, but it is understood that apertures <b>29</b> can have any shape and/or directional alignment suitable for facilitating the flow of a material such as grout <b>92</b> from conduit <b>12</b> through apertures <b>29</b>. The central conduit <b>12</b> is not in fluid communication with the plurality of pipes,</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The plurality of pipes <b>14</b> includes a first end portion <b>30</b>, an opposed second end portion <b>32</b> and a central portion <b>33</b>. The first end portion <b>30</b> of the plurality of pipes when positioned in bore hole <b>8</b> is below grade <b>5</b>, the center portion includes the helical twisting arrangement and the second end portion <b>32</b> is in proximity to the terminal end of the bore hole <b>8</b>. In this preferred embodiment, the geothermal heat exchange apparatus <b>10</b> has a proximal end portion that includes at least one fitting <b>16</b>, the first end portion <b>30</b> of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b>, and the first end portion <b>20</b> of the central conduit <b>12</b> and a distal end portion that includes the at least one joint <b>18</b>, second end portion of the plurality of pipes <b>32</b> of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b>, and second end portion <b>22</b> of central conduit <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Each pipe <b>15</b> of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> has a flexible tubular structure that includes a first end portion <b>30</b> and an opposed second end portion <b>32</b>. First end portion <b>30</b> includes a first terminal end <b>34</b> and second end portion <b>32</b> includes a second terminal end <b>36</b>. The first terminal end <b>34</b> and second terminal end <b>36</b> define an aperture <b>38</b> that is a through hole that extends the length of each pipe <b>15</b>. The diameter of aperture <b>38</b> of pipe <b>15</b> can vary depending upon the intended heat exchange application. In one preferred embodiment, individual pipes <b>15</b> of the plurality pipes <b>14</b> are standard &#xbe; or 0.75 inch inside diameter pipes <b>15</b> with a standard wall thickness of approximately 0.078 inch. The inside diameter and wall thickness of each pipe <b>15</b> of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> is varied to accommodate the liquid flow and/or heat exchange demand for a given application. Primary pipe <b>4</b> preferably has an interior diameter of one and one-quarter (1.25) inches, but it is understood that the diameters of pipes <b>15</b> and primary pipe <b>4</b> can vary depending upon the application of geothermal heat exchange apparatus <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Geothermal heat exchange apparatus <b>10</b> is structured for positioning in a bore hole <b>8</b>. The diameter and length of bore hole <b>8</b> and apparatus <b>10</b> can vary depending upon its intended application for heat exchange. In this one preferred embodiment, bore hole <b>8</b> has a six (6) inch diameter and apparatus <b>10</b> includes eight (8) pipes <b>15</b> that are wound around conduit <b>12</b> in the helical arrangement. The function of the helical arrangement of the eight (8) pipes <b>15</b> can vary, but the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> typically includes four (4) supply pipes <b>15</b> and four (4) return pipes <b>15</b>. One common length of apparatus <b>10</b> is approximately 300 feet.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The materials of construction of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> and fluid flow therein are controlled by local ordinances, building codes and environmental laws. In this preferred embodiment, the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> is made from a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) material.

Twisted onto as defined herein includes positioning the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> in direct contact with central conduit <b>12</b> in a helical arrangement. In the preferred embodiment the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> is positioned in an approximately parallel helical arrangement around the central conduit <b>12</b>. Each pipe <b>15</b> of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> is fixed in position in direct contact with central conduit <b>12</b> and has a space or a gap <b>40</b> between pipes <b>15</b>. Each pipe <b>15</b> of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> is positioned in approximate fixed spaced separation on central conduit <b>12</b> relative to the adjacent pipe <b>15</b> of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b>. Individual pipes <b>15</b> of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> can vary in their respective inside diameters, their length, the quantity of pipes <b>15</b> in the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> and the arrangement of pipes <b>15</b> on central conduit <b>12</b> depending upon the intended application of geothermal heat exchange apparatus <b>10</b>. For example, in one preferred embodiment, plurality of pipes <b>14</b> includes a total of eight (8) pipes <b>15</b> in a twisted arrangement around the conduit <b>12</b>. While this embodiment as shown includes four (4) pipes <b>15</b> that are supply pipes and four (4) pipes <b>15</b> that are return pipes, alternative embodiments of apparatus <b>10</b> can include two (2) pairs of pipes <b>15</b> with one (1) pair of pipes <b>15</b> being supply pipes <b>15</b> and the one (1) pair of pipes <b>15</b> being return pipes <b>15</b> or six (6) supply pipes <b>15</b> and six (6) return pipes <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The first end portion <b>30</b> and the second end portion <b>32</b> of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> on central conduit <b>12</b> include a transition from the helical arrangement to a straight alignment with the central conduit and axis-X. The length of the straight alignment of the plurality of pipes <b>14</b> in first end portion <b>30</b> and second end portion <b>32</b> can vary, but is preferably three (3) to four (4) feet due primarily to the stiffness of pipes <b>15</b> and due to the straight length of pipe required to properly fuse the fitting onto the pipes. A straight alignment with each pipe <b>15</b> into each fitting <b>16</b> and primary pipe <b>4</b>A or <b>4</b>B is required because of the dimensional, form and fit limitations necessitated by the positioning of fittings <b>16</b> on conduit <b>12</b> that will be located in the six (6) inch diameter bore hole <b>8</b>. The straight alignments of pipe <b>15</b>, fitting <b>16</b>, joint <b>18</b> and primary pipe <b>4</b> also make a less complex and more reliable connection.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, fitting <b>16</b> is a non-standard and unique manifold connector specifically dimensioned for positioning in bore hole <b>8</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).
