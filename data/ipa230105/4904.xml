Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It will be readily understood that the instant components, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, may be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following detailed description of the embodiments of at least one of a method, apparatus, non-transitory computer readable medium and system, as represented in the attached figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the application as claimed but is merely representative of selected embodiments.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Communications between the transport(s) and certain entities, such as remote servers, other transports and local computing devices (e.g., smartphones, personal computers, transport-embedded computers, etc.) may be sent and/or received, and processed by one or more &#x2018;components&#x2019; which may be hardware, firmware, software or a combination thereof. The components may be part of any of these entities or computing devices or certain other computing devices. In one example, consensus decisions related to blockchain transactions may be performed by one or more computing devices or components (which may be any element described and/or depicted herein) associated with the transport(s) and one or more of the components outside or at a remote location from the transport(s).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The instant features, structures, or characteristics as described throughout this specification may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. For example, the usage of the phrases &#x201c;example embodiments&#x201d;, &#x201c;some embodiments&#x201d;, or other similar language, throughout this specification refers to the fact that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases &#x201c;example embodiments&#x201d;, &#x201c;in some embodiments&#x201d;, &#x201c;in other embodiments&#x201d;, or other similar language, throughout this specification do not necessarily all refer to the same group of embodiments, and the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the diagrams, any connection between elements can permit one-way and/or two-way communication even if the depicted connection is a one-way or two-way arrow. In the current solution, a transport may include one or more of cars, trucks, walking area battery electric vehicle (BEV), e-Palette, fuel cell bus, motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, boats, recreational vehicles, planes, and any object that may be used to transport people and or goods from one location to another.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, while the term &#x201c;message&#x201d; may have been used in the description of embodiments, other types of network data, such as, a packet, frame, datagram, etc. may also be used. Furthermore, while certain types of messages and signaling may be depicted in exemplary embodiments they are not limited to a certain type of message and signaling.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Example embodiments provide methods, systems, components, non-transitory computer readable medium, devices, and/or networks, which provide at least one of: a transport (also referred to as a vehicle or car herein), a data collection system, a data monitoring system, a verification system, an authorization system and a vehicle data distribution system. The vehicle status condition data, received in the form of communication messages, such as wireless data network communications and/or wired communication messages, may be processed to identify vehicle/transport status conditions and provide feedback as to the condition and/or changes of a transport. In one example, a user profile may be applied to a particular transport/vehicle to authorize a current vehicle event, service stops at service stations, to authorize subsequent vehicle rental services, and enable vehicle to vehicle communications.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Within the communication infrastructure, a decentralized database is a distributed storage system, which includes multiple nodes that communicate with each other. A blockchain is an example of a decentralized database, which includes an append-only immutable data structure (i.e. a distributed ledger) capable of maintaining records between untrusted parties. The untrusted parties are referred to herein as peers, nodes or peer nodes. Each peer maintains a copy of the database records and no single peer can modify the database records without a consensus being reached among the distributed peers. For example, the peers may execute a consensus protocol to validate blockchain storage entries, group the storage entries into blocks, and build a hash chain via the blocks. This process forms the ledger by ordering the storage entries, as is necessary, for consistency. In a public or permissionless blockchain, anyone can participate without a specific identity. Public blockchains can involve crypto-currencies and use consensus based on various protocols such as proof of work (PoW). Conversely, a permissioned blockchain database can secure interactions among a group of entities, which share a common goal, but which do not or cannot fully trust one another, such as businesses that exchange funds, goods, information, and the like. The instant solution can function in a permissioned and/or a permissionless blockchain setting.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Smart contracts are trusted distributed applications, which leverage tamper-proof properties of the shared or distributed ledger (which may be in the form of a blockchain) and an underlying agreement between member nodes, which is referred to as an endorsement or endorsement policy. In general, blockchain entries are &#x201c;endorsed&#x201d; before being committed to the blockchain while entries, which are not endorsed are disregarded. A typical endorsement policy allows smart contract executable code to specify endorsers for an entry in the form of a set of peer nodes that are necessary for endorsement. When a client sends the entry to the peers specified in the endorsement policy, the entry is executed to validate the entry. After validation, the entries enter an ordering phase in which a consensus protocol is used to produce an ordered sequence of endorsed entries grouped into blocks.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Nodes are the communication entities of the blockchain system. A &#x201c;node&#x201d; may perform a logical function in the sense that multiple nodes of different types can run on the same physical server. Nodes are grouped in trust domains and are associated with logical entities that control them in various ways. Nodes may include different types, such as a client or submitting-client node, which submits an entry-invocation to an endorser (e.g., peer), and broadcasts entry-proposals to an ordering service (e.g., ordering node). Another type of node is a peer node, which can receive client submitted entries, commit the entries and maintain a state and a copy of the ledger of blockchain entries. Peers can also have the role of an endorser. An ordering-service-node or orderer is a node running the communication service for all nodes, and which implements a delivery guarantee, such as a broadcast to each of the peer nodes in the system when committing entries and modifying a world state of the blockchain. The world state can constitute the initial blockchain entry, which normally includes control and setup information.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A ledger is a sequenced, tamper-resistant record of all state transitions of a blockchain. State transitions may result from smart contract executable code invocations (i.e., entries) submitted by participating parties (e.g., client nodes, ordering nodes, endorser nodes, peer nodes, etc.). An entry may result in a set of asset key-value pairs being committed to the ledger as one or more operands, such as creates, updates, deletes, and the like. The ledger includes a blockchain (also referred to as a chain), which is used to store an immutable, sequenced record in blocks. The ledger also includes a state database, which maintains a current state of the blockchain. There is typically one ledger per channel. Each peer node maintains a copy of the ledger for each channel of which they are a member.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A chain is an entry log structured as hash-linked blocks, and each block contains a sequence of N entries where N is equal to or greater than one. The block header includes a hash of the blocks' entries, as well as a hash of the prior block's header. In this way, all entries on the ledger may be sequenced and cryptographically linked together. Accordingly, it is not possible to tamper with the ledger data without breaking the hash links. A hash of a most recently added blockchain block represents every entry on the chain that has come before it, making it possible to ensure that all peer nodes are in a consistent and trusted state. The chain may be stored on a peer node file system (i.e., local, attached storage, cloud, etc.), efficiently supporting the append-only nature of the blockchain workload.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The current state of the immutable ledger represents the latest values for all keys that are included in the chain entry log. Since the current state represents the latest key values known to a channel, it is sometimes referred to as a world state. Smart contract executable code invocations execute entries against the current state data of the ledger. To make these smart contract executable code interactions efficient, the latest values of the keys may be stored in a state database. The state database may be simply an indexed view into the chain's entry log and can therefore be regenerated from the chain at any time. The state database may automatically be recovered (or generated if needed) upon peer node startup, and before entries are accepted.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A blockchain is different from a traditional database in that the blockchain is not a central storage but rather a decentralized, immutable, and secure storage, where nodes must share in changes to records in the storage. Some properties that are inherent in blockchain and which help implement the blockchain include, but are not limited to, an immutable ledger, smart contracts, security, privacy, decentralization, consensus, endorsement, accessibility, and the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Example embodiments provide a service to a particular vehicle and/or a user profile that is applied to the vehicle. For example, a user may be the owner of a vehicle or the operator of a vehicle owned by another party. The vehicle may require service at certain intervals and the service needs may require authorization prior to permitting the services to be received. Also, service centers may offer services to vehicles in a nearby area based on the vehicle's current route plan and a relative level of service requirements (e.g., immediate, severe, intermediate, minor, etc.). The vehicle needs may be monitored via one or more vehicle and/or road sensors or cameras, which report sensed data to a central controller computer device in and/or apart from the vehicle. This data is forwarded to a management server for review and action. A sensor may be located on one or more of the interior of the transport, the exterior of the transport, on a fixed object apart from the transport, and on another transport proximate the transport. The sensor may also be associated with the transport's speed, the transport's braking, the transport's acceleration, fuel levels, service needs, the gear-shifting of the transport, the transport's steering, and the like. A sensor, as described herein, may also be a device, such as a wireless device in and/or proximate to the transport. Also, sensor information may be used to identify whether the vehicle is operating safely and whether an occupant has engaged in any unexpected vehicle conditions, such as during a vehicle access and/or utilization period. Vehicle information collected before, during and/or after a vehicle's operation may be identified and stored in a transaction on a shared/distributed ledger, which may be generated and committed to the immutable ledger as determined by a permission granting consortium, and thus in a &#x201c;decentralized&#x201d; manner, such as via a blockchain membership group.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each interested party (i.e., owner, user, company, agency, etc.) may want to limit the exposure of private information, and therefore the blockchain and its immutability can be used to manage permissions for each particular user vehicle profile. A smart contract may be used to provide compensation, quantify a user profile score/rating/review, apply vehicle event permissions, determine when service is needed, identify a collision and/or degradation event, identify a safety concern event, identify parties to the event and provide distribution to registered entities seeking access to such vehicle event data. Also, the results may be identified, and the necessary information can be shared among the registered companies and/or individuals based on a consensus approach associated with the blockchain. Such an approach could not be implemented on a traditional centralized database.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Various driving systems of the instant solution can utilize software, an array of sensors as well as machine learning functionality, light detection and ranging (LIDAR) projectors, radar, ultrasonic sensors, etc. to create a map of terrain and road that a transport can use for navigation and other purposes. In some embodiments, GPS, maps, cameras, sensors and the like can also be used in autonomous vehicles in place of LIDAR.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The instant solution includes, in certain embodiments, authorizing a vehicle for service via an automated and quick authentication scheme. For example, driving up to a charging station or fuel pump may be performed by a vehicle operator or an autonomous transport and the authorization to receive charge or fuel may be performed without any delays provided the authorization is received by the service and/or charging station. A vehicle may provide a communication signal that provides an identification of a vehicle that has a currently active profile linked to an account that is authorized to accept a service, which can be later rectified by compensation. Additional measures may be used to provide further authentication, such as another identifier may be sent from the user's device wirelessly to the service center to replace or supplement the first authorization effort between the transport and the service center with an additional authorization effort.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Data shared and received may be stored in a database, which maintains data in one single database (e.g., database server) and generally at one particular location. This location is often a central computer, for example, a desktop central processing unit (CPU), a server CPU, or a mainframe computer. Information stored on a centralized database is typically accessible from multiple different points. A centralized database is easy to manage, maintain, and control, especially for purposes of security because of its single location. Within a centralized database, data redundancy is minimized as a single storing place of all data also implies that a given set of data only has one primary record. A blockchain may be used for storing transport-related data and transactions.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Any of the actions described herein may be performed by one or more processors (such as a microprocessor, a sensor, an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), a head unit, and the like) which may be located on-board or off-board the transport. The one or more processors may communicate with other processors on-board or off-board other transports to utilize data being sent by the transport. The one or more processors and the other processors can send data, receive data, and utilize this data to perform one or more of the actions described or depicted herein.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example flow diagram <b>100</b> of energy offset benefits, according to example embodiments. A system may include an entity <b>110</b>, one or more servers <b>120</b>, and one or more other entities <b>130</b>. Entities <b>110</b>, <b>130</b> may include physical locations such as buildings or transports that utilize energy in some form. Energy may include electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, energy from fossil fuel sources, and/or energy from one or more renewable sources. Entities <b>110</b>, <b>130</b> may be wired to or wirelessly coupled to the one or more servers <b>120</b> (referred to as server <b>120</b>, although it should be understood that server <b>120</b> may include multiple devices. Server <b>120</b> is a computing device that includes one or more processors and memories. Server <b>120</b> may include any type of computing device, including but not limited to hardware or virtual servers, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, smart-watches, wearable computers and the like.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, a processor of the server <b>120</b> may determine a current environmental factor <b>114</b>. For example, the current environmental factor <b>114</b> may be an external temperature, where it is 90 degrees outside, and the server <b>120</b> may inform the entity <b>110</b> to not enable an air conditioner. This may be during a high demand period and therefore the amount of energy offset <b>124</b> may be higher during that period. In one embodiment, the current environmental factor <b>114</b> may be related to a location of the server <b>120</b>. In another embodiment, the server <b>112</b> may not be located in proximity to the entity <b>110</b> and determining the current environmental factor <b>114</b> may need to take into account a difference between environmental conditions at a location of the entity <b>110</b> and environmental conditions at a location of the server <b>112</b>. In that case, the server <b>120</b> may determine the current environmental factor <b>114</b> after receiving environmental data <b>112</b> from the entity <b>110</b>. Environmental data <b>112</b> may include a temperature, a pressure, a time of day, a daylight condition, a wind speed, precipitation data, and the like.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, a server <b>120</b> may be physically located in a warm climate such as in Florida. A warm climate may have a corresponding low environmental factor (e.g., &#x2018;3&#x2019;). An entity <b>110</b> may be located in Scandinavia, where a cold climate may be present with a corresponding high environmental factor <b>114</b> (e.g., &#x2018;8&#x2019;). The entity <b>110</b>, as a consumer of energy, may have a greater importance in the calculation of the current environmental factor <b>114</b> than the server <b>120</b>. Therefore, it would be beneficial for the server <b>120</b> to consider the received environmental data <b>112</b> from the entity <b>110</b> rather than any environmental data associated with the location of the server <b>120</b> for the current environmental factor <b>114</b> calculation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the entity <b>110</b> may include one or more sensors coupled to a processor, and the processor of the entity <b>110</b> may measure energy use <b>116</b> by the entity <b>110</b> by measuring the one or more sensors. The energy use <b>116</b> may be an instantaneous value, a value over a time period, or a statistically averaged or normalized value. The entity <b>110</b> processor may provide the entity energy use <b>118</b> to the server <b>120</b> one time, at regular intervals, when the entity energy use <b>118</b> exceeds a threshold, or at any time.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, a processor associated with the server <b>120</b> may determine a modified use of energy <b>122</b> of the entity <b>110</b>. The modified use of energy <b>122</b> may be based on the current environmental factor <b>114</b>, the entity energy use <b>118</b>, or a combination of the current environmental factor <b>114</b> and the entity energy use <b>118</b>. Once the modified use of energy <b>122</b> has been determined, the processor of the server <b>120</b> may calculate an energy offset <b>124</b> for the entity <b>110</b>. The energy offset <b>124</b> may be a carbon or non-carbon offset and provide an indication of current energy use by the entity <b>110</b>, compared with an energy use goal, an allocated energy amount, or expected energy use by the entity <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, a processor of the server <b>120</b> may transmit the entity energy offset <b>128</b> to the entity <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, a processor associated with the entity <b>110</b> may utilize the entity energy offset <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The system <b>100</b> may include one or more other entities <b>130</b>. In one embodiment, a processor associated with another entity <b>130</b> may measure energy use <b>126</b>, as previously described with respect to the entity <b>110</b>, and provide the other entity energy use <b>132</b> to the server <b>120</b>. After receiving the other entity energy use <b>132</b>, the processor of the server <b>120</b> may determine a negative balance <b>134</b> exists with respect to the other entity <b>130</b>. Additionally, the processor of the server <b>120</b> may determine an alternative benefit <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one embodiment, the energy offset <b>124</b> may include a positive value and in response a processor of the server <b>120</b> may sell a portion of the offset to the other entity <b>130</b> and reduce the negative balance <b>134</b> in proportion to the portion of the offset. Energy credits (or carbon credits) may be reflected in the energy offset <b>124</b> and may be sold to other entities <b>130</b> that may currently have a negative balance. In this manner, the entity <b>110</b> may earn revenue or other benefit (for example, a future credit against energy usage) while helping the environment at the same time.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the energy offset <b>124</b> may include a negative value and in response a processor of the server <b>120</b> may identify another entity <b>130</b> that includes another energy offset that includes a positive value, determine the positive value includes a greater magnitude than the negative balance <b>134</b>, and request purchase of a quantity of the other energy offset that overcomes the negative balance <b>134</b>. This may allow an entity <b>110</b> currently having a negative energy offset <b>124</b> (i.e., the entity <b>110</b> has used more energy than expected or allocated) to purchase needed energy from another entity <b>130</b> having a currently positive energy offset. For example, the server <b>120</b> may include a data structure in a memory or data storage location that stores energy offsets for the entity <b>110</b> and one or more other entities <b>130</b>. The server <b>120</b> may calculate or receive energy offsets (perhaps from another server <b>120</b>) and store the latest or current energy offsets <b>124</b>. The server <b>120</b> may identify an energy offset <b>124</b> that includes a positive value from the data structure, and because the data structure may include a correspondence between entities <b>110</b>, <b>130</b> and energy offsets <b>124</b>, the server <b>120</b> may select the corresponding entity <b>110</b>, <b>130</b> to the current energy offset <b>124</b> with the positive value.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, a processor of the server <b>120</b> may monitor the current environmental factor <b>114</b> for an improved condition and determine the improved condition has been achieved. The modified use of energy <b>122</b> may include a reduced use of energy until the improved condition has been achieved. The improved condition may reflect a lower environmental temperature, a precipitation level, a wind level, or an energy demand load. For example, a wind level within a range may reflect an expected energy contribution to a grid from a wind power source.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, the current environmental factor <b>114</b> may be based on a total use of energy and environmental conditions at a location of the entity <b>110</b>. For example, the total use of energy from a microgrid may be limited to those entities <b>110</b>, <b>130</b> that have previously utilized energy consuming devices in a most environmentally friendly manner, thus saving the energy in the microgrid for those entities <b>110</b>, <b>130</b> that most deserve it and promote better use of electricity for others. In one embodiment, a processor of the server <b>120</b> may calculate a lower current environmental factor <b>114</b> after receiving the entity energy use <b>118</b>, which may reflect the total use of energy. If the entity energy use <b>118</b> is high, the processor may derate the current environmental factor <b>114</b> even if the received environmental data <b>112</b> reflects a higher energy need by the entity <b>110</b>. If the entity energy use <b>118</b> is low, the processor may increase the current environmental factor <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, a processor of the entity <b>110</b> may receive a signal. In response, the entity <b>110</b> may allow a reduced modified use of energy in response to receiving a higher signal or allow an increased modified use of energy by the entity in response to receiving a lower signal. In one embodiment, the signal may be an energy cost, a history of energy usage by the entity <b>110</b>, a history of selling or purchasing energy credits by the entity <b>110</b>, an indication of the availability of clean energy, or previous transactions with other entities <b>130</b>. For example, in warmer climates, a thermostat may be lowered, which may result in less efficient appliance use. A price signal may be delivered to the entity <b>110</b> based on the usage of the energy, such as a weekly cost. For example, next week, the entity <b>110</b> may pay a certain amount per kilowatt hour (KwH) to consume a similar amount of energy as was consumed this week.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, a processor of the entity <b>110</b> may determine a reduced energy offset <b>124</b> compared with a previous energy offset, determine a combination of the modified use of energy <b>122</b> and the current environmental factor <b>114</b> are above a threshold, and delay use of energy, by the entity <b>110</b>, in response to the combination is below the threshold. In one embodiment, the threshold may reflect a level above which energy costs sharply increase. By delaying use of the energy, it may be possible for the cost of energy usage to decline before it is used. For example, a processor of the entity <b>110</b> may delay usage of energy until the combination of the modified use of energy <b>122</b> and the current environmental factor <b>114</b> are below the threshold.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a transport network diagram <b>200</b>, according to example embodiments.

For example, a user might want to share a membership, and if so, associated transactions are stored in a blockchain or traditional database. When the subscribed materials are requested by a user, who is not a primary subscriber, a blockchain node (i.e., a transport) can verify that a person requesting a service is an authorized person with whom the subscriber has shared the profile.

To prevent unauthorized physical access, a transport is equipped with a secure access system such as a keyless entry in one embodiment. Meanwhile, security protocols are added to a transport's computers and computer networks to facilitate secure remote communications to and from the transport in one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are nodes within a transport that control tasks such as activating the windshield wipers to tasks such as an anti-lock brake system. ECUs are often connected to one another through the transport's central network, which may be referred to as a controller area network (CAN). State of the art features such as autonomous driving are strongly reliant on the implementation of new, complex ECUs such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), sensors, and the like. While these new technologies have helped improve the safety and driving experience of a transport, they have also increased the number of externally-communicating units inside of the transport making them more vulnerable to attack. Below are some examples of protecting the transport from physical intrusion and remote intrusion.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>J</figref> illustrates a keyless entry system <b>290</b>B to prevent unauthorized physical access to a transport <b>291</b>B, according to example embodiments. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>J</figref>, a key fob <b>292</b>B transmits commands to a transport <b>291</b>B using radio frequency signals in one embodiment. In this example, the key fob <b>292</b>B includes a transmitter <b>2921</b>B with an antenna that is capable of sending short-range wireless radio signals. The transport <b>291</b>B includes a receiver <b>2911</b>B with an antenna that is capable of receiving the short-range wireless signal transmitted from the transmitter <b>2921</b>B. The key fob <b>292</b>B and the transport <b>291</b>B also include CPUs <b>2922</b>B and <b>2913</b>B, respectively, which control the respective devices. Here, a memory of the CPUs <b>2922</b>B and <b>2913</b>B (or accessible to the CPUs). Each of the key fob <b>292</b>B and the transport <b>291</b>B includes power supplies <b>2924</b>B and <b>2915</b>B for powering the respective devices in one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">When the user presses a button <b>293</b>B (or otherwise actuates the fob, etc.) on the key fob <b>292</b>B, the CPU <b>2922</b>B wakes up inside the key fob <b>292</b>B and sends a data stream to the transmitter <b>2921</b>B which is output via the antenna. In other embodiments, the user's intent is acknowledged on the key fob <b>292</b>B via other means, such as via a microphone that accepts audio, a camera that captures images and/or video, or other sensors that are commonly utilized in the art to detect intent from a user including receiving gestures, motion, eye movements, and the like. The data stream may be a 64 bit to 128 bit long signal which includes one or more of a preamble, a command code, and a rolling code. The signal may be sent at a rate between 2 KHz and 20 KHz, but embodiments are not limited thereto. In response, the receiver <b>2911</b>B of the transport <b>291</b>B captures the signal from the transmitter <b>2921</b>B, demodulates the signal, and sends the data stream to the CPU <b>2913</b>B which decodes the signal and sends commands (e.g., lock the door, unlock the door, etc.) to a command module <b>2912</b>B.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">If the key fob <b>292</b>B and the transport <b>291</b>B use a fixed code between them, replay attacks can be performed. In this case, if the attacker is able to capture/sniff the fixed code during the short-range communication, the attacker could replay this code to gain entry into the transport <b>291</b>B. To improve security, the key fob and the transport <b>291</b>B may use a rolling code that changes after each use. Here, the key fob <b>292</b>B and the transport <b>291</b>B are synchronized with an initial seed <b>2923</b>B (e.g., a random number, pseudo random number, etc.) This is referred to as pairing. The key fob <b>292</b>B and the transport <b>291</b>B also include a shared algorithm for modifying the initial seed <b>2914</b>B each time the button <b>293</b>B is pressed. The following keypress will take the result of the previous keypress as an input and transform it into the next number in the sequence. In some cases, the transport <b>291</b>B may store multiple next codes (e.g., <b>255</b> next codes) in case the keypress on the key fob <b>292</b>B is not detected by the transport <b>291</b>B. Thus, a number of keypress on the key fob <b>292</b>B that are unheard by the transport <b>291</b>B do not prevent the transport from becoming out of sync.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In addition to rolling codes, the key fob <b>292</b>B and the transport <b>291</b>B may employ other methods to make attacks even more difficult. For example, different frequencies may be used for transmitting the rolling codes. As another example, two-way communication between the transmitter <b>2921</b>B and the receiver <b>2911</b>B may be used to establish a secure session. As another example, codes may have limited expirations or timeouts. Further, the instant solution as described and depicted with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>J</figref> can be utilized in this and other networks and/or systems including those that are described and depicted herein.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>K</figref> illustrates a controller area network (CAN) <b>290</b>C within a transport, according to example embodiments. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>K</figref>, the CAN <b>290</b>C includes a CAN bus <b>297</b>C with a high and low terminal, and plurality of electronic control units (ECUs) <b>291</b>C, <b>292</b>C, <b>293</b>C, etc. which are connected to the CAN bus <b>297</b>C via wired connections. The CAN bus <b>297</b>C is designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in an application without a host computer. The CAN bus <b>297</b>C implements a message-based protocol (i.e., ISO 11898 standards) that allows ECUs <b>291</b>C-<b>293</b>C to send commands to one another at a root level. Meanwhile, the ECUs <b>291</b>C-<b>293</b>C represent controllers for controlling electrical systems or subsystems within the transport. Examples of the electrical systems include power steering, anti-lock brakes, air-conditioning, tire pressure monitoring, cruise control, and many other features.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In this example, the ECU <b>291</b>C includes a transceiver <b>2911</b>C and a microcontroller <b>2912</b>C. The transceiver may be used to transmit and receive messages to and from the CAN bus <b>297</b>C. For example, the transceiver <b>2911</b>C may convert the data from the microcontroller <b>2912</b>C into a format of the CAN bus <b>297</b>C and also convert data from the CAN bus <b>297</b>C into a format for the microcontroller <b>2912</b>C. Meanwhile, the microcontroller <b>2912</b>C interprets the messages and also decide what messages to send using ECU software installed therein in one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In order to protect the CAN <b>290</b>C from cyber-threats, various security protocols may be implemented. For example, sub-networks (e.g., sub-networks A and B, etc.) may be used to divide the CAN <b>290</b>C into smaller sub-CANs and limit an attacker's capabilities to access the transport remotely. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>K</figref>, ECUs <b>291</b>C and <b>292</b>C may be part of a same sub-network while ECU <b>293</b>C is part of an independent sub-network. Furthermore, a firewall <b>294</b>C (or gateway, etc.) may be added to block messages from crossing the CAN bus <b>297</b>C across sub-networks. If an attacker gains access to one sub-network, the attacker will not have access to the entire network. To make sub-networks even more secure, the most critical ECUs are not placed on the same sub-network, in one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>K</figref>, other examples of security controls within a CAN include an intrusion detection system (IDS) which can be added to each sub-network and read all data passing to detect malicious messages. If a malicious message is detected, the IDS can notify the automobile user. Other possible security protocols include encryption/security keys that can be used to obscure messages. As another example, authentication protocols are implemented that enable a message to authenticate itself, in one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In addition to protecting a transport's internal network, transports may also be protected when communicating with external networks such as the Internet. One of the benefits of having a transport connected to a data source such as the Internet is that information from the transport can be sent through a network to remote locations for analysis. Examples of transport information include GPS, onboard diagnostics, tire pressure, and the like. These communication systems are often referred to as telematics because they involve the combination of telecommunications and informatics. Further, the instant solution as described and depicted with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>K</figref> can be utilized in this and other networks and/or systems including those that are described and depicted herein.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>L</figref> illustrates a secure end-to-end transport communication channel according to example embodiments.

In this example, a device <b>296</b>D associated with the host server <b>295</b>D may be installed within the network inside the transport <b>291</b>D. Furthermore, although not shown, the device <b>296</b>D may connect to other elements of the transport <b>291</b>D such as the CAN bus, an onboard diagnostics (ODBII) port, a GPS system, a SIM card, a modem, and the like. The device <b>296</b>D may collect data from any of these systems and transfer the data to the server <b>295</b>D via the network.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Secure management of data begins with the transport <b>291</b>D.

However, the device <b>296</b>D may only communicate the collected information back to the host server <b>295</b>D in response to transport ignition and trip completion. Furthermore, communication may only be initiated by the device <b>296</b>D, and not by the host server <b>295</b>D. As such, the device <b>296</b>D will not accept communications initiated by outside sources in one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">To perform the communication, the device <b>296</b>D may establish a secured private network between the device <b>296</b>D and the host server <b>295</b>D. Here, the device <b>296</b>D may include a tamper-proof SIM card which provides secure access to a carrier network <b>294</b>D, via a radio tower <b>292</b>D. When preparing to transmit data to the host server <b>295</b>D, the device <b>296</b>D may establish a one-way secure connection with the host server <b>295</b>D. The carrier network <b>294</b>D may communicate with the host server <b>295</b>D using one or more security protocols. As a non-limiting example, the carrier network <b>294</b>D may communicate with the host server <b>295</b>D via a VPN tunnel which allows access through a firewall <b>293</b>D of the host server <b>295</b>D. As another example, the carrier network <b>294</b>D may use data encryption (e.g., AES encryption, etc.) when transmitting data to the host server <b>295</b>D. In some cases, the system may use multiple security measures such as both a VPN and encryption to further secure the data.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In addition to communicating with external servers, transports may also communicate with each other. In particular, transport-to-transport (V2V) communication systems enable transports to communicate with each other, roadside infrastructures (e.g., traffic lights, signs, cameras, parking meters, etc.), and the like, over a wireless network. The wireless network may include one or more of a Wi-Fi networks, cellular networks, dedicated short range communication (DSRC) networks, and the like. Transports may use V2V communication to provide other transports with information about a transport's speed, acceleration, braking, and direction, to name a few. Accordingly, transports can receive insight of the conditions ahead before such conditions become visible thus greatly reducing collisions.

For example, the transport <b>292</b>E may verify with the certificate authority <b>291</b>E that the public key certificate <b>294</b>E used by transport <b>293</b>E to sign a V2V communication is authentic. If the transport <b>292</b>E successfully verifies the public key certificate <b>294</b>E, the transport knows that the data is from a legitimate source. Likewise, the transport <b>293</b>E may verify with the certificate authority <b>291</b>E that the public key certificate <b>295</b>E used by the transport <b>292</b>E to sign a V2V communication is authentic. Further, the instant solution as described and depicted with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>M</figref> can be utilized in this and other networks and/or systems including those that are described and depicted herein.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>N</figref> illustrates yet a further diagram <b>290</b>F depicting an example of a transport interacting with a security processor and a wireless device, according to example embodiments.

In particular, the security processor <b>292</b>F may perform authorization, authentication, cryptography (e.g., encryption), and the like, for data transmissions that are sent between ECUs and other devices on a CAN bus of a vehicle, and also data messages that are transmitted between different vehicles.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>N</figref>, the security processor <b>292</b>F may include an authorization module <b>293</b>F, an authentication module <b>294</b>F, and a cryptography module <b>295</b>F. The security processor <b>292</b>F may be implemented within the transport's computer and may communicate with other elements of the transport, for example, the ECUs/CAN network <b>296</b>F, wired and wireless devices <b>298</b>F such as wireless network interfaces, input ports, and the like. The security processor <b>292</b>F may ensure that data frames (e.g., CAN frames, etc.) that are transmitted internally within a transport (e.g., via the ECUs/CAN network <b>296</b>F) are secure. Likewise, the security processor <b>292</b>F can ensure that messages transmitted between different transports and to devices that are attached or connected via a wire to the transport's computer are also secured.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">For example, the authorization module <b>293</b>F may store passwords, usernames, PIN codes, biometric scans, and the like, for different users of the transport. The authorization module <b>293</b>F may determine whether a user (or technician) has permission to access certain settings such as a transport's computer. In some embodiments, the authorization module may communicate with a network interface to download any necessary authorization information from an external server. When a user desires to make changes to the transport settings or modify technical details of the transport via a console or GUI within the transport, or via an attached/connected device, the authorization module <b>293</b>F may require the user to verify themselves in some way before such settings are changed. For example, the authorization module <b>293</b>F may require a username, a password, a PIN code, a biometric scan, a predefined line drawing or gesture, and the like. In response, the authorization module <b>293</b>F may determine whether the user has the necessary permissions (access, etc.) being requested.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The authentication module <b>294</b>F may be used to authenticate internal communications between ECUs on the CAN network of the vehicle. As an example, the authentication module <b>294</b>F may provide information for authenticating communications between the ECUS. As an example, the authentication module <b>294</b>F may transmit a bit signature algorithm to the ECUs of the CAN network. The ECUs may use the bit signature algorithm to insert authentication bits into the CAN fields of the CAN frame. All ECUs on the CAN network typically receive each CAN frame. The bit signature algorithm may dynamically change the position, amount, etc., of authentication bits each time a new CAN frame is generated by one of the ECUs. The authentication module <b>294</b>F may also provide a list of ECUs that are exempt (safe list) and that do not need to use the authentication bits. The authentication module <b>294</b>F may communicate with a remote server to retrieve updates to the bit signature algorithm, and the like.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The encryption module <b>295</b>F may store asymmetric key pairs to be used by the transport to communicate with other external user devices and transports. For example, the encryption module <b>295</b>F may provide a private key to be used by the transport to encrypt/decrypt communications while the corresponding public key may be provided to other user devices and transports to enable the other devices to decrypt/encrypt the communications. The encryption module <b>295</b>F may communicate with a remote server to receive new keys, updates to keys, keys of new transports, users, etc., and the like. The encryption module <b>295</b>F may also transmit any updates to a local private/public key pair to the remote server.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a flow diagram <b>300</b>, according to example embodiments.

The vehicle <b>525</b> may engage with another vehicle <b>508</b> to perform various actions such as to share, transfer, acquire service calls, etc. when the vehicle has reached a status where the services need to be shared with another vehicle. For example, the vehicle <b>508</b> may be due for a battery charge and/or may have an issue with a tire and may be in route to pick up a package for delivery. A transport processor <b>528</b> resides in the vehicle <b>508</b> and communication exists between the transport processor <b>528</b>, a database <b>554</b>, and the transaction module <b>552</b>. The vehicle <b>508</b> may notify another vehicle <b>525</b>, which is in its network and which operates on its blockchain member service.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the blockchain architecture <b>600</b> may include certain blockchain elements, for example, a group of blockchain member nodes <b>602</b>-<b>606</b> as part of a blockchain group <b>610</b>. In one example embodiment, a permissioned blockchain is not accessible to all parties but only to those members with permissioned access to the blockchain data. The blockchain nodes participate in a number of activities, such as blockchain entry addition and validation process (consensus). One or more of the blockchain nodes may endorse entries based on an endorsement policy and may provide an ordering service for all blockchain nodes. A blockchain node may initiate a blockchain action (such as an authentication) and seek to write to a blockchain immutable ledger stored in the blockchain, a copy of which may also be stored on the underpinning physical infrastructure.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The blockchain transactions <b>620</b> are stored in memory of computers as the transactions are received and approved by the consensus model dictated by the members' nodes. Approved transactions <b>626</b> are stored in current blocks of the blockchain and committed to the blockchain via a committal procedure, which includes performing a hash of the data contents of the transactions in a current block and referencing a previous hash of a previous block. Within the blockchain, one or more smart contracts <b>630</b> may exist that define the terms of transaction agreements and actions included in smart contract executable application code <b>632</b>, such as registered recipients, vehicle features, requirements, permissions, sensor thresholds, etc. The code may be configured to identify whether requesting entities are registered to receive vehicle services, what service features they are entitled/required to receive given their profile statuses and whether to monitor their actions in subsequent events. For example, when a service event occurs and a user is riding in the vehicle, the sensor data monitoring may be triggered, and a certain parameter, such as a vehicle charge level, may be identified as being above/below a particular threshold for a particular period of time, then the result may be a change to a current status, which requires an alert to be sent to the managing party (i.e., vehicle owner, vehicle operator, server, etc.) so the service can be identified and stored for reference. The vehicle sensor data collected may be based on types of sensor data used to collect information about vehicle's status. The sensor data may also be the basis for the vehicle event data <b>634</b>, such as a location(s) to be traveled, an average speed, a top speed, acceleration rates, whether there were any collisions, was the expected route taken, what is the next destination, whether safety measures are in place, whether the vehicle has enough charge/fuel, etc. All such information may be the basis of smart contract terms <b>630</b>, which are then stored in a blockchain. For example, sensor thresholds stored in the smart contract can be used as the basis for whether a detected service is necessary and when and where the service should be performed.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates a shared ledger configuration, according to example embodiments.

The blockchain configuration <b>640</b> may include one or more applications, which are linked to application programming interfaces (APIs) to access and execute stored program/application code (e.g., smart contract executable code, smart contracts, etc.), which can be created according to a customized configuration sought by participants and can maintain their own state, control their own assets, and receive external information. This can be deployed as an entry and installed, via appending to the distributed ledger, on all blockchain nodes.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The smart contract application code <b>644</b> provides a basis for the blockchain transactions by establishing application code, which when executed causes the transaction terms and conditions to become active.

The platform includes a security/authorization <b>658</b>, computing devices, which execute the transaction management <b>656</b> and a storage portion <b>654</b> as a memory that stores transactions and smart contracts in the blockchain.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The blockchain platform may include various layers of blockchain data, services (e.g., cryptographic trust services, virtual execution environment, etc.), and underpinning physical computer infrastructure that may be used to receive and store new entries and provide access to auditors, which are seeking to access data entries. The blockchain may expose an interface that provides access to the virtual execution environment necessary to process the program code and engage the physical infrastructure. Cryptographic trust services may be used to verify entries such as asset exchange entries and keep information private.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The blockchain architecture configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> may process and execute program/application code via one or more interfaces exposed, and services provided, by the blockchain platform. As a non-limiting example, smart contracts may be created to execute reminders, updates, and/or other notifications subject to the changes, updates, etc. The smart contracts can themselves be used to identify rules associated with authorization and access requirements and usage of the ledger. For example, the information may include a new entry, which may be processed by one or more processing entities (e.g., processors, virtual machines, etc.) included in the blockchain layer. The result may include a decision to reject or approve the new entry based on the criteria defined in the smart contract and/or a consensus of the peers. The physical infrastructure may be utilized to retrieve any of the data or information described herein.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Within smart contract executable code, a smart contract may be created via a high-level application and programming language, and then written to a block in the blockchain. The smart contract may include executable code that is registered, stored, and/or replicated with a blockchain (e.g., distributed network of blockchain peers). An entry is an execution of the smart contract code, which can be performed in response to conditions associated with the smart contract being satisfied. The executing of the smart contract may trigger a trusted modification(s) to a state of a digital blockchain ledger. The modification(s) to the blockchain ledger caused by the smart contract execution may be automatically replicated throughout the distributed network of blockchain peers through one or more consensus protocols.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The smart contract may write data to the blockchain in the format of key-value pairs. Furthermore, the smart contract code can read the values stored in a blockchain and use them in application operations. The smart contract code can write the output of various logic operations into the blockchain. The code may be used to create a temporary data structure in a virtual machine or other computing platform. Data written to the blockchain can be public and/or can be encrypted and maintained as private. The temporary data that is used/generated by the smart contract is held in memory by the supplied execution environment, then deleted once the data needed for the blockchain is identified.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">A smart contract executable code may include the code interpretation of a smart contract, with additional features. As described herein, the smart contract executable code may be program code deployed on a computing network, where it is executed and validated by chain validators together during a consensus process. The smart contract executable code receives a hash and retrieves from the blockchain a hash associated with the data template created by use of a previously stored feature extractor. If the hashes of the hash identifier and the hash created from the stored identifier template data match, then the smart contract executable code sends an authorization key to the requested service. The smart contract executable code may write to the blockchain data associated with the cryptographic details.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> illustrates a blockchain configuration for storing blockchain transaction data, according to example embodiments.

The server may represent a service provider entity inquiring with a vehicle service provider to share user profile rating information in the event that a known and established user profile is attempting to rent a vehicle with an established rated profile. The server <b>666</b> may be receiving and processing data related to a vehicle's service requirements. As the service events occur, such as the vehicle sensor data indicates a need for fuel/charge, a maintenance service, etc., a smart contract may be used to invoke rules, thresholds, sensor information gathering, etc., which may be used to invoke the vehicle service event. The blockchain transaction data <b>670</b> is saved for each transaction, such as the access event, the subsequent updates to a vehicle's service status, event updates, etc. The transactions may include the parties, the requirements (e.g., 18 years of age, service eligible candidate, valid driver's license, etc.), compensation levels, the distance traveled during the event, the registered recipients permitted to access the event and host a vehicle service, rights/permissions, sensor data retrieved during the vehicle event operation to log details of the next service event and identify a vehicle's condition status, and thresholds used to make determinations about whether the service event was completed and whether the vehicle's condition status has changed.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> illustrates blockchain blocks <b>680</b> that can be added to a distributed ledger, according to example embodiments, and contents of block structures <b>682</b>A to <b>682</b><i>n</i>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, clients (not shown) may submit entries to blockchain nodes to enact activity on the blockchain. As an example, clients may be applications that act on behalf of a requester, such as a device, person or entity to propose entries for the blockchain. The plurality of blockchain peers (e.g., blockchain nodes) may maintain a state of the blockchain network and a copy of the distributed ledger. Different types of blockchain nodes/peers may be present in the blockchain network including endorsing peers, which simulate and endorse entries proposed by clients and committing peers which verify endorsements, validate entries, and commit entries to the distributed ledger. In this example, the blockchain nodes may perform the role of endorser node, committer node, or both.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The instant system includes a blockchain that stores immutable, sequenced records in blocks, and a state database (current world state) maintaining a current state of the blockchain. One distributed ledger may exist per channel and each peer maintains its own copy of the distributed ledger for each channel of which they are a member. The instant blockchain is an entry log, structured as hash-linked blocks where each block contains a sequence of N entries. Blocks may include various components such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>. The linking of the blocks may be generated by adding a hash of a prior block's header within a block header of a current block. In this way, all entries on the blockchain are sequenced and cryptographically linked together preventing tampering with blockchain data without breaking the hash links. Furthermore, because of the links, the latest block in the blockchain represents every entry that has come before it. The instant blockchain may be stored on a peer file system (local or attached storage), which supports an append-only blockchain workload.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The current state of the blockchain and the distributed ledger may be stored in the state database. Here, the current state data represents the latest values for all keys ever included in the chain entry log of the blockchain. Smart contract executable code invocations execute entries against the current state in the state database. To make these smart contract executable code interactions extremely efficient, the latest values of all keys are stored in the state database. The state database may include an indexed view into the entry log of the blockchain, it can therefore be regenerated from the chain at any time. The state database may automatically get recovered (or generated if needed) upon peer startup, before entries are accepted.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Endorsing nodes receive entries from clients and endorse the entry based on simulated results. Endorsing nodes hold smart contracts, which simulate the entry proposals. When an endorsing node endorses an entry, the endorsing nodes creates an entry endorsement, which is a signed response from the endorsing node to the client application indicating the endorsement of the simulated entry. The method of endorsing an entry depends on an endorsement policy that may be specified within smart contract executable code. An example of an endorsement policy is &#x201c;the majority of endorsing peers must endorse the entry.&#x201d; Different channels may have different endorsement policies. Endorsed entries are forward by the client application to an ordering service.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">The ordering service accepts endorsed entries, orders them into a block, and delivers the blocks to the committing peers. For example, the ordering service may initiate a new block when a threshold of entries has been reached, a timer times out, or another condition. In this example, blockchain node is a committing peer that has received a data block <b>682</b>A for storage on the blockchain. The ordering service may be made up of a cluster of orderers. The ordering service does not process entries, smart contracts, or maintain the shared ledger. Rather, the ordering service may accept the endorsed entries and specifies the order in which those entries are committed to the distributed ledger. The architecture of the blockchain network may be designed such that the specific implementation of &#x2018;ordering&#x2019; (e.g., Solo, Kafka, BFT, etc.) becomes a pluggable component.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Entries are written to the distributed ledger in a consistent order. The order of entries is established to ensure that the updates to the state database are valid when they are committed to the network. Unlike a cryptocurrency blockchain system (e.g., Bitcoin, etc.) where ordering occurs through the solving of a cryptographic puzzle, or mining, in this example the parties of the distributed ledger may choose the ordering mechanism that best suits that network.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, a block <b>682</b>A (also referred to as a data block) that is stored on the blockchain and/or the distributed ledger may include multiple data segments such as a block header <b>684</b>A to <b>684</b><i>n</i>, transaction specific data <b>686</b>A to <b>686</b><i>n</i>, and block metadata <b>688</b>A to <b>688</b><i>n</i>.

The block <b>682</b>A may also include a link to a previous block (e.g., on the blockchain) within the block header <b>684</b>A. In particular, the block header <b>684</b>A may include a hash of a previous block's header. The block header <b>684</b>A may also include a unique block number, a hash of the block data <b>690</b>A of the current block <b>682</b>A, and the like. The block number of the block <b>682</b>A may be unique and assigned in an incremental/sequential order starting from zero.

The entry data may be stored for each of the N entries.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In some embodiments, the block data <b>690</b>A may also store transaction specific data <b>686</b>A, which adds additional information to the hash-linked chain of blocks in the blockchain. Accordingly, the data <b>686</b>A can be stored in an immutable log of blocks on the distributed ledger. Some of the benefits of storing such data <b>686</b>A are reflected in the various embodiments disclosed and depicted herein. The block metadata <b>688</b>A may store multiple fields of metadata (e.g., as a byte array, etc.). Metadata fields may include signature on block creation, a reference to a last configuration block, an entry filter identifying valid and invalid entries within the block, last offset persisted of an ordering service that ordered the block, and the like. The signature, the last configuration block, and the orderer metadata may be added by the ordering service. Meanwhile, a committer of the block (such as a blockchain node) may add validity/invalidity information based on an endorsement policy, verification of read/write sets, and the like. The entry filter may include a byte array of a size equal to the number of entries in the block data <b>610</b>A and a validation code identifying whether an entry was valid/invalid.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The other blocks <b>682</b>B to <b>682</b><i>n </i>in the blockchain also have headers, files, and values. However, unlike the first block <b>682</b>A, each of the headers <b>684</b>A to <b>684</b><i>n </i>in the other blocks includes the hash value of an immediately preceding block. The hash value of the immediately preceding block may be just the hash of the header of the previous block or may be the hash value of the entire previous block. By including the hash value of a preceding block in each of the remaining blocks, a trace can be performed from the Nth block back to the genesis block (and the associated original file) on a block-by-block basis, as indicated by arrows <b>692</b>, to establish an auditable and immutable chain-of-custody.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">The above embodiments may be implemented in hardware, in a computer program executed by a processor, in firmware, or in a combination of the above. A computer program may be embodied on a computer readable medium, such as a storage medium.
