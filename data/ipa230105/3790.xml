Testing is typically performed at the die level on a given wafer device-under-test (DUT), prior to the many die on the wafer being cut and mounted in respective packages to form the associated &#x201c;chips&#x201d;. Test systems are typically operated at an environment that simulates typical operation of the circuit to be tested on the respective wafer DUT. Thus, typical semiconductor-based ICs are tested at a non-cryogenic temperature (e.g., &#x201c;room-temperature&#x201d;) to determine efficacy of the circuit. Similarly, typical superconducting circuits are tested at cryogenic temperatures. Such testing of superconducting circuits at cryogenic temperatures can be both expensive and labor-intensive. For example, for a typical superconducting die test, the wafer DUT is diced into individual chips, placed into special fixtures, and dipped into a liquid helium Dewar, which can be time consuming and helium intensive, and thus not scalable for high volume throughput.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One example includes a cryogenic wafer test system.

The cryogenic wafer test system includes a first chamber that is cooled to a cryogenic temperature in a vacuum. The first chamber includes a wafer chuck configured to accommodate a wafer device-under-test (DUT) comprising a plurality of superconducting die that can undergo testing via at least one wafer prober arranged in the first chamber. The cryogenic wafer test system also includes a second chamber, such as separated from the first chamber by a radiation barrier. The second chamber can likewise be evacuated, and can be held at a non-cryogenic temperature. The second chamber includes a wafer chuck actuator system configured to provide at least one of translational and rotational motion of the wafer chuck to facilitate alignment and contact of a plurality of electrical contacts of the superconducting die to the respective plurality of electrical probe contacts of the at least one wafer prober.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As described herein, the terms &#x201c;first chamber&#x201d; and &#x201c;second chamber&#x201d; can refer to two separate portions of a same chamber (e.g., &#x201c;upper chamber portion&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower chamber portion&#x201d;, respectively) that are separated by the radiation barrier, as described in greater detail herein. As also described herein, the term &#x201c;cryogenic&#x201d; describes a temperature that is equal to or less than approximately 10 Kelvin, and the term &#x201c;non-cryogenic&#x201d; describes a temperature that is greater than the cryogenic temperature. For example, the ambient temperature of the first chamber can be equal to or less than approximately 10 Kelvin, while components within the first chamber (e.g., the wafer chuck) can have a temperature of equal to or less than approximately 5 Kelvin.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The radiation barrier can be arranged as a plurality of overlapping planar rings. For example, the overlapping planar rings can each be formed from and/or coated with a thermally conductive material (e.g., copper and/or gold), and can be arranged in an incrementally increasing size between a first ring and a last ring of the overlapping planar rings. For example, the first ring can be the smallest ring and can be coupled to the mechanical linkage, such that each next contiguous ring has a larger inner diameter (ID) and a larger outer diameter (OD), with the last ring having the largest ID and the largest OD. Therefore, in response to lateral motion of the mechanical linkage along a plane that is parallel with each of the overlapping planar rings, the overlapping planar rings can slide along a next contiguous one of the overlapping planar rings. Therefore, given the incrementally increasing ID and OD of the overlapping planar rings, at an extreme lateral position of the mechanical linkage, the overlapping planar rings provide no gaps through which radiation can pass in a direct line from the second chamber to the first chamber, and therefore occludes radiation from being able to pass through the radiation barrier from the second chamber to the first chamber. Likewise, upon returning to a neutral position (e.g., from an extreme lateral position), the overlapping planar rings provide no gaps through the radiation barrier between the first and second chambers. Accordingly, the radiation barrier can maintain a sufficient thermal gradient to maintain the cryogenic temperature of the first chamber despite the non-cryogenic temperature of the second chamber, and can facilitate the translational motion of the mechanical linkage through the radiation barrier.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b>. The cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b> can be configured substantially the same as the cryogenic wafer test system described in Attorney Docket Number NG(ES)-029498 US PRI, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. The cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b> can be configured to perform testing of each of a plurality of superconducting die on a wafer DUT. For example, the wafer DUT can have a minimum diameter of approximately fifteen centimeters, and can include several hundred separate die (e.g., with each die being sized at approximately five mm<sup>2</sup>) to be tested. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b> includes a first chamber <b>12</b> and a second chamber <b>14</b>, with the second chamber <b>14</b> being located beneath the first chamber <b>12</b>. For example, the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can be separated by a radiation barrier that is configured to provide a thermal gradient between the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Therefore, the first chamber <b>12</b> can be held to a cryogenic temperature to test the superconducting die and the second chamber <b>14</b> can be held to a non-cryogenic temperature. For example, the first chamber <b>12</b> can be coupled to liquid (e.g., helium) coolant lines <b>16</b> to bring the temperature of the first chamber <b>12</b> down to the cryogenic temperature (e.g., approximately 5 K or lower). For example, the liquid coolant lines <b>16</b> can be coupled to a plurality of heat exchangers in the first chamber <b>12</b>, such as statically coupled to a surface (e.g., bottom surface) of the first chamber <b>12</b> and flexibly coupled to a wafer chuck on which the superconducting die is tested. As an example, the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can both be at a same pressure (e.g., evacuated), and the radiation barrier can facilitate mechanical interface between the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, as described in greater detail herein.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example diagram of a cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b>. The cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> can correspond to the cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Therefore, reference is to be made to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in the following description of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> includes a first chamber <b>52</b> and a second chamber <b>54</b> that can correspond, respectively, to the first and second chambers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As an example, the first and second chambers <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> can both be at a same pressure (e.g., evacuated), and the first chamber <b>52</b> is cooled to a cryogenic temperature. The first chamber <b>52</b> includes a wafer chuck <b>56</b> configured to accommodate a wafer DUT comprising a plurality of superconducting die to be tested. The cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> also includes at least one wafer prober <b>58</b> arranged in the first chamber <b>52</b>. The wafer prober(s) <b>58</b> includes electrical probe contacts that are implemented to provide physical contact to electrical contacts of a superconducting die of the plurality of superconducting die to implement a test of the superconducting die.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The second chamber <b>54</b> includes a wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> configured to provide at least one of translational and rotational motion of the wafer chuck <b>56</b>. Therefore, the wafer chuck <b>56</b> can be manipulated to facilitate alignment and contact of the plurality of electrical contacts of the superconducting die to the respective plurality of electrical probe contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b>. The translational motion can include motion of the wafer chuck <b>56</b> along three orthogonal axes, and the rotational motion can provide rotation of the wafer chuck <b>56</b> about an axis perpendicular to a planar surface of the wafer DUT. Therefore, the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> is configured to facilitate motion of the wafer DUT to align the electrical contacts of a given one of the superconducting die to the electrical probe contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b>. Thus, the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> can provide precision contact of the electrical contacts of the respective one of the superconducting die to the electrical probe contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b> to facilitate the test of the respective one of the superconducting die.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring back to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first chamber <b>12</b> can include a substantially transparent viewing window <b>18</b> that can provide an overhead view to the inside the first chamber <b>12</b>. Therefore, the viewing window <b>18</b> can provide a view of the planar surface of the wafer DUT to facilitate the alignment of the wafer DUT to the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b>, and thus the electrical contacts of the wafer DUT to the respective electrical prober contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b>, via the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b>. As an example, the viewing window can be formed of any of a variety of substantially transparent crystalline materials that can facilitate operation in the first chamber <b>12</b> at the cryogenic temperature. As another example, the cryogenic wafer test system <b>10</b> can include an electronic vision system (not shown) that can provide approximately real-time imaging of the first chamber <b>12</b> through the viewing window <b>18</b>. Accordingly, the vision system can further facilitate alignment of the electrical contacts on the surface of the superconducting die to the respective electrical probe contacts on the wafer prober(s) <b>58</b> to allow for real-time adjustments of the position of the wafer DUT via the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> for aligning the electrical contacts to the electrical probe contacts.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring back to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the second chamber <b>54</b> is demonstrated as separated from the first chamber <b>52</b> by a radiation barrier <b>62</b>. As described herein, the radiation barrier <b>62</b> is configured to provide a thermal gradient between the first and second chambers <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> by occluding direct line radiation from propagating from the second chamber <b>54</b> to the first chamber <b>52</b>. For example, because both the first and second chambers <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> can be evacuated, there is substantially no convection heat transfer that can occur from the second chamber <b>54</b> to the first chamber <b>52</b>. Thus, only radiation can provide heat transfer from the second chamber <b>54</b> to the first chamber <b>52</b>. As a result, by occluding direct line radiation from propagating from the second chamber <b>54</b> to the first chamber <b>52</b>, the radiation barrier <b>62</b> can substantially mitigate heat transfer from the second chamber <b>54</b> to the first chamber <b>52</b>. Therefore, the first chamber <b>52</b> can be held to a cryogenic temperature (e.g., approximately 5 K or lower) to test the superconducting die and the second chamber <b>54</b> can be held to a non-cryogenic temperature. As described in greater detail herein, the radiation barrier <b>62</b> can facilitate mechanical interface between the first and second chambers <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>. Therefore, the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> can be mechanically coupled to the wafer chuck <b>56</b> through the radiation barrier <b>62</b> to facilitate the translational and/or rotational motion of the wafer chuck <b>56</b> via the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b> through the radiation barrier <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The arrangement of the cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> can thus facilitate a more efficient testing environment of superconducting die than typical superconducting test fixtures. For example, by facilitating motion of the wafer chuck <b>56</b>, and thus the wafer DUT, via the wafer chuck actuator system <b>60</b>, the cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> can test multiple superconducting die sequentially in an indexed manner on the wafer DUT, as opposed to testing individually cut superconducting die that have been individually cooled via dipping into a liquid Dewar. As a result, by performing tests iteratively on each of the superconducting die on the wafer DUT, the process of testing each of the superconducting die in an indexed manner can be significantly more efficient by saving time between testing of each individual superconducting die, as well as by saving energy and cooling material (e.g., liquid helium) by operating the first chamber <b>52</b> that encapsulates the wafer DUT at the cryogenic temperature. Accordingly, the cryogenic wafer test system <b>50</b> provides for much more efficient testing than typical systems that implement die testing, and can provide for testing a large number of die in a superconducting environment in an indexed manner.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates another example diagram of a cryogenic wafer test system <b>100</b>.

Therefore, the heat exchanger <b>108</b> can likewise be provided a cooling liquid (e.g., helium), such as via a flexible hose to allow for the cooling liquid to be provided to the heat exchanger <b>108</b> as it moves with the wafer chuck <b>114</b>, to cool the first chamber <b>102</b> to the cryogenic temperature. The cryogenic wafer test system <b>100</b> also includes at least one wafer prober <b>116</b> arranged in the first chamber <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first chamber <b>102</b> also includes a radiation shield <b>118</b> and a magnetic shield <b>120</b> that are arranged interior with respect to the perimeter wall <b>106</b>. The radiation shield <b>118</b> can, for example, provide thermal insulation of the first chamber <b>102</b> to assist in maintaining the first chamber at the cryogenic temperature. The magnetic shield <b>120</b> can provide protection for the wafer DUT on the wafer chuck <b>114</b> from external magnetic fields, such as to provide more accurate testing. The first chamber <b>102</b> also includes a substantially transparent viewing window <b>122</b> that can provide an overhead view to the inside the first chamber <b>102</b>. Therefore, the viewing window <b>122</b> can provide a view of the planar surface of the wafer DUT to facilitate the alignment of the wafer DUT to the wafer prober(s) <b>116</b> (e.g., via a vision system), and thus the electrical contacts of the wafer DUT to the respective electrical prober contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>116</b>. For example, the viewing window <b>122</b> can be formed from a thermally insulating transparent or translucent material, such as a crystalline material (e.g., sapphire), to mitigate ambient heating of the first chamber <b>102</b>.

As an example, the mechanical linkage <b>126</b> can be configured as a shaft that can extend along an axis and/or rotate about the axis. Therefore, the wafer chuck <b>114</b> can be manipulated to facilitate alignment and contact of the plurality of electrical contacts of the superconducting die to the respective plurality of electrical probe contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>116</b>. The translational motion can include motion of the wafer chuck <b>114</b> along three orthogonal axes, and the rotational motion can provide rotation of the wafer chuck <b>114</b> about an axis perpendicular to a planar surface of the wafer DUT. Therefore, the wafer chuck actuator system <b>124</b> is configured to facilitate motion of the wafer DUT to align the electrical contacts of a given one of the superconducting die to the electrical probe contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>116</b>. Thus, the wafer chuck actuator system <b>124</b> can provide precision contact of the electrical contacts of the respective one of the superconducting die to the electrical probe contacts of the wafer prober(s) <b>116</b> to facilitate the test of the respective one of the superconducting die.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the cryogenic wafer test system <b>100</b> also includes a radiation barrier <b>128</b>. The radiation barrier <b>128</b> is coupled to the mechanical linkage <b>126</b> and is arranged to obstruct radiation that could propagate in a straight line from the second chamber <b>104</b>, through the aperture <b>112</b>, and into the first chamber <b>102</b>. Therefore, the radiation barrier <b>128</b> is configured to provide a thermal gradient between the first and second chambers <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Therefore, the first chamber <b>102</b> can be held to a cryogenic temperature (e.g., approximately 5 K or lower) to test the superconducting die and the second chamber <b>104</b> can be held to a non-cryogenic temperature. As described herein, the radiation barrier <b>128</b> can facilitate mechanical interface between the first and second chambers <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> while maintaining the thermal gradient between the first and second chambers <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Therefore, the wafer chuck actuator system <b>124</b> can be mechanically coupled to the wafer chuck <b>114</b> through the radiation barrier <b>128</b> to facilitate the translational and/or rotational motion of the wafer chuck <b>114</b> via the wafer chuck actuator system <b>124</b> through the radiation barrier <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the radiation barrier <b>128</b> is demonstrated as a plurality of overlapping planar rings <b>130</b> through which the mechanical linkage <b>126</b> extends from the wafer chuck actuator system <b>124</b> to the wafer chuck <b>114</b>. For example, the overlapping planar rings <b>130</b> can each be formed from and/or coated with a thermally conductive material (e.g., copper and/or gold), and can be arranged in an incrementally increasing size between a first ring (e.g., on the bottom) and a last ring (e.g., on the top) of the overlapping planar rings <b>130</b>. As an example, the overlapping planar rings <b>130</b> can be formed from copper and coated with gold. As another example, the overlapping planar rings <b>130</b> can be formed from a thermally conductive metal. As an example, the first ring (e.g., on the bottom) can have a thermally conductive and flexible coupling (e.g., a metallic braid or thermal strap) to the wafer chuck <b>114</b>, such that the heat exchanger <b>108</b> on the wafer chuck <b>114</b> can provide thermal cooling of the first ring, and thus the radiation barrier <b>128</b>. Similarly, the last ring (e.g., on the top) can have a thermally conductive and flexible coupling (e.g., a metallic braid or thermal strap) to the bottom surface <b>110</b> of the first chamber <b>102</b>, such that the heat exchanger <b>108</b> on the bottom surface <b>110</b> can provide thermal cooling of the last ring, and thus the radiation barrier <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the first ring can be the smallest ring and can be coupled to the mechanical linkage <b>126</b>, such that each next contiguous ring has a larger inner diameter (ID) and a larger outer diameter (OD), with the last ring having the largest ID and the largest OD. As an example, the mechanical linkage <b>126</b> can include a flange upon which the first ring can rest via gravity, and therefore without mechanical coupling. Thus, the remaining overlapping planar rings <b>130</b> can each rest upon the respective ring below by gravity. The last ring, and thus the largest ring, can have a range of motion that is limited by fixed mechanical limits in the first chamber <b>102</b>, such as posts that extend from the bottom surface <b>110</b> or the inner surface of the perimeter wall <b>106</b> (e.g., the magnetic barrier <b>120</b>). Therefore, in response to lateral motion of the mechanical linkage <b>126</b> along a plane that is parallel with each of the overlapping planar rings <b>130</b>, one or more of the overlapping planar rings <b>130</b> can slide along a next contiguous one of the overlapping planar rings <b>130</b>. Additionally, the radiation barrier <b>128</b> can move up and down as the wafer chuck <b>114</b> moves up and down via the mechanical linkage <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Therefore, given the incrementally increasing ID and OD of the overlapping planar rings, at an extreme lateral position of the mechanical linkage <b>126</b>, the overlapping planar rings <b>130</b> provide no gaps through the radiation barrier <b>128</b> between the first and second chambers <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> through which radiation can propagate in a straight line from the second chamber <b>104</b> to the first chamber <b>102</b>. In other words, the radiation barrier <b>128</b> provides a mechanical range of lateral motion of the mechanical linkage <b>126</b> while preventing any gaps between the first and second chambers <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> through which radiation can pass through the radiation barrier <b>128</b> in a straight line.

Accordingly, the radiation barrier <b>128</b> can maintain a sufficient thermal gradient to maintain the cryogenic temperature of the first chamber <b>102</b> despite the non-cryogenic temperature of the second chamber <b>104</b>, and can facilitate the translational motion of the mechanical linkage <b>126</b> through the radiation barrier <b>128</b>. Additionally, the interior of the first chamber <b>102</b> can be coated with a radiation damping material to absorb radiation that may bounce from the radiation barrier <b>128</b> to within the first chamber <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example diagram <b>150</b> of motion of a wafer chuck.

The OD of the first ring <b>214</b> can then contact the lip <b>218</b> of the next contiguous ring (e.g., above the first ring <b>214</b>), which can cause the next contiguous ring to begin moving along the X-axis. Such a sequence can continue until the OD of the ring below the last ring <b>216</b> contacts the lip <b>218</b> of the last ring <b>216</b>, which thus corresponds to a bound of the motion along the X-axis.

As a result, there is no gap between the overlapping planar rings through the radiation barrier <b>206</b>, and therefore no gap between the first and second chambers through which radiation can pass from the second chamber to the first chamber in a straight line.
