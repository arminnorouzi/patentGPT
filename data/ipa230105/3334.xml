Examples of displays include a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) and a plasma (i.e., Gas-Plasma) display, among other types of displays.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A display can be coupled to and subsequently decoupled from a stand. For example, when a user seeks to change a display (e.g., install a new display), change components in or behind the display, or perform maintenance on the display the user may seek to decouple the display from a stand.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some approaches may employ multiple release mechanisms on a side (e.g., a bottom side) of a display to permit the display to be decoupled (i.e., released) from a stand. Some approaches may rely on use of a tool (e.g., screwdriver) to permit the display to be decoupled from a stand. For instance, some approaches may rely on use of a tool to adjust multiple release mechanisms and thereby permit the display to be decoupled from the stand. However, such release mechanisms may be difficult/time-consuming, for instance, due to employing multiple release mechanisms which can result in a poor user experience. Additionally, such approaches may rely on a user to manually adjust (e.g., turn) multiple mechanical fasteners (e.g., screws) included in a release mechanism with a tool (e.g., a screwdriver) to decouple the display from the stand. As such, such approaches can cause a user to apply a rotational force or other type of force to a housing of a display (e.g., a left/right side of the display) when attempting to adjust the mechanism fasteners and/or the multiple release mechanisms. However, applying such a force can cause the display to bend. Having the display bend can cause the display to break. Moreover, as displays become larger the displays may become increasingly prone to such bending and breakage.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As such, the disclosure is directed to release mechanisms. For instance, a release mechanism can include an extensible mechanism including a handle, a hinge mechanism, and an ejection mechanism, as detailed herein. Notably, such release mechanisms can be actuated by applying a force (e.g., pulling) to the handle to decouple a display from a stand. For instance, a force can be applied to an individual handle to decouple a display from a stand. As such, the release mechanisms can mitigate any additional forces applied to the display and thereby prevent any resultant bending or breakage of the display. Moreover, such release mechanisms can be employed without the use of separate mechanical fasteners (e.g., screws) and can be employed without the use of a separate/dedicated tool (e.g., a screwdriver).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a perspective view of an example of a release mechanism <b>100</b> in a disengaged position consistent with the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a perspective view of an example of the release mechanism <b>100</b> in an engaged position consistent with the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an exploded view of an example of the release mechanism <b>100</b> in a disengaged position consistent with the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used herein, a &#x201c;release mechanism&#x201d; refers to a device shaped to release a display coupled to a stand. The release mechanism <b>100</b> can be coupled to a stand. For instance, the release mechanism <b>100</b> can be coupled to a stand (e.g., stand <b>240</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and/or a mounting mechanism (e.g., mounting mechanism <b>244</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the stand to selectively release a display, when present, from the stand. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the release mechanism <b>100</b> can include an extensible mechanism <b>102</b>, a hinge mechanism <b>110</b>, and an ejection mechanism <b>120</b> that can together selectively release a display, when present, from a stand.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The extensible mechanism <b>102</b> can include a first distal end <b>103</b>-<b>1</b> and a second distal end <b>103</b>-<b>2</b> (opposite the first distal end <b>103</b>-<b>1</b>). The first distal end <b>103</b>-<b>1</b> can form some or all of a handle <b>104</b>. The handle <b>104</b> refers to a mechanical component that promotes application of a force to the extensible mechanism <b>102</b> and thereby promotes movement of the release mechanism <b>100</b> between an engaged position and a disengaged position, as detailed herein. For instance, the first distal end <b>103</b>-<b>1</b> can form a handle such as the handle <b>104</b> that is integral (formed from an individual continuous piece of material) with the of portions of the extensible mechanism <b>102</b>. Having the handle <b>104</b> be integral with the extensible mechanism <b>102</b> can promote aspects herein such as providing a given aesthetic and/or providing a sealed electronic device when the handle <b>104</b> is in a disengaged position (e.g., when the handle <b>104</b> is recessed in the housing of the electronic device).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The extensible mechanism <b>102</b> can be formed of a continuous extension of material. In other words, the extensible mechanism <b>102</b> can be a unitary body, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Being a unitary body can promote aspects of retention mechanisms herein such as providing structural integrity. Similarly, the hinge mechanism <b>110</b>, and/or the ejection mechanism <b>120</b> can be formed of a continuous extension of material, in some examples.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, in some examples, the extensible mechanism <b>102</b> be formed of separate and distinct components which are coupled (e.g., mechanically coupled via a fastening mechanism such as screw) together. Being formed of separate and distinct components which are coupled together can permit customization and/or replacement of a mechanism over an operational lifetime of the mechanism. Similarly, in some examples, the hinge mechanism <b>110</b> and/or the ejection mechanism <b>120</b> can include separate and distinct components which are coupled to together.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The handle <b>104</b> can include a cavity (e.g., cavity <b>466</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). For instance, the handle <b>104</b> can include a rectangular or square shaped cavity. However, other shapes are possible. As detailed herein, the handle <b>104</b> can be retracted or otherwise recessed in a housing of an electronic device. For instance, the handle <b>104</b> can be in contact with the third face <b>112</b>-<b>3</b> when the release mechanism <b>100</b> is in a disengaged position (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second distal end <b>103</b>-<b>2</b> can include the opening <b>106</b>. As detailed herein, the opening <b>106</b> can be shaped and/or sized to receive another component. For instance, the opening <b>106</b> can be shaped or sized to permit the third arm <b>122</b>-<b>3</b> to extend through the opening <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The slot <b>108</b> can be an elongated slot with a length <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> that is greater than a width <b>109</b>-<b>2</b> of the slot <b>108</b>. As used herein, being elongated refers to a component having a length that is greater than a width of a component. For instance, a length <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> of the slot <b>108</b> can be greater than a width <b>109</b>-<b>2</b> of the slot <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The slot <b>108</b> can have an uninterrupted length <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> and width <b>109</b>-<b>2</b>. As used herein, being uninterrupted refers to a dimension that is without any intervening components along an entirety of the dimension. Having the uninterrupted length <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> and the width <b>109</b>-<b>2</b> can permit a component such as a retention mechanism <b>118</b> to readily move (e.g., translate) along the length <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> of the slot <b>108</b>. For instance, the retention mechanism <b>118</b> can translate relative to extensible mechanism <b>102</b> along the length <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> of the slot <b>108</b> between the disengaged position (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) where the retention mechanism <b>118</b> is disposed at a first position in the slot <b>108</b>, and the engaged position (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) where the retention mechanism is disposed at a second position, a distance away from the first position, in the slot <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, the retention mechanism <b>118</b> can translate relative to extensible mechanism <b>102</b> along the length <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> of the slot <b>108</b> responsive to the presence or absence of a force applied to the handle <b>104</b>. For instance, the retention mechanism <b>118</b> can translate relative to extensible mechanism <b>102</b> along the length <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> of the slot <b>108</b> to where the retention mechanism <b>118</b> is disposed at a first position in the elongated slot <b>108</b> in response to removal or absence of a force applied to the handle. Conversely, the retention mechanism <b>118</b> can translate relative to extensible mechanism <b>102</b> along the length <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> of the slot <b>108</b> to the engaged position where the retention mechanism <b>118</b> is disposed at the second position a distance away from the first position in response to a force being applied to the handle <b>104</b>, as detailed herein.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The hinge mechanism <b>110</b> can include a plurality of faces <b>112</b> such as a first face <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>, a second face <b>112</b>-<b>2</b>, a third face <b>112</b>-<b>3</b>, and a fourth face <b>112</b>-<b>4</b>, etc. The third face <b>112</b>-<b>3</b> can be located opposite of (i.e., on an opposite side relative to) the first face <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>. The fourth face <b>112</b>-<b>4</b> can be located opposite the second face <b>112</b>-<b>2</b>. The faces <b>112</b> can be planar faces or can have a different shape.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The faces <b>112</b> can have various components extending therefrom. For instance, the first face <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> can include a first tab <b>114</b>-<b>1</b> that extends a distance from the first face <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> and defines the first annulus <b>116</b>-<b>1</b>. Similarly, the first face <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> can include a second tab <b>114</b>-<b>2</b> that extends a distance from the first face <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> and defines the second annulus <b>116</b>-<b>2</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;annulus&#x201d; refers to a part having an opening. The annulus can be ring-shaped or circular. However, the annulus may have a different shape (e.g., rectangular, U-shaped opening, hexagonal, etc.).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The second face <b>112</b>-<b>2</b> can include a third tab <b>114</b>-<b>3</b> that extends a distance from the second face <b>112</b>-<b>2</b> and defines the retention mechanism <b>118</b>. The retention mechanism <b>118</b> can be positioned in the slot <b>108</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. The retention mechanism <b>118</b> can move (e.g., translate) along the length <b>109</b>-<b>1</b> of the slot <b>108</b>, as detailed herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The ejection mechanism <b>120</b> can include a plurality of arms <b>122</b> such as a first arm <b>122</b>-<b>1</b>, a second arm <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>, and a third arm <b>122</b>-<b>3</b>. In some examples, the first arm <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and the second arm <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> can be co-located on a side (the same individual side such that the first arm <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and the second arm <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> extend in the same direction) from the ejection mechanism <b>120</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and FIG. <b>1</b>B. In some examples, each of the first arm <b>122</b>-<b>1</b>, the second arm <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>, and the third arm <b>122</b>-<b>3</b> can be co-located on a side of the ejection mechanism <b>120</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The arms <b>122</b> can be coupled together by a connecting member <b>121</b>. For instance, the arms <b>122</b> can be coupled together by the connecting member <b>121</b> that interfaces with the distal ends of each of the arms <b>122</b>. Having the arms <b>122</b> be coupled together by the connecting member <b>121</b> can promote aspects herein such as promoting the arms <b>122</b> of the ejection mechanism <b>120</b> to rotate in unison.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The ejection mechanism <b>120</b> can rotate relative to the hinge mechanism <b>110</b>. For instance, the ejection mechanism <b>120</b> can rotate relative to the hinge mechanism <b>110</b> responsive to application of a force or absence of a force applied to the handle <b>104</b>. For example, the first projection <b>124</b>-<b>1</b> of the first arm <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> can extend into the first annulus <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to rotatably couple the ejection mechanism <b>120</b> to the first tab <b>114</b>-<b>1</b> of the hinge mechanism <b>110</b>. Similarly, the second projection <b>124</b>-<b>2</b> of the second arm <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> can extend into the second annulus <b>116</b>-<b>2</b> to rotatably couple the ejection mechanism <b>120</b> to the second tab <b>114</b>-<b>2</b> of the hinge mechanism <b>110</b>. In this way, the ejection mechanism <b>120</b> can rotate, relative to the hinge mechanism <b>110</b>, between the disengaged position (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and the engaged position (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The third arm <b>122</b>-<b>3</b> of the ejection mechanism <b>120</b> can extend through the opening <b>106</b>.

The force can be applied in a direction that is normal to a fourth face <b>412</b>-<b>4</b> of the hinge mechanism <b>410</b>. For instance, the force can be applied in a direction that is normal to a fourth face <b>412</b>-<b>4</b> responsive to application of a force (e.g., as represented by the arrow &#x201c;1&#x201d;) to the handle <b>404</b>. That is, the hinge mechanism <b>410</b> can include the fourth face <b>412</b>-<b>4</b> that defines a recess <b>464</b>, and the arm <b>442</b> can include a distal portion that forms a protrusion which can be disposed in the recess <b>464</b> when the release mechanism <b>400</b> is coupled to the arm <b>442</b> of the stand <b>440</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples, the ejection mechanism <b>420</b> can maintain contact with a portion of the internal frame <b>455</b> along an entirety of a path of travel of the ejection mechanism <b>420</b> between the disengaged position and the engaged position. Having the ejection mechanism <b>420</b> remain in maintain contact with a portion of the internal frame <b>455</b> along an entirety of a path of travel of the ejection mechanism <b>420</b> between the disengaged position and the engaged position can promote aspects herein such as providing a given tactile feedback via the handle <b>404</b> to a user and/or ensuring uniform application of force to various components in the release mechanism <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As mentioned, the handle <b>404</b> can be removed from a volume of a recess <b>464</b> when the release mechanism is in an engaged position (e.g., when the force is applied to the handle <b>404</b>.

For instance, in the disengaged position the internal frame <b>455</b> can be a first distance <b>461</b> from the stand <b>440</b> (e.g., a first distance away from a face <b>443</b> of the stand <b>440</b> that is proximate to the release mechanism <b>400</b>). Yet, in the engaged position the internal frame <b>455</b> can be a second distance <b>462</b> from the face <b>443</b> that is greater than the first distance <b>461</b> and can thereby permit release of the display <b>452</b> from the stand <b>440</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the &#x201c;disengaged position&#x201d; refers to an orientation of the release mechanism <b>400</b> in which the handle <b>404</b> is disposed in the recess <b>464</b> of the housing <b>453</b>.
