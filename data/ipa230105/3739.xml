Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the diagnosing of esthetic degradations of skin, in particular linked to pollution.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many factors can generate imperfections on the skin and its complexion. These imperfections of the complexion of the skin are a more and more frequent cause of consultations at esthetic care centers or dermatologists' offices.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Among the extrinsic factors likely to affect the complexion of the skin, mention can be made of exposure to the sun, exposure to variations in temperature and/or humidity, exposure to pollutants or to cigarette smoke. Among the intrinsic factors that affect the complexion of the skin, mention can be made of stress, fatigue, hormonal changes, dehydration of the epidermis, an alternation in the barrier function of the skin, aging or excessive secretion of sebum.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These different factors tent to blur the complexion, make it inhomogeneous, dull, waxy or yellowish and cause, and even favor, the presence of pigmentary disorders.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Yet, to prevent and/or treat these esthetic degradations of skin, it can be useful to know the cause of it, in particular from among the factors mentioned hereinabove.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Certain urban environments are regularly subjected to pollution peaks. The individual in his daily environment and particularly in an urban zone, can be subjected to multiple aggressions at the keratin materials, and in particular the skin, by different air pollutants.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Among the known pollutants, mention can first be made of exhaust gas which has become a major challenge in big cities, heavy metals but also fine particles or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzopyrene or benzoanthracene.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These pollutants will notably cause, on the skin, the deposition of particles on the surface of the epidermis, and among other consequences, induce a dull complexion of the skin and/or pigmentary disorders.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Identifying the exposure to pollution as a factor responsible for esthetic degradations of skin could make it possible to prevent and/or treat these degradations more effectively, There is therefore a substantial need for methods for diagnosing esthetic degradations of skin, in particular linked to pollution.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This invention meets this need.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention arises from the unexpected finding by the inventors that skin samples of individuals exposed to chronic pollution (based on the detection of high levels of pollutants in the samples of their hair) displayed a level of certain bacteria and of certain metabolites of these bacteria that was significantly higher with respect to individuals not exposed to such pollution.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention thus relates to a method for diagnosing esthetic degradations of skin, in particular linked to pollution, in a subject, comprising a step (a) of determining, in a skin sample of the subject, the level of at least one marker selected from the group constituted of (i) bacteria that comprise a nucleic acid encoding a 16S rRNA of sequence at least 90% identical to the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8 or SEQ ID NO: 9, and (ii) metabolites of these bacteria selected from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate,

id="p-0019" num="0018">&#x201c;16S rRNA&#x201d; here means the ribosomal RNA that form the small subunit of ribosomes of prokaryotes. The genes encoding 16S rRNA are called &#x201c;16S rDNA&#x201d;. Their sequence is highly used due to its structure, well conserved in all bacteria. Indeed, it is constituted of a succession of conserved domains, complementarity regions for universal primers used for the sequencing of this gene, and other sequence portions specific to a group of bacteria, named signature sequences (species, genus, family, order).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, the marker used in the context of the invention can be chosen from the group constituted of bacteria comprising a 16S rDNA of sequence at least 90% identical to the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8 or SEQ ID NO: 9.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the context of the present invention, the &#x201c;percentage identity&#x201d; is calculated by using a global alignment (i.e. the two sequences are compared over their entire sequence). Methods for comparing the identity of two sequences or more are well known to those skilled in the art. The &#x201c;needle&#x201d; program, which uses the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment 90 algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch (1970) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>48:443-453) to find the optimum alignment (including the gaps) between two sequences by considering their entire sequence can for example be used.

For the analysis of the 16S rRNA, the amplicon PCR and the indexing PCR were conducted on a PCR 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA), and the amplicons were purified with DNA/RNA purification beads (SeqMatic, Fremont, Calif., USA).

The merged readings were cut at 45 bp and the shorter readings were eliminated. The filtered readings were subjected to a OTU grouping at 97% sequence identity using the UPARSE algorithm (Edgar (2013) <i>Nature Methods </i>10:996-998), and the taxonomic information was provided for the sequences representative of bacterial OTUs by using the &#x201c;assign_taxonomy.py&#x201d; command in QIIME (version 1.9) against the SILVA database (128 outputs). The OTUs in the taxonomic lines present in more than 5% of the negative controls were considered as potential contaminants (Leung et al.
