id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a wireless communication method and a wireless communication terminal which use non-contiguous channel, and more particularly, to a wireless communication method and a wireless communication terminal for efficiently signaling non-contiguous channel allocation information.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, with supply expansion of mobile apparatuses, a wireless LAN technology that can provide a rapid wireless Internet service to the mobile apparatuses has been significantly spotlighted. The wireless LAN technology allows mobile apparatuses including a smart phone, a smart pad, a laptop computer, a portable multimedia player, an embedded apparatus, and the like to wirelessly access the Internet in home or a company or a specific service providing area based on a wireless communication technology in a short range.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 has commercialized or developed various technological standards since an initial wireless LAN technology is supported using frequencies of 2.4 GHz. First, the IEEE 802.11b supports a communication speed of a maximum of 11 Mbps while using frequencies of a 2.4 GHz band. IEEE 802.11a which is commercialized after the IEEE 802.11b uses frequencies of not the 2.4 GHz band but a 5 GHz band to reduce an influence by interference as compared with the frequencies of the 2.4 GHz band which are significantly congested and improves the communication speed up to a maximum of 54 Mbps by using an OFDM technology. However, the IEEE 802.11a has a disadvantage in that a communication distance is shorter than the IEEE 802.11b. In addition, IEEE 802.11g uses the frequencies of the 2.4 GHz band similarly to the IEEE 802.11b to implement the communication speed of a maximum of 54 Mbps and satisfies backward compatibility to significantly come into the spotlight and further, is superior to the IEEE 802.11a in terms of the communication distance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, as a technology standard established to overcome a limitation of the communication speed which is pointed out as a weak point in a wireless LAN, IEEE 802.11n has been provided. The IEEE 802.11n aims at increasing the speed and reliability of a network and extending an operating distance of a wireless network. In more detail, the IEEE 802.11n supports a high throughput (HT) in which a data processing speed is a maximum of 540 Mbps or more and further, is based on a multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) technology in which multiple antennas are used at both sides of a transmitting unit and a receiving unit in order to minimize a transmission error and optimize a data speed. Further, the standard can use a coding scheme that transmits multiple copies which overlap with each other in order to increase data reliability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the supply of the wireless LAN is activated and further, applications using the wireless LAN are diversified, the need for new wireless LAN systems for supporting a higher throughput (very high throughput (VHT)) than the data processing speed supported by the IEEE 802.11n has come into the spotlight. Among them, IEEE 802.11ac supports a wide bandwidth (80 to 160 MHz) in the 5 GHz frequencies. The IEEE 802.11ac standard is defined only in the 5 GHz band, but initial 11ac chipsets will support even operations in the 2.4 GHz band for the backward compatibility with the existing 2.4 GHz band products. Theoretically, according to the standard, wireless LAN speeds of multiple stations are enabled up to a minimum of 1 Gbps and a maximum single link speed is enabled up to a minimum of 500 Mbps. This is achieved by extending concepts of a wireless interface accepted by 802.11n, such as a wider wireless frequency bandwidth (a maximum of 160 MHz), more MIMO spatial streams (a maximum of 8), multi-user MIMO, and high-density modulation (a maximum of 256 QAM). Further, as a scheme that transmits data by using a 60 GHz band instead of the existing 2.4 GHz/5 GHz, IEEE 802.11ad has been provided. The IEEE 802.11ad is a transmission standard that provides a speed of a maximum of 7 Gbps by using a beamforming technology and is suitable for high bit rate moving picture streaming such as massive data or non-compression HD video. However, since it is difficult for the 60 GHz frequency band to pass through an obstacle, it is disadvantageous in that the 60 GHz frequency band can be used only among devices in a short-distance space.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, in recent years, as next-generation wireless LAN standards after the 802.11ac and 802.11ad, discussion for providing a high-efficiency and high-performance wireless LAN communication technology in a high-density environment is continuously performed. That is, in a next-generation wireless LAN environment, communication having high frequency efficiency needs to be provided indoors/outdoors under the presence of high-density stations and access points (APs) and various technologies for implementing the communication are required.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical

Further, in the present specification, a term &#x2018;terminal&#x2019; may be used to refer to a non-AP STA, or an AP, or to both terms. A station for wireless communication includes a processor and a communication unit and according to the embodiment, may further include a user interface unit and a display unit. The processor may generate a frame to be transmitted through a wireless network or process a frame received through the wireless network and besides, perform various processing for controlling the station.

Meanwhile, in the present invention, the AP is used as a concept including a personal BSS coordination point (PCP) and may include concepts including a centralized controller, a base station (BS), a node-B, a base transceiver system (BTS), and a site controller in a broad sense.

First, the scanning step is a step in which the STA <b>100</b> obtains access information of BSS operated by the AP <b>200</b>. A method for performing the scanning includes a passive scanning method in which the AP <b>200</b> obtains information by using a beacon message (S<b>101</b>) which is periodically transmitted and an active scanning method in which the STA <b>100</b> transmits a probe request to the AP (S<b>103</b>) and obtains access information by receiving a probe response from the AP (S<b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The STA <b>100</b> that successfully receives wireless access information in the scanning step performs the authentication step by transmitting an authentication request (S<b>107</b><i>a</i>) and receiving an authentication response from the AP <b>200</b> (S<b>107</b><i>b</i>). After the authentication step is performed, the STA <b>100</b> performs the association step by transmitting an association request (S<b>109</b><i>a</i>) and receiving an association response from the AP <b>200</b> (S<b>109</b><i>b</i>). In this specification, an association basically means a wireless association, but the present invention is not limited thereto, and the association may include both the wireless association and a wired association in a broad sense.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Meanwhile, an 802.1X based authentication step (S<b>111</b>) and an IP address obtaining step (S<b>113</b>) through DHCP may be additionally performed.

When a wireless signal having a predetermined strength or more is sensed, it is determined that the corresponding channel is busy and the terminal delays the access to the corresponding channel. Such a process is referred to as clear channel assessment (CCA) and a level to decide whether the corresponding signal is sensed is referred to as a CCA threshold. When a wireless signal having the CCA threshold or more, which is received by the terminal, indicates the corresponding terminal as a receiver, the terminal processes the received wireless signal. Meanwhile, when a wireless signal is not sensed in the corresponding channel or a wireless signal having a strength smaller than the CCA threshold is sensed, it is determined that the channel is idle.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">When it is determined that the channel is idle, each terminal having data to be transmitted performs a backoff procedure after an inter frame space (IFS) time depending on a situation of each terminal, for instance, an arbitration IFS (AIFS), a PCF IFS (PIFS), or the like elapses. According to the embodiment, the AIFS may be used as a component which substitutes for the existing DCF IFS (DIFS). Each terminal stands by while decreasing slot time(s) as long as a random number determined by the corresponding terminal during an interval of an idle state of the channel and a terminal that completely exhausts the slot time(s) attempts to access the corresponding channel. As such, an interval in which each terminal performs the backoff procedure is referred to as a contention window interval.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">When a specific terminal successfully accesses the channel, the corresponding terminal may transmit data through the channel. However, when the terminal which attempts the access collides with another terminal, the terminals which collide with each other are assigned with new random numbers, respectively to perform the backoff procedure again. According to an embodiment, a random number newly assigned to each terminal may be decided within a range (2*CW) which is twice larger than a range (a contention window, CW) of a random number which the corresponding terminal is previously assigned. Meanwhile, each terminal attempts the access by performing the backoff procedure again in a next contention window interval and in this case, each terminal performs the backoff procedure from slot time(s) which remained in the previous contention window interval. By such a method, the respective terminals that perform the wireless LAN communication may avoid a mutual collision for a specific channel.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a method for performing a distributed coordination function using a request to send (RTS) frame and a clear to send (CTS) frame.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The AP and STAs in the BSS contend in order to obtain an authority for transmitting data. When data transmission at the previous step is completed, each terminal having data to be transmitted performs a backoff procedure while decreasing a backoff counter (alternatively, a backoff timer) of a random number assigned to each terminal after an AFIS time. A transmitting terminal in which the backoff counter expires transmits the request to send (RTS) frame to notify that corresponding terminal has data to transmit. According to an exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, STA<b>1</b> which holds a lead in contention with minimum backoff may transmit the RTS frame after the backoff counter expires. The RTS frame includes information on a receiver address, a transmitter address, and duration. A receiving terminal (i.e., the AP in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) that receives the RTS frame transmits the clear to send (CTS) frame after waiting for a short IFS (SIFS) time to notify that the data transmission is available to the transmitting terminal STA<b>1</b>. The CTS frame includes the information on a receiver address and duration. In this case, the receiver address of the CTS frame may be set identically to a transmitter address of the RTS frame corresponding thereto, that is, an address of the transmitting terminal STA<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The transmitting terminal STA<b>1</b> that receives the CTS frame transmits the data after a SIFS time. When the data transmission is completed, the receiving terminal AP transmits an acknowledgment (ACK) frame after a SIFS time to notify that the data transmission is completed. When the transmitting terminal receives the ACK frame within a predetermined time, the transmitting terminal regards that the data transmission is successful. However, when the transmitting terminal does not receive the ACK frame within the predetermined time, the transmitting terminal regards that the data transmission is failed. Meanwhile, adjacent terminals that receive at least one of the RTS frame and the CTS frame in the course of the transmission procedure set a network allocation vector (NAV) and do not perform data transmission until the set NAV is terminated. In this case, the NAV of each terminal may be set based on a duration field of the received RTS frame or CTS frame.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the course of the aforementioned data transmission procedure, when the RTS frame or CTS frame of the terminals is not normally transferred to a target terminal (i.e., a terminal of the receiver address) due to a situation such as interference or a collision, a subsequent process is suspended. The transmitting terminal STA<b>1</b> that transmitted the RTS frame regards that the data transmission is unavailable and participates in a next contention by being assigned with a new random number. In this case, the newly assigned random number may be determined within a range (2*CW) twice larger than a previous predetermined random number range (a contention window, CW).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> illustrate multi-user transmission methods according to an embodiment of the present invention. When using orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) or multi-input multi-output (MIMO), one wireless communication terminal can simultaneously transmit data to a plurality of wireless communication terminals. Further, one wireless communication terminal can simultaneously receive data from a plurality of wireless communication terminals. For example, a downlink multi-user (DL-MU) transmission in which an AP simultaneously transmits data to a plurality of STAs, and an uplink multi-user (UL-MU) transmission in which a plurality of STAs simultaneously transmit data to the AP may be performed.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a UL-MU transmission process according to an embodiment of the present invention. In order to perform the UL-MU transmission, the channel to be used and the transmission start time of each STA that performs uplink transmission should be adjusted. In order to efficiently schedule the UL-MU transmission, state information of each STA needs to be transmitted to the AP. According to an embodiment of the present invention, information for scheduling of a UL-MU transmission may be indicated through a predetermined field of a preamble of a packet and/or a predetermined field of a MAC header. For example, a STA may indicate information for UL-MU transmission scheduling through a predetermined field of a preamble or a MAC header of an uplink transmission packet, and may transmit the information to an AP. In this case, the information for UL-MU transmission scheduling includes at least one of buffer status information of each STA, and channel state information measured by each STA. The buffer status information of the STA may indicate at least one of whether the STA has uplink data to be transmitted, the access category (AC) of the uplink data and the size (or the transmission time) of the uplink data.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the UL-MU transmission process may be managed by the AP. The UL-MU transmission may be performed in response to a trigger frame transmitted by the AP. The STAs simultaneously transmit uplink data a predetermined IFS (e.g., SIFS) time after receiving the trigger frame. The trigger frame solicits UL-MU transmission of STAs and may inform channel (or subchannel) information allocated to the uplink STAs. Upon receiving the trigger frame from the AP, a plurality of STAs transmit uplink data through each allocated channel (or, subchannel) in response thereto. After the uplink data transmission is completed, the AP transmits an ACK to the STAs that have successfully transmitted the uplink data. In this case, the AP may transmit a predetermined multi-STA block ACK (M-BA) as an ACK for a plurality of STAs.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the non-legacy wireless LAN system, subcarriers of a specific number, for example, 26, 52, or 106 tones may be used as a resource unit (RU) for a subchannel-based access in a channel of 20 MHz band. Accordingly, the trigger frame may indicate identification information of each STA participating in the UL-MU transmission and information of the allocated resource unit. The identification information of the STA includes at least one of an association ID (AID), a partial AID, and a MAC address of the STA. Further, the information of the resource unit includes the size and placement information of the resource unit.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">On the other hand, in the non-legacy wireless LAN system, a UL-MU transmission may be performed based on a contention of a plurality of STAs for a specific resource unit. For example, if an AID field value for a specific resource unit is set to a specific value (e.g., 0) that is not assigned to STAs, a plurality of STAs may attempt random access (RA) for the corresponding resource unit.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a DL-MU transmission process according to an embodiment of the present invention. According to an embodiment of the present invention, RTS and/or CTS frames of a predetermined format may be used for NAV setting in the DL-MU transmission process.

The duration field of the MU-RTS frame is set to a time until the end of the DL-MU transmission session. That is, the duration field of the MU-RTS frame is set based on a period until the downlink data transmission of the AP and ACK frame transmissions of the STAs are completed. The neighboring terminals of the AP set a NAV until the end of the DL-MU transmission session based on the duration field of the MU-RTS frame transmitted by the AP.

When the L_RATE field is set to 6 Mbps, 3 bytes (i.e., 24 bits) can be transmitted for 4 us, which is one symbol duration of 64 FFT. Therefore, by adding 3 bytes corresponding to the SVC field and the Tail field to the value of the L_LENGTH field and dividing it by 3 bytes, which is the transmission amount of one symbol, the number of symbols after the L-SIG is obtained on the 64FFT basis. The length of the corresponding PPDU, that is, the reception time (i.e., RXTIME) is obtained by multiplying the obtained number of symbols by 4 us, which is one symbol duration, and then adding a 20 us which is for transmitting L-STF, L-LTF and L-SIG.

In this case, the HE MU PPDU may transmit AID information of the receiver and/or the transmitter of the corresponding PPDU through a user specific field of the HE-SIG-B. Therefore, terminals receiving the HE MU PPDU may perform a spatial reuse operation based on the AID information obtained from the preamble of the corresponding PPDU. In addition, data transmission through some narrowband may be performed using the HE MU PPDU. Here, the narrowband may be a frequency band of less than 20 MHz.

In the corresponding PPDU format, HE-SIG-A and HE-SIG-B are repeated in the time domain. In this case, it is possible to obtain a reception gain of 3 dB or more due to repetitive transmission of HE-SIG-A and HE-SIG-B in the time domain, thereby enabling signal reception at a long distance. Since the PPDU format according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> can additionally signal HE-SIG-B, it can be used for a downlink extended range (ER) multi-user transmission. In addition, the corresponding PPDU format may be used for narrowband transmission of data in uplink/downlink ER single-user transmissions. More specifically, the PPDU format may signal, via HE-SIG-B, a transmission which uses a part of the resource units of the data area transmitted on the basis of 256 FFT/20 MHz. Therefore, transmission using only 26-tone RU, 52-tone RU, or 106-tone RU which is less than 20 MHz band can be performed even in an uplink/downlink single-user transmission situation. Through such narrowband transmission, the terminal can perform transmission by concentrating the entire allowable transmission power in the ISM band on a narrow RU. That is, in addition to the extension of the transmission distance due to the repetitive transmission of the HE-SIG-A/B in the 64 FFT/20 MHz domain, the transmission distance can be extended even in the data transmission in the following 256 FFT/20 MHz domain. In addition, the corresponding PPDU format may also be used for narrowband transmission of data in a downlink multi-user transmission.

The specific embodiments of the predetermined non-contiguous bands will be described later.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0130">The SIG-B MCS field indicates the MCS applied to the HE-SIG-B field. Depending on the amount of information that requires signaling, variable MCS between MSC<b>0</b> and MSC<b>5</b> can be applied to the HE-SIG-B. The CP+LTF size field indicates the duration of the CP or GI and the size of the HE-LTF. The corresponding field indicates the combination of the HE-LTF size used among 2&#xd7; and 4&#xd7;HE-LTF, and the CP (or GI) value used in the data field among 0.8 us, 1.6 us, and 3.2 us.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0131">The SIG-B compression field indicates whether to use a compression mode of the HE-SIG-B field. When the HE MU PPDU is transmitted using an MU-MIMO in the full bandwidth, the resource unit allocation information for each 20 MHz band becomes unnecessary. Therefore, in the full bandwidth MU-MIMO transmission, the SIG-B compression field indicates the compression mode of the HE-SIG-B field. In this case, the common block field containing the resource unit allocation field is not present in the HE-SIG-B field. The SIG-B DCM field indicates whether the HE-SIG-B field is modulated with the DCM for reliable transmission of the HE-SIG-B field. The number of HE-SIG-B symbols field indicates information on the number of OFDM symbols in the HE-SIG-B field.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0132">On the other hand, when the HE MU PPDU is transmitted in a band of 40 MHz or more as described later, the HE-SIG-B may consist of two kinds of content channels in units of 20 MHz. The content channels are referred to as HE-SIG-B content channel 1 and HE-SIG-B content channel 2, respectively. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the number of HE-SIG-B symbols in each channel can be kept similar by differentiating MCSs applied to the HE-SIG-B content channel 1 and the HE-SIG-B content channel 2, respectively. The HE-SIG-A field of the HE MU PPDU may include a SIG-B dual MCS field. In this case, it is indicated through the corresponding field whether the MCSs applied to the HE-SIG-B content channel 1 and the HE-SIG-B content channel 2 are different with each other.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0133">According to the embodiment of the present invention, when the SIG-B compression field indicates the compression mode of the HE-SIG-B field (i.e., when the full bandwidth MU-MIMO transmission is indicated), a specific field of the HE-SIG-A may indicate information on the number of MU-MIMO users. For example, when the full bandwidth MU-MIMO transmission is performed, the HE-SIG-B content channel 1 and the HE-SIG-B content channel 2 do not need to distribute the amount of information through different MCSs. Therefore, when the SIG-B compression field indicates the compression mode of the HE-SIG-B field, the SIG-B dual MCS field of the HE-SIG-A may indicate information on the number of MU-MIMO users. Likewise, when the full bandwidth MU-MIMO transmission is performed, information on the number of symbols in each HE-SIG-B content channel need not be delivered separately. Therefore, when the SIG-B compression field indicates the compression mode of the HE-SIG-B field, the number of HE-SIG-B symbols field in the HE-SIG-A may indicate the information on the number of MU-MIMO users. As described above, in the compression mode in which the resource unit allocation field of the HE-SIG-B is omitted, information on the number of MU-MIMO users may be indicated through a specific subfield of the HE-SIG-A.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0134">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the HE MU PPDU may be used for the DL-MU transmission. However, in the following additional situations, the HE MU PPDU may be used for both the downlink transmission and the uplink transmission.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0135">According to an embodiment, an HE MU PPDU may be used for OFDMA based transmission in a downlink/uplink transmission between an AP and a single STA. More specifically, transmission between an AP and a single STA may be performed using only some contiguous or non-contiguous channels among the entire band. For example, when only a secondary 20 MHz channel is busy as a result of the STA performing CCA to transmit an 80 MHz PPDU to the AP, the STA may transmit the PPDU through the primary 20 MHz channel and the secondary 40 MHz channel. In addition, a narrowband transmission using only some resource units within 20 MHz may be performed between an AP and a single STA. In the case where the transmission using the non-contiguous channel or the narrowband transmission is performed, the resource unit allocation information should be additionally transmitted via the HE-SIG-B field in the transmitted PPDU. Therefore, the terminal may perform such transmissions using the HE MU PPDU. The specific embodiments of the transmission using the non-contiguous channel and the narrowband transmission will be described later.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0136">According to another embodiment, the HE MU PPDU may be used when a transmission of the HE-SIG-B field is required for the enhancement of the spatial reuse operation. Unlike the HE SU PPDU, the HE MU PPDU can indicate an AID of the recipient through the user field of the HE-SIG-B. However, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, since it is obvious that the recipient of the corresponding PPDU is an AP when the HE MU PPDU is used for an uplink transmission, the user field of the HE-SIG-B may indicate an AID of the transmitter. The neighboring terminals that have received the HE MU PPDU may perform the spatial reuse operation.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0137">For example, assume that there are arbitrary BSS<b>1</b> and BSS<b>2</b>, and that STA<b>1</b> of the BSS<b>1</b> transmits an HE UL MU PPDU. A STA of the BSS<b>2</b> overhearing the PPDU may estimate the distance between it and an AP of the BSS<b>1</b> which is the recipient of the PPDU, through a DL PPDU of the AP of the BSS<b>1</b> that has been previously received. Therefore, the STA of the BSS<b>2</b> may perform the spatial reuse operation considering the interference to the AP of the BSS<b>1</b> which is the recipient. Also, when a DL PPDU transmitted by the AP of the BSS<b>1</b> to the STA<b>1</b> of the BSS<b>1</b> is received, the STA of the BSS<b>2</b> may perform the spatial reuse operation considering the interference to the STA<b>1</b> of the BSS<b>1</b> which is the recipient of the corresponding PPDU. In this case, the interference is considered based on the signal strength previously measured from an HE UL MU PPDU of the STA<b>1</b>. In the spatial reuse operation, the STA may attempt to transmit if the received PPDU is a PPDU of other BSS (OBSS) and the interference to the recipient of the corresponding PPDU is below a predetermined level.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0138">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> illustrates a subfield configuration of the HE-SIG-A field of the HE trigger-based PPDU.

Further, the RA field may indicate the number of users in each resource unit.

In addition, the RA field may indicate, through a predetermined index, a specific resource unit in which a user specific field is not transmitted, i.e., a specific resource unit (i.e., an empty RU) that is not assigned to the user.

That is, the HE-SIG-B content channel 1 is transmitted in the lowest frequency band, and the HE-SIG-B content channel 2 is transmitted in the next higher frequency band. Such a content channel configuration is then duplicated through content duplication in the next higher frequency bands.

Therefore, when an MU-MIMO transmission is performed through a bandwidth greater than 20 MHz, the number of users to be allocated to the HE-SIG-B content channel 1 and the HE-SIG-B content channel 2, respectively, should be separately determined. According to an embodiment of the present invention, when the MU-MIMO transmission is performed through a bandwidth greater than 20 MHz, user fields may be split equitably between the two content channels for load balancing.

If a full bandwidth MU-MIMO transmission is performed on the P40 channel (i.e., a 40 MHz channel), STAs may transmit an ACK frame within the P40 channel.

In this case, in the trigger frame, the TXOP duration field of the HE-SIG-A and the duration field of the MAC header indicate duration information, respectively. The two duration fields may have different bit configurations with each other. For example, the number of bits in the TXOP duration field may be less than the number of bits in the duration field of the MAC header. In this case, the setting method of each duration field and/or the interpretation method of each duration field should be determined in order to set a correct NAV of the neighboring terminals.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0191">According to an embodiment of the present invention, when the TXOP duration field consists of t bits and the duration field of the MAC header consists of m bits (where t&#x3c;m), the value of the duration field of the MAC header may be set to not exceed the value of the TXOP duration field. For example, if the TXOP duration field consists of 12 bits and the duration field of the MAC header consists of 15 bits, the value of the duration field of the MAC header shall not exceed the maximum value that the TXOP duration field can represent, that is, 2{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}12=4096 us.

For example, if the TXOP duration field consists of 12 bits and the duration field of the MAC header consists of 15 bits, the value of the TXOP duration field may be used after a scaling factor 8 is multiplied. In this way, by using the predetermined scaling factor, duration information indicated by the duration fields of different number of bits may have similar range.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0193">However, if the value of the TXOP duration field is used after the scaling factor 8 is multiplied, duration information obtained from the two duration fields may have a difference of up to 7 us.

However, a STA which can only interpret the TXOP duration field of the HE-SIG-A among the two duration fields sets a NAV based on the TXOP duration field. In preparation for this situation, the value of the TXOP duration field in a PPDU may be set to a value which is larger or smaller than the value of the duration field of the MAC header by the maximum offset (e.g., 7 us).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0194">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, since H<b>1</b> receiving the trigger frame can interpret both the TXOP duration field of the HE-SIG-A and the duration field of the MAC header, it may update a NAV using both the two fields.

As such, the transmitter transmits a wireless packet in which non-contiguous channel allocation information is signaled. A receiver (e.g., a STA) receives the wireless packet and obtains the non-contiguous channel allocation information from the received packet. The receiver decodes the received packet based on the obtained non-contiguous channel allocation information.

The HE MU PPDU performs signaling through the HE-SIG-A and the HE-SIG-B. The HE-SIG-A carries overall information including bandwidth information of the PPDU, and the HE-SIG-B carries information for a simultaneous multi-user transmission. In a total PPDU bandwidth of 40 MHz or more, the HE-SIG-B may consist of HE-SIG-B content channel 1 and HE-SIG-B content channel 2. According to the embodiment of the present invention, when a transmission of a non-contiguous PPDU is performed, the following matters can be considered.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0217">First, all types of non-contiguous PPDUs should assign the P20 channel. That is, the non-contiguous PPDU may include one or more unassigned channels (or unassigned resource units), but the P20 channel should be assigned to one or more users.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0218">Second, the HE-SIG-A of the non-contiguous PPDU should be able to indicate channel information on which the content channel(s) of the HE-SIG-B of the PPDU is transmitted. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, channels of an 80 MHz bandwidth consist of channel A, channel B, channel C and channel D in an increasing order of the frequency, and a non-contiguous PPDU may be transmitted through channel A, channel B and channel D except a busy channel C. In this case, the HE-SIG-B content channel 1 is transmitted through channel A, and the HE-SIG-B content channel 2 is transmitted through channel B and channel D. In this case, the bandwidth field of the HE-SIG-A may indicate information about at least which channel each of the HE-SIG-B content channels of the corresponding PPDU is transmitted through. As described below, the bandwidth field of the HE-SIG-A may index puncturing of the S20 channel, and puncturing of at least one of two channels of the S40 channel, respectively. When the bandwidth field indicates puncturing of the S20 channel, at least one content channel of the two HE-SIG-B content channels may be transmitted through the S40 channel. On the other hand, when the bandwidth field indicates puncturing of at least one of two 20 MHz channels in the S40 channel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, all of the two HE-SIG-B content channels may be transmitted through at least the P40 channel.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0219">Finally, the HE-SIG-A may explicitly or implicitly indicate the size information of the common block field of the HE-SIG-B in the corresponding PPDU. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the HE-SIG-B consists of a common block field <b>430</b> and a user specific field <b>440</b>, and the common block field <b>430</b> includes an RA field. When a total bandwidth of the PPDU is 20 MHz or 40 MHz, each HE-SIG-B content channel carries one RA field. However, when the total bandwidth of the PPDU is 80 MHz or 160 MHz (80+80 MHz), each HE-SIG-B content channel may carry multiple RA fields <b>432</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>.

Furthermore, when the total bandwidth of the PPDU is 160 MHz (or 80+80 MHz), each HE-SIG-B content channel carries four RA fields <b>432</b>. Therefore, the number of RA fields <b>432</b> carried in the common block field <b>430</b> of the HE-SIG-B varies according to the information indicated by the bandwidth field <b>452</b> of the HE-SIG-A. The bandwidth field <b>452</b> of the HE-SIG-A may indicate the number of RA fields <b>432</b> carried in the common block field <b>430</b> of the HE-SIG-B, thereby explicitly or implicitly indicating the size information of the common block field <b>430</b>.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0220">According to the embodiment of the present invention, the non-contiguous channel allocation information may be indicated via any one of subfield(s) of the HE-SIG-A, subfield(s) of the HE-SIG-B, and a combination thereof.

When the non-contiguous channel allocation information is signaled through the subfield of the HE-SIG-A, the receiver may promptly obtain the entire configuration information of the PPDU. In addition, the additional signaling overhead through the HE-SIG-B is reduced when the non-contiguous channel allocation information is signaled via only the subfield of the HE-SIG-A.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0222">However, due to the limitation of the available number of bits in the HE-SIG-A, various non-contiguous channel allocation information may not be signaled. Thus, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the bandwidth field <b>452</b> may explicitly indicate only some non-contiguous channel allocation information among the various options of the non-contiguous channel allocation. According to another embodiment of the present invention, some subfields of the HE-SIG-A that are unnecessary when non-contiguous channel allocation is performed may be used for additional signaling of the non-contiguous channel allocation information. For example, when the non-contiguous channel allocation is performed, a SIG-B compression field <b>454</b> indicating whether to use the full bandwidth MU-MIMO is unnecessary. Thus, when the non-contiguous channel allocation is performed, the SIG-B compression field <b>454</b> may be used for other purposes. For example, the HE-SIG-A may indicate non-contiguous channel allocation information using both the bandwidth field <b>452</b> and the SIG-B compression field.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0223">Next, the non-contiguous channel allocation information may be signaled solely via subfield(s) of the HE-SIG-B. In this case, the bandwidth field of the HE-SIG-A indicates the existing contiguous bandwidths, and information of the unassigned channel (or unassigned resource unit) may be indicated via the RA field <b>432</b> and/or the user field of the HE-SIG-B. In this case, the signaling overhead of the HE-SIG-A may be reduced, but the signaling overhead of the HE-SIG-B may increase.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0224">Finally, the non-contiguous channel allocation information may be signaled via a combination of subfield(s) of the HE-SIG-A and subfield(s) of the HE-SIG-B. The subfield(s) of the HE-SIG-A may signal at least a portion of the non-contiguous channel allocation information, and the subfield(s) of the HE-SIG-B may signal the remaining information. According to an embodiment, a subfield of the HE-SIG-A may signal the detailed information of the PPDU configuration of the P80 channel and information on whether to transmit the S80 channel. If the subfield of the HE-SIG-A indicates transmission of the S80 channel, the subfield(s) of the HE-SIG-B may signal the detailed information of the PPDU configuration of the S80 channel According to another embodiment, the subfield of the HE-SIG-A may signal channel information on which the HE-SIG-B content channel(s) of the corresponding PPDU is transmitted and size information of the common block field <b>430</b>. The subfield(s) of the HE-SIG-B signal additional information of the corresponding PPDU configuration.

In addition, while the HE-STF has a repetitive pattern on the time axis when the PPDU is transmitted through a total bandwidth of 80 MHz, it is difficult to have a repetitive pattern on the time axis when the HE-STF is not transmitted on some channels.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0264">Therefore, according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, when transmitting a non-contiguous PPDU, the terminal may not transmit data but may transmit the preamble through the unassigned channel. In this case, the terminal may transmit both the legacy preamble and the non-legacy preamble through the unassigned channel. In such a case, an interference may occur to OBSS signal already transmitted through the corresponding channel. However, since the transmission power may be dispersed to the entire band in the case of the wideband PPDU transmission, there may be no significant damage to the OBSS signal.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0265">According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, the terminal may transmit only HE-STF and HE-LTF (or only HE-STF) through the unassigned channel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>. That is, a transmission of the legacy preamble, the HE-SIG-A and the HE-SIG-B, of which reception through the entire band is not required, may be restricted and only a transmission of the HE-STF and the HE-LTF, of which reception through the entire band is required, may be performed, thereby minimizing interference to the OBSS signal.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0266"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>43</b> to <b>44</b></figref> illustrate embodiments in which a transmission using an HE MU PPDU is performed between a single STA and an AP.

According to the embodiment of the present invention, a STA may perform a transmission using a resource unit of 20 MHz bandwidth or less (i.e., a narrowband) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>. The STA may increase a transmission distance of data by concentrating the transmission power on a specific resource unit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>43</b>(<i>b</i>) to <b>43</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref> illustrate embodiments for signaling such a narrowband transmission.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0268">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the narrowband transmission may be signaled via a null STA ID contained in a user field of the HE-SIG-B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>. More specifically, the RA field of the HE-SIG-A may indicate information on resource unit partition type in a specific channel. For example, if a bandwidth of 20 MHz is partitioned into nine resource units based on OFDMA, the RA field may signal &#x201c;00000000&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>. In this case, an AID of a receiver or a transmitter may be contained in a user field corresponding to a resource unit used for an uplink data transmission among the nine partitioned resource units. On the other hand, a null STA ID may be contained in user fields corresponding to the remaining resource units through which data transmission is not performed.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0269">For example, when data is transmitted only through the third 26-tone RU among the nine resource units, a null STA ID may be contained in the first to second user fields and the fourth to ninth user fields. However, if the signaling structure of the HE-SIG-B, which is designed based on the DL-MU transmission, is directly used in the uplink narrowband transmission, the signaling overhead may be increased. Thus, other signaling methods may be used to reduce the signaling overhead. According to another embodiment of the present invention, user fields after a user field in which the AID of the receiver or transmitter is contained may be excluded from the signaling. That is, in the above embodiment, the null STA ID is contained in the first to second user fields, and the AID of the receiver or transmitter may be contained in the third user field. However, the fourth to ninth user fields may not be transmitted. It is because the AP receiving the PPDU does not need to receive additional user fields after obtaining information of the transmitting STA in the third user field.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0270">According to another embodiment of the present invention, index values for the uplink resource unit allocation may be newly defined in the RA field of the HE-SIG-B for the narrowband transmission as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>. More specifically, the RA field of the HE-SIG-B may index a specific 26-tone RU, 52-tone RU and/or 106-tone RU through which an uplink transmission is performed. In this case, since only one user field corresponding to a resource unit indicated by the RA field is carried, the signaling overhead may be greatly reduced. According to an embodiment, index values for the uplink resource unit allocation may be used among unassigned (i.e., TBD) indices of the RA field configuration for the DL-MU transmission. According to another embodiment, the index values for the uplink resource unit allocation may be newly defined in the RA field.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0271">According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, the narrowband transmission may be signaled by recycling unnecessary fields of the HE-SIG-A. For example, if the HE MU PPDU is used in the uplink transmission, the number of HE-LTF symbols field and the number of HE-SIG-B symbols field in the HE-SIG-A may be used for other purposes. Since the number of HE-LTF symbols field has a function redundant with the NSTS field of the user specific field of the HE-SIG-B, no separate signaling is required. Also, in a signaling of a single STA, since the amount of signaling information is fixed and the number of symbols can be fixed according to the design, it is not necessary to indicate the number of symbols separately through the number of HE-SIG-B symbols field. Accordingly, it is possible to perform signaling of the uplink HE MU PPDU using at least one of the above fields. For example, in the resource unit allocation indicated by the RA field, the location of the resource unit through which the STA transmits the uplink data may be indicated using at least one of the above fields. In this case, the RA field of the HE-SIG-B is set to be the same as the conventional one, and the signaling overhead can be reduced since only one user field is carried.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0272">Meanwhile, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, the uplink transmission using the HE MU PPDU may be performed not only through the narrowband but also through the entire bandwidth of 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, or 160 MHz (80+80 MHz). In this case, the bandwidth field of the HE-SIG-A may indicate the total bandwidth of the PPDU, and the SIG-B compression field may indicate the compression mode of the HE-SIG-B field. Therefore, the RA field of the HE-SIG-B may be omitted in an uplink HE MU PPDU. On the other hand, when the SIG-B compression field indicates the compression mode of the HE-SIG-B field in a downlink HE MU PPDU, MU-MIMO based user specific information could be indicated. However, when the SIG-B compression field indicates the compression mode of the HE-SIG-B field in an uplink HE MU PPDU, OFDMA-based user specific information may be indicated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0273"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref> illustrates a method of configuring the HE-SIG-B when a single STA transmits a non-contiguous PPDU to an AP. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>, the S20 channel is busy in a total bandwidth of 80 MHz. Therefore, the STA transmits a PPDU in a 60 MHz band including the P20 channel and the S40 channel.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0274">The bandwidth field of the HE-SIG-A defined in the existing HE SU PPDU format is not suitable for signaling a non-contiguous PPDU. Therefore, the STA may perform the transmission of the non-contiguous PPDU using the HE MU PPDU format. In this case, the bandwidth field of the HE-SIG-A indicates puncturing of the S20 channel in the total bandwidth of 80 MHz. The HE-SIG-B carries information of the single STA (i.e., SU Info) through the P20 channel and the S40 channel.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0275">Meanwhile, since the configuration information of the non-contiguous PPDU is signaled via the bandwidth field, the common block field of the HE-SIG-B may be omitted. Therefore, the SIG-B compression field may indicate the compression mode of the HE-SIG-B field. In addition, the user specific field of the HE-SIG-B may carry only one user field. In this case, an AID of a transmitter, not an AID of a receiver, is contained in the user field. When the HE MU PPDU is used for the uplink transmission, it is obvious that the receiver of the corresponding PPDU is an AP. When the UL/DL field of the HE MU PPDU indicates an uplink transmission, the AP may interpret the AID contained in the user field as the AID of the transmitter.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0276"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>45</b> to <b>46</b></figref> illustrate methods of a non-contiguous channel allocation and a signaling thereof according to additional embodiments of the present invention.
