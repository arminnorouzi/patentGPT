Options include high power consumption for higher performance or low performance for energy savings. The performance may be determined in terms of refresh rate and color gamut.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A high refresh panel may benefit many applications including ones with fast motion images such as watching movies, playing games, and inking. The high refresh rate has a downside as it consumes higher amounts of power. Likewise, the backlight light emitting diode (LED) which leads to wider color gamut in an LCD display, also consumes higher power. Lower power LED backlights result in narrower color gamut.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some instances, when the refresh rate is high, the color gamut may not be noticeable. In this instance, high color gamut may be superfluous. Gaming content often moves so fast that absolute color accuracy may not be relevant or valuable. Creative content, retouching photos or color correcting film, may be an instance where high color gamut matters most.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A configurable high color gamut display panel is described herein. The high color gamut display panel provides an end-user or a system integrator a configuration option to operate the liquid crystal display in a variety of display modes. The display modes include but are not limited to a high color gamut mode for creative applications, a narrow color gamut mode with high refresh rate for fast motion images, and a narrow gamut mode with low refresh rate for minimizing power consumption of the display panel and likewise the integrated system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a high color gamut display panel <b>100</b>. The high color gamut display panel <b>100</b> may include a liquid crystal display (LCD) <b>104</b>, a time controller <b>114</b>, and an LED driver <b>112</b>. The high color gamut display panel <b>100</b> may be incorporated with a display device or a display system. The display device or display system may incorporate other ancillary components including but not limited to casing, bezels, digitizers, cameras, and power systems. As described here the fundamental operation of the combination of the gate driver <b>108</b> and source driver <b>106</b> may continue standards of industry operation. For example, the gate driver <b>108</b> may turn on the transistor within each pixel cell on a horizontal row of an LCD <b>104</b>. Once the gate driver <b>108</b> turns on the transistor, the source driver <b>106</b> may generate voltages that are applied to the liquid crystal with each pixel cell on that row for data input. The LCD <b>104</b>, the source driver <b>106</b> and the gate driver <b>108</b> may remain unchanged from a standard display implementation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The time controller <b>114</b> may coordinate the high color gamut display panel <b>100</b>. The time controller <b>114</b> may receive a display panel configuration. The time controller <b>114</b> may be communicatively coupled to the source driver <b>106</b>, the gate driver <b>108</b>, the LED driver <b>112</b>, and a switch <b>110</b>. The time controller <b>114</b> transmits a display signal <b>116</b> and a backlight signal <b>118</b>. The time controller <b>114</b> may synchronize the display signal <b>116</b> and the backlight signal <b>118</b> to configure a combination of a color gamut value and a refresh rate value based on a display panel configuration. The display panel configuration may include an operation refresh rate and a specified color gamut. The display panel configuration may be a data structure capable of being encoded and decoded by the time controller <b>114</b>. In another implementation, the display panel configuration may be decoded and decomposed by another system, and the resultant parts (including refresh rate and color gamut) may be transmitted to the time controller <b>114</b>.

The display signal <b>116</b> may control the gate driver <b>108</b> and source driver <b>106</b>. As such, the display LCD <b>104</b> may be refreshed at different rates, e.g. 60 Hz, 120 Hz, 144 Hz, 240 Hz, 300 Hz, etc.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The time controller <b>114</b> may also transmit a backlight signal <b>118</b> to the light emitting diode (LED) driver <b>112</b> and the switch <b>110</b>. The backlight signal <b>118</b> controls LED driver <b>112</b> to light on LEDs. Further, the backlight signal <b>118</b> provides control instructions to the switch <b>110</b>. The switch <b>110</b> may decide which set of LEDs to be light on. The LED driver <b>112</b> may control power output to the LEDs thereby extending battery life and enhance LCD display panel performance through heightened dimming methods. The LED driver <b>112</b> may also implement electromagnetic interference mitigation techniques, selectable switching frequency, and fault protection notification. In an example, the LED driver <b>112</b> may control the switch <b>110</b> based on information received in the backlight signal <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">The display panel configuration may be received via an open application programming interface (API) from a user controllable application. For instance, a user may manually select a combination and refresh rate and a color gamut for their specific use case through a user accessible application. Alternatively, an automated system executing on a host device of the high color gamut display panel may detect a use case based on the executing application. For example, if a video editing application is executing on the host device, the automated system may detect that application and send a display panel configuration to the time controller <b>114</b> indicating high refresh and high color gamut.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">In another implementation, the display panel configuration may be remotely locked. In an effort to differentiate products yet use the same bill of materials, the display panel configuration may be locked at production. In this implementation, the time controller <b>114</b> may discard any newly received display panel configuration. In another implementation, the display panel configuration may be restricted. The time controller <b>114</b> may receive authentication and authorization in the display panel configuration to effect any change. For example, the high color gamut display receives an initial display panel configuration. In an example, the user may request and pay for additional functionality of the high color gamut display. Upon receipt of payment, an automated system may send a display panel configuration including authentication and authorization to enable configurations that were previously not accessible. Likewise, upon production, the high color gamut display panel may be shipped in a configuration. Upon installation, the time controller <b>114</b> may receive a display panel configuration to lock the refresh rate and color gamut from a remote source. In some implementations, the display panel configuration may be propagated to the high color gamut display panel through the host device via a communication channel in the display connection.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">Communicatively coupled to the switch may be a high color gamut LED <b>120</b>A and a narrow color gamut LED <b>120</b>B. For simplicity and ease of understanding the high color gamut LED <b>120</b>A and the narrow color gamut LED <b>120</b>B are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as a single LED. However, in implementation, the high color gamut LED <b>120</b>A and the narrow color gamut LED <b>120</b>B may be a corresponding set of high color gamut LEDs and a corresponding set of narrow color gamut LEDs.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">The switch <b>110</b> may toggle between the high color gamut LED <b>120</b>A and the narrow color gamut LED <b>120</b>B. In some implementations, the backlight signal <b>118</b> provides the LED driver <b>112</b> with the display panel configuration detail determinative of which LED to toggle. The LED driver <b>112</b> toggles the switch to activate the specified LED backlight. In another implementation, an LED driver <b>112</b> may not be aware of the existence of the dual LED-type configuration. In this implementation, the time controller <b>114</b> may transmit the backlight signal <b>118</b> directly to the switch <b>110</b> to toggle the switch <b>110</b> independently. This implementation may include the use of pre-existing LED drivers <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of a high color gamut display panel <b>200</b>A with a single light guide plate. As described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the high color gamut LED <b>120</b>A and the narrow color gamut LED <b>1208</b> may be described in terms of sets of LEDs of the same type. For example, the high color gamut LED <b>120</b>A may correspond to a set of high color gamut LEDs and the narrow color gamut LED <b>120</b>A may correspond to a set of narrow color gamut LEDs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">In this implementation a high color gamut display panel <b>200</b>A may include an LCD <b>104</b>, a light guide plate <b>202</b>, and an LED array <b>204</b>. The LCD <b>104</b> may be similar to the one referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in that it may be implemented with the corresponding source driver <b>106</b>, gate driver <b>108</b> and time controller <b>114</b>, The light guide plate <b>202</b> provides the backlighting for the LCD <b>104</b>. The light guide plate <b>202</b> provides physical structure to support the LED array <b>204</b> and may channel backlight through the LCD <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">The LED array <b>204</b> may include alternating high color gamut LEDs <b>120</b>A, and narrow color gamut LEDs <b>120</b>B. Each of the same-type LEDs are communicatively coupled to the switch <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As such, each of the same-type LEDs operate synchronously with each of the same-type. For example, if one high color gamut LED <b>120</b>A is toggled, all of high color gamut LEDs within the LED array <b>204</b> may be toggled to the same state. At any given time, all of the same-type LEDs are in the same state. In another implementation, sections of the high color gamut display panel <b>200</b>A may be configured independently based on application executing within that digital graphical space. For example, a user may be utilizing an application such as movie editing software on a portion of the display, and the user may be utilizing an email client on the other portion of the screen. In this example, the time controller <b>114</b> may toggle the set of high color gamut LEDs for the portion of displaying the movie editing software, and may toggle the set of narrow color gamut LEDs for the portion displaying the email client.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">As the LEDs array <b>204</b> may include the alternating high color gamut LEDs <b>120</b>A and the narrow color gamut LEDs <b>1206</b>, the light guide plate <b>202</b> may offer full backlighting support to the LCD <b>104</b>. In one implementation, when the set of high color gamut LEDs within the LED array <b>204</b> are enabled, the set of narrow color gamut LEDs within the LED array <b>204</b> are disabled. Additionally, when the set of narrow color gamut LEDs within the LED array <b>204</b> are enabled, the set of high color gamut LEDs within the LED array <b>204</b> are disabled. Utilizing the multiple sets of differing and alternating LEDs allows a single LCD <b>104</b> to support multiple color gamuts.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> illustrates an example of a high color gamut display panel <b>2003</b> with multiple light guide plate. The high color gamut display panel <b>200</b>B may include a liquid crystal display <b>104</b>, a high color gamut light guide plate <b>206</b> and a narrow color gamut light guide plate <b>208</b>. The high color gamut light guide plate <b>206</b> and the narrow color gamut light guide plate <b>208</b> may be planarly parallel and stacked upon another in a cohesive assembly with the LCD <b>104</b>. The high color gamut light guide plate <b>206</b>, the narrow color gamut light guide plate <b>208</b>, and the LCD <b>104</b> are stacked in parallel planes.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">The high color gamut light guide plate <b>206</b> may include a high color gamut LED array <b>210</b>. The high color gamut LED array <b>210</b> may include an array of homogenous LEDs such as the high color gamut LED <b>120</b>A. The high color gamut LED array <b>210</b> of the high color gamut light guide plate <b>206</b> may provide one of two illumination sources. Likewise, the narrow color gamut light guide plate <b>208</b> may include a narrow color gamut LED array <b>212</b>. The narrow color gamut LED array <b>212</b> of the narrow color gamut light guide plate <b>208</b> may provide the second of two illumination sources. The narrow color gamut LED array <b>212</b> may include an array of homogenous LEDs such as the narrow color gamut. LED <b>120</b>B.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">The high color gamut LED array <b>210</b> and the narrow color gamut LED array <b>212</b> may be offset from one another. For example, in the cohesive stacked assembly, a narrow color gamut. LED <b>120</b>B may physically reside in between two high color gamut LEDs <b>120</b>A, however the narrow color gamut LED <b>120</b>B may be located in a parallel plane to the high color gamut LEDs <b>120</b>A within the narrow color light guide plate <b>208</b>. Likewise, the high color gamut LEDs <b>120</b>A reside within the high color gamut light guide plate <b>206</b> and maintain the same offset relationship from the narrow color gamut LEDs <b>120</b>B. Utilizing the approach illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. existing light guide plates may be utilized to create the same, effect as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> without the redesign of a light guide plate and the construction of a new alternating LED array.

The controller <b>302</b> may be synonymous with the timing controller <b>114</b> referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The controller <b>302</b> may include but is not limited to central processing units (CPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphical processing units (GPUs).
