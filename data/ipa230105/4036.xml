A mobile terminal includes a flat display device using liquid crystal or organic EL elements. The display device is connected to a host device which outputs image data, commands, and the like. The display device includes a display panel and a driver processing commands and driving the display panel.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the display device, pixels two-dimensionally arrayed on the display panel include a common electrode and a pixel electrode, and the liquid crystal or organic EL elements are arranged between the common electrode and the pixel electrode. When the driver writes a pixel signal to the pixels on the display panel, the liquid crystal or organic EL elements arranged between the common electrode and the pixel electrode are controlled and an image is thereby displayed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Display devices capable of detecting an inputting object such as a finger and a touch pen (also called a stylus) approaching or contacting the screen have been widely employed. The operation of allowing the inputting object to approach or contact the screen is called a touch operation or a touch, and the detection of a position of the inputting object is called touch detection. Examples of the touch detection include various types such as an optical type, a resistive type, a capacitive type, and an electromagnetic induction type. The capacitive type utilizes a feature that the electrostatic capacitance between a pair of electrodes (called a drive electrode and a detection electrode) is varied by approach or contact of the inputting object, and has benefits that the structure is comparatively simple and that the power consumption is small.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">If the number of drive electrodes and the detection electrodes is increased to improve the performance of the image display operation and the touch detection operation, in the display device with the touch detection function, a layout of lines connected to the electrodes or a terminal layout of a semiconductor chip controlling the image display operation and the touch detection operation becomes complicated. In accordance with this, the number of terminals of the semiconductor chip is increased, the size of the semiconductor chip becomes larger, and the structure becomes complicated.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present application generally relates to a display device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one embodiment, a display device includes a display unit including electrodes, a touch sensor configured to supply drive signals to the electrodes and receive signals from the electrodes, and a switch circuit group including transistors connected between the touch sensor and the electrodes. The transistors include a first transistor connected to a first electrode via a line of a first length and a second transistor connected to a second electrode via a line of a second length longer than the first length. The channel width of the first transistor is smaller than a channel width of the second transistor.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

The disclosure is merely an example and is not limited by contents described in the embodiments described below. Modification which is easily conceivable by a person of ordinary skill in the art comes within the scope of the disclosure as a matter of course. In order to make the description clearer, the sizes, shapes and the like of the respective parts may not be illustrated as they are, but may be changed and illustrated schematically in the drawings, and hatching attached to distinguish structures may be omitted. Constituent elements corresponding to each other in a plurality of drawings may be denoted by similar reference numerals and their detailed descriptions may be omitted unless necessary.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In general, according to one embodiment, a display device includes a display unit including electrodes two-dimensionally arrayed on a substrate, a touch sensor configured to supply drive signals for touch detection to the electrodes and receiving the signals from the electrodes, and a switch circuit including transistors connected between the touch sensor and the electrodes to select at least one of the electrodes. The transistors include a first transistor connected to a first electrode of the electrodes via a line of a first length and a second transistor connected to a second electrode of the electrodes via a line of a second length longer than the first length. A channel width of the first transistor is smaller than a channel width of the second transistor.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The display device equipped with the touch detection function includes an on-cell type (also called an external type) in which the display device and the touch panel implementing the touch function are produced separately and the touch panel is bonded to the screen of the display device, and an in-cell type (also called a built-in type) in which the display device and the touch panel are integrated. The in-cell type display device includes a device in which several or all parts having the touch detection function also serve as several or all parts having the display function or a device in which a component having the touch detection function and a component having the display function do not serve each other. In the in-cell type display device, for example, the detection electrode is formed between a color filter and a polarizer, and a common electrode formed on a TFT substrate is also served as a drive electrode. Since the in-cell type display device includes no external touch panel, the display device is entirely slim and lightweight, and visibility of the display is also improved. Embodiments of the in-cell type display device will be explained. However, the embodiments can also be applied to an on-cell type display device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Examples of the touch detection include various types such as an optical type, a resistive type, a capacitive type, and an electromagnetic induction type. The capacitive type utilizes a feature that the electrostatic capacitance between a pair of electrodes (called a drive electrode and a detection electrode) is varied by approach or contact of the inputting object, and has benefits that the structure is comparatively simple and that the power consumption is small. A display device equipped with a capacitive touch detection function will be explained as the embodiments. However, the embodiments can be applied to not only the capacitive type touch detection, but also the touch detection of the other types such as an electromagnetic induction type.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The capacitive type includes a mutual-capacitive type (mutual capacitive sensing) for detecting an electrostatic capacitance between two detection electrodes opposed to be spaced apart from each other and a self-capacitive type (self-capacitive sensing) for detecting an electrostatic capacitance between one detection electrode and, for example, a reference electrode having a reference potential such as a ground potential. The self-capacitive sensing will be explained as an example, but the embodiments can also be applied to a display device which executes mutual-capacitive touch detection. In the self-capacitive sensing, the reference electrode may be a conductive pattern of being disposed around the detection electrode in a remote distance to form an electrostatic capacitance which can be detected between the reference electrode and the detection electrode. A path for supplying a fixed potential may be connected to the reference electrode. The shape and the like of the reference electrode are not particularly limited. The display device with the touch detection function is an aspect of the input device, and detects an input signal and calculates a touch position when a finger or an input instrument such as a stylus touches or approaches the touch surface. The touch position is coordinates of a point at which the input signal is detected, on the touch surface.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A liquid crystal display device, an organic EL display device, a plasma display device, and the like can be used as the display device and, the embodiments using the liquid crystal display device will be explained hereinafter as an example, but the embodiments can also be applied to the organic EL display device, the plasma display device, and the like. The display mode of the liquid crystal display device is largely classified into two modes in accordance with the direction of application of the electric field to vary the alignment of liquid crystal molecules of a liquid crystal layer which is a display function layer. The first mode is what is called a longitudinal electric field mode in which the electric field is applied in a thickness direction (or an out-of-plane direction). The longitudinal electric field mode includes, for example, twisted nematic (TN) mode, vertical alignment (VA) mode, and the like. The second mode is what is called a lateral electric field mode in which the electric field is applied in a plane direction (or an in-plane direction). The lateral electric field mode includes, for example, in-plane switching (IPS) mode, fringe field switching (FFS) mode which is a type of the IPS mode, and the like. The embodiments explained below can be applied to any one of the longitudinal electric field mode and the lateral electric field. The display device of the lateral electric field will be explained as the embodiments, but the embodiments can also be applied to the display device of the longitudinal electric field.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">[Schematic Configuration]</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view showing an overall schematic configuration of an example of a display device equipped with a touch detection function according to the embodiment. The display device includes a display panel PNL including a touch detection mechanism, a touch sensing chip TSC, and a driver chip DRC. The display panel PNL includes a transparent first substrate SUB<b>1</b> formed of glass, resin, and the like, a transparent second substrate SUB<b>2</b> formed of glass, resin, and the like and disposed to be opposed to the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>, and a liquid crystal layer (not shown) disposed between the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> and the second substrate SUB<b>2</b>. Since pixels (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) are disposed in two-dimensional array (also called a matrix) in the X direction and the Y direction on the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>, the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> is also called a pixel substrate or an array substrate. The second substrate SUB<b>2</b> is also called a counter-substrate. The display panel PNL is observed from the second substrate SUB<b>2</b> side. For this reason, the second substrate SUB<b>2</b> may be called an upper substrate while the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> may be called a lower substrate.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The display panel PNL is shaped in a rectangular flat plate, and its shorter side is along an X direction and its longer side is along a Y direction. The first substrate SUB<b>1</b> and the second substrate SUB<b>2</b> are substantially the same in size of the shorter side but different in size of the lower side. The longer side of the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> is larger than the longer side of the second substrate SUB<b>2</b>. Since a first shorter side of the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> and a first shorter side of the second substrate SUB<b>2</b> are aligned, a second shorter side of the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> protrudes further than a second shorter side of the second substrate SUB<b>2</b> in the Y direction. The driver chip DRC which drives the display panel PNL for image display is mounted on a portion of the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> protruding further than the second substrate SUB<b>2</b> in the Y direction. The driver chip DRC is also called a driver IC or a display controller IC. An area where the pixels are disposed in two-dimensional array is called a display area DA (or an active area), and a non-display area NDA other than the display area DA is also called a frame area.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The display device can be connected to a host device HOST. The display panel PNL and the host device HOST are connected to each other via two flexible printed circuits FPC<b>1</b> and FPC<b>2</b>. The host device HOST is connected to the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> via the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>1</b>. The touch sensing chip TSC which controls the touch detection is a Chip on Film (COF) chip disposed on the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>1</b>. The touch sensing chip TSC is also called a touch detector IC or touch controller IC. The touch sensing chip TSC may be a Chip on Glass (COG) chip which is not disposed on the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>1</b>, but on the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The driver chip DRC and the touch sensing chip TSC are electrically connected to each other by means of the timing pulse, and the like and cooperate with respect to the operation timing. The driver chip DRC and the touch sensing chip TSC may not be constituted as different ICs, but as the same IC. In this case, the single IC may be disposed on the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> or the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>1</b>. The driver chip DRC may also be disposed not on the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>, but on the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A backlight unit BL serving as an illumination device which illuminates the display panel PNL is provided on the back side of the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> (i.e., the back surface side of the display panel PNL). The host device HOST is connected to the backlight unit BL via a flexible printed circuit FPC<b>2</b>. Various types of backlight units can be employed as the backlight unit BL. For example, a light-emitting diode (LED), a cold-cathode tube (CCFL) and the like, can be used as the light source. An illumination device using a light guide disposed on the back surface side of the display panel PNL and an LED or a cold-cathode tube disposed on its side surface side can be employed as the backlight unit BL. An illumination device using a spot light source in which light emitting elements are aligned in plane on the back surface side of the display panel PNL can also be employed as the backlight unit BL. Not only the backlight, but a front light disposed on the display surface side of the display panel PNL can be used as the illumination device. If the display device is a reflective display device or if the display panel PNL employs organic EL, the illumination device may not be provided. The display device includes a secondary battery, a power circuit, and the like, though not illustrated in the drawing.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a longitudinally elongated screen in which the length of the Y direction is larger than the length of the X direction and the X direction is set as the lateral direction, but may be applied to a laterally elongated screen in which the length of the X direction is larger than the length of the Y direction.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">[Circuit Configuration]</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a plan view showing an example of the display device according to the embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing an example of several parts of the display area DA. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plan view showing an example of arrangement of the common electrodes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram showing an example of a pixel. To facilitate viewing, constituent members of the display panel PNL will be shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> separately. To illustrate an example of a positional relationship between a scanning line GL and a signal line SL in a thickness direction of the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a scanning line GL provided in a cross-section different from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> will be shown together for convenience of explanations.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the driver chip DRC includes a signal line driver SD which drives the display panel PNL. The touch sensing chip TSC includes a sensor SE including a capacitive-type touch detection function. The sensor SE includes a detection controller DCP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) which controls the touch detection operation and processes a signal output from a detection electrode Rx (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). A configuration of the sensor SE serving as the touch detection circuit and a detection method of the sensor SE will be explained later. The display device includes a control module provided outside the display panel PNL or the like and the control module is electrically connected to the display panel PNL via a flexible printed circuit FPC<b>1</b>, though not illustrated in the figure. The detection controller DCP may be disposed inside the driver chip DRC.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the backlight unit BL is disposed on a back surface side of the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>. An optical element OD<b>1</b> is provided between the backlight unit BL and the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>. The first substrate SUB<b>1</b> includes an insulating substrate <b>10</b>, insulating films <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b>, the common electrode CE (also called a detection electrode Rx), the pixel electrode PE, and a first alignment film ALL The second substrate SUB<b>2</b> includes a second alignment film AL<b>2</b>, an overcoat layer OCL, red, green, and blue color filters CFR, CFG, and CFB, a black matrix BM, an insulating substrate <b>20</b>, and a conductive film CDF. A liquid crystal layer LQ serving as an electro-optical layer is disposed between the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> and the second substrate SUB<b>2</b>. An optical element OD<b>2</b> is disposed on a surface side of the second substrate SUB<b>2</b>. The surface of the optical element OD<b>2</b> is a touch detection surface TDS or a display surface DS on which an image is displayed.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the display panel PNL includes detection electrodes Rx disposed in a two-dimensional array in the first direction X and the second direction Y in the display area DA. The sensor SE detects variation in the electrostatic capacitance of each of the detection electrodes Rx, though the details are explained later. Since the detection electrodes Rx are provided inside the display panel PNL, the embodiments relate to an in-cell type display device equipped with the touch detection function. An example of a planar shape of the detection electrode Rx is a square, but may be an octagon formed by slightly cutting corners of a square, a shape formed by rounding corners of a square, or the like.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the driver chip DRC is provided in a non-display area NDA outside the display area DA of the display panel PNL on the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>. The driver chip DRC includes a signal line driver SD which drives the liquid crystal layer LQ (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) serving as an electro-optical layer via wirings SCL and signal lines SL, and the like. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the signal line driver SD supplies a video signal Spic to the pixel electrode PE provided in the pixel PX via the wiring SCL and the signal line SL.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the display area DA, m&#xd7;n pixels PX are aligned in a two-dimensional array in the X direction and the Y direction. Each of m and n is an arbitrarily positive integer. The signal lines SL extending in the Y direction are spaced apart from each other and aligned in the X direction. &#x201c;m&#x201d; signal lines SL<b>1</b>, SL<b>2</b>, SLm (generically called SL) are aligned in order of SL<b>1</b>, SL<b>2</b>, SLm, from one side to the other side in the X direction. Ends of the signal lines SL drawn to the non-display area NDA outside the display area DA and are electrically connected to the driver chip DRC via connection wirings SCL for signal serving as connection wirings (also called connection leads).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The signal lines SL and the wirings SCL are video signal lines for transmitting video signals, but the signal lines SL and the wirings SCL can be distinguished in the following manner. The lines disposed inside the display area DA, of the signal transmission paths connected to the driver chip DRC to supply the video signals to the pixels PX, are called the signal lines SL, and the lines outside the display area DA are called the wirings SCL. The signal lines SL extend linearly in the Y direction, in parallel with one another. Since the wirings SCL are the lines for connecting the signal lines SL and the driver chip DRC, the wirings SCL include bent portions having an entirely fan shape, between the signal lines SL and the driver chip DRC.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The signal lines SL and the driver chip DRC may be connected directly via the wirings SCL or the other circuit may be disposed between the signal lines SL and the driver chip DRC. For example, an RGB select switch for selecting a red video signal, a green video signal or a blue video signal may be interposed between the signal lines SL and the driver chip DRC. The RGB select switch is, for example, a multiplexer circuit, which inputs signals formed by multiplexing the red video signal, the green video signal, and the blue video signal and selectively outputs the input video signals to signal lines SL for each color. In this case, the number of wirings SCL which connect the RGB select switch and the driver chip DRC is smaller than the number of signal lines SL.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A scanning line driver GD serving as a scanning signal output circuit for sequentially outputting scanning signals to the scanning lines GL is provided in the non-display area NDA on the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>. The driver chip DRC is connected to the scanning line driver GD via a wiring W<b>1</b> to supply control signals such as a clock signal and an enable signal to the scanning line driver GD. The scanning line GL extending in the X direction are spaced apart from each other and aligned in the Y direction. &#x201c;n&#x201d; scanning lines GL<b>1</b>, GL<b>2</b>, . . . GLn (generically called GL) are aligned in order of GL<b>1</b>, GL<b>2</b>, . . . GLn, from one side to the other side in the Y direction. Ends of the scanning lines GL are drawn to the non-display area NDA outside the display area DA and connected to the scanning line driver GD. The scanning lines GL intersect the signal lines SL.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The scanning line driver GD may include, for example, shift register circuits (not shown) and a switch (also called a switching element) connected to the shift register circuit to select an electric potential supplied to the scanning line GL, based on the control signals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example in which the scanning line driver GD is disposed in one side in the X direction while a scanning line drive circuit is not disposed in the other side, but the layout of the scanning line driver GD can be variously modified. For example, the scanning line driver GD may be disposed on each of the sides in the X direction and the display area DA may be disposed between two scanning line drive circuits GD. A buffer circuit for shaping waveforms of the control signals may be connected between the driver chip DRC and the scanning line driver GD.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the common electrodes CE are aligned in a two-dimensional array in the X direction and the Y direction. Common lines CML are connected to the common electrodes CE, respectively. The common electrodes CE are connected to a switch circuit group SWG via the common lines CML. A common electrode driver CD (also called common potential circuit) which drives the common electrodes CE during the image display is disposed on the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>1</b> and is electrically connected to the common electrodes CE via a common potential supply line VCDL, the switch circuit group SWG, and the common lines CML.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the embodiments, the common electrodes CE serve as the detection electrodes Rx for self-capacitive touch detection. For this reason, the common lines CML also has a function of lines for detected signal transmission for transmitting the signals detected by the detection electrodes Rx to the sensor SE.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Since the self-capacitive touch detection is executed by using the detection electrodes Rx, the common lines CML also has a function of the lines for signal transmission for inputting drive waveforms serving as write signals to the detection electrodes Rx, though explained later in detail.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The number of common electrodes CE may be equal to the number of pixels PX shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> or may be smaller than the number of pixels PX. If the number of common electrodes CE which operate as the detection electrodes Rx is equal to the number of pixels PX, the resolution of the touch detection becomes substantially the same as the resolution of the display image. If the number of common electrodes CE is smaller than the number of pixels PX, the resolution of the touch detection is lower than the resolution of the display image but the number of common lines CML can be reduced. In general, the resolution of the display image is high as compared with the resolution of the touch detection. Therefore, the number of common electrodes CE may be smaller than the number of pixels PX. For example, a plane area of one detection electrode Rx is 4 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 36 mm<sup>2</sup>, one detection electrode Rx overlaps several tens to several hundreds of pixels PX.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The switch circuit group SWG connected to the common lines CML is disposed outside the driver chip DRC, though explained later in detail. The switch circuit group SWG is disposed in the non-display area NDA on the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>. A control pulse generator CPG is connected to the switch circuit group SWG</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The control pulse generator CPG is a circuit which selectively turns on and off switches (explained later in detail) provided in the switch circuit group SWG. The control pulse generator CPG is disposed outside the driver chip DRC, for example, in the non-display area NDA on the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>. If the control pulse generator CPG is disposed outside the driver chip DRC, versatility of the driver chip DRC is increased. The control pulse generator CPG may be disposed inside the driver chip DRC. Details of the layout of the switch circuit group SWG connecting each of the detection electrodes Rx to the sensor SE will be explained later in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> and the like. The control pulse generator CPG may be disposed inside the driver chip DRC.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The arrangement of the scanning line driver GD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and the common electrode driver CD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) is not limited to the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.

The pixels PX may share one common electrode CE. The pixel switch PSW includes, for example, a thin-film transistor (TFT). The pixel switch PSW is electrically connected to the scanning line GL and the signal line SL. A semiconductor layer of the pixel switch PSW is formed of, for example, polycrystalline silicon (poly-silicon) but may be formed of amorphous silicon.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The pixel electrode PE is electrically connected to the pixel switch PSW. The pixel electrode PE is opposed to the common electrode CE via the insulating film. The liquid crystal layer LQ is disposed between the pixel electrode PE and the common electrode CE. A storage capacitor CS is formed by the common electrode CE, an insulating film and the pixel electrode PE.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">An electric field is formed between the pixel electrode PE and the common electrode CE, based on the drive signal applied to each electrode, during the display period (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) in which a display image is formed based on the video signals. Liquid crystal molecules contained in the liquid crystal layer LQ serving as the electro-optical layer are driven by the electric field formed between the pixel electrode PE and the common electrode CE. In the display device using the lateral electric field mode, the pixel electrodes PE and the common electrodes CE are disposed on the first substrate SUB<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

In the figure, the high level indicates turning on the switches while the low level indicates turning off the switches. In other words, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is also a timing chart showing control of the control pulse generator CPG which controls the switches. The display device of the embodiments has a display operation period FLD for executing a display operation of forming the image displayed on the display surface DS (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and a touch detection operation period FLT for executing a touch detection operation of detecting touch of the object such as a finger on the touch detection surface TDS. The display operation period FLD is also called a display period. The touch detection operation period FLT is also called a detection period. The display operation FLD and the touch detection operation FLT are repeated. For this reason, the display periods FLD and the detection periods FLT are alternately repeated along the time axis (lateral direction) in the time chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The switches SWd connected to the detection elements of all the rows and all the columns are turned off in the detection periods FLT and turned on in the display periods FLD. The switches SWp and SWn connected to the detection elements of all the rows and all the columns are turned off in the display periods FLD. For this reason, the common potential is supplied from the common potential supply line VDCL to all the detection electrodes Rx via the switches SWd in the display periods FLD. In the display periods FLD, the liquid crystal layer LQ (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) which is the electro-optical layer is driven based on the video signals and the display image is formed.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the detection periods FLT, the switches SWp and SWn connected to the detection elements of each row are turned on in every two columns and the turned-on switches are sequentially changed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. When the switches SWpj are turned on (or off), the switches SWnj are turned off (or on). If the detection electrodes Rx are arranged in six columns, the first scan is repeated after the sixth scan. The sensor SE outputs a drive signal DSp shaped in a high frequency pulse to the drive signal lines TSpL and a guard signal DSn having the same waveform as the drive signal to the guard signal line TSnL in the detection period FLT. For this reason, the drive signals DSp are supplied to the detection electrodes Rx of two columns selected by two turned-on switches SWp, and the guard signals DSn are supplied to the detection electrodes Rx of the other columns. The touch detection operation in the self-capacitive sensing mode explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is thereby executed. The sensor SE detects a total of the detection values of the detection electrodes Rx of each row and two columns, via the drive signal lines TSpL serving as the detection signal lines DSL, and the detection value of each detection electrode Rx is obtained from the total detection value by the following operation.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the touch detection period, driving the detection electrodes Rx of any two columns, of the detection electrodes Rx of three columns constituting one group of each row, by the drive signals DSp via the drive signal lines TSpL indicates that the drive signals DSp are coded by a code pattern (1 indicates the drive signal DSp and 0 indicates the guard signal DSn). The code pattern corresponds to turning on and off the switches SWp.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">If the detection values of the detection electrodes Rx<b>11</b>, Rx<b>12</b>, and Rx<b>13</b> are

Since the signal of the detection electrode Rx<b>12</b> is higher than the signals of the other detection electrodes, the detection electrode Rx<b>12</b> can be determined as the touch electrode. After that, the detection values of the detection electrodes of three columns can be obtained by three scans in the similar manner.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0124">If the touch is detected on a certain detection electrode Rx, coordinates of the position of the detection electrode Rx by which the touch has been detected on the touch detection surface (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) are calculated and the coordinate data are output to an external circuit such as the host device. The external circuit changes the image in the display area DA, based on the acquired coordinate data. Calculation of the position coordinates and output of the coordinate data may be executed by, for example, a circuit (for example, a data processing circuit) included in the sensor SE. The data processing circuit may be formed on the substrate SUB<b>1</b> or formed in the driver chip DRC. The data processing circuit may be formed on the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>1</b> or may be formed at a location remote from the display panel PNL and connected via the flexible printed circuit FPC<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0125">If the touch is not detected on any detection electrodes Rx, the coordinate data are not output to the external circuit. Alternatively, the above data processing circuit may output to the external circuit a signal indicating that the touch is not detected on any detection electrodes Rx.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0126">Not only CDM<b>3</b>, but CDM<b>4</b>, CDM<b>5</b>, . . . and the like can be employed. For example, in CDM<b>4</b>, four detection electrodes are determined as one group and simultaneous drive of three detection electrodes is executed four times. If the detection value of each detection electrode Rx is obtained from the total detection values of three detection electrodes Rx, a value which is four times as large as the actual detection value can be obtained. In CDM<b>9</b>, simultaneous drive of five detection electrodes is executed nine times. The number of simultaneously driven electrodes and the number of times of simultaneous drive can be selected arbitrarily. The sensitivity is increased as the number of simultaneously driven electrodes is larger.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0127">[Switch Circuit Group SWG]</p><p id="p-0135" num="0128">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the detection electrode Rx array is disposed in the display area DA, and the switch circuit group SWG is disposed in the non-display area NDA. For this reason, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the distance between the detection electrodes Rx of each row and the switch circuit group SWG is different in each row. The common line CML connecting the detection electrodes Rx remotest from the switch circuit group SWG, for example, the detection electrodes Rx<b>11</b> to Rx<b>16</b> of the first row to the switch circuit group SWG is the longest, and the common line CML connecting the detection electrodes Rx closest to the switch circuit group SWG, for example, the detection electrodes Rx<b>41</b> to Rx<b>46</b> of the fourth row to the switch circuit group SWG is the shortest. As the resistance of the common line is proportional to its length, the resistance between the switch circuit group SWG and the detection electrodes of each row is different in each row. For this reason, on-resistances of the TFTs constituting the switches SWd, SWp, and SWn included in the switch circuit group SWG do not need to be the same, but the on-resistance of the TFTs connected to the remote detection electrodes Rx<b>11</b> to Rx<b>16</b> via the longer CML line needs to be small while the on-resistance of the TFTs connected to the closer detection electrodes Rx<b>41</b> to Rx<b>46</b> via the shorter CML line may be large. The on-resistance of the TFT is inversely proportional to the channel width. For this reason, all the channel widths of TFTs <b>161</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>163</b>, and <b>164</b> connected to the detection electrodes of the first to fourth rows do not need to be equal and may be different. The channel width of the TFT <b>161</b> connected to the detection electrodes Rx<b>11</b> to Rx<b>16</b> of the first row may be the largest, the channel widths of the TFT <b>162</b> and TFT <b>163</b> connected to the detection electrodes of the second and third rows may become smaller, and the channel width of the TFT <b>164</b> connected to the detection electrodes Rx<b>41</b> to Rx<b>46</b> of the fourth row may be the smallest. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref> shows an example of the TFT <b>164</b> connected to the detection electrodes of the fourth row. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> shows an example of the TFT <b>161</b> connected to the detection electrodes of the first row. A channel width W<b>1</b> of the TFT <b>164</b> along the gate line Ga is thus smaller than a channel width W<b>2</b> of the TFT <b>161</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0129">Thus, the channel width of the TFT connected to the detection electrode Rx which is the closest to the switch circuit group SWG, of the TFTs included in the switch circuit group SWG, can be made smaller than the channel widths of the other TFTs. For this reason, an occupation area of the TFTs is reduced, free space is increased on the first substrate SUB<b>1</b>, and mounting the circuits and layout of wirings are facilitated. If the degree of freedom of the wiring is increased and the density of wiring is reduced, the occurrence of the parasitic capacitance and the parasitic resistance can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0130">[Wiring Example of Detection Electrodes Rx and Sensor SE]</p><p id="p-0138" num="0131">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, if the CDM drive is executed in the row direction, one drive signal line TSpL is connected to the detection electrodes Rx of all the columns of each row via the switches SWp.

In this case, the drive signal lines TSpL and the guard signal line TSnL formed of the same wiring layer as the video signal lines cannot be formed on the video signal lines, and the drive signal lines TSpL and the guard signal line TSnL are formed while avoiding the video signal lines as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0146">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>B</figref>, the drive signal lines TSpL and the guard signal line TSnL are formed of the signal lines SL of the wiring layer WL<b>2</b>, and the video signal lines <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>are formed of the signal lines SL of the wiring layer WL<b>2</b> at most parts, but are partially formed of a two-layer structure.
