More particularly, in some embodiments, the disclosure relates to using one or more accessory devices or medical instruments with an endoscope and independent articulation of a distal end of each of the endoscope and the one or more accessory devices or medical instruments.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Medical tools for accessing target sites within a body may be advanced through one or more lumens of an endoscope, and may extend from a distal end thereof to manipulate the target site. Drawbacks of these endoscopic systems include, for example, limited accessibility and maneuverability of tools at protruding from the distal end of the endoscope. For example, in many endoscopes, medical tools extend from one or more openings in a distal end face of the endoscope, limiting the access and maneuverability of these medical tools in a direction perpendicular to the distal end face. This may create difficulties in cutting and removing tissue from the target sites, or performing other therapies. Furthermore, multiple users, such as a physician and one or more technicians, may be required to operate multiple tools and/or accessories of an endoscope device. This may increase the number of persons in a medical operation suite, which may increase the risk of accidents, infections, or other complications. The present disclosure may solve one or more of these problems or other problems in the art. The scope of the disclosure, however, is defined by the attached claims and not the ability to solve a specific problem.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p

In this manner, the plunger (or movable portion) of handles <b>150</b><i>a, </i><b>150</b><i>b </i>may move relative to the body of the handles <b>150</b><i>a, </i><b>150</b><i>b, </i>which may cause operation of the tool or end effector at the distal end of handles <b>150</b><i>a, </i><b>150</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Actuating device <b>30</b><i>a </i>may be actuated via actuator <b>40</b><i>a </i>(either via a wired (not shown) or a wireless connection), and actuating device <b>30</b><i>b </i>may be actuated via actuator <b>40</b><i>b </i>in a similar manner. Although actuators <b>40</b><i>a, </i><b>40</b><i>b </i>are shown as foot pedals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this disclosure is not so limited, as actuators <b>40</b><i>a, </i><b>40</b><i>b </i>may be buttons, levers, knobs, etc., for example, positioned on handle <b>110</b>, a separate user interface or display, robotic actuators, etc. Alternatively or additionally, actuators <b>40</b><i>a, </i><b>40</b><i>b </i>may be voice activated, activated via a motion or a specific blinking sequence of the user (e.g., a motion of a user being captured via a camera), or any other manner known in the art.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As an example, the user may depress actuator <b>40</b><i>a </i>with a foot, which may cause actuating device <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the plunger of handle <b>150</b><i>a </i>to move. This may cause jaws of a tool at the distal end of first medical instrument <b>150</b> to move from an open position to a close position. Removing the user's foot from actuator <b>40</b><i>a </i>may cause the jaws of the tool to open. As another example, the tool may include a laser fiber, whereby depressing actuator <b>40</b><i>a </i>may cause the laser energy to fire, and releasing actuator <b>40</b><i>a </i>may cause the laser energy to stop firing. In some examples, depressing actuator <b>40</b><i>a </i>may cause an electrode to extend into a tissue and/or energize the electrode. Actuator <b>40</b><i>b </i>may be operated in a similar manner as actuator <b>40</b><i>a </i>and may cause plunger of handle <b>152</b><i>a </i>to move to cause the tool at the distal end of second medical instrument <b>152</b> to be actuated. It will be understood that the tools may be any medical tool and handles <b>150</b><i>a, </i><b>152</b><i>a </i>are not limited to plunger-style handles. For example, handles <b>150</b><i>a, </i><b>150</b><i>b </i>may include knobs or other known actuating members or actuating tools or end effectors of first and second medical instruments <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A method of operating medical system <b>10</b> will now be described. Shaft <b>120</b> may be inserted into a body, e.g., a body of patient <b>1000</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, via a natural orifice, an incision, or any other opening in the body and advanced to a target site. A medical professional may visualize the target site using one or more light emitting elements <b>184</b> and/or visualization device <b>182</b> at the distal end of shaft <b>120</b>, for example, with visualization device <b>182</b> coupled to a user interface or display via an umbilicus. First medical instrument <b>150</b> may be introduced into lumen <b>166</b> of first tube <b>160</b> at a proximal end thereof via the opening in locking member <b>139</b><i>a </i>of port <b>136</b><i>a, </i>and medical instrument <b>152</b> may be introduced into lumen <b>168</b> of second tube <b>162</b> at a proximal end thereof via the opening in the locking member of corresponding control device <b>130</b><i>b. </i>First medical instrument <b>150</b> and second medical instrument <b>152</b> may be introduced into lumens <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, respectively, at any time during the medical procedure, e.g., before or after shaft <b>120</b> is inserted into the body of patient <b>1000</b>. Locking member <b>139</b><i>a </i>may be locked or unlocked by rotating locking member clockwise or counterclockwise. Locking member <b>139</b><i>a </i>may be locked or unlocked at any time during the procedure to allow first medical instrument <b>150</b> and second medical instrument <b>152</b> to be moved within lumens <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, respectively</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">After positioning the distal end of shaft <b>120</b> at the target site, the user may advance one or both of first tube <b>160</b> and second tube <b>162</b> in the distal direction such that a distal end of first tube <b>160</b> and/or a distal end of second tube <b>162</b> extend distally of the distalmost end of shaft <b>120</b>, as shown by arrow C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. As described herein, this distal movement of first tube <b>160</b> and second tube <b>162</b> relative to shaft <b>120</b> is caused by a user moving control devices <b>130</b><i>a, </i><b>130</b><i>b </i>in the distal direction, indicated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. For example, a user may use a thumb and a forefinger to grasp one or both of control devices <b>130</b><i>a, </i><b>130</b><i>b </i>and move control devices distally within slot <b>114</b>. In this manner, the user may move the distal ends of first tube <b>160</b> and/or second tube <b>162</b> distal of the distalmost end of shaft <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Once first tube <b>160</b> or second tube <b>162</b> extends distally of the distalmost end of shaft <b>120</b>, the user may use joystick <b>132</b><i>a </i>or joystick <b>132</b><i>b </i>to cause articulation of first tube <b>160</b> or second tube <b>162</b>, respectively. For example, a user may grasp joystick <b>132</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> using a thumb and a forefinger (or any other fingers if desired) and may move joystick <b>132</b><i>a </i>in any direction as indicated by arrows D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. For example, a first hand of the user may gasp handle <b>110</b>, while a second hand of the user may manipulate joystick <b>132</b><i>a </i>or joystick <b>132</b><i>b. </i>Alternatively, handle <b>110</b> may be fixed, e.g., by support device <b>40</b>, which may allow the user to use the first hand to manipulate joystick <b>130</b><i>a </i>and the second hand to manipulate joystick <b>130</b><i>b. </i>Movement of joystick <b>132</b><i>a </i>in any 360-degree direction may cause corresponding movement of the distal end of first tube <b>160</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C, <b>5</b>E, and <b>5</b>F</figref>. Movement of joystick <b>132</b><i>a </i>or joystick <b>132</b><i>b </i>may impart similar movement in the distal ends of first tube <b>160</b> or second tube <b>162</b>. For example, if joystick <b>132</b><i>a </i>is moved 30 degrees in one direction, the distal end of first tube <b>160</b> may be bent 30 degrees in a corresponding direction. It will be understood that the bend angle of the distal ends of first tube <b>160</b> and second tube <b>162</b> are not limited to a degree of movement of joystick <b>132</b><i>a </i>or joystick <b>132</b><i>b. </i>Prior to, during, or after articulation of joystick <b>132</b><i>a, </i>first medical instrument <b>150</b> may be advanced in the distal direction such that a distal end of sheath <b>170</b> and a corresponding tool extend distally of the distalmost end of first tube <b>160</b>. The user may continue to move joystick <b>132</b><i>a </i>and/or move sheath <b>170</b> within and relative to first tube <b>160</b> such that the tool at the distal end of sheath <b>170</b>, e.g., a grasper, is aligned with the target tissue. It will be understood that a user may visualize the target tissue on a monitor showing images transmitted via visualization device <b>182</b>, for example, on a user interface or display.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Once the tissue is properly positioned relative to the tools, the user may actuate actuator <b>40</b><i>a </i>by pressing down on actuator <b>40</b><i>a </i>with the user's foot. In the event the tool is a grasper, actuation of actuator <b>40</b><i>a </i>may cause a plunger in the handle of first medical instrument <b>150</b> to move in a first direction and cause the jaws of the grasper to close around the tissue. The user may lift the user's foot from actuator <b>40</b><i>a, </i>which may cause the plunger (or other movable element) in the handle of first medical instrument <b>150</b> to move in an opposite direction, which may open the jaws of the tool.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">It will be understood that similar articulation of the distal end of tube <b>162</b> may be performed using joystick <b>132</b><i>b. </i>In addition, the user may move sheath <b>172</b> of second medical instrument <b>152</b> within second tube <b>162</b> in a similar manner as described herein (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>). The user may depress or release actuator <b>40</b><i>b </i>to cause actuation of the handle of medical instrument <b>152</b>. This may cause a tool at the distal end of sheath <b>172</b> to operate (e.g., opening or closing a cutting tool, opening or closing another grasping element, deploying a device using the tool, or any similar operation).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Once the user completes work at the target site, the user may remove shaft <b>120</b> from the body. In some instances, one or both of first tube <b>160</b> and second tube <b>162</b> and/or one or both of first medical instrument <b>150</b> and second medical instrument <b>152</b> may extend distally of the distalmost end of shaft <b>120</b>. In one instance, first medical instrument <b>150</b> may include a grasping element to grasp tissue, and second medical instrument <b>152</b> may include a cutting element to cut or dissect the tissue from the body. For example, it may be desired to remove a portion of the tissue from the target site. In this instance, one or more of the tools may grasp the tissue distally of the distalmost end of shaft <b>120</b> and this tissue may be removed from the body by removing shaft <b>120</b> from the body. It will be understood that the user may also bend or articulate shaft <b>120</b> using knobs <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, which in turn would cause first tube <b>160</b> and second tube <b>162</b>, and any tool extending therein, to be bent in the same direction as shaft <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">While different medical systems have been described, it will be understood that the particular arrangements of elements in these medical systems are not limited. Moreover, a size and a shape of the catheter or shaft of the medical system, or the medical instruments used with the medical system, and/or the method of deploying the system, are not limited. As described in examples herein, tubes within lumens of an endoscope sheath may be extended distally of a distalmost end of the endoscope sheath and may be independently bent or articulated to provide independent articulation for a medical instrument extending within a lumen of the tube improved visualization and/or access to a target site. For example, in certain procedures, accessing the target site from multiple different directions may improve the results of the medical procedure, may decrease the time of the medical procedure, and may improve recovery times of the patient after the medical procedure. In addition, individual first and second tubes <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> may impart high steering force, high lifting force, shorter articulation radius, and high dissection force. Moreover, providing controls, e.g., control devices <b>130</b><i>a, </i><b>130</b><i>b, </i>on handle <b>110</b> may allow a single user to operate medical system <b>10</b>. For example, the user may use one handle to hold handle <b>110</b>, and may use the other hand (together with one or both feet) to provide independent and/or simultaneous articulation, translation, and/or actuation of medical tools. It will be understood that more than one operator may use medical system <b>10</b>, e.g., an assistant, to assist in guiding, positioning, and/or operating medical system <b>10</b> within the body.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed device without departing from the scope of the disclosure. For example, the maximum bend angle, the location of the bend in a longitudinal direction of the tube, and the number of tubes extending and moving within the endoscope sheath be modified based on a desired medical therapy. Other embodiments of the disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein.
