relates to drug delivery devices and, more particularly, to drug delivery devices having a lockout mechanism for resisting drug delivery until the devices reaches a desired temperature.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Drug delivery devices, such as injectors, are used to deliver liquid drugs to a patient. Upon activation, a drug delivery device may expel a drug stored within an internal reservoir of a primary container through a needle, cannula, or other delivery member into the patient. Some drug delivery devices may be temporarily attached to a patient to deliver a drug via an injection needle or some other means over an extended period of time. The drug delivery device may be adhesively attached to the tissue of the patient's abdomen, thigh, arm, or some other portion of the patient's body. Some drug delivery devices may be held against or onto a patient to deliver a drug via an injection needle or some other means over a relatively short period of time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many medicaments require refrigeration to maintain stability and performance. Accordingly, it is common for these medicaments to be labeled for cold storage during manufacturing, transportation, and storage processes prior to patient and/or clinician use. These medicaments are often stored at temperatures ranging from approximately 2&#xb0; C. and approximately 8&#xb0; C., such as via standard household refrigerators. Cold storage medicaments are often preferably sufficiently warmed prior to administration, such as to reduce or minimize pain and/or to ensure the delivery device functions properly and as intended. Patients may be hesitant to administer these drugs due to warming techniques which may result in risking administering a cold injection or require extended delivery times if the patient fails to wait an appropriate length of time after removing the device from refrigeration. These contributing factors which may extend the time of the perceived injection experience or add discomfort to the user may risk reducing adherence to therapy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patients desire both a comfortable and predictable injection experience. Administering injections using devices at substantially similar temperatures often yields substantially similar experiences. Differences of medicament temperatures at the time of administration of approximately 5&#xb0; C. or more are likely to cause discernible differences to the patient, particularly in medicaments having highly temperature-dependent viscosities, which may lead to hesitation and uncertainty in administering subsequent doses. This in turn may lead to reduced adherence levels.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described in more detail below, the present disclosure sets forth systems for delivery devices embodying advantageous alternatives to existing systems and methods, and that may address one or more of the challenges or needs mentioned herein, as well as provide other benefits and advantages.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an aspect, a drug delivery device is provided, including: a housing; a container at least partially disposed within the housing, the container configured to contain a medicament; an injection mechanism at least partially disposed within the housing, the injection mechanism configured to exert a force to urge the medicament from the container; a drug delivery component at least partially disposed within the housing; a protective cap selectively coupled with the housing adjacent to the drug delivery component; and a plurality of lock pins positioned adjacent to the housing and the protective cap and preventing relative movement therebetween until the plurality of lock pins reach a desired temperature.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The device may include at least three lock pins annularly spaced about an inner surface of the protective cap. Alternatively, the device may include at least four lock pins annularly spaced about an inner surface of the protective cap.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The housing may include a needle shield at least selectively surrounding the drug delivery component, wherein the plurality of lock pins are each connected to an outer surface of the needle shield.

Injectable drugs are typically stored in cooling devices such as refrigerators at temperatures ranging between approximately 2&#xb0; C. to approximately 8&#xb0; C. Patients are recommended to wait until the drug has increased in temperature before administering the drug to aid in administration comfort. The drug delivery devices, and more specifically, the lockout mechanisms, described herein prevent and/or resist use of the drug delivery devices until the drug has reached a suitable temperature for injection.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to the Figures, a general drug delivery device <b>100</b> is provided in the form of an autoinjector having a vertically oriented configuration with some or all drug delivery components disposed in stacked relation along a longitudinal axis L within a housing <b>102</b> thereof. As a more specific example, the device <b>100</b> can be configured to operate and inject a user with the device <b>100</b> oriented generally perpendicular to a skin surface of the user. The drug delivery device <b>100</b> can include the aforementioned housing <b>102</b> that defines a shell and includes an inner volume <b>102</b><i>a </i>and at least one opening <b>104</b>, a container <b>110</b> containing a medicament <b>101</b>, an injection mechanism <b>120</b> for urging the medicament <b>101</b> from the container <b>110</b>, a drug delivery component <b>132</b> for delivering the medicament to a patient, a protective cap <b>136</b> selectively coupled with the housing <b>102</b>, a user input mechanism such as an activation button <b>124</b> that is depressed by a patient to activate the injection mechanism <b>120</b>, and a lockout mechanism configured to prevent and/or resist drug delivery until the lockout mechanism reaches a desired temperature. As a more specific example, the lockout mechanism may be a plurality of lock pins <b>140</b> positioned adjacent to the housing <b>102</b> and the protective cap <b>136</b> to prevent relative movement therebetween until the lock pins <b>140</b> have reached a desired temperature. As a more specific example, the housing <b>102</b> may include a needle shield <b>142</b> that is slidably engaged with the main portion of the housing such that the needle shield <b>142</b> at least partially surrounds the drug delivery component <b>132</b> when it is in a storage position (e.g., non-extended or non-injection position). As another example, the lockout mechanism may be a lock pin <b>125</b> positioned adjacent to the housing <b>102</b> and the activation button <b>124</b> that prevents relative movement therebetween.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The device <b>100</b> may also include a needle insertion mechanism <b>130</b> for inserting the needle <b>132</b> into the user during or just prior to delivery of the medicament. The device <b>100</b> may also include a temperature indicator <b>150</b> that includes a visual indicator informing a user or health care provider that the device <b>100</b> has reached a desired temperature.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, including the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the drug delivery device <b>100</b> may be configured as an autoinjector or a pen injector. In other embodiments, the drug delivery device <b>100</b> may be in the form of a hybrid handheld device, a wearable drug delivery device such as an on-body injector or an ambulatory infusion pump that may be releasably coupled with a patient, or any other type of handheld devices including hybrids thereof. The drug delivery device <b>100</b> may be operated to subcutaneously or transdermally deliver a drug to a patient. The drug delivery device <b>100</b> may be configured to automatically deliver a fixed or a patient/operator-settable dose of a drug over a fixed and/or a patient/operator-settable period of time. The drug delivery device <b>100</b> may be intended for self-administration by the patient, and in some examples, may be used by a caregiver or a formally trained healthcare provider to administer an injection.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The container <b>110</b> includes an outer surface <b>110</b><i>a </i>and an interior volume <b>112</b>. The container <b>110</b> (which, in some examples, may be referred to as a primary container) further accommodates a piston <b>114</b> within the interior volume <b>112</b> thereof. The piston <b>114</b> is moveably disposed within the container <b>110</b> along the longitudinal axis &#x201c;L&#x201d; and has a first end <b>114</b><i>a </i>that includes an interior surface <b>115</b>. The interior surface of the container <b>110</b> and the interior surface <b>115</b> of the piston <b>114</b> define a reservoir to contain a drug or medicament <b>101</b>. Generally, the at least one opening <b>104</b> is aligned with the container <b>110</b> to allow a user to see at least a portion of the outer surface <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the container <b>110</b> for the purposes of completing a visual inspection and/or to determine a quantity of remaining drug and/or medicament <b>101</b> prior to, during, and after drug administration.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The volume of the drug <b>101</b> contained in the reservoir prior to delivery may be: any volume in a range between approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 0.05-20 mL, or any volume in a range between approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 0.5-10 mL, or any volume in a range between approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 1-10 mL, or any volume in a range between approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 1-8 mL, or any volume in a range between approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 1-5 mL, or any volume in a range between approximately (e.g., +10%) 1-3.5 mL, or any volume in a range between approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 1-3 mL, or any volume in a range between approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 1-2.5 mL, or any volume in a range between approximately (e.g., +10%) 1-2 mL, or any volume equal to or less than approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 4 mL, or any volume equal to or less than approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 3.5 mL, or any volume equal to or less than approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 3 mL, or any volume equal to or less than approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 2.5 mL, or any volume equal to or less than approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 2 mL, or any volume equal to or less than approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 1.5 mL, or any volume equal to or less than approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 1 mL, or any volume equal to or greater than approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 2 mL, or any volume equal to or greater than approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 2.5 mL, or any volume equal to or greater than approximately (e.g., &#xb1;10%) 3 mL. The reservoir may be completely or partially filled with the drug or medicament <b>101</b>. The drug or medicament <b>101</b> may be one or more of the drugs listed below under the heading &#x201c;Drug Information&#x201d;, such as, for example, a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9) specific antibody, a sclerostin antibody, or a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The injection mechanism <b>120</b> is coupled to a piston rod <b>122</b> to drive the piston <b>114</b> through the container <b>110</b>. The injection mechanism <b>120</b> may be in the form of any number of suitable components capable of exerting a force to urge the drug or medicament <b>101</b> out of the container <b>110</b>. In some examples, the injection mechanism <b>120</b> may include a user input device <b>124</b> such as, for example, the button <b>124</b>, that may be engageable by a user to initiate drug delivery.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The needle insertion mechanism <b>130</b> is operably coupled with the injection mechanism <b>120</b> to insert a needle and/or a cannula <b>132</b> to deliver the drug or medicament <b>101</b>. More specifically, the needle insertion mechanism <b>130</b> includes the needle and/or cannula <b>132</b> oriented along the longitudinal axis L, a flow path <b>134</b> fluidly coupling the reservoir to the needle and/or cannula <b>132</b>, a protective cap <b>136</b> configured to selectively and at least partially surround the needle and/or cannula <b>132</b> to reduce the likelihood and/or prevent unintentional needle sticks and to reduce and/or prevent contamination of the needle and/or cannula <b>132</b>. For example, the protective cap <b>136</b> may include an annular portion <b>136</b><i>a </i>that substantially or completely surrounds the sides of the needle and/or cannula <b>132</b>. The protective cap <b>136</b> may also include an end face <b>136</b><i>b </i>that cooperates with the annular portion <b>136</b><i>a </i>to substantially or completely enclose the portion of the needle and/or cannula <b>132</b> that extends past the housing <b>102</b> when the needle and/or cannula <b>132</b> is in a storage position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). As a more specific example, protective cap <b>136</b> may be selectively coupled with the needle shield <b>142</b> when the device <b>100</b> is in the storage configuration (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). As an even more specific example, the protective cap <b>136</b> may surround the outer surface of the needle shield <b>142</b> such as to form a closed or substantially closed environment within the needle shield <b>142</b>. In such a configuration, the protective cap <b>136</b> annular portion <b>136</b><i>a </i>may have an inner diameter that is at least slightly larger than the outer diameter of the needle shield <b>142</b> to facilitate removal of the protective cap <b>136</b> when desired (e.g., prior to injection). Additionally or alternatively, the protective cap <b>136</b> may be received within the inner surface of the needle shield <b>142</b> such as to form a closed or substantially closed environment within the needle shield <b>142</b>. In such a configuration, the protective cap <b>136</b> may have an annular portion <b>136</b><i>a </i>that has an outer diameter that is at least slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the needle shield <b>142</b> and/or an end face <b>136</b><i>b </i>that has a larger diameter than both the annular portion <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the needle shield <b>142</b> such that the protective cap end face <b>136</b><i>b </i>extends radially outwardly to further seal the environment within the needle shield <b>142</b> and/or to improve user grip when removing the protective cap <b>136</b>. As a more specific example, the protective cap is removed by pulling or otherwise urging it in direction <b>135</b> (a.k.a. the distal direction) so that the needle shield <b>142</b> is no longer covered.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The needle shield <b>142</b> may be configured to activate and/or permit the device to activate. For example, the needle shield <b>142</b> may have extension arms (not shown) or other suitable components to act on and/or actuate the injection mechanism <b>120</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the needle shield <b>142</b> may act on and/or actuate a component that permits the device to be activated but does not actually do so; for example the movement of the needle shield <b>142</b> in the proximal direction (e.g., in the opposite direction of direction <b>135</b>) may unlock a component thereby allowing depression of the button <b>124</b>, which in turn actuates the injection mechanism <b>120</b>. In some examples, the injection mechanism <b>120</b> may be configured to drive both movement of the piston <b>114</b> and the needle and/or cannula <b>132</b> by moving any combination of the container <b>110</b>, the flow path <b>134</b>, and/or the needle and/or cannula <b>132</b>. As commonly configured, one or more of the components of the device <b>100</b>, such as the drive mechanism <b>108</b> and needle insertion mechanism <b>116</b>, can be operable in response to actuation of a user input device <b>124</b> which is accessible on an exterior of the housing <b>102</b>. Suitable activation mechanisms <b>120</b> include, but are not limited to, springs, gas sources, phase changing materials, motors, or other electromechanical systems. As previously noted, the controller <b>126</b> may control operation of one or more of the drug delivery components.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The protective cap <b>136</b> may be configured to prevent or resist movement of the needle shield <b>142</b> while the protective cap <b>136</b> is in place. For example, the distal end <b>136</b><i>c </i>of the protective cap <b>136</b> may abut against a portion of the housing <b>102</b> or another component of the device <b>100</b> thereby preventing movement of the needle shield <b>142</b> in the proximal direction.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As indicated above, the device <b>100</b> includes at least one lockout mechanism configured to prevent and/or resist drug delivery until the lockout mechanism reaches a desired temperature. One exemplary lockout mechanism is the plurality of lock pins <b>140</b> positioned adjacent to the housing <b>102</b> and the protective cap <b>136</b> to prevent relative movement therebetween until the lock pins <b>140</b> have reached a desired temperature. As a more specific example, the lock pins <b>140</b> are made of a shape memory alloy (commonly known as nitinol) or other suitable materials that, once shape set during manufacture, return to their original shape only when warmed.

As a more specific example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b></figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, the lock pins <b>140</b> are coupled with at least one of the protective cap <b>136</b> and the needle shield <b>142</b> to prevent relative movement therebetween.

For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, the lock pins <b>140</b> each have a thickness <b>150</b> when they are at a temperature that is below the desired temperature; at this thickness <b>150</b> the lock pins <b>140</b> engage the slots <b>138</b> of the protective cap <b>136</b> and prevent and/or resist relative movement between the needle shield <b>142</b> and the protective cap <b>136</b>. As a more specific example, at this thickness <b>150</b> the lock pins <b>140</b> may permit some relative movement but still prevent and/or resist removal of the protective cap <b>136</b> from the needle shield <b>142</b> and/or other components of the housing.

When the device <b>100</b> is removed from cold storage and warms to the designed alloy transition temperature, the lock pins <b>140</b> get smaller in thickness until they are small enough to clear the slots <b>138</b>. With the lock pins <b>140</b> out of the way, the user can remove the protective cap <b>136</b> along the direction <b>135</b>. With this configuration, a user and/or health care provider may be prevented or discouraged from removing the protective cap <b>136</b> until the device <b>100</b> has reached a temperature suitable for injection, thereby potentially preventing and/or reducing instances of too-cold injection (which may cause discomfort and/or undesirable drug efficacy issues) and potentially reducing the time that the needle is exposed to outside conditions (potentially leading to breach of cleanliness/sterility).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">As discussed above, the device <b>100</b> may also include an indicator <b>150</b> to alert the user when the device <b>100</b> has reached a suitable and/or desirable temperature for injection. For example, the temperature indicator <b>150</b> may be in the form of a liquid crystal and/or a leuco dye member that is thermally coupled with the outer surface <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the container <b>110</b>. In some examples, the temperature indicator <b>150</b> may be in the form of a disc member that is affixed and/or adhered directly to the outer surface <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the container <b>110</b>. In other examples, the temperature indicator <b>150</b> may be in the form of a label, strip, or painted component affixed to the container <b>110</b>. The temperature indicator <b>150</b> may be constructed from a material having high thermal conductivity and elastomeric properties so that close physical contact with the container <b>110</b> provides for high thermal responsiveness.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">In some examples, the temperature indicator <b>150</b> may be responsive to a designated temperature range such as, for example, between an administration temperature of approximately 15&#xb0; C. and approximately 35&#xb0; C., and preferably between approximately 22&#xb0; C. and approximately 28&#xb0; C. Other examples of suitable temperature ranges are possible. In some examples, the temperature indicator <b>150</b> may be a first color and/or pattern (e.g., generally clear) when exposed to a low temperature, and may shift to a second color and/or pattern (e.g., green) when being exposed to a higher temperature suitable for drug administration. In some examples, the temperature indicator <b>150</b> may change colors in a reversed manner. The temperature indicator <b>150</b> may be coupled with and positioned on the outer surface <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the container. The temperature indicator <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is positioned with the opening <b>104</b> so that a user may look through the opening <b>104</b> to discern the color of the temperature indicator <b>150</b> (as well as to observe whether the drug or medicament <b>101</b> includes any particulates, discoloration, and/or abnormalities), and thus whether the drug or medicament <b>101</b> is at a suitable administration temperature. Such a configuration advantageously provides close proximity with the drug or medicament <b>101</b>. More specifically, because the temperature indicator <b>150</b> is thermally coupled with the container <b>110</b>, when the container <b>110</b> increases in temperature due to being removed from the refrigeration unit, the temperature indicator <b>150</b> will reflect the increase in temperature by changing colors.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">The device <b>100</b> may have any suitable number of lock pins <b>140</b>, such as one, two, three, four, or more than four. In the instance where the device includes more than one lock pins <b>140</b>, they may be evenly spaced apart from each other along the circumference of the needle shield <b>142</b> and/or the protective cap <b>136</b>. For example, if the device includes four lock pins <b>140</b>, they may be spaced apart from each other by approximately 90 degrees. The lock pins <b>140</b> may have any suitable shape, such as a round button shaped component as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Additionally, the device may include a lock ring (not shown) instead of or in addition to the lock pins <b>140</b> that expands or constricts based on temperature. The ring may be coupled with at least one of the needle shield <b>142</b> and/or the protective cap <b>136</b>. The lock pins <b>140</b> and/or the lock ring may be coupled to the needle shield <b>142</b> (and/or the protective cap <b>136</b>) by any suitable configuration, such as an adhesive, by heat-melting the lock pins <b>140</b> or lock ring into the needle shield <b>142</b>, and/or by inserting the lock pins <b>140</b> or lock ring into a corresponding-shaped indentation in the needle shield <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">The device <b>100</b> may also include a label or a tag, such as a tag connected to the protective cap <b>136</b> that indicates to the user that the protective cap <b>136</b> will remain locked until the device <b>100</b> has reached the desirable temperature. For example, the tag may read, &#x201c;CAP WILL REMAIN LOCKED DURING COLD STORAGE&#x201d; or &#x201c;CAP WILL REMAIN LOCKED UNTIL REACHING SUITABLE INJECTION TEMPERATURE.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">As discussed above, the device <b>100</b> may additionally or alternatively include a lock out mechanism associated with the button <b>124</b>, such as the internal activation mechanism within the device or an external surface of the button <b>124</b>. For example, the shape memory alloy pins <b>126</b> may be installed into the device <b>100</b> where components must move relative to one another to activate the injection sequence. When the device <b>100</b> is cold, the pins <b>126</b> are too long to allow the mechanism to move and start the injection sequence.
