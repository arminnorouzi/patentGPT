Device, and Related Methods&#x201d;, filed Jul. 2, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, catheters may be used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and total parenteral nutrition, into a patient. Catheters may also be used for withdrawing blood from the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common type of catheter device includes a catheter that is over-the-needle. As its name implies, the catheter that is over-the-needle may be mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. A catheter assembly may include a catheter hub, the catheter extending distally from the catheter hub, and the introducer needle extending through the catheter. The catheter and the introducer needle may be assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing up away from skin of the patient. The catheter and introducer needle are generally inserted at a shallow angle through the skin into vasculature of the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to verify proper placement of the introducer needle and/or the catheter in the blood vessel, a clinician generally confirms that there is &#x201c;flashback&#x201d; of blood in a flashback chamber of the catheter assembly. Once placement of the needle has been confirmed, the clinician may temporarily occlude flow in the vasculature and remove the needle, leaving the catheter in place for future blood withdrawal or fluid infusion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Infusion and blood withdrawal using the catheter may be difficult for several reasons, particularly when an indwelling time of the catheter increases. A fibrin sheath or thrombus may form on an internal surface of the catheter assembly, an external surface of the catheter assembly, or within the vasculature near the distal tip of the catheter. The fibrin sheath or thrombus may block or narrow a fluid pathway through the catheter, which may impair infusion and/or collection of a high-quality blood sample.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one example technology area where some implementations described herein may be practiced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates generally to vascular access devices and related systems and methods. More particularly, in some embodiments, the present disclosure relates to an adapter of a catheter assembly, an instrument delivery device, and related methods. In some embodiments, a catheter assembly may include the adapter, which may include a distal end, a proximal end aligned with the distal end of the adapter, a side port disposed between the distal end of the adapter and the proximal end of the adapter, and an adapter lumen. In some embodiments, the adapter lumen may extend through the distal end of the adapter, proximal end of the adapter, and the side port.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the catheter assembly may include a catheter hub, which may include a distal end, a proximal end, a catheter hub lumen extending through the distal end of the catheter hub and the proximal end of the catheter hub, and another side port disposed in fluid communication with the catheter hub lumen.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the catheter assembly may include an extension tube, which may include a distal end and a proximal end. In some embodiments, the distal end of the extension tube may be coupled to the other side port. In some embodiments, the distal end of the adapter may be coupled to the proximal end of the extension tube. In some embodiments, a portion of the adapter lumen between the distal end of the adapter and the side port may include an annular protrusion configured to form a fluidic seal around a tube of an instrument advancement device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the adapter may include a T-connector or a Y-connector. In some embodiments, the catheter assembly may include another extension tube. In some embodiments, the side port is coupled to the other extension tube. In some embodiments, the portion of the adapter lumen between the distal end of the adapter and the side port may include a cylindrical uniform diameter portion proximate the proximal end of the extension tube and proximate an outward taper. In some embodiments, the annular protrusion may be proximal to the outward taper.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the annular protrusion may be proximate the proximal end of the extension tube. In some embodiments, an edge of the protrusion proximate the proximal end of the extension tube may be disposed an equal or greater distance from a longitudinal axis of the adapter than an inner surface of the extension tube proximate the annular protrusion.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the catheter assembly may include an annular elastomeric seal disposed within the adapter lumen between the proximal end of the extension tube and the side port. In some embodiments, the annular elastomeric seal may be configured to form a fluidic seal around a tube of an instrument advancement device. In some embodiments, an inner surface of the adapter forming the adapter lumen may include an annular groove, and the annular elastomeric seal is seated within the annular groove. In some embodiments, the annular elastomeric seal may include an O-ring. In some embodiments, the portion of the adapter lumen between the distal end of the adapter and the side port may include the cylindrical uniform diameter portion proximate the outward taper, and the annular elastomeric seal may be proximal to the outward taper.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, an inner surface of the extension tube may include an annular protrusion configured to form a fluidic seal around a tube of an instrument advancement device. In some embodiments, the inner surface of the extension tube may include one or more other annular protrusions.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the instrument delivery device may include a housing, which may include a proximal end, a distal end, a lumen disposed between the proximal end and a distal end, and a slot disposed between the proximal end and the distal end. In some embodiments, the instrument delivery device may include an advancement element extending through the slot and configured to move linearly along the slot between a retracted position and an advanced position.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the instrument delivery device may include an instrument such as a tube, which may include a first end and a second end. In some embodiments, when the advancement element is moved linearly along the slot from the retracted position to the advanced position, the second end of the instrument may be advanced beyond the distal end of the housing. In some embodiments, the distal end of the tube may include an annular protrusion or an outward flare. In some embodiments, the annular protrusion of the tube or the outward flare may be configured to form a fluidic seal within the adapter of the catheter assembly. In some embodiments, the tube may include an increased diameter portion configured to form a fluidic seal within an adapter of a catheter assembly.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, a method of blood collection may include advancing the tube distally within the adapter of the catheter assembly. In some embodiments, the adapter may include the side port. In some embodiments, in response to advancing the tube distally within the adapter of the catheter assembly, a fluidic seal may be formed around the tube distal to the side port within the adapter. In some embodiments, a distal end of the adapter may include an opening, and the fluidic seal may be formed proximal to the opening. In some embodiments, the tube may include the annular protrusion, and in response to advancing the tube distally within the adapter of the catheter assembly, the fluidic seal may be formed at the annular protrusion of the tube.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the adapter may include the distal end, the proximal end aligned with the distal end of the adapter, the side port disposed between the distal end of the adapter and the proximal end of the adapter, and the adapter lumen. In some embodiments, the adapter lumen may extend through the distal end of the adapter, the proximal end of the adapter, and the side port. In some embodiments, the portion of the adapter lumen between the distal end of the adapter and the side port may include the annular protrusion, which may be configured to form the fluidic seal in response to advancing the tube distally within the adapter of the catheter assembly.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, an elastomeric O-ring is disposed within adapter lumen between the proximal end of the extension tube and the side port, and the elastomeric O-ring may form the fluidic seal around the tube of the instrument delivery device in response to advancing the tube distally within the adapter of the catheter assembly. In some embodiments, the annular protrusion of the extension tube may form the fluidic seal around the tube of the instrument delivery device in response to advancing the tube distally within the adapter of the catheter assembly.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are examples and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. It should be understood that the various embodiments are not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality illustrated in the drawings.
