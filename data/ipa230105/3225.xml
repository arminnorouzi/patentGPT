When this type of pump is primed with water before being operated, part of air in the pump remains and air is accumulated around the mechanical seal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When the pump is operated with air accumulated, failure might occur in the mechanical seal. Specifically, air has a density smaller than that of water, and therefore receives a smaller centrifugal force from rotation of the impeller. As a result, water is pushed outward from the casing, and air gathers near the rotary shaft. Since the mechanical seal is provided near the rotary shaft, the mechanical seal is in dry operation during the operation of the pump, generates heat due to insufficient lubrication, and might burn at the worst case.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To eliminate such accumulation of air, a pump configured to pour water into the accumulation of air by eliminating a pressure difference between an interior of the impeller and the accumulation of air is known (e.g., PTL 1). Specifically, in this pump, a small hole is provided in a main plate of the impeller to eliminate the pressure difference between the interior of the impeller and the accumulation of air.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, a pump including a housing in which a flow path communicating between a discharge port of the pump and a mechanical seal is formed is also known (e.g., PTL 2).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">PTL 1: Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 60-178391</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0007">PTL 2: Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 62-111994</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0008">In a pump disclosed in PTL 1, liquid returns from a mechanical seal side through a hole in a main plate back into an impeller, and hence a pump efficiency might decrease. In a pump disclosed in PTL 2, if there is a foreign object inside the pump, a flow path might be blocked with the foreign object. Furthermore, liquid flows backward from a discharge port of the pump to a mechanical seal side, the pump efficiency might decrease in the same manner as in PTL 1.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">One of objects of the present invention, which has been made in view of the above problems, is to eliminate accumulation of air while preventing a decrease in pump efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0010">According to one aspect of the present invention, a pump is provided.

Further, the lower casing <b>37</b> includes a suction port <b>37</b><i>a </i>through which liquid is introduced into the lower casing <b>37</b> and a discharge port <b>37</b><i>b </i>through which the liquid introduced into the lower casing <b>37</b> is discharged.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0045">In the pump <b>10</b> having the shown configuration, the rotary shaft <b>31</b> is rotated by torque given from the motor <b>20</b>, and the impeller <b>33</b> rotates with the rotary shaft <b>31</b>. The liquid is introduced into the pump <b>10</b> through the suction port <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the lower casing <b>37</b>, boosted by the rotating impeller <b>33</b>, and then discharged through the discharge port <b>37</b><i>b </i>to outside of the pump <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0046">As described above, when the pump <b>10</b> is primed with water before being operated, an interior of the casing <b>35</b> of the pump <b>10</b> cannot be filled with water, and air is accumulated inside the mechanical chamber <b>36</b><i>b</i>, that is, around the mechanical seal <b>38</b>. When the pump <b>10</b> is operated in this state, water present on a back side of the main plate <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the impeller <b>33</b> moves in the circumferential direction with the rotation of the impeller <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0047">Pumps of recent years may have a rotation speed controlled by an inverter. When the impeller <b>33</b> rotates at a relatively high rotation speed (e.g., 3000 rpm), the water on the back side of the main plate <b>33</b><i>a </i>also moves in the circumferential direction at a relatively high speed. Therefore, with this movement of water, air in the mechanical chamber <b>36</b><i>b </i>also moves in the circumferential direction, and the air in the mechanical chamber <b>36</b><i>b </i>may be discharged with water. However, when the pump <b>10</b> is operated at a relatively low rotation speed (e.g., 450 rpm), the water on the back side of the main plate <b>33</b><i>a </i>does not move in the circumferential direction for discharging air in the mechanical chamber <b>36</b><i>b</i>, and the air in the mechanical chamber <b>36</b><i>b </i>cannot be discharged.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0048">Therefore, the pump <b>10</b> of the present embodiment includes a rotary baffle plate <b>50</b> located between the impeller <b>33</b> and the mechanical seal <b>38</b> and attached to a rotating body of the pump <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a plan view of the rotary baffle plate <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the rotary baffle plate <b>50</b> in cross section <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.

More specifically, the baffle plate part <b>51</b> is provided on the main body part <b>52</b> to extend from the main body part <b>52</b> toward the mechanical seal <b>38</b> side.

However, this shape is not limited, and any shape such as a cylindrical shape can be adopted if the baffle plate part <b>51</b> can be attached. The rotary baffle plate <b>50</b> can be manufactured by perpendicularly bending a part of a single metal plate of, for example, SUS or the like. Alternatively, the rotary baffle plate <b>50</b> may be manufactured by welding the baffle plate part <b>51</b> to the main body part <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the baffle plate part <b>51</b> extends in a direction that is inclined or orthogonal with respect to a surface orthogonal to an axial direction of the rotary shaft <b>31</b>. In other words, the baffle plate part <b>51</b> extends from the main body part <b>52</b> to have an angle with respect to the plate-shaped main body part <b>52</b>. Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the baffle plate part <b>51</b> extends in the direction orthogonal to the surface orthogonal to the axial direction of the rotary shaft <b>31</b>, that is, in parallel with the axial direction of the rotary shaft <b>31</b>.

The baffle plate part <b>51</b> can have a length, width, shape, and the like arbitrarily adjusted depending on a shape of the mechanical chamber <b>36</b><i>b</i>. In principle, the larger an area of the baffle plate part <b>51</b> is, the more an effect of discharging air from the mechanical chamber <b>36</b><i>b </i>can improve. In the present description, &#x201c;the main surface of the baffle plate part <b>51</b>&#x201d; refers to a surface that receives the most resistance from water when the baffle plate part <b>51</b> rotates with the rotary shaft <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the main body part <b>52</b> has an opening <b>52</b><i>a </i>through which the small diameter portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the rotary shaft <b>31</b> passes. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the main body part <b>52</b> is sandwiched between the large diameter portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the rotary shaft <b>31</b> and the impeller <b>33</b>. Thus, the main body part <b>52</b> frictionally engages with the large diameter portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>and the impeller <b>33</b>, and the rotary baffle plate <b>50</b> can rotate with the rotation of the rotary shaft <b>31</b>. In this case, the main body part <b>52</b> can be attached to the rotary shaft <b>31</b> without requiring any special parts, structures or the like.
