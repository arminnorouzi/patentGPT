The scope of the disclosure is to be defined by the claims appended hereto, any future claims submitted here and in different applications, and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A first example of an embodiment of an exercise assembly <b>10</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b></figref>, through <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As depicted, assembly <b>10</b> may have a central body <b>100</b>, which may be a hollow body formed by an enclosing sidewall. As depicted, the body <b>100</b> may have a generally ovoid shape, with a long axis extending from a first side to a second side. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, the particular shape of the central body <b>100</b> may vary.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The interior of central body <b>100</b> may be a cavity defining a reservoir <b>103</b> between the sidewalls (as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>). As depicted, the reservoir may be an open space. In certain embodiments, one or more structures, such as a baffle or a flow guide may be disposed in the reservoir for directing fluid flow during use.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">An opening <b>102</b> may be disposed on the body and passing through the sidewall to allow access to the interior space. The opening may have a surrounding neck, which may be threaded to allow a counterpart cap <b>104</b> to be secured thereon to close the opening. This allows a user to add or remove liquid from the reservoir for use. In certain embodiments, the cap and opening may allow the amount of liquid to be adjusted in the reservoir to be adjusted and for the assembly <b>10</b> to serve as a water bottle for user.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Handle assemblies <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B may be disposed on opposite ends of assembly <b>10</b>, extending from body <b>100</b>. As depicted, the handle assemblies may be formed as symmetrical counterparts. In the depicted embodiment, each handle assembly many include an upper handle support member <b>202</b> and a lower support member that extend from the central body <b>100</b> to define a grip space therebetween. In the depicted embodiment, the handle support members <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> each extend out and away from the body <b>100</b> apart from one another to a bend, then extend parallel to one another to their distal ends.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Near the distal ends of the upper support member <b>202</b> and lower support member <b>204</b>, a rotatable grip member <b>210</b> may be disposed. In some embodiments, each handle assembly <b>200</b>A or <b>200</b>B may allow a grip member <b>210</b> to freely rotate on a central axle <b>212</b>, that may be mounted between mounting points on the handle support members using a suitable fastener <b>211</b>. It will be appreciated that other arrangements that provide for pivotally mounted grip members may be used and are within the scope of the present disclosure. While the depicted embodiment features to grip members <b>210</b> that freely rotate, in other embodiments, the grip members may be structured to have a limited rotation to a stop point in order to facilitate certain exercises by a user, as by indicating when a movement should cease.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts one set of illustrative axle <b>211</b> and grip member <b>210</b> components, as well as a unitary body for assembly <b>10</b> that includes both central body <b>100</b> and handle support members. It will be appreciated that these are merely illustrative and that embodiments where assembly is formed form multiple induvial components that are joined by suitable fasteners and/or adhesives may be used.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one exemplary exercise, the central body <b>100</b> opened with cap <b>104</b> and a desired amount of liquid dispensed into the reservoir, which is then closed. A user may hold an assembly <b>10</b> assembly by the grip member <b>211</b> on the opposite grips <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B and walk while swinging the arms and rotating the torso back and forth. As the user maintains a grip on the grip members, the rotatable grips allow for movement of the central body as they rotate. As the assembly <b>10</b> is moved, the liquid in the reservoir flows in response to the movement of the assembly. As the assembly is moved to one side, the inertia of the liquid causes it to be forced against that side, and then towards the opposite side as the opposite motion occurs. The movement of the liquid and contact against the sides of the reservoir provide additional force compared to movement of static weight.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another exemplary exercise, the central body <b>100</b> opened with cap <b>104</b> and a desired amount of liquid dispensed into the reservoir, which is then closed. A user may hold an assembly <b>10</b> assembly by the grip member <b>211</b> on the opposite grips <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B and run or jog while swinging the arms and rotating the torso back and forth. As the user maintains a grip on the grip members, the rotatable grips allow for movement of the central body as they rotate. As the assembly <b>10</b> is moved, the liquid in the reservoir flows in response to the movement of the assembly, and the up and down motion provided by the running movement of the body. As the assembly is moved towards one direction by the user, the inertia of the liquid causes it to be forced towards a corresponding point of the reservoir wall, and then towards an opposite point as the counterpart opposite motion occurs. The movement of the liquid and contact against the sides of the reservoir provide additional forces compared to movement of static weight.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another illustrative exercise, the central body <b>100</b> opened with cap <b>104</b> and a desired amount of liquid dispensed into the reservoir, which is then closed. A user may hold an assembly <b>10</b> assembly by the grip member <b>211</b> on the opposite grips <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B and rotate the torso back and forth while holding the assembly level. As the user maintains a grip on the grip members, the rotatable grips allow for movement of the central body as they rotate. As the assembly <b>10</b> is moved, the liquid in the reservoir flows in response to the movement of the assembly. As the assembly is moved to one side, the inertia of the liquid causes it to be forced towards that side and then towards the opposite side as the opposite motion occurs. The movement of the liquid and contact against the sides of the reservoir provide additional force compared to movement of static weight.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the various exercises, the shape of the reservoir may direct the force as desired. In the depicted embodiment, the elongated curved shape of the central body serves as a flow path. When the reservoir is filled to approximately from about &#x2153; to about &#x2154; capacity with a liquid, such as water, as flow is inducted, the flow is guided towards the end in a lower portion of the cavity, upon reaching the end, a flow is created upwards and away from that across an upper portion of the chamber. Arrows <b>80</b>A and <b>80</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> indicate the side-to-side flow placed on the liquid when moved by a user in the side-to-side direction. Arrows <b>82</b>A and <b>82</b>A indicate the upwards and away direction of the flow that is created as the liquid flows around the sides of the reservoir <b>103</b>. This results in a flowing moving of the mass and an upwards force on the assembly <b>10</b>. It will be appreciated that assemblies having differently shaped reservoirs to achieve different forces may be used and are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is to be understood that the above-described arrangements are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the disclosure. Numerous modifications and alternative arrangements may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure and the appended claims are intended to cover such modifications and arrangements. Thus, while the disclosure has been shown in the drawings and described above with particularity and detail, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications, including, but not limited to, variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use may be made without departing from the principles and concepts set forth herein.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
