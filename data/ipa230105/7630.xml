modulation and transmission mechanisms. Example transmission mechanisms may include, but are not limited to: Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Wavelet technologies, and/or the like. Hybrid transmission mechanisms such as TDMA/CDMA, and OFDM/CDMA may also be employed. Various modulation schemes may be applied for signal transmission in the physical layer. Examples of modulation schemes include, but are not limited to: phase, amplitude, code, a combination of these, and/or the like. An example radio transmission method may implement Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) using Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), 16-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM, and/or the like. Physical radio transmission may be enhanced by dynamically or semi-dynamically changing the modulation and coding scheme depending on transmission requirements and radio conditions.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example Radio Access Network (RAN) architecture as per an aspect of an embodiment of the present disclosure. As illustrated in this example, a RAN node may be a next generation Node B (gNB) (e.g. <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B) providing New Radio (NR) user plane and control plane protocol terminations towards a first wireless device (e.g. <b>110</b>A). In an example, a RAN node may be a next generation evolved Node B (ng-eNB) (e.g. <b>120</b>C, <b>120</b>D), providing Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) user plane and control plane protocol terminations towards a second wireless device (e.g. <b>110</b>B). The first wireless device may communicate with a gNB over a Uu interface. The second wireless device may communicate with a ng-eNB over a Uu interface.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0189">A gNB or an ng-eNB may host functions such as radio resource management and scheduling, IP header compression, encryption and integrity protection of data, selection of Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) at User Equipment (UE) attachment, routing of user plane and control plane data, connection setup and release, scheduling and transmission of paging messages (originated from the AMF), scheduling and transmission of system broadcast information (originated from the AMF or Operation and Maintenance (O&#x26;M)), measurement and measurement reporting configuration, transport level packet marking in the uplink, session management, support of network slicing, Quality of Service (QoS) flow management and mapping to data radio bearers, support of UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state, distribution function for Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages, RAN sharing, dual connectivity or tight interworking between NR and E-UTRA.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0190">In an example, one or more gNBs and/or one or more ng-eNBs may be interconnected with each other by means of Xn interface. A gNB or an ng-eNB may be connected by means of NG interfaces to 5G Core Network (5GC). In an example, 5GC may comprise one or more AMF/User Plan Function (UPF) functions (e.g. <b>130</b>A or <b>130</b>B). A gNB or an ng-eNB may be connected to a UPF by means of an NG-User plane (NG-U) interface. The NG-U interface may provide delivery (e.g. non-guaranteed delivery) of user plane Protocol Data Units (PDUs) between a RAN node and the UPF. A gNB or an ng-eNB may be connected to an AMF by means of an NG-Control plane (NG-C) interface. The NG-C interface may provide functions such as NG interface management, UE context management, UE mobility management, transport of NAS messages, paging, PDU session management, configuration transfer or warning message transmission.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0191">In an example, a UPF may host functions such as anchor point for intra-/inter-Radio Access Technology (RAT) mobility (when applicable), external PDU session point of interconnect to data network, packet routing and forwarding, packet inspection and user plane part of policy rule enforcement, traffic usage reporting, uplink classifier to support routing traffic flows to a data network, branching point to support multi-homed PDU session, QoS handling for user plane, e.g. packet filtering, gating, Uplink (UL)/Downlink (DL) rate enforcement, uplink traffic verification (e.g. Service Data Flow (SDF) to QoS flow mapping), downlink packet buffering and/or downlink data notification triggering.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0192">In an example, an AMF may host functions such as NAS signaling termination, NAS signaling security, Access Stratum (AS) security control, inter Core Network (CN) node signaling for mobility between 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) access networks, idle mode UE reachability (e.g., control and execution of paging retransmission), registration area management, support of intra-system and inter-system mobility, access authentication, access authorization including check of roaming rights, mobility management control (subscription and policies), support of network slicing and/or Session Management Function (SMF) selection.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is an example user plane protocol stack, where Service Data Adaptation Protocol (SDAP) (e.g. <b>211</b> and <b>221</b>), Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) (e.g. <b>212</b> and <b>222</b>), Radio Link Control (RLC) (e.g. <b>213</b> and <b>223</b>) and Media Access Control (MAC) (e.g. <b>214</b> and <b>224</b>) sublayers and Physical (PHY) (e.g. <b>215</b> and <b>225</b>) layer may be terminated in wireless device (e.g. <b>110</b>) and gNB (e.g. <b>120</b>) on the network side. In an example, a PHY layer provides transport services to higher layers (e.g. MAC, RRC, etc.). In an example, services and functions of a MAC sublayer may comprise mapping between logical channels and transport channels, multiplexing/demultiplexing of MAC Service Data Units (SDUs) belonging to one or different logical channels into/from Transport Blocks (TBs) delivered to/from the PHY layer, scheduling information reporting, error correction through Hybrid Automatic Repeat request (HARQ) (e.g. one HARQ entity per carrier in case of Carrier Aggregation (CA)), priority handling between UEs by means of dynamic scheduling, priority handling between logical channels of one UE by means of logical channel prioritization, and/or padding. A MAC entity may support one or multiple numerologies and/or transmission timings. In an example, mapping restrictions in a logical channel prioritization may control which numerology and/or transmission timing a logical channel may use. In an example, an RLC sublayer may supports transparent mode (TM), unacknowledged mode (UM) and acknowledged mode (AM) transmission modes. The RLC configuration may be per logical channel with no dependency on numerologies and/or Transmission Time Interval (TTI) durations. In an example, Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) may operate on any of the numerologies and/or TTI durations the logical channel is configured with. In an example, services and functions of the PDCP layer for the user plane may comprise sequence numbering, header compression and decompression, transfer of user data, reordering and duplicate detection, PDCP PDU routing (e.g. in case of split bearers), retransmission of PDCP SDUs, ciphering, deciphering and integrity protection, PDCP SDU discard, PDCP re-establishment and data recovery for RLC AM, and/or duplication of PDCP PDUs. In an example, services and functions of SDAP may comprise mapping between a QoS flow and a data radio bearer. In an example, services and functions of SDAP may comprise mapping Quality of Service Indicator (QFI) in DL and UL packets. In an example, a protocol entity of SDAP may be configured for an individual PDU session.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is an example control plane protocol stack where PDCP (e.g. <b>233</b> and <b>242</b>), RLC (e.g. <b>234</b> and <b>243</b>) and MAC (e.g. <b>235</b> and <b>244</b>) sublayers and PHY (e.g. <b>236</b> and <b>245</b>) layer may be terminated in wireless device (e.g. <b>110</b>) and gNB (e.g. <b>120</b>) on a network side and perform service and functions described above. In an example, RRC (e.g. <b>232</b> and <b>241</b>) may be terminated in a wireless device and a gNB on a network side. In an example, services and functions of RRC may comprise broadcast of system information related to AS and NAS, paging initiated by 5GC or RAN, establishment, maintenance and release of an RRC connection between the UE and RAN, security functions including key management, establishment, configuration, maintenance and release of Signaling Radio Bearers (SRBs) and Data Radio Bearers (DRBs), mobility functions, QoS management functions, UE measurement reporting and control of the reporting, detection of and recovery from radio link failure, and/or NAS message transfer to/from NAS from/to a UE. In an example, NAS control protocol (e.g. <b>231</b> and <b>251</b>) may be terminated in the wireless device and AMF (e.g. <b>130</b>) on a network side and may perform functions such as authentication, mobility management between a UE and a AMF for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, and session management between a UE and a SMF for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0195">In an example, a base station may configure a plurality of logical channels for a wireless device. A logical channel in the plurality of logical channels may correspond to a radio bearer and the radio bearer may be associated with a QoS requirement. In an example, a base station may configure a logical channel to be mapped to one or more TTIs/numerologies in a plurality of TTIs/numerologies. The wireless device may receive a Downlink Control Information (DCI) via Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH) indicating an uplink grant. In an example, the uplink grant may be for a first TTI/numerology and may indicate uplink resources for transmission of a transport block. The base station may configure each logical channel in the plurality of logical channels with one or more parameters to be used by a logical channel prioritization procedure at the MAC layer of the wireless device. The one or more parameters may comprise priority, prioritized bit rate, etc. A logical channel in the plurality of logical channels may correspond to one or more buffers comprising data associated with the logical channel. The logical channel prioritization procedure may allocate the uplink resources to one or more first logical channels in the plurality of logical channels and/or one or more MAC Control Elements (CEs). The one or more first logical channels may be mapped to the first TTI/numerology. The MAC layer at the wireless device may multiplex one or more MAC CEs and/or one or more MAC SDUs (e.g., logical channel) in a MAC PDU (e.g., transport block). In an example, the MAC PDU may comprise a MAC header comprising a plurality of MAC sub-headers. A MAC sub-header in the plurality of MAC sub-headers may correspond to a MAC CE or a MAC SUD (logical channel) in the one or more MAC CEs and/or one or more MAC SDUs. In an example, a MAC CE or a logical channel may be configured with a Logical Channel IDentifier (LCID). In an example, LCID for a logical channel or a MAC CE may be fixed/pre-configured. In an example, LCID for a logical channel or MAC CE may be configured for the wireless device by the base station. The MAC sub-header corresponding to a MAC CE or a MAC SDU may comprise LCID associated with the MAC CE or the MAC SDU.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0196">In an example, a base station may activate and/or deactivate and/or impact one or more processes (e.g., set values of one or more parameters of the one or more processes or start and/or stop one or more timers of the one or more processes) at the wireless device by employing one or more MAC commands. The one or more MAC commands may comprise one or more MAC control elements. In an example, the one or more processes may comprise activation and/or deactivation of PDCP packet duplication for one or more radio bearers. The base station may transmit a MAC CE comprising one or more fields, the values of the fields indicating activation and/or deactivation of PDCP duplication for the one or more radio bearers. In an example, the one or more processes may comprise Channel State Information (CSI) transmission of on one or more cells.

At Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection establishment/re-establishment/handover, one serving cell may provide the NAS (non-access stratum) mobility information (e.g. Tracking Area Identifier (TAI)). At RRC connection re-establishment/handover, one serving cell may provide the security input. This cell may be referred to as the Primary Cell (PCell).

In an example, in an RRC idle state, a wireless device may not have an RRC connection with a base station, and a UE context of a wireless device may not be stored in a base station. In an example, in an RRC inactive state, a wireless device may not have an RRC connection with a base station.

In an example, an anchor base station may be a base station that a wireless device in an RRC inactive state was lastly connected to in a latest RRC connected state or that a wireless device lastly performed an RNA update procedure in.

In an example, if a cell selected belongs to a different RNA from an RNA for a wireless device in an RRC inactive state, the wireless device may initiate a random access procedure to perform an RNA update procedure. In an example, if a wireless device in an RRC inactive state has one or more packets, in a buffer, to transmit to a network, the wireless device may initiate a random access procedure to transmit one or more packets to a base station of a cell that the wireless device selects.

In response to fetching a UE context, a base station may transmit a path switch request for a wireless device to a core network entity (e.g. AMF, MME, and/or the like). A core network entity may update a downlink tunnel endpoint identifier for one or more bearers established for the wireless device between a user plane core network entity (e.g. UPF, S-GW, and/or the like) and a RAN node (e.g. the base station), e.g. changing a downlink tunnel endpoint identifier from an address of the anchor base station to an address of the base station.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0306">A gNB may communicate with a wireless device via a wireless network employing one or more new radio technologies.

If sidelink communication and Uu communication coexist on a carrier, a transmission power of a sidelink transmission of a UE may be determined based on a pathloss between the base station and the UE to reduce the interference on Uu communications (e.g., between the base station and other UEs). Based on a power control of sidelink communication based on a pathloss from the base station, a UE, who is located close to the base station, may determine a small transmission power for sidelink feedback signal (e.g. a physical sidelink feedback channel (PSFCH)), and in this case, the reception performance of the sidelink feedback signal may be degraded since the transmission power may be lower than other UEs (e.g. cell edge UE) and the received signal strength may be lower.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0308">To address this issue, examples of embodiments present how to set the size of the resources of the sidelink feedback channel differently depending on a RSRP, a pathloss of the base station, a sidelink transmission power, a sidelink RSRP, and/or a sidelink pathloss.

A link directly established between devices may be referred to as a D2D link or a sidelink. The D2D communication may have merits in that latency is reduced compared to a legacy base station-centered communication scheme and a less radio resource is required, and the like.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0310"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>D</figref> show various deployment examples of UEs performing D2D communication and cell coverage.

A discovery signal may correspond to a signal used by a UE to determine a plurality of UEs adjacent to the UE. As an example of a sidelink channel for transmitting and receiving a discovery signal, there is a sidelink discovery channel (PSDCH: Physical Sidelink Discovery Channel). A communication signal may correspond to a signal for transmitting general data (e.g., voice, image, video, safety information, etc.). As an example of a sidelink channel for transmitting and receiving a communication signal, there is a physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH), a physical sidelink shared channel (PSSCH), a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH), and the like.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0312"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows an example of a UE A, a UE B and a radio resources used by the UE A and the UE B performing D2D communication. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>, a UE corresponds to a terminal or such a network device as a base station transmitting and receiving a signal according to a D2D communication scheme. A UE selects a resource unit corresponding to a specific resource from a resource pool corresponding to a set of resources and the UE transmits a D2D signal using the selected resource unit. The UE B corresponding to a reception UE receives a configuration of a resource pool in which the UE A is able to transmit a signal and the UE B is able to detect a signal of the UE A in the resource pool. In this case, if the UE A is located at the inside of network coverage of a base station, the base station may inform the UE A of the resource pool. If the UE A is located at the outside of network coverage of the base station, the resource pool may be informed by a different UE or may be determined by a preconfigured resource pool. In general, a resource pool includes a plurality of resource units. One resource unit may be comprised of a group of resource blocks and a duration in time (e.g., a slot/a subframe/K OFDM symbols). A UE selects one or more resource units from a plurality of the resource units and may be able to use the selected resource unit(s) for D2D signal transmission. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> shows an example of configuring one or more resource units. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>, the entire frequency resources are divided into the Nf number of resource units per a unit time resource (e.g. slot or a group of slots). In particular, a resource pool may be repeated with a period of k unit time resources and a resource pool may be configured within a bandwidth part for D2D or sidelink communication (e.g., a SL BWP). Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, one resource unit may periodically and repeatedly appear, or, an index of a physical resource unit to which a logical resource unit is mapped may change with a predetermined pattern according to time to obtain a diversity gain in time domain and/or frequency domain. In this resource unit structure, a resource pool may correspond to a set of resource units capable of being used by a UE intending to transmit or receive a D2D signal.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0313">The resource pool may be classified into various types. First of all, the resource pool may be classified according to contents of a D2D signal transmitted via each resource pool. For example, the contents of the D2D signal may be classified into various signals and a separate resource pool may be configured according to each of the contents. The contents of the D2D signal may include a D2D control channel, a D2D data channel, and a discovery channel. The D2D control channel may correspond to a signal including information on a resource position of a D2D data channel, information on MCS necessary for modulating and demodulating a data channel, information on a MIMO transmission scheme, information on packet priority, information on target coverage, information on QoS requirement or the like. The D2D control channel may be transmitted on an identical resource unit in a manner of being multiplexed with D2D data channel. In this case, a D2D control and data channel resource pool may correspond to a pool of resources that D2D control and D2D data are transmitted in a manner of being multiplexed. The D2D control channel may also be referred to as a PSCCH (physical sidelink control channel). The D2D data channel (or, PSSCH (physical sidelink shared channel)) corresponds to a resource pool used by a transmission UE to transmit user data. If a D2D control and a D2D data are transmitted in a manner of being multiplexed in an identical resource unit, D2D data channel except D2D control information may be transmitted only in a resource pool for the D2D data channel. In other word, resource elements (REs), which are used to transmit D2D control information in a specific resource unit of a D2D control resource pool, may also be used for transmitting D2D data in a D2D data channel resource pool. The discovery channel may correspond to a resource pool for a message that enables a neighboring UE to discover transmission UE transmitting information such as ID of the UE, and the like.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0314">Second, the resource pool may be classified to support different QoS level or different service. For example, the priority level for each resource pool may be configured by a base station, or the service to be supported for each resource pool may be configured differently. Alternatively, a specific resource pool may be configured to use only a specific unicast or groupcast UEs. Although contents of D2D signal are identical to each other, it may use a different resource pool according to a transmission/reception attribute of the D2D signal. For example, in case of the same D2D data channel or the same discovery message, the D2D data channel or the discovery signal may be classified into a different resource pool according to a transmission timing determination scheme (e.g., whether a D2D signal is transmitted at the time of receiving a synchronization reference signal or the timing to which a prescribed timing advance is added) of a D2D signal, a resource allocation scheme (e.g., whether a transmission resource of an individual signal is designated by a base station or an individual transmission UE selects an individual signal transmission resource from a pool), a signal format (e.g., number of symbols occupied by a D2D signal in a subframe, number of subframes used for transmitting a D2D signal), signal strength from a base station, strength of transmit power of a D2D UE, and the like. For clarity, a method for a base station to directly designate a transmission resource of a D2D transmission UE is referred to as a mode 1. In mode 1, a base station such as eNB or gNB may transmit DCI to schedule D2D signal transmission. If a transmission resource region (or resource pool) is (pre)configured or a base station designates the transmission resource region or resource pool and a UE directly selects a transmission resource from the transmission resource region (or resource pool), it is referred to as a mode 2. In case of performing D2D discovery, if a base station directly indicates a transmission resource, it is referred to as a Type 2. If a UE directly selects a transmission resource from a predetermined resource pool or a resource pool indicated by the base station, it is referred to as a Type 1.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0315">(D2D synchronization) In order to perform D2D communication, it is necessary to obtain time synchronization and frequency synchronization between two UEs. In general, if the two UEs belong to the coverage of a cell, the two UEs may be synchronized by PSSs/SSSs of the cell, other reference signals (e.g., CSI-RSs) and/or the like transmitted by the base station and the time/frequency synchronization may be maintained between the two UEs in a level that the two UEs are able to directly transmit and receive a signal. Alternatively, a UE may transmit synchronization signal and another UE may be synchronized to the synchronization signal transmitted by the UE. This synchronization signal transmitted by a UE may be referred to as a sidelink synchronization signal (SLSS). SLSS may comprise sidelink primary synchronization signal (S-PSS) and sidelink secondary synchronization signal (S-SSS). SLSS may be transmitted with physical sidelink broadcast channel (PSBCH) to convey some basic or initial system information. Additionally, a UE may synchronize or derive a timing of transmission time intervals (e.g., frames, subframes, slots, and/or the like) using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) timing. S-PSS, S-SSS and PSBCH may be structured in a block format (sidelink synchronization signal block (S-SSB)) which may support periodic transmission. The S-SSB may have the same numerology (i.e. SCS and CP length) as sidelink data channel and sidelink control channel in a carrier, transmission bandwidth may be within the (pre-)configured sidelink BWP, and its frequency location may be (pre-)configured. This may lead to no need for the UE to perform hypothesis detection in frequency to find S-SSB in a carrier. Sidelink synchronization sources may be GNSS, gNB, eNB, or NR UE. Each sidelink synchronization source may be associated with a synchronization priority level in which the priority order may be (pre)configured.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0316">A D2D resource pool may be to divide a bandwidth into multiple subchannels, wherein each transmitter of a number of neighboring transmitters may select one or more subchannels to transmit a signal. Subchannel selection may be based on received energy measurements and/or control channel decoding. As an example, a UE may identify which subchannel is going to be used by other UE based on control channel decoding as well as an energy measurement for each subchannel. Here, a limit on system performance may be imposed by in-band emissions. An in-band emission (IBE) is interference caused by one transmitter transmitting on one subchannel and imposed on another transmitter transmitting to a receiver on another subchannel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an in-band emissions model. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the plot of the in-band emissions model shows that nearby subchannels as well as other subchannels (e.g., I/Q or image subchannels) experience more interference.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0317">On the other hand, when the D2D UE operates in a cellular network, the power radiated by the D2D UE may cause serious interference to the cellular communication. In particular, when a D2D UE uses only some frequency resources in a particular slot or subframe, the in-band emission of the power radiated by the D2D UE may cause serious interference to the frequency resources used by the cellular communication network. To prevent this problem, the D2D UE may perform a cellular pathloss-based power control. The parameters used for power control (e. g. P<sub>0 </sub>or alpha) may be configured by the base station.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0318">In a D2D communication, the transmitting UE may correspond to a half-duplex UE which is unable to perform reception at the time of performing transmission. In particular, the transmission UE may fail to receive the transmission of another UE due to the half-duplex problem. To mitigate the half duplex problem, different D2D UEs performing communication need to transmit signals at one or more different time resources.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0319">D2D operation may have various advantages in that it is communication between devices in proximity. For example, D2D operation may have a high transfer rate and a low latency and may perform data communication. Furthermore, in D2D operation, traffic concentrated on a base station may be distributed. If a D2D UE plays the role of a relay, the D2D operation may also extend the coverage of a base station.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0320">The above-described D2D communication may be expanded and applied to signal transmission and/or reception between vehicles. Most particularly, vehicle-related communication is referred to as vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. In V2X, the &#x2018;X&#x2019; may refer to: a pedestrian and, in this case, V2X may by indicated by V2P (communication between a vehicle and a device carried by an individual (e.g., handheld terminal carried by a pedestrian, cyclist, driver or passenger); a vehicle and, in this case, V2X may be indicated V2V (communication between vehicles); and an infrastructure/network and, in this case, V2X may be indicated by V2I/N (communication between a vehicle and a roadside unit (RSU)/network. An RSU may be a transportation infrastructure entity (e.g., an entity transmitting speed notifications) implemented in a base station or a stationary UE)). For V2X communication, a vehicle, an RSU, and a handheld device may be equipped with a transceiver. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of V2X communication.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0321">As describe above, V2X communication may be used to indicate warnings for various events such as safety and the like. For example, information on an event occurring on a vehicle or road may be notified to another vehicle or pedestrians through V2X communication. For example, information on a warning of a traffic accident, a change of a road situation, or an accident occurrence may be forwarded to another vehicle or pedestrian. For example, a pedestrian, who is adjacent to or crossing a road, may be informed of information on vehicle approach.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0322">In V2X communication, one challenge may be to avoid collisions and guarantee a minimum communication quality even in dense UE scenarios. Wireless congestion control may represent a family of mechanisms to mitigate such collisions by adjusting one or more communication parameters to control the congestion level on the vehicular wireless channel and guarantee reliable V2X communications. In existing technologies, a wireless device may measure the following two metrics to characterize the channel state and allow the wireless device to take necessary actions. The first metric may be a channel busy radio (CBR), which may be defined as the portion (or number) of subchannels in a resource pool with measured RSSIs exceeding a pre-configured threshold. The total frequency resources of the resource pool may be divided into a given number of subchannels. Such a metric may be sensed over, for example, the last <b>100</b> subframes (where the definition of &#x201c;subframe&#x201d; in LTE may be used). The CBR may provide an estimation on the total state of the channel. The second metric may be a channel occupancy ratio (CR). The CR may be calculated at subframe n and may be defined as the total number of subchannels used for sidelink transmissions in subframes [n&#x2212;a, n&#x2212;<b>1</b>] and granted in subframes [n, n+b] divided by the total number of subchannels within [n&#x2212;a, n+b]. a and b may be determined by the wireless device with the limitation of a+b+1=1000, a&#x2265;500. The CR may provide an indication of the channel utilization by the transmitter itself. For each interval of CBR values, a CR limit may be defined as a footprint that the transmitter should not exceed. This CR limit may be configured by a base station per a CBR range and packet priority. For example, if a high CBR is observed, a low CR limit may be configured, and a low CR limit may be configured for a low packet priority. When the station decides to transmit a packet, the station maps its CBR value to the correct interval to get the corresponding CR limit value. If its CR is higher than the CR limit, the wireless device may have to decrease its CR below that limit. To reduce the CR, it may be up to each implementation to decide which technique(s) to use. In an example, the following options to accommodate CR limit may be taken into account: 1) drop packet retransmission: if the retransmission feature is enabled, the station may disable it. 2) drop packet transmission: the station simply drops the packet transmission (including the retransmission if enabled). This is one of the simplest techniques. 3) adapt the MCS: the wireless device may reduce its CR by augmenting the MCS index used. This may reduce the number of subchannels used for the transmission. However, increasing the MCS reduces the robustness of the message, and thus reduces the range of the message. 4) adapt transmission power: the wireless device may reduce its transmission power. Consequently, the overall CBR in the area may be reduced, and the value of CR limit might be increased.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0323">When SL HARQ feedback is enabled for a SL-unicast, at least when a UE is not enabled with a code-block group (CBG) based HARQ feedback, a receiver UE, of a SL communication/channel, may generate a HARQ-ACK when the receiver UE successfully decodes a transport block (TB) transmitted for the SL-unicast.

In this figure, Rx wireless device 1 may determine a first power level for a the sidelink feedback signal based on a RSRP of a cell of the base station or a pathloss from the base station where the first power level may be low since the Rx wireless device 1 is located close to the base station. Rx wireless device 2 may transmit the sidelink feedback signal at high transmission power because it is located far from the base station. When these two wireless devices transmit sidelink feedback signals to Tx wireless device 1 at the same time (e.g., using CDM/FDM), the detection performance of the feedback signal of Rx wireless device 1 may be significantly degraded from that of Rx wireless device 2. In order to prevent such a problem, the following example may be considered.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0330">In an example, a base station may transmit a configuration message comprising a plurality of feedback resources (or resource sets) to a wireless device via an SIB or an RRC. In an example, the plurality of feedback resources (or resource sets) may comprise a first feedback resource set and a second feedback resource set. The first feedback resource set may be used for wireless devices with a first RSRP value(s) of a serving or a camping cell. The second feedback resource set may be used for wireless devices with a second RSRP value(s). The first feedback resource set and the second feedback resource set may be configured at different times and/or different frequency resources. For example, the first RSRP value(s) may be configured for the first feedback resource set and the second RSRP value(s) may be configured for the second feedback resource set. The first or second RSRP value(s) may be, an RSRP range or an upper and/or a lower limit value of RSRP. One or more parameters of feedback resource set configurations may comprise a number of feedback resources, time and/or frequency location of each feedback resource, a (time and/or frequency) size of each feedback resource (e.g., a number of RBs used for a feedback channel), and one or more conditions for each feedback resource (a wireless device may determine one or more feedback resources based on the one or more conditions).

The one or more conditions may be at least one of an Uu RSRP range, a sidelink RSRP range, or a sidelink transmission power range. Each range may comprise a upper limit value and/or a lower limit value. A wireless device may measure the Uu RSRP based on the received signal power of a (serving or camping) cell. The Uu RSRP may be measured by an average of received signal power over a reference signal transmitted by a base station. For Uu RSRP measurement, a base station may configure one or more reference signal information may comprise antenna port number or reference signal sequence information. A wireless device may measure the sidelink RSRP based on a received signal power from a transmitter wireless device. The sidelink RSRP may be measured as an (linear) average of a received power on a reference signal which is transmitted by a wireless device.

The wireless device may be a transmitter wireless device and the wireless device may configure the one or more conditions via a sidelink control channel (e.g. a PSCCH) or a sidelink MAC CE or a sidelink RRC. This configuration may be maintained within a same sidelink session or for a same MAC PDU. For example, the RSRP range may be for RSRP measurement from a base station. A wireless device may measure an RSRP from a base station and determine which feedback resource (or feedback resource set) is used based on the RSRP range. Since Rx wireless device 1 is located close to the base station, when the OLPC is applied, a feedback signal may be transmitted with low transmission power. In this case, Rx wireless device 1 uses feedback resource 2 of larger size to improve detection performance or to increase the total transmission power. For this operation, a higher RSRP range or lower transmission power range than the feedback resource 1 may be configured for the feedback resource 2.

The SL RSRP may be measured by the average received power over DMRS for a PSCCH or a PSSCH transmitted by the first wireless device. If the SL RSRP measurement satisfies one of the plurality of conditions, the associated feedback resource (or resource set) may be used for feedback information transmission.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0336">The advantage of the sidelink Tx wireless device to directly configure the sidelink feedback resources may be that it may be dynamically adjusted when different Tx wireless devices may have different QoS requirements. The method of the base station configuring the same sidelink feedback resource per resource pool may reduce the signaling complexity and the delay in which the Rx wireless device may perform the reception operation for the feedback resource configuration.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0337">For outside coverage, a similar problem may occur. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>, two different sidelink receiving wireless devices may differ in receiving power from each other due to a difference in distance from the transmitting wireless device. If two wireless devices simultaneously transmit feedback signals at the same time, the signal of Rx wireless device 2 may not be detected properly. In an example, the Rx wireless device 2 may use more resources to improve the detection performance of the feedback signal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref> shows an example of this. In this embodiment, the usage condition of each sidelink feedback resource may be SL RSRP or SL pathloss from the sidelink Tx wireless device. In an example, when open loop power control is applied/configured from/to the sidelink Tx wireless device, the range of the sidelink Tx power may also be considered as the feedback resource usage condition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows an example where these sidelink feedback resources are set at different times.

When a plurality of feedback resources are configured by a transmit wireless device or a base station, the size of each feedback resource may be configured differently according to the measured CBR of Rx wireless device. However, since the measured CBR may be different for the receiving wireless device, the transmitting wireless device may directly configure the size of the feedback resource based on the CBR measured by the data Tx wireless device, or the data Tx wireless device may transmit the CBR value measured by the data Tx wireless device via a physical layer control signaling (e.g., PSCCH) to the receiving wireless device or a higher layer signal (e.g. sidelink MAC or sidelink RRC signaling). In an example, the size of the feedback resource may be fixed, and the (usage) condition for using the feedback resource, for example, the range of the RSRP, the pathloss, or the transmit power, may be determined as a function of the CBR. For example, according to the CBR range, a table of range values used for each feedback resource is signaled to wireless devices by the network (through RRC or SIB signaling), and each wireless device determines a feedback resource based on the CBR measurement. If the CBR is extremely high, all the receiving wireless devices may not perform the feedback signal transmission in any feedback resource.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0339">In an example, a wireless device may receive from a base station, one or more configuration messages comprising a plurality of sidelink feedback resources within a set of sidelink resources (e.g. a resource pool or a BWP).
