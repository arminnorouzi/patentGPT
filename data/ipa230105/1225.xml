In current treatments for cervical cancer, treatment can include removing an entire uterus from an early stage (stage I). However, for young patients, local treatment is required to conserve the uterus in order to maintain fertility. Further, in an advanced stage (stage III and subsequent stages), when cancer has spread to surrounding tissues, it is difficult to remove by surgery, and thus treatment can include combining radiation therapy and chemotherapy. However, a five-year survival rate is as low as 50% in stage III and 20% in stage IV, and more effective treatment is required. As the local treatment for cancer, a treatment method using a photoreactive substance is known (for example, see United States Patent Application Publication No. 2018/0113246). In particular, a treatment method using an antibody-photosensitive substance (hydrophilic phthalocyanine) can specifically destroy target cells without destroying non-target cells such as normal cells by irradiating the antibody-photosensitive substance accumulated in a tumor with excitation light (for example, near-infrared rays), and is expected to achieve a relatively high treatment effect while minimizing side effects.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, in order to achieve a high treatment effect by the antibody-photosensitive substance, the antibody-photosensitive substance accumulated in the tumor is required to be reliably irradiated with the near-infrared rays. However, since light is rapidly attenuated due to an influence of a biological tissue, the near-infrared rays have a relatively small penetration depth, and it can be extremely difficult to non-invasively irradiate a solid cancer with light having energy required for treatment from a body surface. Therefore, a method for reliably irradiating the tumor in a body with light while reducing invasiveness as much as possible is required. In the case of cervical cancer, cancer often spreads over a wide area of a cervical canal, and a method for irradiating cancer in a wide range with light from as close as possible is required.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A treatment apparatus and a treatment method capable of effectively treating cancer in a range including at least a part of a cervix.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A treatment apparatus is disclosed, which is configured to irradiate an antibody-photosensitive substance bound to a tumor cell of cervical cancer with excitation light. The treatment apparatus includes: a main shaft including a distal portion and a proximal portion; an inflation portion disposed on a distal side of the main shaft and configured to be inflated by inflowing a fluid; a distal shaft protruding from the inflation portion toward the distal side; and at least one irradiation unit configured to emit the excitation light of the antibody-photosensitive substance from the distal shaft and the inflation portion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the treatment apparatus described above, the excitation light can be effectively emitted to the antibody-photosensitive substance bound to the tumor cell in a wide range including a cervix in a state in which the distal shaft is inserted into a cervical canal and the inflation portion is inflated in a vagina. Therefore, this treatment apparatus can improve a treatment effect of cancer in a relatively wide range including the cervix.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The distal shaft may emit the excitation light in a direction substantially perpendicular to an axial center of the distal shaft, and the inflation portion may emit the excitation light in a substantially distal direction. Accordingly, the excitation light can be emitted to the tumor cell of the cervix from both the distal shaft and the inflation portion, and thus the treatment effect can be improved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The treatment apparatus may be formed with an irradiation lumen communicating with an inside of the inflation portion and an inside of the distal shaft and configured to movably accommodate the irradiation unit. Accordingly, even if only one irradiation unit is provided, the excitation light can be emitted from the distal shaft and the inflation portion, and thus a configuration of the treatment apparatus can be simplified and operability can be improved. By moving the irradiation unit, a position where the excitation light is emitted can be appropriately adjusted, and thus the treatment effect can be improved. The number of the irradiation unit is not limited to one.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inflation portion may have an abutment surface facing the distal side in an inflated state of the inflation portion, and the abutment surface may have a portion that is separated from an axial center of the distal shaft and that partially protrudes toward the distal side. Accordingly, by abutting the inflation portion against the uterine vagina, the portion of the abutment surface that protrudes toward the distal side can be brought close to a vaginal vault. Therefore, the excitation light can be effectively emitted to the vicinity of the vaginal vault, which is difficult for light to reach, and the treatment effect can be improved.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The treatment apparatus may further include an annular reinforcement portion disposed on a distal side of the inflation portion and surrounding a proximal portion of the distal shaft. Accordingly, the distal shaft and the inflation portion can be positioned at appropriate positions by inserting the distal shaft into the cervical canal and abutting the reinforcement portion against the uterine vagina. Therefore, the excitation light can be emitted from the distal shaft and the inflation portion to desired positions, and thus the treatment effect can be improved.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The treatment apparatus may further include a detection unit configured to detect fluorescence emitted by the antibody-photosensitive substance. Accordingly, a degree of destruction of the tumor cell due to emission of the excitation light can be checked by a change in the fluorescence detected by the detection unit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The inflation portion may be configured to move relative to the main shaft in an axial center direction of the main shaft. Accordingly, the distal shaft can be inserted into the cervical canal in a state in which the inflation portion is retracted toward a proximal side with respect to the main shaft to secure a visual field. In a state in which the distal shaft is maintained at an appropriate position of the cervical canal, the inflation portion can be moved and disposed at an appropriate position. Therefore, both the distal shaft and the inflation portion can be accurately and rather easily disposed at appropriate positions of the cervical canal and the vagina. Therefore, the excitation light can be emitted from the distal shaft and the inflation portion to desired positions, and thus the treatment effect can be improved.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A treatment method for, for example, for cervical cancer is disclosed. The treatment method includes: intravenously administering an antibody-photosensitive substance; inserting a treatment apparatus into a living body, for example, a vagina after 12 hours to 36 hours from the intravenous administration, the treatment apparatus including an inflation portion configured to be inflated and a distal shaft protruding from the inflation portion and configured to emit excitation light of the antibody-photosensitive substance; inserting the distal shaft into a body lumen, for example, a cervical canal; inflating the inflation portion in the living body or vagina; emitting the excitation light from the distal shaft to a surrounding tissue; emitting the excitation light from the inflation portion to a surrounding tissue; and deflating the inflation portion.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the treatment method described above, the distal shaft can be inserted into the cervical canal from an external uterine ostium while visually checking the distal shaft in a state in which the inflation portion is deflated to secure the visual field, and the inflation portion can be widely inflated in the vagina. Therefore, by emitting the excitation light of the antibody-photosensitive substance from the distal shaft and the inflation portion, the excitation light can be effectively emitted to the antibody-photosensitive substance bound to the tumor cell in a wide range including the cervix. Therefore, this treatment method can improve the treatment effect of cancer in a wide range including the cervix.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the emitting of the excitation light from the distal shaft, an irradiation unit configured to emit the excitation light may be disposed inside the distal shaft to emit the excitation light from the irradiation unit, in the emitting of the excitation light from the inflation portion, the irradiation unit may be disposed inside the inflation portion to emit the excitation light from the irradiation unit, and the irradiation unit may be moved between the distal shaft and the inflation portion between the emitting of the excitation light from the distal shaft and the emitting of the excitation light from the inflation portion. Accordingly, even if only one irradiation unit is provided, the excitation light can be emitted from the distal shaft and the inflation portion, and thus the configuration of the treatment apparatus can be simplified and the operability can be improved. By moving the irradiation unit, a position where the excitation light is emitted can be appropriately adjusted, and thus the treatment effect can be improved. An order of emitting the excitation light is not limited. Therefore, the excitation light may be emitted from the distal shaft first, or the excitation light may be emitted from the inflation portion first. The number of the irradiation unit is not limited to one.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The emitting of the excitation light from the distal shaft and the emitting of the excitation light from the inflation portion may be performed simultaneously. Accordingly, this treatment method can simultaneously emit the excitation light from various positions and directions, and thus the treatment effect can be improved, and treatment can be efficiently performed in a short time.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the inserting of the distal shaft into the cervical canal, an abutment surface may be abutted against a uterine vagina. The abutment surface may be disposed on a proximal side of the distal shaft. The distal shaft may extend from the abutment surface and face a distal side. Accordingly, the distal shaft and the inflation portion can be positioned at appropriate positions. Therefore, the excitation light can be emitted from the distal shaft and the inflation portion to desired positions, and the treatment effect can be improved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The treatment method may further include detecting fluorescence emitted by the antibody-photosensitive substance and checking an intensity of the fluorescence. Accordingly, in this treatment method, the degree of the destruction of the tumor cell due to the emission of the excitation light can be checked by detecting the fluorescence.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The checking of the intensity of the fluorescence may be performed in parallel with the emitting of the excitation light. Accordingly, in this treatment method, a tumor can be treated while detecting the fluorescence to check the degree of the destruction of the tumor cell due to the emission of the excitation light, and the treatment effect can be improved.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The checking of the intensity of the fluorescence may be performed after the emitting of the excitation light. Accordingly, in this treatment method, a result of the destruction of the tumor cell due to the emission of the excitation light can be accurately checked by detecting the fluorescence.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A treatment method is disclosed, which includes: intravenously administering an antibody-photosensitive substance; inserting a treatment apparatus into a living body after the intravenous administration of the antibody-photosensitive substance, the treatment apparatus including an inflation portion configured to be inflated and a distal shaft protruding from the inflation portion and configured to emit excitation light of the antibody-photosensitive substance; inserting the distal shaft into a body lumen; inflating the inflation portion in the living body; and emitting the excitation light from the distal shaft and the inflation portion to surrounding tissue.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings

In the present specification, a side of a device to be inserted into a body lumen is referred to as a &#x201c;distal side&#x201d;, and a side to be operated is referred to as a &#x201c;proximal side&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A treatment apparatus <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment is used for a treatment method for cervical cancer. The treatment apparatus <b>10</b> and the treatment method can also be used to simultaneously treat both cervical cancer and vaginal cancer. The treatment method can be used for photoimmunotherapy in which an antibody-photosensitive substance bound to cell membranes of target cells is irradiated with near-infrared rays, which serve as excitation light of the antibody-photosensitive substance, to destroy the target cells. The target cells are tumor cells such as cancer cells. In this treatment method, the antibody-photosensitive substance, which is obtained by binding an antibody that specifically binds to only a specific antigen on surfaces of the tumor cells and a photosensitive substance paired with the antibody, is used as a drug. The antibody is not particularly limited, and may be, for example, panitumbab, trastuzumab, HuJ591, pertuzumab, lapatinib, palbociclib, and olaparib. The photosensitive substance can be, for example, hydrophilic phthalocyanine which is a substance that reacts with near-infrared rays having a wavelength of about 700 nm (IR700), but is not limited to hydrophilic phthalocyanine. When IR700 receives near-infrared rays having a wavelength of about 660 nm to 740 nm, a ligand of a functional group that secures water solubility is broken, causing a structural change of the IR700 from water-soluble to hydrophobic. Due to this structural change, membrane protein is extracted, holes are opened in the cell membranes, and water enters the cells, so that the cancer cells can be ruptured and destroyed. IR700 can be excited by receiving the near-infrared rays, and emits fluorescence having a wavelength different from an excitation wavelength. For example, IR700 emits fluorescence having a wavelength of 704 nm when excited by receiving near-infrared rays having a wavelength of 689 nm. A structural change of the IR700 occurs while emitting the fluorescence by a photoreaction, and IR700 also stops emitting the fluorescence when the tumor cells are destroyed and the role as a drug is finished.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The treatment apparatus <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can treat, with one device, cervical cancer and vaginal cancer in a relatively wide range A, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b></figref> and can include a cervix U, an external uterine ostium O, a uterine vagina UV around the external uterine ostium O, a vaginal vault VF, and a site or location near the vaginal vault VF on a vaginal introitus side relative to the vaginal vault VF of a vagina V.

It can be more preferable that a material for the distal shaft <b>24</b> has elasticity and has a physical property allowing the distal shaft <b>24</b> to be deformed while being bent along a cervical canal after being inserted into the cervical canal.

Accordingly, when inserting the distal shaft <b>24</b> from the external uterine ostium O into the cervical canal CC, the operator can rather easily grasp a length of insertion of the distal shaft <b>24</b> into the cervical canal CC by visually checking the irregular structure <b>24</b>A.

The irradiation unit <b>50</b> may be moved between the distal shaft <b>24</b> and the inflation portion <b>30</b> between the emitting of the excitation light from the distal shaft <b>24</b> and the emitting of the excitation light from the inflation portion <b>30</b>. Accordingly, even if only one irradiation unit <b>50</b> is provided, the excitation light can be emitted from the distal shaft <b>24</b> and the inflation portion <b>30</b>, and thus the configuration of the treatment apparatus <b>10</b> can be relatively simplified and the operability can be improved. By moving the irradiation unit <b>50</b>, a position where the excitation light is emitted can be appropriately adjusted, and thus the treatment effect can be improved. An order of emitting the excitation light is not limited. Therefore, the excitation light may be emitted from the distal shaft <b>24</b> first, or the excitation light may be emitted from the inflation portion <b>30</b> first.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The emitting of the excitation light from the distal shaft <b>24</b> and the emitting of the excitation light from the inflation portion <b>30</b> may be performed simultaneously. Accordingly, this treatment method can simultaneously emit the excitation light from various positions and directions, and thus the treatment effect can be improved, and treatment can be efficiently performed in a relatively short time.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the inserting of the distal shaft <b>24</b> into the cervical canal CC, the abutment surface <b>34</b> may be abutted against the uterine vagina UV. The abutment surface <b>34</b> is disposed on the proximal side of the distal shaft <b>24</b>. The distal shaft <b>24</b> extends from the abutment surface <b>34</b>, and faces the distal side. Accordingly, the distal shaft <b>24</b> and the inflation portion <b>30</b> can be positioned at appropriate positions. Therefore, the excitation light can be emitted from the distal shaft <b>24</b> and the inflation portion <b>30</b> to desired positions, and the treatment effect can be improved.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The disclosure is not limited to the embodiments described above, and various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art within a scope of the technical idea of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the treatment apparatus <b>10</b> may further include the detection unit <b>90</b> configured to detect fluorescence that is emitted by the antibody-photosensitive substance excited by being irradiated with near-infrared rays from the light-emitting unit <b>52</b> and has a wavelength (for example, 704 nm) different from a wavelength of irradiation light (for example, 689 nm). The detection unit <b>90</b> can include, for example, an optical waveguide <b>91</b> such as an optical fiber disposed in the irradiation lumen <b>25</b> like the irradiation unit <b>50</b> and receiving light, and an optical sensor <b>92</b> capable of detecting the amount of light. The detection unit <b>90</b> may include, at a position where the detection unit <b>90</b> receives light, a semiconductor sensor such as a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor that senses the light and converts the light into an electrical signal.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">When the antibody-photosensitive substance bound to the tumor cells C is irradiated with the near-infrared rays, the antibody-photosensitive substance causes a photoreaction to emit the fluorescence, and destroys the tumor cells C. The antibody-photosensitive substance stops emitting the fluorescence after the tumor cells C are destroyed. Therefore, a degree of destruction of the tumor cells C due to the emission of the excitation light can be checked by measuring a change in an intensity of the detected fluorescence by the optical sensor <b>92</b>. Therefore, a progress state of the photoreaction for destroying the tumor cells C can be checked.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The detection unit <b>90</b> may be a device different from the treatment apparatus <b>10</b> including the irradiation unit <b>50</b> described above as long as the detection unit <b>90</b> can detect the fluorescence emitted by the antibody-photosensitive substance excited by receiving the near-infrared rays. The detection unit <b>90</b> may be inserted into the vagina V, a uterus, a rectum, a bladder, a urethra, an abdominal cavity, a blood vessel, a ureter, or the like to detect fluorescence. The detection of the fluorescence by the detection unit <b>90</b> may be performed in parallel with the emission of the near-infrared rays by the treatment apparatus <b>10</b>, or may be performed after the emission of the near-infrared rays by the treatment apparatus <b>10</b> is ended. The detection unit <b>90</b> may be inserted into the vagina V or the cervical canal CC after the treatment apparatus <b>10</b> is drawn out of the cervical canal CC and the vagina V. The detection unit <b>90</b> may detect fluorescence from a body surface outside a body in parallel with the emission of the near-infrared rays by the treatment apparatus <b>10</b> or after the emission of the near-infrared rays.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">When the operator inserts the treatment apparatus <b>10</b> into the vagina V or the cervical canal CC, the detection unit <b>90</b> may be used to check a length of insertion of the treatment apparatus <b>10</b>. For example, a position of the treatment apparatus <b>10</b> can be checked based on an image obtained from the CMOS image sensor or a change in the intensity or color of light obtained from the optical waveguide <b>91</b> such as an optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the inflation portion <b>30</b> may not include a portion substantially parallel to and being in contact with the vaginal wall between the proximal inflation portion <b>32</b> and the abutment surface <b>34</b>. An inner surface of the abutment surface <b>34</b> is coated with the scatterer coat <b>36</b>, and the proximal inflation portion <b>32</b> whose outer diameter gradually decreases toward the proximal side is coated with the reflector coat <b>39</b>. Accordingly, the light-emitting unit <b>52</b> emits light inside the inflation portion <b>30</b>, and the excitation light emitted from the inflation portion <b>30</b> is reflected and diffused only in the distal direction (a direction in which the external uterine ostium O and the uterine vagina UV are present with respect to the inflation portion <b>30</b>) and then emitted. Accordingly, the distal direction can be efficiently irradiated with light energy, and the treatment effect in the external uterine ostium O and the uterine vagina UV can be improved. The entire light-emitting unit <b>52</b> is preferably positioned within a range of a length of the inflation portion <b>30</b> in the axial center direction (a long axis direction). Accordingly, the light emitted from the light-emitting unit <b>52</b> can be input into the inflation portion <b>30</b> without waste.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The detailed description above describes embodiments of a treatment apparatus and a treatment method for cervical cancer and vaginal cancer.
