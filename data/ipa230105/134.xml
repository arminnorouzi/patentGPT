Aerosol-generating material may, for example, be in the form of a solid, liquid or gel which may or may not contain nicotine and/or flavorants. The aerosol-generating material comprises an &#x201c;amorphous solid&#x201d;, which may alternatively be referred to as a &#x201c;monolithic solid&#x201d; (i.e. non-fibrous). In some embodiments, the amorphous solid may be a dried gel. The amorphous solid is a solid material that may retain some fluid, such as liquid, within it. In some embodiments, the aerosol-generating material may for example comprise from about 50 wt %, 60 wt % or 70 wt % of amorphous solid, to about 90 wt %, 95 wt % or 100 wt % of amorphous solid. In some cases, the aerosol generating material consists of amorphous solid.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">As described hereinabove, the invention provides an aerosol-generating material comprising an amorphous solid, wherein the amorphous solid comprises:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0029">1-60 wt % of a gelling agent; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0030">5-80 wt % of an aerosol-former material; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0031">10-60 wt % of an active substance;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0027" num="0032">wherein these weights are calculated on a dry weight basis, and wherein the gelling agent comprises alginate and pectin, wherein a ratio of the alginate to the pectin is from 1:1 to 10:1. The ratio of alginate to pectin is expressed as a dry weight ratio (w/w).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0033">The inventors have established that providing a gelling agent comprising alginate and pectin in such ratios may provide an improved substrate. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that a combination of alginate and pectin may have a synergistic effect on the binding in the amorphous solid. Further, combining alginate and pectin in particular ratios may influence the temperature at which an active substance is released from the amorphous solid when heated and/or the point in a session of use at which the active substance is released</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">Providing a gelling agent which comprises more alginate than pectin may be advantageous due to lower material costs. However, a gelling agent comprising alginate alone may have a high viscosity, meaning that it is difficult to process the gelling agent during the manufacture of the substrate. The inventors have identified that, by combining alginate with pectin, and particularly by combining alginate with pectin wherein pectin is present as a minority portion, the viscosity of the gelling agent may be easier to process during the manufacture of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">The ratio of the alginate to the pectin is from 1:1 to 10:1. In some embodiments, the ratio of the alginate to the pectin is &#x3e;1:1. That is, in some embodiments, the alginate is present in an amount greater than the amount of pectin. In some embodiments, the ratio of alginate to pectin is from 2:1 to 8:1, or 3:1 to 8:1, or 3:1 to 6:1, or is approximately 4:1. In some embodiments, the ratio of alginate to pectin is from 5:1 to 7:1.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">In some embodiments, the alginate is comprised in the gelling agent in an amount of from 15-40 wt % of the amorphous solid. That is, the amorphous solid comprises alginate in an amount of 15-40 wt % by dry weight of the amorphous solid. In some embodiments, the amorphous solid comprises alginate in an amount of from 10-35 wt %, or 15 wt % to 30 wt %.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037">In some embodiments, the pectin is comprised in the gelling agent in an amount of from 3-10 wt % of the amorphous solid. That is, the amorphous solid comprises pectin in an amount of 3-10 wt % by dry weight of the amorphous solid. In some embodiments, the amorphous solid comprises pectin in an amount of from 3-8 wt %, or 4 wt % to 6 wt %.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">Suitably, the amorphous solid may comprise from about 1 wt %, 5 wt %, 10 wt %, 15 wt %, 20 wt % or 25 wt % to about 60 wt %, 50 wt %, 45 wt %, 40 wt %, 35 wt %, 30 wt % or 27 wt % of gelling agent (all calculated on a dry weight basis). For example, the amorphous solid may comprise 1-50 wt %, 5-40 wt %, or 25-35 wt % of a gelling agent.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">In some embodiments, the gelling agent further comprises a hydrocolloid other than those mentioned above. In some embodiments, the gelling agent further comprises one or more compounds selected from the group comprising starches (and derivatives), celluloses (and derivatives, such as such as methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)), gums, silica or silicones compounds, clays, polyvinyl alcohol and combinations thereof. For example, in some embodiments, the gelling agent further comprises one or more of hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, pullulan, xanthan gum, guar gum, carrageenan, agarose, acacia gum, fumed silica, PDMS, sodium silicate, kaolin and polyvinyl alcohol.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">The gelling agent may further comprise one or more compounds selected from cellulosic gelling agents, non-cellulosic gelling agents, guar gum, acacia gum and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">In some embodiments, the cellulosic gelling agent is selected from the group consisting of: hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">In some embodiments, the gelling agent further comprises one or more of hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), carboxymethylcellulose, guar gum, or acacia gum.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">In some embodiments, the gelling agent further comprises one or more non-cellulosic gelling agents, including, but not limited to, agar, xanthan gum, gum Arabic, guar gum, locust bean gum, carrageenan, starch, and combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments, the non-cellulose based gelling agent further comprises agar.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0044">The aerosol-generating material may comprise one or more active substances, one or more aerosol-former materials and optionally one or more other functional constituents. In some cases, the amorphous solid may comprise from about 1 wt %, 5 wt %, 10 wt %, 15 wt %, 20 wt % or 25 wt % to about 70 wt %, 50 wt %, 45 wt % or 40 wt % (calculated on a dry weight basis) of active substance.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0045">In particular embodiments, the amorphous solid comprises 10-60 wt %, 40-60 wt % or 45-55 wt % of active substance. In these embodiments, the active substance may consist essentially of menthol, or comprise menthol in an amount of at least 90% by weight of the active substance, or of at least 95 wt % by weight of the active substance.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0046">The active substance may comprise a physiologically and/or olfactory active substance which is included in the aerosol-generating material in order to achieve a physiological and/or olfactory response. The active substance may for example be selected from nutraceuticals, nootropics, and psychoactives. The active substance may be naturally occurring or synthetically obtained. The active substance may comprise for example nicotine, caffeine, taurine, theine, a vitamin such as B6 or B12 or C, melatonin, a cannabinoid, or a constituent, derivative, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the active substance comprises nicotine. In some embodiments, the active substance comprises caffeine, melatonin or vitamin B12. The active substance may comprise a constituent, derivative or extract of tobacco or of another botanical such as cannabis, such as a cannabinoid or terpene. In some embodiments, the active substance is a physiologically active substance and may be selected from nicotine, nicotine salts (e.g. nicotine ditartrate/nicotine bitartrate), nicotine-free tobacco substitutes, other alkaloids such as caffeine, cannabinoids, or mixtures thereof. Cannabinoids are a class of natural or synthetic chemical compounds which act on cannabinoid receptors (i.e., CB1 and CB2) in cells that repress neurotransmitter release in the brain. Two of the most important cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabinoids may be naturally occurring (Phytocannabinoids) from plants such as cannabis, (endocannabinoids) from animals, or artificially manufactured (Synthetic cannabinoids).

The addition of a colorant may alter the visual appearance of the amorphous solid. The presence of colorant in the amorphous solid may enhance the visual appearance of the amorphous solid and the aerosol-generating material. By adding a colorant to the amorphous solid, the amorphous solid may be color-matched to other components of the aerosol-generating material or to other components of an article comprising the amorphous solid.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0071">A variety of colorants may be used depending on the desired color of the amorphous solid. The color of amorphous solid may be, for example, white, green, red, purple, blue, brown or black. Other colors are also envisaged. Natural or synthetic colorants, such as natural or synthetic dyes, food-grade colorants and pharmaceutical-grade colorants may be used. In certain embodiments, the colorant is caramel, which may confer the amorphous solid with a brown appearance. In such embodiments, the color of the amorphous solid may be similar to the color of other components (such as tobacco material) in an aerosol-generating material comprising the amorphous solid. In some embodiments, the addition of a colorant to the amorphous solid renders it visually indistinguishable from other components in the aerosol-generating material.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0072">The colorant may be incorporated during the formation of the amorphous solid (e.g. when forming a slurry comprising the materials that form the amorphous solid) or it may be applied to the amorphous solid after its formation (e.g. by spraying it onto the amorphous solid).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0073">The aerosolizable or non-aerosol-generating material may be present on or in a support to form a substrate. The support functions as a support on which the amorphous solid layer forms, easing manufacture. The support may provide rigidity to the amorphous solid layer, easing handling.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0074">The support may be any suitable material which can be used to support an amorphous solid. In some cases, the support may be formed from materials selected from metal foil, paper, carbon paper, greaseproof paper, ceramic, carbon allotropes such as graphite and graphene, plastic, cardboard, wood or combinations thereof. In some cases, the support may comprise or consist of a tobacco material, such as a sheet of reconstituted tobacco. In some cases, the support may be formed from materials selected from metal foil, paper, cardboard, wood or combinations thereof. In some cases, the support comprises paper. In some cases, the support itself be a laminate structure comprising layers of materials selected from the preceding lists. In some cases, the support may also function as a flavor support. For example, the support may be impregnated with a flavorant or with tobacco extract.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0075">Suitably, the thickness of the support layer may be in the range of about 10 &#x3bc;m, 15 &#x3bc;m, 17 &#x3bc;m, 20 &#x3bc;m, 23 &#x3bc;m, 25 &#x3bc;m, 50 &#x3bc;m, 75 &#x3bc;m or 0.1 mm to about 2.5 mm, 2.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 1.0 mm or 0.5 mm. The support may comprise more than one layer, and the thickness described herein refers to the aggregate thickness of those layers.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0076">In some cases, the support may be magnetic. This functionality may be used to fasten the support to the assembly in use, or may be used to generate particular amorphous solid shapes. In some cases, the aerosol generating substrate may comprise one or more magnets which can be used to fasten the substrate to an induction heater in use.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0077">In some cases, the support may be substantially or wholly impermeable to gas and/or aerosol. This prevents aerosol or gas passage through the support layer, thereby controlling the flow and ensuring it is delivered to the user. This can also be used to prevent condensation or other deposition of the gas/aerosol in use on, for example, the surface of a heater provided in an aerosol generating assembly. Thus, consumption efficiency and hygiene can be improved in some cases.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0078">In some cases, the surface of the support that abuts the amorphous solid may be porous. For example, in one case, the support comprises paper. The inventors have found that a porous support such as paper is particularly suitable for the present invention; the porous (e.g. paper) layer abuts the amorphous solid layer and forms a strong bond. The amorphous solid is formed by drying a gel and, without being limited by theory, it is thought that the slurry from which the gel is formed partially impregnates the porous support (e.g. paper) so that when the gel sets and forms cross-links, the support is partially bound into the gel. This provides a strong binding between the gel and the support (and between the dried gel and the support).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0079">Additionally, surface roughness may contribute to the strength of bond between the amorphous material and the support. The inventors have found that the paper roughness (for the surface abutting the support) may suitably be in the range of 50-1000 Bekk seconds, suitably 50-150 Bekk seconds, suitably 100 Bekk seconds (measured over an air pressure interval of 50.66-48.00 kPa). (A Bekk smoothness tester is an instrument used to determine the smoothness of a paper surface, in which air at a specified pressure is leaked between a smooth glass surface and a paper sample, and the time (in seconds) for a fixed volume of air to seep between these surfaces is the &#x201c;Bekk smoothness&#x201d;.)</p><p id="p-0072" num="0080">Conversely, the surface of the support facing away from the amorphous solid may be arranged in contact with the heater, and a smoother surface may provide more efficient heat transfer. Thus, in some cases, the support is disposed so as to have a rougher side abutting the amorphous material and a smoother side facing away from the amorphous material.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0081">In one particular case, the support may be a paper-backed foil; the paper layer abuts the amorphous solid layer and the properties discussed in the previous paragraphs are afforded by this abutment. The foil backing is substantially impermeable, providing control of the aerosol flow path. A metal foil backing may also serve to conduct heat to the amorphous solid.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0082">In another case, the foil layer of the paper-backed foil abuts the amorphous solid. The foil is substantially impermeable, thereby preventing water provided in the amorphous solid to be absorbed into the paper which could weaken its structural integrity.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0083">In some cases, the support is formed from or comprises metal foil, such as aluminium foil. A metallic support may allow for better conduction of thermal energy to the amorphous solid. Additionally, or alternatively, a metal foil may function as a susceptor in an induction heating system. In particular embodiments, the support comprises a metal foil layer and a support layer, such as cardboard. In these embodiments, the metal foil layer may have a thickness of less than 20 &#x3bc;m, such as from about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 10 &#x3bc;m, suitably about 5 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0084">In some cases, the support may have a thickness of between about 0.017 mm and about 2.0 mm, suitably from about 0.02 mm, 0.05 mm or 0.1 mm to about 1.5 mm, 1.0 mm, or 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0085">In some cases, the aerosol generating substrate may comprise embedded heating means, such as resistive or inductive heating elements. For example, the heating means may be embedded in the amorphous solid.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0086">The amorphous solid may be made from a gel, and this gel may additionally comprise a solvent, included at 0.1-50 wt %. However, the inventors have established that the inclusion of a solvent in which the flavor is soluble may reduce the gel stability and the flavor may crystallise out of the gel. As such, in some cases, the gel does not include a solvent in which the flavor is soluble.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0087">In some embodiments, the amorphous solid comprises less than 60 wt % of a filler, such as from 1 wt % to 60 wt %, or 5 wt % to 50 wt %, or 5 wt % to 30 wt %, or 10 wt % to 20 wt %.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0088">In other embodiments, the amorphous solid comprises less than 20 wt %, suitably less than 10 wt % or less than 5 wt % of a filler. In some cases, the amorphous solid comprises less than 1 wt % of a filler, and in some cases, comprises no filler.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0089">An aspect of the present invention relates to an article. A consumable is an article, part or all of which is intended to be consumed during use by a user. A consumable may comprise or consist of aerosol-generating material. A consumable may comprise one or more other elements, such as a filter or an aerosol modifying substance. A consumable may comprise a heating element that emits heat to cause the aerosol-generating material to generate aerosol in use. The heating element may, for example, comprise combustible material, or may comprise a susceptor that is heatable by penetration with a varying magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0090">Articles of the present invention may be provided in any suitable shape. In some examples, the article is provided as a rod (e.g. substantially cylindrical). An article provided as a rod may include the aerosol-generating material as a shredded sheet, optionally blended with cut tobacco. Alternatively, or additionally, the article provided as a rod may include the aerosol-generating material as a sheet, such as a sheet circumscribing a rod of aerosol-generating material (e.g. tobacco). In some embodiments, the article comprises a layer portion of aerosol-generating material disposed on a carrier. In examples, the article may have at least one substantially planar (flat) surface.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0091">A susceptor is material that is heatable by penetration with a varying magnetic field, such as an alternating magnetic field. The heating material may be an electrically-conductive material, so that penetration thereof with a varying magnetic field causes induction heating of the heating material. The heating material may be magnetic material, so that penetration thereof with a varying magnetic field causes magnetic hysteresis heating of the heating material. The heating material may be both electrically-conductive and magnetic, so that the heating material is heatable by both heating mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0092">Induction heating is a process in which an electrically-conductive object is heated by penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field. The process is described by Faraday's law of induction and Ohm's law. An induction heater may comprise an electromagnet and a device for passing a varying electrical current, such as an alternating current, through the electromagnet. When the electromagnet and the object to be heated are suitably relatively positioned so that the resultant varying magnetic field produced by the electromagnet penetrates the object, one or more eddy currents are generated inside the object. The object has a resistance to the flow of electrical currents. Therefore, when such eddy currents are generated in the object, their flow against the electrical resistance of the object causes the object to be heated. This process is called Joule, ohmic, or resistive heating.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0093">In some embodiments, the susceptor is in the form of a closed circuit. It has been found that, when the susceptor is in the form of a closed circuit, magnetic coupling between the susceptor and the electromagnet in use is enhanced, which results in greater or improved Joule heating.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0094">Magnetic hysteresis heating is a process in which an object made of a magnetic material is heated by penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field. A magnetic material can be considered to comprise many atomic-scale magnets, or magnetic dipoles. When a magnetic field penetrates such material, the magnetic dipoles align with the magnetic field. Therefore, when a varying magnetic field, such as an alternating magnetic field, for example as produced by an electromagnet, penetrates the magnetic material, the orientation of the magnetic dipoles changes with the varying applied magnetic field. Such magnetic dipole reorientation causes heat to be generated in the magnetic material.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0095">When an object is both electrically-conductive and magnetic, penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field can cause both Joule heating and magnetic hysteresis heating in the object. Moreover, the use of magnetic material can strengthen the magnetic field, which can intensify the Joule heating.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0096">In each of the above processes, as heat is generated inside the object itself, rather than by an external heat source by heat conduction, a rapid temperature rise in the object and more uniform heat distribution can be achieved, particularly through selection of suitable object material and geometry, and suitable varying magnetic field magnitude and orientation relative to the object. Moreover, as induction heating and magnetic hysteresis heating do not require a physical connection to be provided between the source of the varying magnetic field and the object, design freedom and control over the heating profile may be greater, and cost may be lower.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0097">The filler, if present, may comprise one or more inorganic filler materials, such as calcium carbonate, perlite, vermiculite, diatomaceous earth, colloidal silica, magnesium oxide, magnesium sulphate, magnesium carbonate, and suitable inorganic sorbents, such as molecular sieves. The filler may comprise one or more organic filler materials such as wood pulp, cellulose and cellulose derivatives. In some cases, the amorphous solid does not comprise any inorganic filler materials. In particular cases, the amorphous solid comprises no calcium carbonate such as chalk.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0098">In some cases, the aerosol-generating material does not comprise any inorganic filler materials. In particular cases, the aerosol-generating material does not comprise calcium carbonate such as chalk.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0099">In particular embodiments which include filler, the filler is fibrous. For example, the filler may be a fibrous organic filler material such as wood pulp, hemp fiber, cellulose or cellulose derivatives. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that including fibrous filler in an amorphous solid may increase the tensile strength of the material. This may be particularly advantageous in examples wherein the amorphous solid is provided as a sheet, such as when an amorphous solid sheet circumscribes a rod of aerosol-generating material.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0100">In some embodiments, the amorphous solid does not comprise tobacco fibers. In particular embodiments, the amorphous solid does not comprise fibrous material.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0101">In some embodiments, the aerosol generating material does not comprise tobacco fibers.

A non-combustible aerosol provision system may also be referred to as an aerosol generating assembly. A non-combustible aerosol provision device may be referred to as an aerosol generating apparatus.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0107">The heater may comprise one or more electrically resistive heaters, including for example one or more nichrome resistive heater(s) and/or one or more ceramic heater(s).

In some cases in use, substantially all of the amorphous solid is less than about 4 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm or 1 mm from the heater. In some cases, the solid is disposed between about 0.010 mm and 2.0 mm from the heater, suitably between about 0.02 mm and 1.0 mm, suitably 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm. These minimum distances may, in some cases, reflect the thickness of a support that supports the amorphous solid. In some cases, a surface of the amorphous solid may directly abut the heater.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0109">The heater is configured to heat not burn the aerosol-generating article, and thus the aerosol-generating material.

That is, it may contain a solid tobacco-containing material (and no liquid aerosol-generating material). In some cases, the amorphous solid may comprise the tobacco material. A heat-not-burn device is disclosed in WO 2015/062983 A2, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0112">In some cases, the aerosol generating assembly may be an electronic tobacco hybrid device.

In some cases, the amorphous solid may comprise a tobacco material. In some cases, the amorphous solid may comprise a tobacco material and a separate nicotine source. The separate aerosol-generating materials may be heated by separate heaters, the same heater or, in one case, a downstream aerosol-generating material may be heated by a hot aerosol which is generated from the upstream aerosol-generating material. An electronic tobacco hybrid device is disclosed in WO 2016/135331 A1, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0113">The aerosol-generating article (which may be referred to herein as an article, a cartridge or a consumable) may be adapted for use in a THP, an electronic tobacco hybrid device or another aerosol generating device. In some cases, the article may additionally comprise a filter and/or cooling element (which have been described above). In some cases, the aerosol-generating article may be circumscribed by a wrapping material such as paper.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0114">The aerosol-generating article may additionally comprise ventilation apertures. These may be provided in the sidewall of the article. In some cases, the ventilation apertures may be provided in the filter and/or cooling element. These apertures may allow cool air to be drawn into the article during use, which can mix with the heated volatilized components thereby cooling the aerosol.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0115">The ventilation enhances the generation of visible heated volatilized components from the article when it is heated in use. The heated volatilized components are made visible by the process of cooling the heated volatilized components such that supersaturation of the heated volatilized components occurs. The heated volatilized components then undergo droplet formation, otherwise known as nucleation, and eventually the size of the aerosol particles of the heated volatilized components increases by further condensation of the heated volatilized components and by coagulation of newly formed droplets from the heated volatilized components.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0116">In some cases, the ratio of the cool air to the sum of the heated volatilized components and the cool air, known as the ventilation ratio, is at least 15%. A ventilation ratio of 15% enables the heated volatilized components to be made visible by the method described above. The visibility of the heated volatilized components enables the user to identify that the volatilized components have been generated and adds to the sensory experience of the smoking experience.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0117">In another example, the ventilation ratio is between 50% and 85% to provide additional cooling to the heated volatilized components. In some cases, the ventilation ratio may be at least 60% or 65%.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0118">In some cases, the aerosol generating material may be included in the article/assembly in sheet form. In some cases, the aerosol generating material may be included as a planar sheet. In some cases, the aerosol generating material may be included as a planar sheet, as a bunched or gathered sheet, as a crimped sheet, or as a rolled sheet (i.e. in the form of a tube). In some such cases, the amorphous solid of these embodiments may be included in an aerosol-generating article/assembly as a sheet, such as a sheet circumscribing a rod of aerosol-generating material (e.g. tobacco). In some other cases, the aerosol generating material may be formed as a sheet and then shredded and incorporated into the article. In some cases, the shredded sheet may be mixed with cut rag tobacco and incorporated into the article.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0119">In some examples, the amorphous solid in sheet form may have a tensile strength of from around 200 N/m to around 900 N/m.

Such tensile strengths may be particularly suitable for embodiments wherein the aerosol generating material is formed as a sheet and then shredded and incorporated into an aerosol-generating article. In some examples, such as where the amorphous solid comprises a filler, the amorphous solid may have a tensile strength of from 600 N/m to 900 N/m, or from 700 N/m to 900 N/m, or around 800 N/m. Such tensile strengths may be particularly suitable for embodiments wherein the aerosol generating material is included in an aerosol-generating article/assembly as a rolled sheet, suitably in the form of a tube.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0120">The assembly may comprise an integrated aerosol-generating article and heater, or may comprise a heater device into which the article is inserted in use.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0121">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, there are shown a partially cut-away section view and a perspective view of an example of an aerosol-generating article <b>101</b>.

The aerosol generating material comprises the amorphous solid material described herein. In some embodiments, it may be included in sheet form. In some embodiments it may be included in the form of a shredded sheet. In some embodiments, the aerosol generating material described herein may be incorporated in sheet form and in shredded form.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0123">The filter assembly <b>105</b> includes three segments, a cooling segment <b>107</b>, a filter segment <b>109</b> and a mouth end segment <b>111</b>. The article <b>101</b> has a first end <b>113</b>, also known as a mouth end or a proximal end and a second end <b>115</b>, also known as a distal end. The body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> is located towards the distal end <b>115</b> of the article <b>101</b>. In one example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is located adjacent the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> between the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>, such that the cooling segment <b>107</b> is in an abutting relationship with the aerosol generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>103</b>. In other examples, there may be a separation between the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> and the cooling segment <b>107</b> and between the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>. The filter segment <b>109</b> is located in between the cooling segment <b>107</b> and the mouth end segment <b>111</b>. The mouth end segment <b>111</b> is located towards the proximal end <b>113</b> of the article <b>101</b>, adjacent the filter segment <b>109</b>. In one example, the filter segment <b>109</b> is in an abutting relationship with the mouth end segment <b>111</b>. In one embodiment, the total length of the filter assembly <b>105</b> is between 37 mm and 45 mm, more preferably, the total length of the filter assembly <b>105</b> is 41 mm.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0124">In one example, the rod of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> is between 34 mm and 50 mm in length, suitably between 38 mm and 46 mm in length, suitably 42 mm in length.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0125">In one example, the total length of the article <b>101</b> is between 71 mm and 95 mm, suitably between 79 mm and 87 mm, suitably 83 mm.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0126">An axial end of the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> is visible at the distal end <b>115</b> of the article <b>101</b>. However, in other embodiments, the distal end <b>115</b> of the article <b>101</b> may comprise an end member (not shown) covering the axial end of the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0127">The body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> is joined to the filter assembly <b>105</b> by annular tipping paper (not shown), which is located substantially around the circumference of the filter assembly <b>105</b> to surround the filter assembly <b>105</b> and extends partially along the length of the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b>. In one example, the tipping paper is made of 58GSM standard tipping base paper. In one example the tipping paper has a length of between 42 mm and 50 mm, suitably of 46 mm.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0128">In one example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is an annular tube and is located around and defines an air gap within the cooling segment. The air gap provides a chamber for heated volatilized components generated from the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> to flow. The cooling segment <b>107</b> is hollow to provide a chamber for aerosol accumulation yet rigid enough to withstand axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the article <b>101</b> is in use during insertion into the device <b>51</b>. In one example, the thickness of the wall of the cooling segment <b>107</b> is approximately 0.29 mm.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0129">The cooling segment <b>107</b> provides a physical displacement between the aerosol generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>. The physical displacement provided by the cooling segment <b>107</b> will provide a thermal gradient across the length of the cooling segment <b>107</b>. In one example the cooling segment <b>107</b> is configured to provide a temperature differential of at least 40 degrees Celsius between a heated volatilized component entering a first end of the cooling segment <b>107</b> and a heated volatilized component exiting a second end of the cooling segment <b>107</b>. In one example the cooling segment <b>107</b> is configured to provide a temperature differential of at least 60 degrees Celsius between a heated volatilized component entering a first end of the cooling segment <b>107</b> and a heated volatilized component exiting a second end of the cooling segment <b>107</b>. This temperature differential across the length of the cooling element <b>107</b> protects the temperature sensitive filter segment <b>109</b> from the high temperatures of the aerosol generating material <b>103</b> when it is heated by the device <b>51</b>. If the physical displacement was not provided between the filter segment <b>109</b> and the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> and the heating elements of the device <b>51</b>, then the temperature sensitive filter segment may <b>109</b> become damaged in use, so it would not perform its required functions as effectively.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0130">In one example the length of the cooling segment <b>107</b> is at least 15 mm. In one example, the length of the cooling segment <b>107</b> is between 20 mm and 30 mm, more particularly 23 mm to 27 mm, more particularly 25 mm to 27 mm, suitably 25 mm.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0131">The cooling segment <b>107</b> is made of paper, which means that it is comprised of a material that does not generate compounds of concern, for example, toxic compounds when in use adjacent to the heater of the device <b>51</b>. In one example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is manufactured from a spirally wound paper tube which provides a hollow internal chamber yet maintains mechanical rigidity. Spirally wound paper tubes are able to meet the tight dimensional accuracy requirements of high-speed manufacturing processes with respect to tube length, outer diameter, roundness and straightness.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0132">In another example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is a recess created from stiff plug wrap or tipping paper. The stiff plug wrap or tipping paper is manufactured to have a rigidity that is sufficient to withstand the axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the article <b>101</b> is in use during insertion into the device <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0133">The filter segment <b>109</b> may be formed of any filter material sufficient to remove one or more volatilized compounds from heated volatilized components from the aerosol generating material. In one example the filter segment <b>109</b> is made of a mono-acetate material, such as cellulose acetate. The filter segment <b>109</b> provides cooling and irritation-reduction from the heated volatilized components without depleting the quantity of the heated volatilized components to an unsatisfactory level for a user.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0134">In some embodiments, a capsule (not illustrated) may be provided in filter segment <b>109</b>. It may be disposed substantially centrally in the filter segment <b>109</b>, both across the filter segment <b>109</b> diameter and along the filter segment <b>109</b> length. In other cases, it may be offset in one or more dimension. The capsule may in some cases, where present, contain a volatile component such as a flavorant or aerosol generating agent.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0135">The density of the cellulose acetate tow material of the filter segment <b>109</b> controls the pressure drop across the filter segment <b>109</b>, which in turn controls the draw resistance of the article <b>101</b>. Therefore the selection of the material of the filter segment <b>109</b> is important in controlling the resistance to draw of the article <b>101</b>. In addition, the filter segment performs a filtration function in the article <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0136">In one example, the filter segment <b>109</b> is made of a 8Y15 grade of filter tow material, which provides a filtration effect on the heated volatilized material, whilst also reducing the size of condensed aerosol droplets which result from the heated volatilized material.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0137">The presence of the filter segment <b>109</b> provides an insulating effect by providing further cooling to the heated volatilized components that exit the cooling segment <b>107</b>. This further cooling effect reduces the contact temperature of the user's lips on the surface of the filter segment <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0138">In one example, the filter segment <b>109</b> is between 6 mm to 10 mm in length, suitably 8 mm.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0139">The mouth end segment <b>111</b> is an annular tube and is located around and defines an air gap within the mouth end segment <b>111</b>. The air gap provides a chamber for heated volatilized components that flow from the filter segment <b>109</b>. The mouth end segment <b>111</b> is hollow to provide a chamber for aerosol accumulation yet rigid enough to withstand axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the article is in use during insertion into the device <b>51</b>. In one example, the thickness of the wall of the mouth end segment <b>111</b> is approximately 0.29 mm. In one example, the length of the mouth end segment <b>111</b> is between 6 mm to 10 mm, suitably 8 mm.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0140">The mouth end segment <b>111</b> may be manufactured from a spirally wound paper tube which provides a hollow internal chamber yet maintains critical mechanical rigidity. Spirally wound paper tubes are able to meet the tight dimensional accuracy requirements of high-speed manufacturing processes with respect to tube length, outer diameter, roundness and straightness.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0141">The mouth end segment <b>111</b> provides the function of preventing any liquid condensate that accumulates at the exit of the filter segment <b>109</b> from coming into direct contact with a user.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0142">It should be appreciated that, in one example, the mouth end segment <b>111</b> and the cooling segment <b>107</b> may be formed of a single tube and the filter segment <b>109</b> is located within that tube separating the mouth end segment <b>111</b> and the cooling segment <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0143">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, there are shown a partially cut-away section and perspective views of an example of an article <b>301</b>.

In one example the ventilation region <b>317</b> takes the form of one or more ventilation holes <b>317</b> formed through the outer layer of the article <b>301</b>. The ventilation holes may be located in the cooling segment <b>307</b> to aid with the cooling of the article <b>301</b>.

In an example, the panels <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> are made of a plastics material, including for example glass-filled nylon formed by injection moulding, and the uni-body sleeve <b>11</b> is made of aluminium, though other materials and other manufacturing processes may be used.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0154">The top panel <b>17</b> of the device <b>51</b> has an opening <b>20</b> at the mouth end <b>53</b> of the device <b>51</b> through which, in use, the article <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> including the aerosol generating material may be inserted into the device <b>51</b> and removed from the device <b>51</b> by a user.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0155">The housing <b>59</b> has located or fixed therein a heater arrangement <b>23</b>, control circuitry <b>25</b> and a power source <b>27</b>. In this example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b>, the control circuitry <b>25</b> and the power source <b>27</b> are laterally adjacent (that is, adjacent when viewed from an end), with the control circuitry <b>25</b> being located generally between the heater arrangement <b>23</b> and the power source <b>27</b>, though other locations are possible.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0156">The control circuitry <b>25</b> may include a controller, such as a microprocessor arrangement, configured and arranged to control the heating of the aerosol generating material in the article <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> as discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0157">The power source <b>27</b> may be for example a battery, which may be a rechargeable battery or a non-rechargeable battery. Examples of suitable batteries include for example a lithium-ion battery, a nickel battery (such as a nickel&#x2014;cadmium battery), an alkaline battery and/or the like. The battery <b>27</b> is electrically coupled to the heater arrangement <b>23</b> to supply electrical power when required and under control of the control circuitry <b>25</b> to heat the aerosol generating material in the article (as discussed, to volatilize the aerosol generating material without causing the aerosol generating material to burn).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0158">An advantage of locating the power source <b>27</b> laterally adjacent to the heater arrangement <b>23</b> is that a physically large power source <b>25</b> may be used without causing the device <b>51</b> as a whole to be unduly lengthy. As will be understood, in general a physically large power source <b>25</b> has a higher capacity (that is, the total electrical energy that can be supplied, often measured in Amp-hours or the like) and thus the battery life for the device <b>51</b> can be longer.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0159">In one example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b> is generally in the form of a hollow cylindrical tube, having a hollow interior heating chamber <b>29</b> into which the article <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> comprising the aerosol generating material is inserted for heating in use. Different arrangements for the heater arrangement <b>23</b> are possible. For example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b> may comprise a single heating element or may be formed of plural heating elements aligned along the longitudinal axis of the heater arrangement <b>23</b>. The or each heating element may be annular or tubular, or at least part-annular or part-tubular around its circumference. In an example, the or each heating element may be a thin film heater. In another example, the or each heating element may be made of a ceramics material. Examples of suitable ceramics materials include alumina and aluminium nitride and silicon nitride ceramics, which may be laminated and sintered. Other heating arrangements are possible, including for example inductive heating, infrared heater elements, which heat by emitting infrared radiation, or resistive heating elements formed by for example a resistive electrical winding.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0160">In one particular example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b> is supported by a stainless steel support tube and comprises a polyimide heating element. The heater arrangement <b>23</b> is dimensioned so that substantially the whole of the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b>, <b>303</b> of the article <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> is inserted into the heater arrangement <b>23</b> when the article <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> is inserted into the device <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0161">The or each heating element may be arranged so that selected zones of the aerosol generating material can be independently heated, for example in turn (over time, as discussed above) or together (simultaneously) as desired.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0162">The heater arrangement <b>23</b> in this example is surrounded along at least part of its length by a thermal insulator <b>31</b>. The insulator <b>31</b> helps to reduce heat passing from the heater arrangement <b>23</b> to the exterior of the device <b>51</b>. This helps to keep down the power requirements for the heater arrangement <b>23</b> as it reduces heat losses generally. The insulator <b>31</b> also helps to keep the exterior of the device <b>51</b> cool during operation of the heater arrangement <b>23</b>.

The predetermined release temperature range may be selected to correspond to the temperature reached by the heater of the non-combustible aerosol provision system so that efficient/desirable release of active substance may be achieved.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0184">Other parameters may also affect the temperature at which the aerosol-generating material releases active substance. For example, a parameter of the active substance may affect the temperature release range, such as the volatility of the active substance.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0185">In examples, the method of producing an aerosol-generating material includes, before a), identifying the active substance to be included in the slurry, identifying a predetermined temperature to which the aerosol-generating material will be heated in a non-combustible aerosol provision device in use, determining the ratio of alginate to pectin to be included in the gelling agent based on the identified active substance and the identified predetermined temperature; and providing the gelling agent comprising alginate and pectin in the determined ratio. In this way, the release temperature range of the aerosol-generating material may be predetermined.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0186">In some embodiments, the predetermined temperature is less than or equal to 350&#xb0; C.

For example, the slurry may comprise sodium, potassium or ammonium alginate as a gel-precursor, and a setting agent comprising a calcium source (such as calcium chloride), may be added to the slurry to form a calcium alginate gel.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0189">In examples, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium acetate, calcium formate, calcium carbonate, calcium hydrogencarbonate, calcium chloride, calcium lactate, or a combination thereof. In some examples, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium formate and/or calcium lactate. In particular examples, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium formate. The inventors have identified that, typically, employing calcium formate as a setting agent results in an amorphous solid having a greater tensile strength and greater resistance to elongation.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0190">The total amount of the setting agent, such as a calcium source, may be 0.5-5 wt % (calculated on a dry weight basis). Suitably, the total amount may be from about 1 wt %, 2.5 wt % or 4 wt % to about 4.8 wt % or 4.5 wt %. The inventors have found that the addition of too little setting agent may result in an amorphous solid which does not stabilise the amorphous solid components and results in these components dropping out of the amorphous solid. The inventors have found that the addition of too much setting agent results in an amorphous solid that is very tacky and consequently has poor handleability.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0191">When the amorphous solid does not contain tobacco, a higher amount of setting agent may need to be applied. In some cases the total amount of setting agent may therefore be from 0.5-12 wt % such as 5-10 wt %, calculated on a dry weight basis. Suitably, the total amount may be from about 5 wt %, 6 wt % or 7 wt % to about 12 wt % or 10 wt %. In this case the amorphous solid will not generally contain any tobacco.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0192">Alginate salts are derivatives of alginic acid and are typically high molecular weight polymers (10-600 kDa). Alginic acid is a copolymer of &#x3b2;-D-mannuronic (M) and &#x3b1;-L-guluronic acid (G) units (blocks) linked together with (<b>1</b>,<b>4</b>)-glycosidic bonds to form a polysaccharide. On addition of calcium cations, the alginate crosslinks to form a gel. The inventors have determined that alginate salts with a high G monomer content more readily form a gel on addition of the calcium source. In some cases therefore, the gel-precursor may comprise an alginate salt in which at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60% or 70% of the monomer units in the alginate copolymer are &#x3b1;-L-guluronic acid (G) units.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0193">The drying (d) may, in some cases, remove from about 50 wt %, 60 wt %, 70 wt %, 80 wt % or 90 wt % to about 80 wt %, 90 wt % or 95 wt % (WWB) of water in the slurry.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0194">The drying (d) may, in some cases, may reduce the cast material thickness by at least 80%, suitably 85% or 87%. For instance, the slurry may be cast at a thickness of 2 mm, and the resulting dried amorphous solid material may have a thickness of 0.2 mm.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0195">The slurry itself may also form part of the invention. In some cases, the slurry solvent may consist essentially of or consist of water. In some cases, the slurry may comprise from about 50 wt %, 60 wt %, 70 wt %, 80 wt % or 90 wt % of solvent (WWB).</p><p id="p-0185" num="0196">In cases where the solvent consists of water, the dry weight content of the slurry may match the dry weight content of the amorphous solid.
