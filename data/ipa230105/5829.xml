As described above, the comparative example is such that the number of rows in the third rows and the number of rows in the fourth rows are equal to the number of rows in the first rows and the number of rows in the second rows. The remaining configurations are substantially the same as the configurations of the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0050">In both the present embodiment and the comparative example, the lower substrate <b>100</b> is thermally deformed at the time of reflow of the solder layers <b>22</b> or the like during manufacturing. After the solder layers <b>22</b> solidify, the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> is constrained by the upper substrate <b>200</b> through the bonding members <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0051">Further, the semiconductor device <b>300</b> also thermally deforms. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> is significantly less than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the lower substrate <b>100</b>. Because of this, the thermal deformation of semiconductor device <b>300</b> is significantly less than the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b>. The thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> is thus also constrained by the semiconductor device <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0052">In the comparative example, the number of rows in the third rows and the number of rows in the fourth rows are equal to the number of rows in the first rows and the number of rows in the second rows. As a result, the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> in the X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> direction and the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> in the Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b> direction are equally constrained by the upper substrate <b>200</b>. The fifth side <b>355</b> and the sixth side <b>356</b> of the semiconductor device <b>300</b> are longer than the seventh side <b>357</b> and the eighth side <b>358</b>. Because of this, the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> in the X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> direction is more constrained by the semiconductor device <b>300</b> than the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> in the Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b> direction. In the comparative example, thus, the lower substrate <b>100</b> is more easily thermally deformed in the X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> direction than in the Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b> direction. Consequently, large anisotropy can occur in the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> in the XY plane. The greater the anisotropy of thermal deformation is, the more likely warping and waving will occur in the semiconductor apparatus.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0053">In contrast, the present embodiment is configured such that the number of rows in the third row and the number of rows in the fourth row are less than the number of rows in the first rows and the number of rows in the second rows.

Similarly to the comparative example, the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> in the X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> direction is more constrained by the semiconductor device <b>300</b> than the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> in the Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b> direction. In the present embodiment, thus, the anisotropy of thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> is reduced by the constraint on the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> by the upper substrate <b>200</b> and the constraint on the thermal deformation of the lower substrate <b>100</b> by the semiconductor device <b>300</b>.

For example, the number of rows in the third row and the number of rows in the fourth row may be one, and the number of rows in the first rows and the number of rows in the second rows may be three. As another example, the number of rows in the third rows and the number of rows in the fourth rows may be two, and the number of rows in the first rows and the number of rows in the second rows may be three.
