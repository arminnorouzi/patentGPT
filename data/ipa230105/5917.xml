Although the exemplary implementations of the disclosure are shown in the accompanying drawings, it should be understood that the disclosure may be implemented in various forms and cannot be limited by specific implementations illustrated herein.

However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the disclosure may be implemented without one or more of these details. In other examples, in order to avoid confusion with the disclosure, some technical features known in the art are not described. That is, all the features of the actual embodiments are not described here, and the well-known functions and structures are not described in detail.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the accompanying drawings, the sizes and relative size of layers, regions, and elements may be exaggerated for clarity. The same reference numerals denote the same elements throughout the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It should be understood that when an element or layer is described as being &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;adjacent to&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, adjacent to, connected to, or coupled to the other element or layer, or there can be an intermediate element or layer. In contrast, when an element is described as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d;, &#x201c;directly adjacent to&#x201d;, &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there is no the intermediate element or layer.

These terms are used merely to distinguish an element, component, region, layer or portion from another element, component, region, layer or portion. Therefore, a first element, component, region, layer, or portion discussed below may be described as a second element, component, region, layer or portion without departing from the teachings of the disclosure.

It should be understood that, in addition to the orientations shown in the figures, the spatial relation terms are intended to include the different orientations of devices in use and operation. For example, if the devices in the figures are turned over, then the element or the feature described as &#x201c;under&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; or &#x201c;below&#x201d; another element or feature would then be oriented as &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other element or feature. Therefore, the exemplary terms &#x201c;under&#x201d; and &#x201c;below&#x201d; may include both orientations of above and below.
