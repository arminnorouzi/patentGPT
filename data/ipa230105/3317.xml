The invention also relates to methods for use in connection with such a valve.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fluid distribution systems, for e.g. heating, cooling and water supply are designed to feed a fluid from a source to a consumption point. Each consumption point typically has a calculated and designed flow or differential pressure requirement. However, depending on the type of hydronic system, the flow requirement is often variable over time and can change with factors like seasonality (e.g. summer or winter), that changes the load from the consumption points, temperature changes of the system fluid, changes in consumption of the system fluid (e.g. for drinking water).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Control valves, balancing valves, and combined control and balancing valves are frequently used in fluid distribution systems and have a variable opening such that the flow rates can be controlled. Hereby, the flow fed to the consumption point may be varied in an effective manner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A valve typically controls the flow by a flow adjustment arrangement, the flow adjustment arrangement comprising an adjustment member, such as a valve plug, and a mating or receiving portion, such as a valve seat arranged to mate with or receive the adjustment member. In other examples, the valve may be a ball valve in which the adjustment member is shaped as a ball which is arranged to rotated and shift its position relative to the receiving portion, and thereby change the opening degree of the flow adjustment arrangement.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A fluid flow through the valve, and the flow adjustment arrangement, will be subject to a pressure drop. Thus, the fluid upstream of the flow adjustment arrangement will be at an upstream pressure, and fluid downstream of the flow adjustment arrangement will be at a downstream pressure. Such pressure drop is typically of interest for controlling the flow, and in the long run the energy consumption of the fluid distribution system in which the valve is arranged. Thus, valves may be equipped with measuring nipples providing fluid paths to fluid at an upstream pressure and downstream pressure respectively. An operator may insert measuring devices into the measuring nipple, the measuring devices being connected to a portable differential pressure sensor, thereby allowing the operator to measure the pressure drop using the portable differential pressure sensor. However, this may be perceived as a cumbersome procedure requiring an operator to perform several manual steps. Recent development has presented an alternative which reduces or eliminates this manual handling of an operator and which completely eliminates the measuring nipples. Instead of an operator needing to access the flow by inserting measuring devices into measuring nipples, a differential pressure sensor may be installed already during manufacturing. Thus, the differential pressure sensor is an integrated part of the wall body, eliminating the need for an operator to manually access the fluid flow. However, although such an integrated differential pressure sensor provides an advantage over the manual portable sensor technology, it too has some drawbacks. The accuracy of pressure sensors may vary due to different factors, for example long term use.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is still a need in the industry to improve differential pressure measurements for a valve.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to alleviate the above-mentioned drawbacks of the existing valves. This and other objects, which will become apparent in the following, are accomplished by a valve and a method as defined in the accompanying claims.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present inventive concept is based on the insight that although a stationary differential pressure sensor may be provided to avoid the need for use of portable pressure sensors, the additional provision of manual access allows for the possibility to check if measurements provided by the stationary differential pressure sensor are accurate and/or to determine if the stationary differential pressure sensor should be calibrated/recalibrated. Thus, the inventor has realized that the combination of a stationary differential pressure sensor and a non-stationary differential pressure sensor allows for a trustworthy long term usage of a stationary differential pressure sensor, with only occasional (less frequently than traditional valves with measuring nipples) manual check-ups using a separate non-stationary differential pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a valve for adjusting a fluid flow. The valve comprises:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">a valve body,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">a flow path extending through the valve body, the flow path having an inlet and an outlet located downstream of the inlet, wherein the flow path is configured to guide a flowing liquid from the inlet to the outlet,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">a flow adjustment arrangement located in the valve body between the inlet and the outlet, for adjusting the flow of liquid from the inlet to the outlet,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0013">wherein liquid upstream of said flow adjustment arrangement but downstream of said inlet has an upstream pressure, and liquid downstream of said flow adjustment arrangement but upstream of said outlet has a downstream pressure,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0014">a stationary differential pressure sensor configured to measure a pressure difference between said upstream pressure and said downstream pressure, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0015">a pair of pressure ports for enabling temporary connection of a non-stationary differential pressure sensor for measuring the pressure difference between said upstream pressure and said downstream pressure.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0016">Thus, by having a stationary differential pressure sensor, a time efficient and effective measurements may be made without requiring any frequent manual measurements. A further advantage is that a stationary differential pressure sensor may allow for continuous measurement over time. However, by also providing a pair of pressure ports enabling connection of a non-stationary differential pressure sensor, a manual check may be made at rare occasions. For instance, at certain service intervals an operator may connect a portable differential pressure sensor and compare the measurement results acquired by such a sensor with the measurement results acquired by the stationary differential pressure sensor. If the results are considered to differ too much, then the operator may decide that the stationary differential pressure sensor should be recalibrated. For instance, a recalibration of the stationary differential pressure sensor may be made by changing the flow adjustment arrangement in such a way that the differential pressure changes. As the differential pressure changes, the stationary differential pressure sensor will be corrected to indicate the same result as the non-stationary differential pressure sensor. Suitably, comparisons between the two sensors may be made over a wider operating range, such as at different opening magnitudes of the flow adjustment arrangement. For instance, comparisons may be made when the flow adjustment arrangement is fully closed, fully opened and at one or more opening magnitudes in between fully closed and fully opened.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0017">It should be understood that the measurements of the pressure difference between the upstream pressure and the downstream pressure, may also be expressed as measurements of the differential pressure over the flow adjustment arrangement.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0018">Furthermore, it should be understood that although the pair of pressure ports provide access for an operator to measure the difference between the upstream pressure and the downstream pressure, the access points where the upstream pressure and the downstream pressure, respectively, are taken, do not need to be the same access points as the ones from which the stationary differential pressure sensor obtains its upstream pressure and downstream pressure. However, for increased accuracy of the comparisons of the measurement results, it may be desirable to lead liquid from the same point upstream of the flow adjustment arrangement to both the stationary differential pressure sensor and a temporarily connected non-stationary differential pressure sensor. Similarly, it may be desirable to lead liquid from the same point downstream of the flow adjustment arrangement to both the stationary differential pressure sensor and a temporarily connected non-stationary differential pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0019">The area of the flow path between the inlet and the flow adjustment arrangement may be referred to as the upstream side of the flow path, while the area of the flow path between the flow adjustment arrangement and the outlet may be referred to as the downstream side of the flow path.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0020">The flow adjustment arrangement may comprise an adjustment member configured to be movable in linear or translational motion. In other exemplary embodiments, the adjustment member may be movable in a rotational motion. In either case, flow adjustment arrangement may comprise a receiving or mating part for enabling receiving or mating with the adjustment member. In case of a linear or translational motion, the adjustment member may suitably be a valve plug attached to or integral with a valve stem, wherein the valve plug may be movable in an axial direction of the valve stem. Suitably, the receiving or mating part is a valve seat. The valve plug may be moved to mate with the valve seat so as to arrive at a closed position of the flow adjustment arrangement, whereby no flow or only a leakage flow passes through the flow adjustment arrangement. The valve plug may suitably be lifted from the valve seat to various opening amounts, so as to enable adjustment of the flow through the valve. The valve may, for instance, be a control valve for continuous regulation of the flow, or a balancing valve allowing the setting of a lift limitation of the valve plug, or a combination of balancing and control valve. This different options are possible irrespective of if the flow adjustment arrangement comprises a linearly movable adjustment member or a rotatingly movable adjustment member. Thus, for a rotatingly movable adjustment member (a ball valve), the angle of rotation of the adjustment member (e.g. in the form of a ball) may be limited for balancing purposes and/or a continuous regulation of the angle relative to an opening in a seat may be made for control purposes.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0021">The adjustment member may suitably be located downstream of the receiving or mating part. For instance, in the case of the adjustment member comprising a valve plug, then the valve plug and any attached valve stem may suitably be located downstream of the valve seat.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0022">According to at least one exemplary embodiment, said stationary differential pressure sensor has a first pressure sensing area in fluid communication with the first measuring channel, and a second pressure sensing area in fluid communication with the second measuring channel, wherein the first pressure sensing area senses said upstream pressure and the second sensing area senses said downstream pressure. By having two distinct sensing areas, liquid communication from the upstream and downstream side of the flow adjustment arrangement may simply be provided to the respective sensing area.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0023">The first sensing area and the second sensing area may suitably be located on opposite sides of the sensor, however other locations, such as on the same side, may also be conceivable.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0024">The stationary differential pressure sensor may suitably comprise a board, such as a printed circuit board, on which the sensing areas are provided. Signals from the sensing areas may suitably be communicated via connections on the board to a local control unit on the board for calculating the differential pressure. Alternatively, the signals may be communicated wired or wirelessly via a communication module to a separate control unit, such as a hand held control unit or a central control unit, which calculates the differential pressure. The board may suitably be moulded or mounted into a casing, such as a plastic casing. The board may be provided with connectors, for connecting hand held control units or wireless communication module. From the above, it should be understood that logic components for calculating the results of the measured pressure difference may either be provided locally at the stationary sensor or remotely. Likewise, the result may be presented, for example on a display, locally at the valve (such as via wired communication with the stationary sensor), or via an operatively connectable display (which may be connected physically by connectors or wirelessly).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0025">Thus, according to at least some exemplary embodiments, the valve comprises is a wireless communication module operatively connected or connectable to the stationary differential pressure sensor for wirelessly transmitting signals representative of the measurements performed by the stationary differential pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0026">The wireless communication module may be configured to establish an operational connection with a handheld device such as e.g. a laptop, a smart phone, a tablet, a PDA, etc. The wireless operational connection may be e.g. Bluetooth, ZigBee, or any other wireless RF technology.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0027">According to at least one exemplary embodiment, the stationary differential pressure sensor may comprise a temperature sensing component. Such a temperature sensing component may suitably be provided on the above-exemplified board, however other arrangements are conceivable. A temperature sensing component may be used for temperature compensation of the differential pressure measurements and/or for providing data to a user for knowing the temperature of the liquid.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0028">According to at least one exemplary embodiment, the pair of pressure ports comprises:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0029">a first pressure port for accessing a first measuring channel of the valve, the first measuring channel being in fluid communication with the flow path upstream of said flow adjustment arrangement but downstream of said inlet, and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0030">a second pressure port for accessing a second measuring channel of the valve, the second measuring channel being in fluid communication with the flow path downstream of said flow adjustment arrangement but upstream of said outlet.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0024" num="0031">By providing measuring channel a longer access area for a measuring device may be provided than just a direct opening into the flow path. Each measuring channel may suitably be provided with one or more seals which may be penetrated by a measuring device (such as a measuring needle) which may be inserted through the respective pressure port.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0032">According to at least one exemplary embodiment, the valve comprises a first measuring nipple and a second measuring nipple, wherein said first pressure port and said first measuring channel are provided in said first measuring nipple, wherein said second pressure port and said second measuring channel are provided in said second measuring nipple. Measuring nipple is advantageous in that it provides for a robust access point for measuring devices. The measuring nipples may suitably be formed in one piece with the valve body, or formed in two separate processes and then fixed to the valve body, such as by welding. The first and the second measuring nipples are suitably provided on the same side of the valve body. In at least some exemplary embodiments the first and the second measuring nipples are both provided on one side of the flow adjustment arrangement. In such case, one of the measuring nipples may suitably be in communication with a fluid conduit which leads past or around the flow adjustment arrangement. For instance, if the measuring nipples are provided at the upstream side of the flow adjustment arrangement, then the second measuring nipple may suitably be fluidly connected or connectable to a conduit which leads to the downstream side of the flow path. In other exemplary embodiments the first measuring nipple may be provided at the upstream side, while the second measuring nipple is provided at the downstream side, in which case conduits that bypass the flow adjustment arrangement are not needed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0033">According to at least one exemplary embodiment, the first measuring nipple has a first opening enabling liquid upstream of the flow adjustment arrangement to enter the first measuring channel and a second opening enabling the entered liquid to exit the first measuring nipple and come into contact with the first pressure sensing area. This is advantageous since the liquid that is guided from the upstream side to the first measuring channel is also guided to the first pressure sensing area of the stationary differential pressure sensor. Thus, liquid that has been bled from the upstream side of the flow path will exert the same pressure in the measuring channel as at the first pressure sensing area. Thus, since the liquid to the measuring channel and to the first sensing area is bled from the same access point at the upstream side of the flow path the pressure exerted on the first pressure sensing area of the stationary differential pressure sensor should be substantially the same as the pressure that would be detected by a measuring device inserted into the measuring channel. This enables a reliable check of the accuracy of the stationary differential pressure sensor, or at least the first pressure sensing area thereof. Similarly, a corresponding provision may be made for the second measuring nipple and the second pressure sensor area, which is reflected in the following exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0034">Thus, according to at least one exemplary embodiment, the second measuring nipple has a first opening enabling liquid downstream of the flow adjustment arrangement to enter the second measuring channel and a second opening enabling the entered liquid to exit the second measuring nipple and come into contact with the second pressure sensing area.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0035">According to at least one exemplary embodiment, the stationary differential pressure sensor is interposed between the first and the second measuring nipple. By providing the stationary differential pressure sensor at such a location, only a short fluid connection is needed from the first measuring nipple to the first pressure sensing area, and from the second measuring nipple and to the second pressure sensing area. Thus, a first interconnecting conduit may be provided between the first measuring nipple and the first pressure sensing area of the stationary differential pressure sensor. A second interconnecting conduit may be provided between the second measuring nipple and the second pressure sensing area of the stationary differential pressure sensor. Such interconnecting conduits may, in at least some exemplary embodiments, extend through the valve body. In other exemplary embodiments, the interconnecting conduits may extend outside of the valve body.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0036">According to at least one exemplary embodiment, at least a portion of each one of the first and second measuring nipples project away from the valve body, wherein the stationary differential pressure sensor is fixed in the valve body. Suitably, interconnecting conduits may extend through the valve body from the first and second pressure sensing areas of the stationary differential pressure sensor to the first and the second measuring nipples, respectively.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0037">According to at least one exemplary embodiment, at least a portion of each one of the first and second measuring nipples project away from the valve body, wherein the stationary differential pressure sensor is fixed to the projecting portions of the first and second measuring nipples. Suitably, interconnecting conduits may extend outside of the valve body from the first and second pressure sensing areas of the stationary differential pressure sensor to the first and the second measuring nipples, respectively.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0038">According to at least one exemplary embodiment, the stationary differential pressure sensor is integrated into said valve body. For, instance it may be arranged in a wall arranged in said valve body. Such a wall may have a cavity holding said stationary differential pressure sensor. A first aperture in the wall may provide a pressurized communication between the stationary differential pressure sensor and liquid at said upstream pressure, and a second aperture in the wall may provide a pressurized communication between the stationary differential pressure sensor and liquid at said downstream pressure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0039">In some exemplary embodiments, said wall may be a partition wall separating liquid at said upstream pressure from the liquid at said downstream pressure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0040">For example, the wall which together with the flow adjustment arrangement in a closed state (for example in the form of a valve plug sealing against a valve seat) fluidly separate said inlet from said outlet, may be referred to as a partition wall. However, a partition wall may in other exemplary embodiments be arranged elsewhere in the valve body where it separates fluid at the upstream and downstream pressure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0041">By having the stationary differential pressure sensor held in a cavity of said partition wall, the stationary differential pressure sensor can be placed physically close to the liquid both at the upstream side and the downstream side of the flow path, without requiring long conduits.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0042">The pressure difference between liquid at said upstream pressure and liquid at said downstream pressure may mainly corresponds to a liquid pressure drop over said flow adjustment arrangement.

The valve <b>2</b> comprises a valve body <b>4</b>. A flow path <b>10</b> extends through the valve body <b>4</b>, from an inlet <b>6</b> to and outlet <b>8</b>. The inlet <b>6</b> and the outlet <b>8</b> is shared by the valve <b>2</b> and the flow path <b>10</b>. The outlet <b>8</b> is located downstream of the inlet <b>6</b>, wherein the flow path <b>10</b> is configured to guide a flowing liquid from the inlet <b>6</b> to the outlet <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0070">At the inlet <b>6</b> and the outlet <b>8</b>, the valve body <b>4</b> is provided with internal threads <b>12</b> to which external threads of pipe sections of a fluid distribution system may be threaded. The valve <b>2</b> may suitably be used in a fluid distribution system such as in a building having a plurality of consumption points. The valve <b>2</b> may be a balancing valve for setting an appropriate flow at one of said consumption points. The flow may be adjusted by setting a flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> in a desired state. In this exemplary embodiment, the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> comprises an adjustment member in the form of a valve plug <b>22</b> and a receiving part in the form of a valve seat <b>24</b>. The flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> may be moved from a closed position, in which no flow or only a leakage flow passes through the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b>, to a fully opened position, or to any intermediate position between closed and fully opened. In the closed position, the valve plug <b>22</b> seals against the valve seat <b>24</b>. The valve plug <b>22</b> may be moved turning a handwheel <b>26</b> of the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b>, the rotation of which will be transferred into an axial movement of a valve stem <b>28</b> attached to the valve plug <b>22</b>. Thus, by rotating the handwheel <b>26</b> in one direction the valve plug <b>22</b> may be lifted away from the valve seat <b>24</b>, and rotating the handwheel <b>26</b> in the other direction will cause the valve plug <b>22</b> to move towards the valve seat <b>24</b>. In other exemplary embodiments, the handwheel <b>26</b> may be replaced by or complemented by an electronic actuator connected to the valve stem <b>28</b> for setting the position of the valve plug <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0071">The flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> is located in the valve body <b>4</b> between the inlet <b>6</b> and the outlet <b>8</b>, and will thus adjust the flow of liquid from the inlet <b>6</b> to the outlet <b>8</b>. Since the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> presents or may present a restriction, i.e. a reduced flow-through area for the liquid, when the liquid passes through the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> it will be subjected to a pressure drop. In other words, liquid upstream of the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> but downstream of the inlet <b>6</b> has an upstream pressure, which may be a relatively high pressure. This volume may also be referred to the upstream side <b>30</b> of the flow path <b>10</b>. Liquid downstream of the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> but upstream of the outlet <b>8</b> has a downstream pressure, which may be a relatively low pressure. This volume may also be referred to as the downstream side of the flow path <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0072">The valve <b>2</b> comprises a stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> configured to measure a pressure difference between the upstream pressure and the downstream pressure, i.e. between the pressure on the upstream side <b>30</b> and the downstream side <b>32</b>. The differential pressure across the valve adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> can be used for calculating the flow velocity through it, and thus the mass and volume flow along the flow path <b>10</b>. Therefore, the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> may be used to check the present flow through the valve <b>2</b>. Accordingly when setting an opening state of the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b>, in this case when setting the separating distance between the valve plug <b>22</b> and the valve seat <b>24</b> to obtain a desired flow through the valve <b>2</b>, the measurements performed by the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> may suitably be taken into account to confirm when a desired flow has been reached. The stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> may suitably communicate its information via wired or wireless communication to remote modules, cell phones, central control units, building management system, etc. or via connectors to connectable devices such as hand-held devices having displays and any appropriate processing circuitry for processing, storing, and/or forwarding, etc. the information received from the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b>. The stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> itself may be provided with a display for a direct reading of the flow and/or differential pressure. In exemplary embodiments, the differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> may comprise a temperature sensing component for measuring the temperature of the liquid. Such temperature measurements may be communicated or displayed similarly as described above with respect to the pressure measurements.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0073">It should be understood that the stationary differential pressure <b>40</b> forms part of the complete valve <b>2</b> as such. Thus, under normal conditions and normal use, it is not configured to be removable, but to remain in place as part of the valve installation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0074">Therefore, the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> is intended to be used almost every time a differential pressure measurement is to be taken, for example when checking the present flow through the valve <b>2</b> or when resetting the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> to achieve a different desired flow through the valve <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0075">However, at rare occasions it may be desirable to check if the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> is still accurate, or is in need of recalibration. Therefore, the valve <b>2</b> is also provided with a pair of pressure ports <b>52</b>, <b>62</b> for enabling temporary connection of a non-stationary differential pressure sensor (not shown) for measuring the pressure difference between said upstream pressure and said downstream pressure.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0076">The pressure ports <b>52</b>, <b>62</b> are here illustrated as entrances to measuring nipples <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> having a respective measuring channel <b>54</b>, <b>64</b>. The measuring nipples <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> project away from the valve body <b>4</b>. In other exemplary embodiment, the pressure ports may be arranged at a different structure, such as directly on the valve body <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0077">The pair of pressure ports comprises a first pressure port <b>52</b> and a second pressure port <b>62</b>. The first pressure port <b>52</b> is provided for accessing a first measuring channel <b>54</b> being in fluid communication with the flow path <b>10</b> upstream of the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> but downstream of the inlet <b>6</b> (i.e. in fluid communication with the upstream side <b>30</b>). The second pressure port <b>62</b> is provided for accessing a second measuring channel <b>64</b> in fluid communication with the flow path <b>10</b> downstream of the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> but upstream of the outlet <b>8</b> (i.e. in fluid communication with the downstream side <b>32</b>). The first pressure port <b>52</b> and the first measuring channel <b>54</b> are provided in a first measuring nipple <b>50</b>. The second pressure port <b>62</b> and the second measuring channel <b>64</b> are provided in a second measuring nipple <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0078">Suitably, there may be provided sealing members <b>56</b>, <b>66</b>, such as of rubber or other resilient material, which block liquid from exiting through the pressure ports <b>52</b>, <b>62</b>. Two measuring devices (not shown), one for each measuring nipple, may suitably be inserted through the respective pressure port <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> and caused to penetrate the sealing members <b>56</b>, <b>66</b> so that liquid can flow from the measuring channels <b>54</b>, <b>64</b> through the temporarily inserted measuring devices to a non-stationary differential pressure sensor in fluid communication with each measuring device. The measuring devices may for instance be in the form of hollow measuring needles.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0079">By comparing the measurement results of the non-stationary differential pressure sensor and the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b>, the accuracy of the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> may be checked, and/or the results may be used as a basis for calibrating the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b>. A corresponding procedure may be performed for an integrated temperature sensing component by checking its accuracy compared to a portable temperature measuring device temporarily inserted through one of the pressure ports, suitably the first pressure port <b>52</b> having the first measuring channel <b>54</b> debouching directly at the flow path <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0080">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first measuring channel <b>54</b> of the first measuring nipple <b>50</b> extends all the way to the flow path <b>10</b> at the upstream side <b>30</b>. The second measuring nipple <b>60</b>, however, is in this embodiment located on the same side of the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> as the first measuring nipple <b>50</b>. Therefore, the second measuring channel <b>64</b> is, via a bypass conduit <b>68</b> going past the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b>, in fluid communication with the flow path <b>10</b> at the downstream side <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0081">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> has a first pressure sensing area <b>42</b> in fluid communication with the first measuring channel <b>54</b>, and a second pressure sensing area <b>44</b> in fluid communication with the second measuring channel <b>64</b>, wherein the first pressure sensing area <b>42</b> senses said upstream pressure and the second pressure sensing area <b>44</b> senses said downstream pressure.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0082">Thus, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which is an enlarged view of a detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it can be seen that the first pressure sensing area <b>42</b> and the second pressure sensing area <b>44</b> are in fluid communication with the first measuring channel <b>54</b> and the second measuring channel <b>64</b>, respectively. More particularly, the first measuring nipple <b>50</b> has a first opening <b>57</b> enabling liquid upstream of the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> to enter the first measuring channel <b>54</b> and a second opening <b>59</b> enabling the entered liquid to exit the first measuring nipple <b>50</b> and come into contact with the first pressure sensing area <b>42</b>. Similarly, the second measuring nipple <b>60</b> has a first opening <b>67</b> enabling liquid downstream of the flow adjustment arrangement <b>20</b> to enter the second measuring channel <b>64</b> and a second opening <b>69</b> enabling the entered liquid to exit the second measuring nipple <b>60</b> and come into contact with the second pressure sensing area <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0083">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> is interposed between the first measuring nipple <b>50</b> and the second measuring nipple <b>60</b>. This is also the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which shows a cross-sectional view of a valve <b>102</b> according to at least a second exemplary embodiment of the invention, including an enlarged view of a detail of the valve <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0084">A difference between the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref> and the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, is that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>40</b> is fixed in/to the valve body <b>4</b>, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> the stationary differential pressure sensor <b>140</b> is not in contact with the valve body <b>104</b>, but is fixed to the first and second measuring nipples <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>. Of course, in other exemplary embodiments, the stationary differential pressure sensor may be fixed to the first and second measuring nipples as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, but also be in contact with and/or fixed to the valve body.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0085">As can be seen in all figures of the valve, at least a portion of each one of the first and second measuring nipples project away from the valve body.
