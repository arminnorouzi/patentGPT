id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to methods and devices for updating a stored configuration of a device in a wireless communications network.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">More specifically, this disclosure relates to issues relating to paging, and to monitoring of paging while a User Equipment (UE) is in an inactive state.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In wireless communications networks operating in accordance with the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) or New Radio (NR) standards, paging allows the network to reach UEs in RRC_IDLE and in RRC_INACTIVE state, and to notify UEs in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED state of system information changes and ETWS/CMAS indications. RRC refers to the Radio Resource Control protocol layer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In RRC_IDLE the UE monitors the paging channels for Core Network (CN)-initiated paging (e.g. with a CN paging identifier). In RRC_INACTIVE the UE monitors paging channels for Radio Access Network (RAN)-initiated paging, for example with a RAN paging identifier, such as the Inactive Radio Network Temporary Identifier (I-RNTI). A UE need not monitor paging channels continuously though; Paging Discontinuous Reception (DRX) is defined where the UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE is only required to monitor paging channels during one Paging Occasion (PO) per DRX cycle (as defined in TS 38.304). The Paging DRX cycles are configured by the network:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">For CN-initiated paging, a default cycle is broadcast in system information;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">For CN-initiated paging, a UE specific cycle can be configured via Non-access stratum (NAS) signalling;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">For RAN-initiated paging, a UE-specific cycle is configured via RRC signalling;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0008">The UE uses the shortest of the DRX cycles applicable i.e. a UE in RRC_IDLE uses the shortest of the first two cycles above, while a UE in RRC_INACTIVE uses the shortest of the three.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0006" num="0009">The POs of a UE for CN-initiated and RAN-initiated paging are based on the same UE Identifier (ID), resulting in overlapping POs for both states. The number of different POs in a DRX cycle is configurable via system information and a network may distribute UEs to those POs based on their IDs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">Paging is defined as an RRC message. It is transmitted in Radio Link Control-Service Access Point Transparent Mode (RLC-SAP TM) and over a Paging Control Channel (PCCH), whose lower layer configuration(s) are broadcast in system information.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">To receive paging messages from the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN), UEs in idle mode monitor the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) channel for a Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI) value used to indicate paging: the Paging Radio Network Temporary Identifier (P-RNTI) (see Section 9.2.2.2). The UE only needs to monitor the PDCCH channel at certain UE-specific occasions (i.e. at specific subframes within specific radio frames&#x2014;see Section 6.2 for an introduction to the LTE radio frame structure.). At other times, the UE may apply DRX, meaning that it can switch off its receiver to preserve battery power.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">Paging is transmitted as: a Downlink Control Information (DCI) on the common PDCCH addressed to a special identifier called the P-RNTI, allocating Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) resources for transmission of a Paging RRC message, containing a list of max 32 UE paging IDs. A UE has to decode the Paging RRC message to find out whether it is paged. Paging may be configured in multiple Bandwidth Parts (BWPs), but only the initial BWP is used for RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_IDLE UEs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">In RRC_IDLE, the UE monitors one PO in its DRX cycle (also known as its paging cycle). The DRX cycle is the smallest of a default DRX cycle configured in system information (SI) and a possible UE specific DRX cycle sent from the UE to the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) in the Registration NAS message. The UE monitors CN paging and SI update notifications. In RRC_INACTIVE, the UE monitors one PO in its DRX cycle, configured by the anchor base station (for example a gNB in NR) in the RRCRelease message. The RAN paging cycle can be shorter than the CN paging cycle, but every CN PO must coincide with a RAN PO. In RRC_CONNECTED the UE monitors any PO, but at least one during each SI modification period. The UE only monitors SI update notifications, i.e. it does not have to decode the PDSCH.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">When it comes to the exact transmission scheme of paging messages, some concepts exist in NR. A paging frame (PF) is defined as a frame with 1, 2 or 4 associated paging occasions (POs). The UE monitors one paging occasion (PO) per DRX cycle. A PO is a set of PDCCH monitoring occasions (MOs) and can consist of multiple time slots (e.g. subframes or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols) where paging DCI can be sent (TS 38.213). In multi-beam operations, the UE assumes that the same paging message is repeated in all transmitted beams and thus the selection of the beam(s) for the reception of the paging message is up to UE implementation. The paging message is same for both RAN initiated paging and CN initiated paging.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">The number of PDCCH monitoring occasions for each PO is equal to the number of Synchronisation Signal Blocks (SSBs) in the cell.

Or, if the network want to change the RNA configuration due to some re-configuration at the network side, addition of new nodes/cells, etc.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0223">As described above, the UE monitors paging occasions (POs) while in INACTIVE state. If network decides that the UE should resume a connection for some reason, e.g. if there is incoming data at the downlink that arrives at the last serving gNodeB (i.e., the gNodeB responsible for the latest cell the UE was suspended to RRC_INACTIVE), the gNodeB will try to page the UE. In the typical case, the last serving gNodeB, knowing the RAN Notification Area Configuration (RANAC) at the UE, knows where the UE may be.

The network could respond that resume request with i) an RRC Resume message, or ii) an RRC Release like message (with or without a suspend configuration), in the case it wants a 2-step procedure.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0226">In the case the network wants to update parts of the RRC configuration context, even if just for the sake of preparing the UE to use that later when attempting to resume again, or the next time it needs to transmit data (like in small data transmission), the network responds with an RRC Resume like message <b>1005</b>. Upon receiving that, the UE restores its AS context, processes the message, enters CONNECTED, and transmits an RRC Resume Complete like message <b>1006</b>. The network may then send an RRC Release message <b>1007</b>.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0227">Once the UE enters Connected state, the network could update the RRC configuration parts of the UE AS Inactive context i.e. the configurations the UE has been using when it was in Connected state, done by the RRC Resume like message (or even a subsequent RRC Reconfiguration, if network wants to).</p><p id="p-0220" num="0228"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows a procedure <b>1100</b> that may be performed in the case the network wants to update the Inactive parameters parts of the AS Inactive context. The procedure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in that the network implementation would first need to transmit a RAN paging message <b>1101</b> to the UE (e.g. in the UE's RAN configuration area), which would trigger the UE to initiate a resume procedure by performing random access <b>1102</b>, <b>1103</b>, and then transmitting an RRC Resume Request <b>1104</b>.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0229">In the case where the network wants to update the Inactive parameters parts of the AS Inactive context, it may respond the resume request with an RRC Release like message (e.g. RRCRelease with or without a suspend configuration) <b>1105</b>. Upon receiving the message, the UE restores its AS context, processes the message and updates whatever needs to be updated, and remains in INACTIVE, as shown below.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0230">However, these procedures involve unnecessary signalling for the use case in which the network needs to update the UE AS Inactive context, without the need to move the UE to Connected state e.g. to start a data transmission/reception or without the need to first try to resume the connection.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0223" num="0231">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method performed by a wireless device for updating a stored configuration.

Other objectives, features and advantages of the enclosed embodiments will be apparent from the following description.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0268">In this disclosure, it is assumed that the UE is monitoring paging while in Inactive state. However, the method is applicable for any power saving state (e.g. Idle, Inactive, etc.) where the UE may have a stored context and where the UE may be paged and resumed. What is referred to herein as a paging channel, or as a paging like channel, may be any channel monitored when the UE is in a power saving state, in defined occasions in the time domain.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0269">In the following disclosure, we mainly use the terminology and examples having 5G NR as the Radio Access Technology (RAT) where the UE is camping, monitoring paging and receives a paging message possibly containing an RRC Release or Reconfiguration like message. However, that should be considered as an example, so the invention is applicable to any RAT with similar procedures i.e. UE is camping on a cell of a RAT, monitoring paging channel of a RAT and responding to a paging message containing an RRC Release or Reconfiguration like message.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0270">In the following disclosure, we mainly use the intra-RAT case as an example, but the method is applicable for inter-RAT procedures where the UE is suspending in a first RAT (e.g. NR) and has a stored context on it. Then, the UE performs cell re-selection to another RAT (e.g. LTE) and camps in a cell of that other RAT, and monitors paging channel in that other RAT and possibly receives an RRC Release like message or RRC Reconfiguration like message in that other RAT.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0271">One aspect of the disclosure comprises a method at a wireless device (also called a wireless terminal or a User Equipment&#x2014;UE) for updating stored configurations of UEs in a power saving state the method comprising:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0272">monitoring a paging like channel while in a power saving state, for the possible reception of a message re-configuring the UE AS Inactive context (such as an RRC Release or RRC Reconfiguration like message e.g. RRCRelease or RRCReconfiguration as defined in the RRC specifications);</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0273">receiving a paging message and determining that it includes a PDCP PDU, and determining that this is a message re-configuring the UE AS Inactive context (such as an RRC Release like message or RRC Reconfiguration like message e.g. RRCRelease as defined in the RRC specifications or RRCReconfiguration as defined in the RRC specifications);</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0274">processing the PDCP PDU (e.g. releasePaging PDCP PDU) as an SRB1 message (i.e. RRCReleasePdcpPdu);</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0275">if after processing the PDCP PDU the UE detects an RRC Release like message (e.g. RRCRelease as defined in the RRC specifications), the UE perform the actions upon reception of an RRCRelease in paging.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0264" num="0276">If the RRC Release like message contains a suspend configuration, the UE remains in Inactive state; Else, if RRC Release like message does not contains a suspend configuration, the UE transitions to Idle and perform actions upon going to Idle.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0277">If after processing the PDCP PDU the UE detects an RRC Reconfiguration like message (e.g. RRCReconfiguration as defined in the RRC specifications), the UE updates parameters in the AS Inactive context, in particular the RRC configuration to be used in Connected state (e.g. Connected measConfig, etc.). In that case the UE remains in Inactive state.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0278">The method also comprises the UE acknowledging (ACK) the reconfiguration of the UE context via paging as described above. In other words, the UE ACKs the successful reception of the message and successful reconfiguration, so both the network and the UE have same understanding of the UE's current context/configuration and UE state. There may be different solutions regarding how that ACK may be defined (as described in more detail below).</p><p id="p-0267" num="0279">To acknowledge the updated configuration in case the UE receives an RRC Reconfiguration or RRC Release message with suspend configuration (or a proper transition to Idle in case RRC Release does not include a suspend configuration) the UE can (either by default or if ordered explicitly by the network) perform a Random Access procedure by transmitting a dedicated Random Access Preamble (bitstring) on the Random Access channel. The dedicated Random Access Preamble can part of the RRC message to the UE including the new UE configuration. When the network receives the dedication Random Access Preamble it can consider the re-configuration of the UE configuration successful. If the network does not receive the dedication Random Access Preamble it can based on implementation re-transmit the configuration message. Other methods for acknowledging the new configuration is also discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0280"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a signaling flow diagram illustrating the basic scheme in one situation in which the network sends the RRC Release like message.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0281">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a procedure in which the UE is in a power saving state, and the network wants to update the suspend configuration.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0282">At <b>1201</b>, the network sends a paging message with an RRC Release like message, with a suspend configuration.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0283">In response, at <b>1202</b>, the UE restores at least parts of its UE AS Inactive content, for example its suspend configuration; at <b>1203</b>, the UE applies RRCRelease; at <b>1204</b>, the UE performs actions upon receiving RRCRelease in paging; and, as shown at <b>1205</b>, the UE remains in the Inactive state.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0284">At <b>1206</b>, the UE sends a message that acts as an acknowledgement for the RRCRelease.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0285"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a signaling flow diagram illustrating the basic scheme in another situation in which the network sends the RRC Release like message.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0286">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a procedure in which the UE is in a power saving state, and the network wants to update the suspend configuration.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0287">At <b>1301</b>, the network sends a paging message with an RRC Release like message, without a suspend configuration.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0288">In response, at <b>1302</b>, the UE deletes at least parts of its UE AS Inactive content, for example its suspend configuration; at <b>1303</b>, the UE applies RRCRelease; at <b>1304</b>, the UE performs actions upon receiving RRCRelease in paging; and, as shown at <b>1305</b>, the UE transitions to the Idle state.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0289">At <b>1306</b>, the UE sends a message that acts as an acknowledgement for the RRCRelease.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0290"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a signaling flow diagram illustrating the basic scheme in a situation in which the network sends the RRC Reconfiguration like message.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0291">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a procedure in which the UE is in a power saving state, and the network wants to update the UE's RRC configuration to be used the next time that it is connected, or for uplink early data.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0292">At <b>1401</b>, the network sends a paging message with an RRC Reconfiguration like message.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0293">In response, at <b>1402</b>, the UE restores at least parts of its UE AS Inactive content, for example its RRC configuration; at <b>1403</b>, the UE applies RRCReconfiguration; at <b>1404</b>, the UE performs actions upon receiving RRCRelease in paging; and, as shown at <b>1405</b>, the UE remains in the inactive state.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0294">At <b>1406</b>, the UE sends a message that acts as an acknowledgement for the RRCReconfiguration</p><p id="p-0283" num="0295"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows the form of the configuration <b>1500</b> that is stored at an Inactive UE.

The disclosure also comprises an RRC Release message (with or without a suspend configuration) that may reconfigure the Inactive configurations in the UE AS Inactive context (e.g. any configuration the UE have received in RRC Release and further configurations e.g. security context. The disclosure also includes a mechanism for the UE to efficiently transmit an acknowledgement to the network that it has received the new configuration. In this way the reconfiguration can be used in robust way. The disclosure also includes a mechanism for the network and UE to encrypt/decrypt as well as integrity protect the reconfiguration messages ensuring privacy and preventing security attacks using fake messages.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0302">An alternative proposal is that the UE monitors a paging channel to receive an RRC Resume like message, so that the UE enters Connected, quickly receives DL data and possibly responds to it with UL data also quickly. In this disclosure, it is proposed that the UE monitors a paging channel to receive a reconfiguration message for the AS context, but without moving the UE to Connected. Another difference from that alternative proposal is that the type of message proposed to be transmitted in paging is different (so it is different its effect). In the current disclosure, the message may be equivalent to an RRC Release like message, in case the network wants to update the parts of the context related to Inactive parameters, or an RRC Reconfiguration like message, in case the network wants to update the parts of the context related to the RRC configuration to be later used in Connected state.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0303">Certain embodiments may provide one or more of the following technical advantages.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0304">Specifically, the procedure of updating the UE AS Inactive context without the need to transition the UE to Connected state reduces the amount of signaling exchanged between the UE and the network when the network wants to update the UE AS Inactive context or when the network wants to securely and robustly transition the UE from Inactive state to Idle, or when the network wants to re-configure the UE RRC configuration (to be used next time the UE tries to resume). The solution is secure since the re-configuration message is encrypted, and integrity protected. The solution is also robust (avoids mismatching configuration between UE and network) since the UE can acknowledge the new configuration by sending a dedicated Random Access Preamble to the network which was included in the configuration message.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0305">There could be different cases where the network may want to update, for example, the suspend configuration of an Inactive UE, such as:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0306">Network may want to re-assign the I-RNTI because it wants/needs to move the AS Inactive context location, hence, it would possibly require a change in some bits of the I-RNTI;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0307">Network may want to re-assign the I-RNTI because it wants/needs to add more UEs and reassign the number of bits in the I-RNTI with more bits for the UE component;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0308">Network may want to re-assign the I-RNTI because it wants/needs to add more nodes and reassign the number of bits in the I-RNTI with more bits for the node component;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0309">Network may want to update in the NCC;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0310">Network may want to update the RNA Configuration Area e.g. increase/decrease the area for a given UE due to at least one of the following use cases:</li>        <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0311">Changes in Xn setup such as:</li>        <li id="ul0008-0007" num="0312">new Xn is setup between nodes, hence possible to perform RAN paging within a new area;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0008" num="0313">removal Xn between nodes, e.g., because network needs to free some memory or due to some error;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0009" num="0314">New nodes being deployed;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0010" num="0315">Network may want to update timer T380 values;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0011" num="0316">One reason could be because network is close to expiry its own value and wants to renew the value before UE sends a RAN Area Update;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0012" num="0317">Network may want to change the UE state from INACTIVE to IDLE e.g. so it can free some context space on the network side.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0294" num="0318">The fact that the procedures described herein are secure allows the UE to make sure that a fake base station is not trying to transition the UE to Idle and making the UE to release its UE AS Inactive context.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0319">Another benefit is the possibility to leverage the fact that the UE may still be synchronized with a given cell when the network wants to reconfigure the UE, since at least some aspects of the disclosure do not require the UE to be UL synchronized with the network. That UL synchronization would otherwise be needed for the transmission of an RRC Resume Request like message, which would first require a random-access procedure. A side effect is also the additional round-trip delays caused by random access preamble transmission(s) attempt(s) and random access response (RARs). With the method disclosed herein, the UE receives the updated configuration in paging without performing random access. And, in case an ACK is to be transmitted, a preamble based solution can be defined (so that there is no need to UL sync).</p><p id="p-0296" num="0320">Detailed Description of UE Aspects of the Method The disclosure relates to a method at a wireless terminal (also called a User Equipment&#x2014;UE) for updating stored configurations of UEs in a power saving state the method comprising:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0321">Monitoring a paging like channel while in a power saving state, for the possible reception of a message re-configuring the UE AS Inactive context;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0322">where: the power saving state may be an RRC Inactive state, RRC Idle with a stored context, RRC Idle without a stored context;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0323">where: the paging like channel may be a paging channel monitored during DRX cycles according to the configuration depending on the UE power saving state and/or the provided configuration e.g. dedicated;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0324">where: the message re-configuring the UE AS Inactive context may be an RRC Release like message that re-configures UE Inactive state parameters.

That new message is introduced to acknowledge that the UE has applied the new configuration, so that any sort of state mismatch between UE and network is avoided (or an RRCReconfigurationComplete).

In the RAR the UE would also receive a temporary C-RNTI (that if the UE would have transition to Connected could have been upgraded to a C-RNTI after contention resolution).

That RACH resource may be a preamble and/or a time/frequency. The UE will then perform a Random Access procedure using the specific RACH resource and/or received Preamble. The Random Access procedure could be perform in the next available Random Access channel slot, or in a later slot. When the network receives the Random Access attempt using the configured RACH resource and/or preamble the network could consider the reconfiguration successful. The network could at this state also transmit a Random Access Response (RAR) message to the UE to acknowledge it has received the indication from the UE. If the UE does not receive the RAR it can re-initiate the Random Access procedure.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0449">In another solution in the third alternative, the UE receives a mapping between RACH resources and beams (e.g. SSB, CSI-RS) with/in the paging message (e.g. in the RRC Release like message transmitted with the paging).

A network node may also include one or more (or all) parts of a distributed radio base station such as centralized digital units and/or remote radio units (RRUs), sometimes referred to as Remote Radio Heads (RRHs). Such remote radio units may or may not be integrated with an antenna as an antenna integrated radio. Parts of a distributed radio base station may also be referred to as nodes in a distributed antenna system (DAS). Yet further examples of network nodes include multi-standard radio (MSR) equipment such as MSR BSs, network controllers such as radio network controllers (RNCs) or base station controllers (BSCs), base transceiver stations (BTSs), transmission points, transmission nodes, multi-cell/multicast coordination entities (MCEs), core network nodes (e.g., MSCs, MMEs), O&#x26;M nodes, OSS nodes, SON nodes, positioning nodes (e.g., E-SMLCs), and/or MDTs. As another example, a network node may be a virtual network node as described in more detail below. More generally, however, network nodes may represent any suitable device (or group of devices) capable, configured, arranged, and/or operable to enable and/or provide a wireless device with access to the wireless network or to provide some service to a wireless device that has accessed the wireless network.

In certain scenarios in which network node <b>1960</b> comprises multiple separate components (e.g., BTS and BSC components), one or more of the separate components may be shared among several network nodes.

Unless otherwise noted, the term WD may be used interchangeably herein with user equipment (UE). Communicating wirelessly may involve transmitting and/or receiving wireless signals using electromagnetic waves, radio waves, infrared waves, and/or other types of signals suitable for conveying information through air. In some embodiments, a WD may be configured to transmit and/or receive information without direct human interaction. For instance, a WD may be designed to transmit information to a network on a predetermined schedule, when triggered by an internal or external event, or in response to requests from the network. Examples of a WD include, but are not limited to, a smart phone, a mobile phone, a cell phone, a voice over IP (VoIP) phone, a wireless local loop phone, a desktop computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless cameras, a gaming console or device, a music storage device, a playback appliance, a wearable terminal device, a wireless endpoint, a mobile station, a tablet, a laptop, a laptop-embedded equipment (LEE), a laptop-mounted equipment (LME), a smart device, a wireless customer-premise equipment (CPE). a vehicle-mounted wireless terminal device, etc. A WD may support device-to-device (D2D) communication, for example by implementing a 3GPP standard for sidelink communication, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and may in this case be referred to as a D2D communication device. As yet another specific example, in an Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, a WD may represent a machine or other device that performs monitoring and/or measurements, and transmits the results of such monitoring and/or measurements to another WD and/or a network node. The WD may in this case be a machine-to-machine (M2M) device, which may in a 3GPP context be referred to as an MTC device. As one particular example, the WD may be a UE implementing the 3GPP narrow band internet of things (NB-IoT) standard. Particular examples of such machines or devices are sensors, metering devices such as power meters, industrial machinery, or home or personal appliances (e.g. refrigerators, televisions, etc.) personal wearables (e.g., watches, fitness trackers, etc.). In other scenarios, a WD may represent a vehicle or other equipment that is capable of monitoring and/or reporting on its operational status or other functions associated with its operation.
