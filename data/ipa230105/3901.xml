Therefore, a satellite search process needs to be performed, such as a serial search scheme or a parallel search scheme, in order to obtain a first positioning fix. When a GNSS receiver is powered on, it may use prepositioning information when aiming to obtain a first positioning fix.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is an object of the present disclosure to present a method, a receiver, a computer program product and a non-volatile storage medium, in which a reliable and time efficient parallel search for a first positioning fix is provided.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above-mentioned object is solved by the subject-matter of the attached independent claims. Further embodiments are disclosed in the attached dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect of the invention, a method for performing a parallel search for a first positioning fix in a Global Navigation Satellite System, GNSS, receiver, comprises the steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">determining prepositioning information, wherein the prepositioning information comprises a receiver information and a satellite information for each satellite in a plurality of satellites,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">determining a code phase search range and a frequency search range, based on the prepositioning information, for each satellite in the plurality of satellites,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0008">determining a starting point information for each satellite in the plurality of satellites, wherein each respective starting point information is representative of an offset from a center of a search range of the respective satellite, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0009">performing the parallel search for all satellites in the plurality of satellites based on the respective code phase search range, the respective frequency search range and the respective starting point information.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">A detection of a satellite is based on time synchronization, which relies on alignment of received and locally generated pseudorandom codes. The GNSS receiver aims to synchronize the received and locally generated identical codes by determining a time shift that results in perfectly time-aligned sequences. The time shift may also be denoted as code phase.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">In satellite navigation technology, time and position (range) are often interchangeable. A range can be expressed in time units by dividing it by the speed of light. Conversely, time can be expressed in range units when multiplied by the speed of light. Therefore, the code phase search consists of both time and position quantities.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">When powering on the GNSS receiver, unknown time and range (error) terms obtained by the GNSS receiver may comprise: a local time bias of the GNSS receiver, an approximate location of the GNSS receiver, an information about a position of one or more satellites, atmospheric propagation delays, reflections and/or receiver hardware delays.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">Similar to time synchronization, the GNSS receiver aims to synchronize to a frequency of a received signal by generating a local copy of it at substantially a same frequency as the received signal. At any relative movement between the signal source, i.e., the respective satellite, and the receiver a Doppler shift is implied. Similarly to time and range, clock drift and velocity may be considered interchangeable. Any deviation in the GNSS receiver's reference oscillator frequency may translate into an apparent Doppler shift in a frequency synchronization process. When powering on the GNSS receiver further unknown (error) terms may comprise a clock drift of the GNSS receiver and a velocity of the GNSS receiver relative to Earth. These (error) terms, which may affect the frequency synchronization are fewer in number and lesser in magnitude than the (error) terms with regard to the code phase synchronization. Therefore, the code synchronization problem may be more complex than frequency synchronization. However, the concepts laid out in the following are applicable to both code phase and frequency search.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">An advantage of the method according to the first aspect is that a reliable and time efficient parallel search for the first positioning fix may be provided. The method according to the first aspect may be applied, when the GNSS receiver is powered on/started. In this situation, the GNSS receiver needs to obtain the first positioning fix.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">The GNSS receiver may be an arbitrary GNSS receiver capable of using one or more of the available GNSS constellations when performing the method according to the first aspect. In other words, the GNSS receiver may be a multi GNSS receiver.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">The parallel search may also be denoted as parallel search scheme. When performing the parallel search, each satellite or signal is searched simultaneously by respective hardware and software resources, i.e., search units, of the GNSS receiver.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">According to the first aspect, a time for detecting a first satellite in the plurality of satellites, and consequently a time for obtaining the first positioning fix, may be reduced by adding controlled satellite specific offsets in the parallel search. For example, if the plurality of satellites comprises a number of N satellites, such a reduction may be achieved by a factor up to N. Compared with a (conventional) parallel search, especially in a situation, where one or more satellites are not detectable, i.e., due to obstruction and/or weak signal strength or the like, a robustness may be increased. This is achieved, by using offsets that correspond to the distribution of an expected common mode error. In this way, a maximum likelihood-type search of the common mode error is created.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">Another technique for obtaining a first satellite detection and/or the first positioning fix, is a serial search/serial search scheme. When performing the serial search, the GNSS receiver selects one satellite of the plurality of satellites. For example, a satellite with the highest elevation in order to maximize the chance that the view/line of sight from the GNSS receiver to the selected satellite is not obstructed. Then a large part or all resources of the GNSS receiver are used to detect that satellite.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">In the situation where one or more satellites are not detectable, i.e., due to obstruction and/or weak signal strength or the like, the serial search will need to first complete the search on a complete search space for one satellite. Due to the obstruction no detection may be possible. Then this procedure needs to be performed for the next satellite and so on. Therefore, the time to detect/acquire the first satellite may vary substantially. According to the first aspect, a time for detecting a first satellite may be the same as for a serial search, however, the time variance may be reduced. Thus, a more robust method is provided.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">According to one embodiment before determining the prepositioning information, the method further comprises obtaining valid satellite orbit information and an uncertainty window of a position of the GNSS receiver.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">Thus, the method according to the first aspect, may be particularly useful, when being applied to a so-called &#x201c;hot start&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;warm start&#x201d; scenario of the GNSS receiver. However, the method may also be applicable to various other scenarios of the GNSS receiver, such as aided starts or some other special scenarios. For example, the method is applicable in a scenario, wherein the GNSS receiver is arranged in a vehicle driving through a tunnel.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">Depending on an actual application, the information prepositioning information may be stored internally in the GNSS receiver.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">The receiver information is known a priori. Furthermore, the receiver information is representative of a position information of the GNSS receiver and a time information of the GNSS receiver. The position information may be estimated based on a last known position of the receiver, i.e., before powering off the receiver. The receiver information respectively position information and time information can be also received through external aiding before or during the search.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">The respective satellite information comprises (the valid) satellite orbit information of the respective satellite, i.e., one or more satellite orbital parameters.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">The prepositioning information has a certain accuracy depending on a quality of the position and the time information. Hence, the parallel search is performed by the GNSS receiver in a given uncertainty window. The error of the prepositioning information can be separated into a satellite-specific error and a common mode error, wherein the common mode error may be considered as a dominating factor and may be specific to the receiver. Therefore, when obtaining the first positioning fix, it is critical to detect/acquire and track a first satellite/signal as soon as possible. The method according to the first aspect provides a way to acquire the first satellite in a quick and robust way.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">The plurality of satellites may comprise N satellites, wherein the N satellites are some or all satellites in view of the GNSS receiver. Additionally or alternatively, the plurality of satellites may be a subset of all satellites in view of the GNSS receiver. A size of such a subset may be determined based on a number of parallel search units available to the GNSS receiver for performing the parallel search.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">The respective center of the search range may be the center of the respective code phase search range and/or the center of the respective frequency search range.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">The method according to the first aspect may be a computer-implemented method.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">According to a further embodiment the determining the prepositioning information comprises the steps:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0030">obtaining a first time information, and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0031">determining at least part of the prepositioning information based on the first time information.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0027" num="0032">With regards to GNSS, there is not just one single time. Each GNSS system, such as GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BeiDou. etc., has its &#x201c;own&#x201d; time. Moreover, each satellite has its deviation from it, although it can be considered negligible. However, the bulk of the time/drift errors are specific to the receiver.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0033">The first time information is used to synchronize the GNSS receiver to each satellite it acquires. It is an arbitrary time information, which is available to the receiver at the time the method is performed. The first time information may be a UTC or a GNSS system time.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">The first time information may be based on a calibrated or an uncalibrated real time clock, RTC, of the GNSS receiver. For example, the method according to the first aspect may be particularly useful, when the first time information is based on the uncalibrated RTC clock. Alternatively, the first time information may be obtained via Network Time Protocol, NTP, or clock aiding or the like. The first time information can be obtained from either an external device, i.e. the aforementioned device external to the receiver, or from internal calculations performed by the GNSS receiver.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">According to a further embodiment at least part of the prepositioning information is received from a device external to the GNSS receiver.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">The &#x201c;at least some part&#x201d; of the prepositioning information according to the embodiment may comprise some or all of the prepositioning information.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037">The device external to the GNSS receiver may be an arbitrary device and/or part of a host system and/or a network. It may be part of some service and/or configured to provide some or all of the prepositioning information for performing the parallel search.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">According to a further embodiment each starting point information comprises a first starting point information, which is representative of an offset from a center of the code phase search range of the respective satellite.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">In this way, a reliable and time efficient parallel search for the code phase search range may be provided.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">According to a further embodiment each starting point information comprises a second starting point information, which is representative of an offset from a center of the frequency search range of the respective satellite.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">In this way, a reliable and time efficient parallel search for the frequency search range may be provided.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">According to a further embodiment the method further comprises the steps:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0043">detecting a first satellite in the plurality of satellites based on the parallel search, and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0044">determining a further prepositioning information based on the detection of the first satellite.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0038" num="0045">In this way, the method may be iteratively performed and a time efficient parallel search may be provided.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0046">As soon as the first satellite is detected, the GNSS receiver may be enabled to resolve time and clock drift error terms of the prepositioning information. These are representative of the dominating contributors to the size of the search space. Therefore, as soon as the first satellite is detected, the prepositioning may be re-computed with new information obtained by the detection of the first satellite. In this way, the search spaces of the respective satellites may be greatly reduced. Thus, all on-going (parallel) search processes are stopped and may be re-started with further new prepositioning information. For example, in an ideal case, the further prepositioning is so accurate, that the reduced search space may be covered by a single search step.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0047">According to a further embodiment the method further comprises performing a further parallel search for a subset of satellites in the plurality of satellites based on the further prepositioning information.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0048">The subset of satellites in the plurality of satellites may comprise all satellites in the plurality of satellites except the first detected satellite. In other words, the subset may comprise solely non-detected satellites. Additionally or alternatively, the subset may an arbitrary subset of the plurality of satellites. For example, a size of the subset may be determined based on the number or parallel search units available for the further parallel search.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0049">The further parallel search may be conducted similar to the parallel search as described above, based on the (updated) further prepositioning information. The further parallel search may be substantially quicker when compared to the previous parallel search.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0050">For example, when performing the further parallel search, a further first satellite may be detected. With each detection, respective results are fed back in order to iteratively determine the further prepositioning information and to perform the further parallel search, until the first positioning fix is obtained. For example, it may be necessary to track a few satellites, e.g. 3 to 7 satellites, in order to achieve the first positioning fix.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0051">In the following embodiments, the disclosure is presented with respect to offsets being uniformly distributed within a common mode search range or search window, to which the aspects of the disclosure may be applied. This example is chosen for a consistent and easily understandable presentation of the disclosure. The disclosure, however, is not limited in this regard. It is to be understood, that the offsets may also follow any other suitable distribution. The term &#x201c;suitable&#x201d; in this case refers to a distribution having a sufficient entropy in order for the method to provide the aforementioned advantages. For example, any flat type of distribution may be applicable, i.e., a standard deviation needs to be substantially large. A different shape of the distribution may provide a different optimal solution.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0052">According to a further embodiment the offsets from the centers of the search ranges of the plurality of satellites are uniformly distributed in a common mode search range.
