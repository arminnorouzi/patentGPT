A surface (the lower surface of the panel body <b>311</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the panel body <b>311</b> facing away from a display surface <b>310</b> thereof is configured to be attached to the flexible support plate <b>32</b>; the flexible cover plate <b>312</b> covers the display surface (the upper surface of the panel body <b>311</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the panel body <b>311</b>, and an edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b> exceeds an edge of the panel body <b>311</b> in the third direction Z.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In this embodiment, the edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b> is set beyond the edge of the panel body <b>311</b>, that is, the edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b> is suspended, so that the edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b> is easy to sag. In order to solve the sagging of the edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the flexible display panel <b>31</b> further includes an elastic support layer <b>313</b>. The elastic support layer <b>313</b> is attached to the edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b>, and is configured such that when the panel body <b>311</b> is attached to the flexible support plate <b>32</b>, the elastic support layer <b>313</b> is located between the edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b> and the flexible support plate <b>32</b> to support the edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b>. By providing the elastic support layer <b>313</b>, when the flexible display panel <b>31</b> is unfolded, the elastic support layer <b>313</b> may fill a gap between the edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b> and the flexible support plate <b>32</b> to support the edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b>, so that the edge of the flexible cover plate <b>312</b> is prevented from sagging and is protected from damage by external force.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The elastic support layer <b>313</b> may be a foam layer (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), or may be a rubble layer, which is not specifically limited here.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the above description of the embodiments, specific features, structures, materials or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in any one or more  embodiments or examples.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The foregoing descriptions are merely specific implementations of the present disclosure, but the protection scope of the present disclosure is not limited thereto.
