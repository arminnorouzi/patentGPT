Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless communication systems or wireless networks are widely deployed to provide various telecommunication services such as telephony, video, data, messaging, and broadcasts. Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, and/or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless network may include a number of base stations (BSs) that can support communication for a number of user equipments (UEs). A user equipment (UE) may communicate with a base station (BS) via a downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the BS to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UE to the BS. A BS may be referred to as a Node B, a gNodeB (gNB), an access point (AP), a radio head, a transmit receive point (TRP), a New Radio (NR) BS, a 5G Node B, and/or the like.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of techniques for positioning of a user equipment (UE) using positioning reference signal (PRS) may be disclosed. An initiator UE may be configured to send or transmit one or more units of messages to a group of two or more responder UEs. A unit of message may include a pre-PRS message, a PRS message and a post-PRS message. Each of the responder UEs may be configured to transmit one or more units of messages to the initiator UE. The pre-PRS message and the post-PRS message may be transmitted using a license spectrum. The PRS message may be transmitted using an unlicensed spectrum. Using the unlicensed spectrum may enable a UE to have access to more bandwidth which may help improving positioning accuracy. The communication from the initiator UE to the group of responder UEs may be performed with the initiator UE broadcasting messages having the same payload to the responder UEs in the group of responder UEs. The communication from the responder UEs may be performed with each responder UE in the group of responder UEs broadcasting its messages to the initiator UE.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some aspects, an initiator UE is provided for positioning using PRS. An example method may include the initiator UE transmitting a pre-positioning reference signal (pre-PRS) message of the initiator UE to a group of responder UEs. The pre-PRS message of the initiator UE may include one or more characteristics of a transmission of a positioning reference signal (or reference signal) of the initiator UE. The initiator UE may be configured to determine one or more characteristics of a transmission of a reference signal of each of the responder UEs and may include this information in the pre-PRS message of the initiator UE. The pre-PRS message of the initiator UE may indicate when each responder UE may send its pre-PRS message to the initiator UE. The same pre-PRS message of the initiator UE may be sent to all of the responder UEs. The initiator UE may receive from each responder UE a pre-PRS message of each responder UE to indicate at least that each responder UE receives the pre-PRS message of the initiator UE. Based on receiving the pre-PRS message of each responder UE, the initiator UE may send a PRS message to the group of responder UEs using the one or more characteristics of the transmission of the PRS of the initiator UE. Based on transmitting of the PRS message of the initiator UE, the initiator UE may receive from each responder UE a PRS message of each responder UE according to the one or more characteristics of the transmission of the PRS of each responder UE. Based on receiving the PRS message of each responder UE, the initiator UE may send to the group of responder UEs a post-PRS message of the initiator UE. The post-PRS message of the initiator UE may indicate that the initiator UE receives the PRS message from each responder UE. Based on sending the post-PRS message of the initiator UE to the group of responder UEs, the initiator UE may receive from each responder UE a post-PRS message of each responder UE. The post-PRS message of each responder UE may include timing data related to a departure time of the PRS message of the responder UE, timing data related to an arrival time of the PRS message of the initiator UE at the responder UE, and data related to a location of the responder UE at the departure time of the PRS message of the responder UE.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, an initiator UE configured with one or more transceivers, a memory, and one or more processors may be used to establish a communication with a group of responder UEs using PRS. For example, the initiator UE may be configured to identify a group of responder UEs based on their positioning properties which may include a direction a responder UE is moving, its velocity, its location confidence, or its location, or a combination thereof. The initiator UE may be configured to send to the group of responder UEs, a pre-PRS message of the initiator UE. The pre-PRS message of the initiator UE may include one or more characteristics of a transmission of a PRS of the initiator UE. The pre-PRS message of the initiator UE may include one or more characteristics of a transmission of a PRS and a PRS ID of each responder UE. The pre-PRS message of the initiator UE may indicate when each responder UE can send its pre-PRS message to the initiator UE. The initiator UE may receive, from each responder UE, a pre-PRS message of the responder UE which may confirm that the responder UE receives the pre-PRS message of the initiator UE. The pre-PRS message of the responder UE may include data related to a frequency that the responder UE may use to send its PRS to the initiator UE. The initiator UE may send to the group of responder UEs, based on receiving the pre-PRS message from each responder UE, a PRS message of the initiator UE using the one or more characteristics of the transmission of the PRS of the initiator UE. The initiator UE may receive from each responder UE, based on sending the PRS message of the initiator UE, a PRS message of the responder UE according to the one or more characteristics of the transmission of the PRS of the responder UE.

The initiator UE may receive from each responder UE, based on the transmitting of the post-PRS message of the initiator UE, a post-PRS message of each responder UE including timing data related to a departure time of the PRS message of the responder UE and timing data related to an arrival time of the PRS message of the initiator UE at the responder UE, and data related to a location of the responder UE at the departure time of the post-PRS message of the responder UE.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some aspects, a responder UE may be used for positioning of an initiator UE using PRS. The responder UE may be one in a group of two or more responder UEs identified by the initiator UE based on their positioning properties. The method may further include receiving, from the initiator UE, a pre-PRS message of the initiator UE including one or more characteristics of a transmission of a PRS of the initiator UE, one or more characteristics of a transmission of a PRS of the responder UE, and information about when the responder UE can send its pre-PRS message to the initiator UE.

The pre-PRS message of the initiator UE may also include one or more characteristics of a transmission of a PRS message of the responder UE determined by the initiator UE on behalf of the responder UE and information about when the responder UE may send its pre-PRS message to the initiator UE. The responder UE may send its pre-PRS message to the initiator UE confirming that it receives the pre-PRS message of the initiator UE.

The PRS exchange between the two UEs may happen within a certain time period so that clock drift error of the two UEs may be minimal. In some aspects, a PRS may be a pseudo-noise (PN) sequence. The PRS may be without a payload. The transmission duration of a PRS may be short (e.g., 33 microseconds). There may be a set of PN sequences generated and shared among the UEs in a network. A PRS may be identified by its identification (ID). For example, all the UEs in the network may share a mechanism to generate the PN sequence. The mechanism to generate the PN sequence may include a sequence generator that is configured to generate the PN sequences based on a seed. A UE may select a PN sequence from the generated PN sequences and may indicate to other UEs that it may use the selected PN sequence to communicate with the other UEs.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some aspects, the UEs in a network may be configured to broadcast basic safety messages (BSM). The broadcast of the BSM may occur periodically. In some aspects, the BSM may include information that indicates whether a UE is capable of performing PRS-based positioning. The BSM may also include information related to an approximate position of a UE. A UE may be configured with a clock. In some aspects, timing between one UE with another UE may not be perfectly synchronized due to certain level of synchronization error which may be in the nanoseconds level.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An initiator UE may be the UE that initiates a positioning session. A responder UE may be the UE that responds or reacts to the initiator UE. In some aspects, an initiator UE may identify a plurality of responder UEs based at least in part on the information included in the BSMs of the responder UEs. For example, the initiator UE may select the plurality of responder UEs for a UE positioning session.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some aspects, a group of UEs may participate in a positioning session. The group of UEs may include an initiator UE and multiple responder UEs. In some aspects, a communication between an initiator UE and each of the responder UE in the multiple responder UEs may include pre-PRS messages, PRS messages and post-PRS messages. The pre-PRS messages may be communicated during a pre-PRS stage, the PRS messages may be communicated during a PRS stage, and the post-PRS messages may be communicated during a post-PRS stage. A combination of a pre-PRS message, a PRS message, and a post-PRS message may be viewed as one unit of positioning signals communicated between an initiator UE and a responder UE. In some aspects, a positioning session may be performed over multiple units of positioning signals.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some aspects, the PRS messages may be transmitted using a large bandwidth to improve ranging. Positioning accuracy may increase as the bandwidth used for the PRS messages increases. As such, the PRS messages may be transmitted using an unlicensed spectrum for larger bandwidth. For example, a licensed spectrum may be associated with frequencies used by the wireless communication network in accordance with governing communication standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, etc.), and an unlicensed spectrum may be associated with frequencies outside of the licensed spectrum and for which LBT communication protocols may apply. To transmit a PRS message using an unlicensed spectrum, a UE may need to perform a listen before talk (LBT) procedure to contend for access to the unlicensed electromagnet spectrum band (e.g., to determine whether a channel of the unlicensed electromagnetic spectrum band is available). In some aspects, the pre-PRS messages and the post-PRS messages may be transmitted using a licensed spectrum because it is an efficient means of communication between UEs in a wireless network. In some aspects, the disclosed positioning technique may be applicable in communication systems that implement the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) standard.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some aspects, a positioning session may be initiated by an initiator UE based on the initiator UE determining that it is not certain about its location as related to a positioning system. For example, an initiator UE may determine that it is completely out of coverage with no network connectivity. In some aspects, when an initiator UE needs to determine its location, the initiator UE may select a group of responder UEs from a plurality of nearby UEs based on positioning properties of each of the responder UEs. In some aspects, the positioning properties of a responder UE may include one or more of a location of confidence of the responder UE, a direction that the responder UE may be moving, a velocity of the responder UE, and a position of the responder UE.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some aspects, an initiator UE may select and engage in a positioning session with a responder UE based on the responder UE moving in a direction different from a direction that the initiator UE is moving. In some aspects, a responder UE may be selected based on the responder UE having a higher location confidence than the initiator UE. In some aspects, the initiator UE may select a responder UE that is moving in a substantially opposite direction over a responder UE that is moving in a substantially similar direction for a positioning session. This may be because there may not be much angular changes between the initiator UE and the responder UE when they are both moving in the same direction. Multiple angular changes between a position of the initiator UE and a position of a responder UE may help with the determination of the location of the initiator UE. In some aspects, communication between an initiator UE and a responder UE in a positioning session described herein may not include communication to a base station or to a server computing system.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some aspects, an initiator UE and a responder UE may use each other to determine their locations. For example, during a positioning session, an initiator UE may send one set of timing data related to a departure time and an arrival time and a position of the initiator UE to a responder UE to enable the responder UE to determine its location. Similarly, the responder UE may send another set of timing data related to a departure time and an arrival time and a position of the responder UE to the initiator UE to enable the initiator UE to determine its location. In some aspects, the responder UE may be configured to send range information relative to the initiator UE to the initiator UE. In some aspects, the initiator UE may be configured to send range information relative to the responder UE to the responder UE. The range information may indicate an approximate distance between an initiator UE and a responder UE.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, an &#x201c;RF signal&#x201d; comprises an electromagnetic wave that transports information through the space between a transmitter (or transmitting device) and a receiver (or receiving device). As used herein, a transmitter may transmit a single &#x201c;RF signal&#x201d; or multiple &#x201c;RF signals&#x201d; to a receiver. However, the receiver may receive multiple &#x201c;RF signals&#x201d; corresponding to each transmitted RF signal due to the propagation characteristics of RF signals through multipath channels. The same transmitted RF signal on different paths between the transmitter and receiver may be referred to as a &#x201c;multipath&#x201d; RF signal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified illustration of a positioning system <b>100</b> in which a UE <b>105</b>, location server <b>160</b>, and/or other components of the positioning system <b>100</b> can use the techniques provided herein for a group-based positioning design in asynchronous vehicular networks, according to an embodiment.

The assistance data may be determined by, for example, a location server (e.g., location server <b>160</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and/or LMF <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), and includes assistance data for a reference cell, and a number of neighbor cells supported by various wireless nodes.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Typically, PRS occasions from all cells in a network that use the same frequency are aligned in time and may have a fixed known time offset (e.g., cell-specific subframe offset (APRs) <b>415</b>) relative to other cells in the network that use a different frequency. In SFN-synchronous networks all wireless nodes (e.g., base stations <b>120</b>) may be aligned on both frame boundary and system frame number. Therefore, in SFN-synchronous networks all cells supported by the various wireless nodes may use the same PRS configuration index for any particular frequency of PRS transmission. On the other hand, in SFN-asynchronous networks, the various wireless nodes may be aligned on a frame boundary, but not system frame number. Thus, in SFN-asynchronous networks the PRS configuration index for each cell may be configured separately by the network so that PRS occasions align in time. A UE <b>105</b> may determine the timing of the PRS occasions <b>410</b> of the reference and neighbor cells for TDOA positioning, if the UE <b>105</b> can obtain the cell timing (e.g., SFN or Frame Number) of at least one of the cells, e.g., the reference cell or a serving cell. The timing of the other cells may then be derived by the UE <b>105</b> based, for example, on the assumption that PRS occasions from different cells overlap.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">With reference to the frame structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a collection of REs that are used for transmission of PRS is referred to as a &#x201c;PRS resource.&#x201d; The collection of resource elements can span multiple RBs in the frequency domain and one or more consecutive symbols within a slot in the time domain, inside which pseudo-random Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) sequences are transmitted from an antenna port of a TRP. In a given OFDM symbol in the time domain, a PRS resource occupies consecutive RBs in the frequency domain. The transmission of a PRS resource within a given RB has a particular comb size (also referred to as the &#x201c;comb density&#x201d;). A comb size &#x201c;N&#x201d; represents the subcarrier spacing (or frequency/tone spacing) within each symbol of a PRS resource configuration, where the configuration uses every Nth subcarrier of certain symbols of an RB. For example, for comb-4, for each of the four symbols of the PRS resource configuration, REs corresponding to every fourth subcarrier (e.g., subcarriers 0, 4, 8) are used to transmit PRS of the PRS resource. Comb sizes of comb-2, comb-4, comb-6, and comb-12, for example, may be used in PRS. Examples of different comb sizes using with different numbers of symbols are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A &#x201c;PRS resource set&#x201d; is a group of PRS resources used for the transmission of PRS signals, where each PRS resource has a PRS resource ID. In addition, the PRS resources in a PRS resource set are associated with the same TRP. A PRS resource set is identified by a PRS resource set ID and is associated with a particular TRP (identified by a cell ID). In addition, the PRS resources in a PRS resource set may have the same periodicity, a common muting pattern configuration, and the same repetition factor across slots. The periodicity may have a length selected from 2<sup>m</sup>. {4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560, 5120, 10240} slots, with &#x3bc;=0, 1, 2, 3. The repetition factor may have a length selected from {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32} slots.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A PRS resource ID in a PRS resource set may be associated with a single beam (and/or beam ID) transmitted from a single TRP (where a TRP may transmit one or more beams). That is, each PRS resource of a PRS resource set may be transmitted on a different beam, and as such, a PRS resource (or simply &#x201c;resource&#x201d;) can also be referred to as a &#x201c;beam.&#x201d; Note that this does not have any implications on whether the TRPs and the beams on which PRS are transmitted are known to the UE.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the 5G NR positioning system <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a TRP (e.g., <b>210</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>) may transmit frames, or other physical layer signaling sequences, supporting PRS signals (i.e. a DL-PRS) according to frame configurations as previously described, which may be measured and used for position determination of the UE <b>105</b>. As noted, other types of wireless network nodes, including other UEs, may also be configured to transmit PRS signals configured in a manner similar to (or the same as) that described above. Because transmission of a PRS by a wireless network node may be directed to all UEs within radio range, the wireless network node may be considered to transmit (or broadcast) a PRS.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a timing diagram illustrating two different options for slot usage of a resource set, according to an embodiment. Because each example repeats each resource four times, the resource set is said to have a repetition factor of four. Successive sweeping <b>610</b> comprises repeating a single resource (resource 1, resource 2, etc.) four times before proceeding to a subsequent resource. In this example, if each resource corresponds to a different beam of a TRP, the TRP repeats a beam for four slots in a row before moving to the next beam. Because each resource is repeated in successive slots (e.g., resource 1 is repeated in slots n, n+1, n+2, etc.), the time gap is said to be one slot. On the other hand, for interleaved sweeping <b>620</b>, the TRP may move from one beam to the next for each subsequent slot, rotating through four beams for four rounds. Because each resource is repeated every four slots (e.g., resource 1 is repeated in slots n, n+4, n+8, etc.), the time gap is said to be one slot. Of course, embodiments are not so limited. Resource sets may comprise a different amount of resources and/or repetitions. Moreover, as noted above, each TRP may have multiple resource sets, multiple TRPs may utilize a single FL, and a UE may be capable of taking measurements of PRS resources transmitted via multiple FLs.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Thus, to obtain PRS measurements from PRS signals sent by TRPs and/or UEs in a network, the UE can be configured to observe PRS resources during a period of time called a measurement period. That is, to determine a position of the UE using PRS signals, a UE and a location server (e.g., LMF <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may initiate a location session in which the UE is given a period of time to observe PRS resources and report resulting PRS measurements to the location server. As described in more detail below, this measurement period may be determined based on the capabilities of the UE.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">To measure and process PRS resources during the measurement period, a UE can be configured to execute a measurement gap (MG) pattern. The UE can request a measurement gap from a serving TRP, for example, which can then provide the UE with the configuration (e.g., via Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As noted, a UE may be configured to execute an MG pattern to measure and process PRS resources of a PRS resource set outside an active DL bandwidth part (BWP) via which the UE sends and receives data with a serving TRP. To allow the network to configure the UE in a manner that accommodates the processing and buffering capabilities of the UE (which may be dynamic), the UE may provide to the network (e.g., a TRP or location server) capabilities related to PRS processing. The various parameters of the MG pattern can be configured in view of these capabilities.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Although many of the communication structures and concepts provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref> are used to provide positioning of UEs in the systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> based on uplink (UL) and/or downlink (DL) signals sent from and/or received by the UE and base stations, they can also be used to communicate PRS (and other reference signals) between UEs.

For example, when the initiator UE <b>705</b> and the responder UEs <b>706</b> and <b>707</b> are moving in the same direction, the angular changes may be minimal, and therefore it may not be useful to have a high number of cycles or iteration. However, when the responder UEs <b>706</b> and <b>707</b> are moving in directions away from the initiator UE <b>705</b>, multiple geometries and angular changes may result between a position of the initiator UE <b>705</b> and positions of the responder UEs <b>706</b> and <b>707</b>.
