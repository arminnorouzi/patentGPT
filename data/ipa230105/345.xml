A slit lamp microscope is used for illuminating a subject's eye with slit light and observing and/or photographing the illuminated cross section from an oblique or side position with a microscope (see, for example, following Patent Documents 1 to 3).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the main uses of a slit lamp microscope is observation of anterior eye segments. When observing an anterior eye segment, a doctor observes an entire anterior eye segment while moving the focal position and the area illuminated by slit light, thereby determining the presence or absence of abnormality. Further, a slit lamp microscope may also be used for prescription of vision correction devices such as for checking of a fitting state of a contact lens.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Diaphanoscopy (or red reflection technique) may be used for anterior eye segment observation (see, for example, following Patent Document 3). Diaphanoscopy is an observation technique that uses retinal reflection of illumination light to depict intraocular conditions, and is typically a technique of depicting an opaque area (or, opacity area, clouding area, haze area, turbidity area, or the like) of the crystalline lens as a shadow formed by the light beam reverting from the retina. An image obtained by diaphanoscopy is referred to as a transillumination image (diaphanoscopic image, red reflex image). While diaphanoscopy is a common technique widely used in the observation of cataract eyes, it has the following problems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">First, it is difficult to manage or control the brightness of transillumination images because diaphanoscopy uses the reflected light coming from the retina, and it is also difficult to manage (control, adjust) its image quality. These difficulties make diaphanoscopy unsuitable for quantitative diagnosis. Therefore, diagnosis using diaphanoscopy is highly dependent on the subjectivity of a person who conducts image interpretation, and for example, grade of cataract cannot be objectively evaluated. In addition, although automatic image analysis techniques using analysis programs or machine learning have been rapidly developing in recent years, the difficulty in image quality management is still one of the factors that prevent the application of automatic image analysis to transillumination images.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Second, a transillumination image is a planar image (projection image) with the eye fundus as a secondary light source, and has no information in the depth direction (axial direction, Z direction), which makes it impossible to provide opacity distribution in a three dimensional manner. In other words, a transillumination image only provides opacity distribution in the XY plane perpendicular to the Z direction, and cannot provide opacity distribution in the Z direction.</p><heading

drawings. It should be noted that any known techniques or technologies such as any of the matters or items disclosed in the documents cited herein may be combined with or incorporated in the aspect examples.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0089">The slit lamp microscope of some aspect examples may be a stationary type or a portable type. The slit lamp microscope of some aspect examples has an (automatic) scanning function of scanning an anterior eye segment with slit light to acquire a plurality of cross sectional images, and is typically used in situations and/or environments where no technical experts (skilled persons) relating to the apparatus is present nearby. Note that the slit lamp microscope of some aspect examples may be used in situations and/or environments where a skilled person is present, or in situations and/or environments where a skilled person can provide monitoring, give instructions, and/or conduct an apparatus operation, from a remote place.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0090">Examples of the facility in which the slit lamp microscope is disposed include an optician's store, an optometrist's office, a health facility, a medical institution, a health check and screening venue, a patient's home, a welfare facility, a public facility, a medical examination vehicle, and the like.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0091">The slit lamp microscope of some aspect examples is an ophthalmic imaging apparatus having at least the function of a slit lamp microscope, and may be further provided with any other photographing or imaging functions performed by other modality apparatuses. Examples of such other modality apparatuses include an anterior segment camera, a fundus camera (retinal camera), an SLO, an OCT apparatus, and the like. The slit lamp microscope of some aspect examples may further have any of the functions of measuring characteristics of eyes. Examples of such measurement functions include visual acuity measurement, refraction measurement, intraocular pressure measurement, corneal endothelial cell measurement, aberration measurement, visual field measurement, and the like. The slit lamp microscope of some aspect examples may further include application software for analyzing photographed images, measurement data, or the like. The slit lamp microscope of some aspect examples may further include any of the functions for treatment or surgery.

The ophthalmic information processing apparatus of some aspect examples may be a peripheral device of the slit lamp microscope, may be connected to the slit lamp microscope through a local area network (LAN), or may be connected to the slit lamp microscope through a wide area network. Alternatively, the ophthalmic information processing apparatus of some aspect examples may have a function of accepting (receiving) input of a plurality of cross sectional images stored in a recording medium.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0093">The ophthalmic system of some aspect examples may include one or more slit lamp microscopes and one or more information processing apparatuses, and may be used for telemedicine, for example. The slit lamp microscope may be a slit lamp microscope of any aspect example, or may be a slit lamp microscope including at least part of a slit lamp microscope of any aspect example.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0094">The information processing apparatus has a function of receiving an image acquired by the slit lamp microscope and processing this image. The information processing apparatus of some examples may be a computer terminal or a server on a network. The computer terminal may be an image interpretation computer terminal and/or an image interpretation apparatus, for example. In the case where the information processing apparatus is an image interpretation computer terminal and/or an image interpretation apparatus, the ophthalmic system may include another information processing apparatus (such as a server) that receives an image acquired by the slit lamp microscope and transfers this image to the image interpretation computer terminal and/or the image interpretation apparatus. The architecture of the ophthalmic system is not limited to a client-server system, and may be a peer-to-peer system. While the aspect examples below will mainly describe an ophthalmic system of a client-server type, any of the functions, configurations, elements, operations, processes, and any other matters and items of such client-server systems may be applied to an ophthalmic system of a peer-to-peer type.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0095">The image interpretation computer terminal is a computer used by a doctor (typically, a specialist such as an ophthalmologist or a medical image interpreter) to conduct interpretation of an image acquired by the slit lamp microscope. Here, the interpretation is an act of observing an image to obtain medical findings. Information entered into the image interpretation computer terminal by the person who has conducted the image interpretation may, for example, be converted by the image interpretation computer terminal or another computer into an image interpretation report or electronic medical record information and then transmitted to the server. In some other examples, information entered into the image interpretation computer terminal by a person who conducts image interpretation may be transmitted to the server. In this case, the server or another computer may perform conversion of the information entered by the person who conducts the image interpretation into an image interpretation report or electronic medical record information. The server may be configured to perform management of image interpretation reports or electronic medical record information by itself, or to transfer (forward, send) image interpretation reports or electronic medical record information to another medical system (e.g., an electronic medical record system).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0096">The image interpretation apparatus is a computer configured to perform interpretation of an image acquired by the slit lamp microscope, using an image processing processor and/or an artificial intelligence engine, for example. Information derived from the image by the image interpretation apparatus may be converted by the image interpretation apparatus or another computer into an image interpretation report or electronic medical record information and then transmitted to the server, for example. In some other examples, information derived from the image by the image interpretation apparatus may be transmitted to the server. In this case, the server or another computer may convert the information derived from the image by the image interpretation apparatus into an image interpretation report or electronic medical record information. The server may be configured to perform management of image interpretation reports or electronic medical record information by itself, or to transfer (forward, send) image interpretation reports or electronic medical record information to another medical system.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0097">As described thus far, the slit lamp microscopes, the ophthalmic information processing apparatuses, and the ophthalmic systems of some aspect examples can be used for telemedicine. On the other hand, acquisition of an adequate image (good image, satisfactory image) using a conventional slit lamp microscope is not an easy task. In addition, effective image interpretation and diagnosis require acquisition of an image of a wide area of an anterior eye segment &#x201c;in advance&#x201d;.

The region through which the illumination light passes is referred to as a slit, and the interval between the slit blades is referred to as a slit width. Further, the slit forming member may be configured to be capable of changing the length of the slit light. The length of the slit light is a size of a cross section of the slit light along the direction perpendicular to the cross sectional width direction of the slit light. Here, the cross sectional width direction corresponds to the slit width. The width of the slit light and the length of the slit light of some typical examples are represented as the size of a projected image on the anterior segment formed by the slit light; however, possible representations of the width and length of the slit light are not limited to these.

Stereo alignment may be applicable to an ophthalmic apparatus capable of photographing an anterior segment from two or more mutually different directions (two or more mutually different viewpoints). A specific method of stereo alignment is disclosed by the present applicant in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2013-248376.

With such an alignment operation, the optical system (the illumination system <b>2</b> and the photography system <b>3</b> in the present example) is brought to and placed at an appropriate alignment position with respect to the subject's eye.
