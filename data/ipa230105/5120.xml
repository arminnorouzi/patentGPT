a method of and a system for detecting damages in a freight container.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Various freight containers may be used for transporting goods, equipment or raw materials. Freight containers, which are typically 20 to 53 feet long, represent a typical example of freight containers. Freight containers are handled for example in various ports or in railway or truck terminals where they are moved for instance from a ship directly onto a train or a truck or vice versa, or to a storage area of the port or terminal for intermediate storing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Problems with the handling of freight containers may take place with containers that have been damaged or even broken in various ways. If the cargo contained in the container has moved, the container may comprise e.g., deformations, or the structures of the container may have broken in response to impacts exerted thereon. Said damages in the container may have been brought about for instance during transportation of the container or while loading or unloading it sometime earlier. While being handled, such damaged containers may constitute a danger to their environment for instance as a result of the cargo or the entire container or parts thereof falling, which is why it should be possible to be able to detect the damaged containers so as to enable, when necessary, the handling of such a container to be planned in advance to take place in a safe manner, or to enable the container to be prevented from further moving along in the transport chain.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">In some terminals, it is possible in connection with loading and unloading containers to employ staff reserved for the purpose for detecting damages in the container prior to moving the container. In large terminals, owing to the enormous number of containers to be handled and incessant demands for efficiency placed on the transport chain, it is in practice often impossible for the staff in the terminal to inspect all containers, however.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a novel method and a novel system for detecting damages in a freight container.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The invention is characterized by the features of the independent claims.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">The invention is based on the idea of capturing or taking images of at least one part of the freight container at different angles in respect of the at least one part of the freight container by different image capturing units for detecting different kind of damages in the at least one part of the freight container, i.e., to detect damages being detectable at different viewing angles in respect of the part of the freight container. The damages detected in the images captured at different viewing angles from the same part of the freight container are combined into one image from the same part of the freight container to easily visualize the damages in the respective part of the freight container.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">The solution provides a way to detect various damages in the freight container, including damages being detectable only in the image captured at the angle deviating from the perpendicular direction in respect of the part of the freight container as well as damages being detectable only in the image captured at the angle substantially perpendicular in respect of the same part of the freight container.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Some embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0010">In the following the invention will be described in greater detail by means of preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows schematically a freight container;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows schematically a part of a system for detecting damages in a freight container as seen from above of a freight container;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows schematically a part of a system for detecting damages in a freight container as seen from a rear end of a freight container;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows schematically an embodiment of a system for detecting damages in a freight container;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows schematically an embodiment of a method of detecting damages in a freight container; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>8</b></figref> show schematically a practical example of detecting damages in a freight container.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0019" num="0017">For the sake of clarity, the figures show some embodiments of the invention in a simplified manner.

The freight container <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises a first end wall <b>1</b>, i.e., a front wall <b>1</b>, provided with openable container doors <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the first end wall <b>1</b> thus forming a front end of the freight container <b>10</b>. The container <b>10</b> further comprises at an opposite end thereof a second end wall <b>2</b>, i.e., a rear wall <b>2</b>, which forms a rear end of the freight container <b>10</b>. The container <b>10</b> further comprises long side walls, i.e., a first side wall <b>3</b> and a second side wall <b>4</b>, which form side structures of the container connecting the front wall <b>1</b> and the rear wall <b>2</b> to each other. The container <b>10</b> further comprises a roof <b>5</b> forming a top structure of the container <b>10</b>, and a bottom <b>6</b> forming a bottom structure of the container <b>10</b>. The freight container <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a typical transport container used for shipment of goods or equipment by sea, but also being applicable to be transported by train or by truck. The freight container may also be a container of a different kind from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, such as a tank container, used for transporting liquids or powders. The freight containers are typically 20 to 53 feet long. The containers may also vary in height and width.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">The freight containers are provided with a container code <b>7</b>, typically on each wall <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and the roof <b>5</b> of the container <b>1</b>.

Such container codes <b>7</b> are used in terminals for monitoring and identifying containers. A container code is one possible example of an individualization identifier of a container to individualize and identify each individual container, the container code typically comprising the following information on the container: owner code (commonly known as BIC code), equipment class identifier, serial number, inspection number, and size and type codes of the container. In the side and end walls of the container <b>10</b>, the container codes <b>7</b> are typically provided at the top right-hand corner. The container code <b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is horizontal, but it may also be vertical. The container codes may have one, two, three and four row(s).

Therefore, such containers could be identified for being able to plan beforehand, if necessary, an alternative transport route and/or an intermediate storing place in the port or terminal or outside it. Relating to measures of the freight containers, for example, ISO 668-standard relates to external and internal dimensions of containers. Additionally, when handling and storing containers deviating in their structure from ordinary freight containers, such as the cooling containers equipped with cooling apparatus, the deviating structures in the containers could be taken into in consideration to prevent the containers from being stored or loaded in a space where the structures of the container might be damaged.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">It will be obvious to a person skilled in the art that, as the technology advances, the inventive concept can be implemented in various ways.
