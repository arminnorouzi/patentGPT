The invention relates also to a method and system for producing a synthesis gas for use in the production of a hydrocarbon product, in which the synthesis gas is produced by using electrically heated steam methane reforming and autothermal reforming. Tail gas from the Firscher-Tropsch synthesis may be recycled to said electrically heated steam methane reforming and/or said autothermal reforming.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The classical approach to the production of synthesis gas (syngas) involves steam reforming of a hydrocarbon feed gas, normally natural gas, and a major associated CO<sub>2 </sub>emission. As the highly endothermic steam reforming reaction is facilitated in conventional steam methane reformers (SMR), i.e. fired reformers using large furnaces operating at temperatures in the vicinity of 1000&#xb0; C., the process economy is heavily favoured by economy of scale to enable high process efficiency and integrated waste heat management. Such plants are therefore difficult to scale down economically due to the integrated design and high upfront capital investment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The conversion of the hydrocarbon feed gas to synthesis gas by such conventional SMR results in synthesis gas having a H2/CO module of about 3 or higher e.g. 3-5. However, for the use of a synthesis gas for the downstream production via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbon products such as diesel, the molar steam-to-carbon ratio (S/C ratio) in the synthesis gas has to be reduced so as to lower its H<sub>2</sub>/CO molar ratio. However, by steam methane reforming it is typically not possible to reach a sufficiently low H<sub>2</sub>/CO-molar ratio in the synthesis gas, unless other means such as CO<sub>2</sub>-addition to the feed or hydrogen removal from the synthesis gas are employed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, CO and hydrogen in the synthesis gas are combined in a number of reactions to produce a variety of hydrocarbons, typically with the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>(2n+2)</sub>. A simplified reaction as given below is often used for the FT-synthesis:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(2<i>n+</i>1)H<sub>2</sub><i>+n</i>CO&#x2192;C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>(2n+2)</sub><i>+n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">where n is typically 10-30 and the formation of methane (n=1) is unwanted.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">It should be noted that the FT-synthesis is highly complex and the above equation is a considerable simplification. In practice, the desired H<sub>2</sub>/CO-ratio in the synthesis gas feed to the FT-synthesis is around 2 such as 1-8-2.2 or preferably 1.9-2.1.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">Accordingly, the desired H<sub>2</sub>/CO module in the synthesis gas is about 2.0, for instance 1.8-2.2, such as 1.9-2.1.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">It is known to achieve this by operating steam reforming with low S/C ratios. For instance, it is possible to produce synthetic fuels such as diesel from natural gas by FT synthesis, in which synthesis gas is produced by the use of a conventional SMR and autothermal reforming in an autothermal reformer (ATR), optionally also with prereforming upstream the conventional SMR. Accordingly, processes/plants are known where, for example, a part of the natural gas feed bypasses the steam methane reformer and enters the autothermal reformer together with recycled tail gas from downstream FT synthesis, and where CO2 from the synthesis gas exiting the autothermal reformer is removed and exported, i.e. CO2 is removed without recycling. Applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 9,353,022 discloses a process which combines the removal of CO<sub>2 </sub>from the produced syngas with recycling of FT tail gas. Applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 9,828,246 discloses a process and plant for the production of liquid hydrocarbons by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in which the reforming section of the plant comprises a process line comprising autothermal reforming and a separate process line comprising steam methane reforming.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">For large scale plants for the production of diesel from synthesis gas generated from natural gas as the hydrocarbon feed gas, it is well known that the preferred solution is the use of ATR without the use of an upstream conventional SMR, i.e. stand-alone ATR, optionally with a prereformer upstream, since among other things, using conventional SMR instead of autothermal reforming in connection with a downstream FT synthesis results in lower overall plant efficiency.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Typically, the hydrocarbon feed gas, i.e. natural gas, is admixed with steam, preheated in a fired heater, passed through a prereformer, then preheated again in a fired heater typically to about 500-700 C and then passed through an autothermal reformer. A portion of the tail gas from downstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT tail gas) is added to this preheated stream or directly to the autothermal reformer, along with an oxygen-rich stream produced in an Air Separation Unit (ASU). The ASU required for the production of oxygen normally represents a significant capital expense. The FT tail gas typically contains CO<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>, methane, unconverted H<sub>2 </sub>and CO together with light hydrocarbons in some cases including olefins formed in the FT synthesis. The recycle of the hydrocarbons increases the overall plant efficiency. The portion of the tail gas which is not recycled is used as fuel for process heaters and other purposes in the plant/process. In some cases, part of the tail gas may be exported either directly or indirectly for example by using the excess gas for producing steam or power.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">This traditional way of producing synthesis gas and downstream synthetic fuels conveys an associated CO<sub>2 </sub>emission.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system for converting a hydrocarbon feed gas, such as methane rich gas, to a synthesis gas suitable for use in the production of hydrocarbon products, particularly diesel, having lower consumption of oxygen in the ATR and thereby having a higher energy efficiency than prior art methods (processes) and systems (plants).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">It is a further object of the invention to provide a sustainable method and system for converting a hydrocarbon feed gas, such as methane rich gas, to a synthesis gas suitable for use in the production of hydrocarbon products, particularly diesel.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">It is a further object of the invention to enable the building of compact plants for the production of hydrocarbon products.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">It is a further object of the invention to enable building of plants with a high carbon utilization.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">These and other objects are solved by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Accordingly, the invention relates to more sustainable production of hydrocarbon products from a hydrocarbon feed gas by applying electrically heated steam methane reformer (eSMR) technology that will allow for a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">Embodiments of the invention generally relate to a method and system for converting a hydrocarbon feed gas to synthesis gas for use in the production of a liquid hydrocarbon product, particularly a synthetic fuel such as diesel.

The FT synthesis section may also include a Product Workup Unit (PWU) comprising one or more refining units such as hydrorefining unit(s), e.g. a hydrocracking unit, for upgrading the raw hydrocarbon product into the hydrocarbon product. The PWU may be located at the same site as the FT-reactors and other associated units or in a separate location.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">The hydrocarbon product is preferably e a synthetic fuel, such as diesel and/or kerosene. The hydrocarbon product can also be in the form of naphta and/or LPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas). For details on FT synthesis section, reference is given to Steynberg A. and Dry M. &#x201c;Fischer-Tropsch Technology&#x201d;, Studies in Surface Sciences and Catalysts, vol. 152.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">In a conventional SMR, the outlet temperature is often 850-900&#xb0; C. due to mechanical limitations. In the electrical reforming reactor according to the invention, the exit gas temperature can be above 900&#xb0; C., such as above 950&#xb0; C., above 1000&#xb0; C., and even above 1050&#xb0; C. This increases the methane conversion and the higher temperature in itself also decreases the H<sub>2</sub>/CO-ratio. Any of these factors contributes improving the economics of a Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) plant, which in the present context means a plant for converting a hydrocarbon feed gas, preferably natural gas, into a synthesis gas and then converting the synthesis gas into a hydrocarbon product, particularly a synthetic fuel such as diesel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">The electrical reforming reactor also avoids the need for combustion of a carbon rich gas to provide heat for the endothermic steam reforming reaction as in a convention SMR. This reduces the emissions of CO<sub>2 </sub>from the plant and also reduces other emissions associated with combustion such as NO<sub>x </sub>and particles. Furthermore, when the electricity needed for the electrical reforming reactor comes from renewable sources the overall emissions of CO<sub>2 </sub>compared to a conventional SMR and substantially reduced.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0030">The electrical reforming reactor is also significantly more compact than the conventional steam reformer. This has the potential to reduce the overall cost of the plant and thereby also improve economics.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0031">At low plant capacities e.g. below 2000 such as below 1000 barrels hydrocarbon product per day, for instance 300 or 500 barrels per day, it may not be economical to build an Air Separation Unit for a GTL plant.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0032">The use of conventional SMR in connection with the production of synthesis gas for use in the production of hydrocarbon products, is not economically feasible in small scale plants as the capital cost is too high. By the present invention, it is now also possible to more economically design a plant, for instance a plant producing about 300 barrels per day or 500 barrels per day or 1000 barrels of hydrocarbon product per day.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0033">The use of autothermal reforming brings some advantages, particularly when the tail gas produced is recycled to the front-end, i.e. to the reforming section including the reforming reactor and in this case also an autothermal reforming unit. Accordingly, in an embodiment according to the first aspect of the invention, the method further comprises autothermal reforming in an autothermal reforming unit (ATR) after conducting said steam methane reforming for producing said synthesis gas.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0034">In an embodiment according to the first aspect of the invention, the method comprises recycling at least part of said tail gas to upstream said reforming reactor i.e. electrically heated SMR (eSMR) and/or upstream said ATR. This enables further flexibility in the adjustment of the module of said synthesis gas so it is maintained at the desired value&#x2014;this value typically being in the range 1.8-2.2, preferably 1.9-2.1.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0035">By &#x201c;tail gas&#x201d; or &#x201c;FT tail gas&#x201d; is meant off-gas from a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis unit, the tail gas comprising: 5-35% vol. CO, 5-35% vol. H<sub>2</sub>, 5-35% vol. CO<sub>2</sub>, more than 2% vol. CH<sub>4</sub>. The tail gas may also comprise higher hydrocarbons such as ethane and propane and including olefins, as well as argon and nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0036">By the term &#x201c;at least part of said tail gas&#x201d; is meant that all the tail gas or part of it is recycled upstream the reforming reactor or upstream the ATR, or a portion of the tail gas may be recycled to the reforming reactor and another portion to the ATR.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0037">It would also be understood that the term &#x201c;upstream&#x201d;, e.g. &#x201c;upstream the ATR&#x201d; includes also adding the stream directly to the ATR.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0038">Autothermal reforming (ATR), as mentioned previously, is a technology commonly used for the production of synthesis gas (syngas), where the conversion of a hydrocarbon feedstock, such as natural gas, is carried out in a single reactor through the combination of partial combustion and steam reforming. The ATR reactor consists of a burner, a combustion chamber and a fixed bed catalyst section contained in a refractory lined pressure shell. The key elements in the ATR reactor are the burner and the catalyst bed. ATR technology is well-known in the art, for which reference is given to i.a. above mentioned applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 9,828,246.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">In an ATR based layout (method or system, or interchangeably process or plant, respectively) according to what is done today, the ATR feed gas is typically heated to the desired inlet temperature of ca. 500-700&#xb0; C. by a fired heater. This fired heater is fueled by a combustible gas such as the feed gas and/or the tail gas. Hence, the fired heater emits CO<sub>2 </sub>to the atmosphere. Furthermore, the fired heater is typically a capital intensive and large piece of equipment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">In a traditional layout, tail gas is recycled to the ATR in an amount to provide an H<sub>2</sub>/CO-ratio in the synthesis gas of 1.8-2.2, preferably 1.9-2.1 depending upon the nature of the FT-synthesis. Typically, the remaining tail gas is used as fuel or for other energy purposes, e.g. to raise steam or generate electricity and in some cases part of the tail gas is even exported.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">By the present invention, the fired heater is partly or completely replaced by an electrical steam reformer, i.e. the eSMR. The eSMR does not need fuel and will thereby not emit CO<sub>2 </sub>or other environmentally undesirable components such as CO, methane, particles, and NO<sub>x</sub>. If the power for the electrical reformer is produced in part or mainly/exclusively from renewable sources such as wind and/or solar sources, this will also reduce the overall CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">This means that the invention enables a larger part of the produced tail gas can be recycled to the reforming section. Less tail gas is needed to cover the fuel requirements as these are smaller. Recycle of the larger amount of tail gas to the reforming section would in principle lead to an undesirable reduction of the H<sub>2</sub>/CO-ratio in the synthesis gas. However, this can be countered by adjusting the power supplied to the electrically heated reformer. This will typically mean that the duty of the electrical reforming reactor will be higher in comparison with the fired heater in a stand-alone ATR reference case. The increase in duty will at the same time mean that the oxygen consumption in the ATR is reduced compared to the reference case, thereby also reducing capital expenses in connection with the Air Separation Unit (ASU).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">In one embodiment, said reforming reactor i.e. eSMR produces an exit gas, said exit gas has a temperature of 500&#xb0; C. or higher, such as above 550&#xb0; C., above 600&#xb0; C., or about or above 650&#xb0; C. The exit gas from the eSMR is then directed to the ATR for producing said synthesis gas. Compared to the traditional design using a fired heater for conducting preheating, the new approach according to the present invention may save oxygen.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">The normal approach in the art to reduce the oxygen consumption in an ATR plant is to include a heat exchange reformer either in-series or in parallel to the ATR. However, the use of heat exchange reforming involves the risk of metal dusting and high alloy and expensive materials may be needed. The risk of metal dusting is avoided when using an electrical reformer.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">Furthermore, the reduction of oxygen consumption in the ATR is obtained without compromising the quality of the syngas in terms of the H<sub>2</sub>/CO molar ratio, i.e. H<sub>2</sub>/CO molar ratio of 1.8-2.2, preferably 1.9-2.1, in the synthesis gas is maintained. In an embodiment according to the first aspect of the invention, the electrical power supplied is generated at least partly by means of renewable energy sources. Suitable renewable sources are for instance wind i.e. wind power from wind mills and/or solar energy from e.g. solar panels, and water e.g. hydropower. The reforming reactor according to the invention, i.e. the electrically heated steam methane reformer (eSMR), is a very compact steam reforming reactor, resulting in a lower capital investment than classical (conventional) steam reforming equipment. The hydrocarbons in the hydrocarbon feed gas are preferably mainly methane; however, the hydrocarbon feed gas may also comprise small amounts of higher hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon feed gas comes preferably from a methane-rich containing source such as natural gas, but because heating is facilitated by electricity, it will be an improvement over existing or conventional fired reformers, i.e. conventional SMR, by saving the plant CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">In one embodiment according to the first aspect of the invention, the production of hydrocarbon products is regulated according to availability of renewable energy.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">In a typical process for production of hydrocarbon products including the use of autothermal reforming and optionally also conventional steam methane reforming before the autothermal reforming, natural gas, typically a mixture of predominantly methane with some higher hydrocarbons, nitrogen and CO<sub>2</sub>, is used as the only carbon-containing material in the feed to the steam methane reformer. The synthesis gas obtained is not optimal for use in the FT synthesis reaction because of the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio. Therefore, it is normal practice in connection with the use of autothermal reforming, to remove the CO<sub>2</sub>, which is co-produced during the reforming process, and recycle the desired quantity back to the reforming section. The addition of this CO<sub>2 </sub>to the feed changes the H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio. Careful control of the amount of recycled CO<sub>2 </sub>allows a desirable H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio to be achieved.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">By the present invention, the required module of the synthesis gas (H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio i.e. H<sub>2</sub>/CO molar ratio) is also obtained by adding CO<sub>2 </sub>available in the process or imported to the plant to the hydrocarbon feed gas, preferably natural gas, and then reforming the resulting mixture in the eSMR. Also, excess hydrogen may be separated from the synthesis gas.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">Accordingly, in an embodiment according to the first aspect of the invention, the method further comprises:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0050">providing a hydrogen separation unit, such as a hydrogen-membrane unit, downstream the reforming reactor and separating excess hydrogen from the synthesis gas stream, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0051">adding CO2 to the hydrocarbon feed gas, preferably by providing a CO2-removal unit downstream the reforming reactor, separating CO<sub>2 </sub>from the synthesis gas and recycling at least part of said CO<sub>2 </sub>to the hydrocarbon feed gas.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0046" num="0052">Again, this enables simple adjustment the module of said synthesis gas is in the range 1.8-2.2, preferably 1.9-2.1, i.e. the H<sub>2</sub>/CO molar ratio.

Preferably also, the method is conducted without autothermal reforming of the synthesis gas.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0055">In an embodiment according to a first aspect of the invention, a combination of steam superheating and steam generation is integrated in the waste heat recovery of the hot synthesis gas product from the reforming reactor and/or the ATR, and the superheated steam is used as steam feedstock in said step of carrying out said steam methane reforming.

Several different forms and shapes of the macroscopic structure can be used as long as the surface area of the structured catalyst exposed to the gas is as large as possible. In a preferred embodiment, the macroscopic structure has parallel channels, since such parallel channels render a structured catalyst with a very small pressure drop. In a preferred embodiment, parallel longitudinal channels are skewed in the longitudinal direction of the macroscopic structure. In this way, molecules of the gas flowing through the macroscopic structure will mostly tend to hit a wall inside the channels instead of just flowing straight through a channel without necessarily getting into contact with a wall. The dimension of the channels should be appropriate in order to provide a macroscopic structure with a sufficient resistivity. For example, the channels could be quadratic (as seen in cross section perpendicular to the channels) and have a side length of the squares of between 1 and 3 mm; however, channels having a maximum extent in the cross section of up to about 4 cm are conceivable. Moreover, the thickness of the walls should be small enough to provide a relatively large electrical resistance and large enough to provide sufficient mechanical strength. The walls may e.g. have a thickness of between 0.2 and 2 mm, such as about 0.5 mm, and the ceramic coating supported by the walls has a thickness of between 10 &#x3bc;m and 500 &#x3bc;m, such as between 50 &#x3bc;m and 200 &#x3bc;m, such as 100 &#x3bc;m. In another embodiment, the macroscopic structure of the structured catalyst is cross-corrugated. In general, when the macroscopic structure has parallel channels, the pressure drop from the inlet to the outlet of the reforming reactor system may be reduced considerably compared to a reactor where the catalyst material is in the form of pellets such as a standard SMR.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0082">In an embodiment, the macroscopic structure(s) is/are extruded and sintered structures. Alternatively, the macroscopic structure(s) is/are 3D printed structure(s). A 3D printed structure can be provided with or without subsequent sintering. Extruding or 3D printing a macroscopic structure, and optional subsequent sintering thereof results in a uniformly and coherently shaped macroscopic structure, which can afterwards be coated with the ceramic coating.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0083">Preferably, the macroscopic structure has been manufactured by 3D printing or extrusion of a mixture of powdered metallic particles and a binder to an extruded structure and subsequent sintering of the extruded structure, thereby providing a material with a high geometric surface area per volume. Preferably, the 3D printed extruded structure is sintered in a reducing atmosphere to provide the macroscopic structure. Alternatively, the macroscopic structure is 3D printed a metal additive manufacturing melting process, viz. a 3D printing processes, which do not require subsequent sintering, such as powder bed fusion or direct energy deposition processes. Examples of such powder bed fusion or direct energy deposition processes are laser beam, electron beam or plasma 3D printing processes. As another alternative, the macroscopic structure may have been manufactured as a 3D metal structure by means of a binder-based metal additive manufacturing process, and subsequent sintered in a non-oxidizing atmosphere at a first temperature T<sub>1</sub>, where T<sub>1</sub>&#x3e;1000&#xb0; C., in order to provide the macroscopic structure.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0084">A ceramic coating, which may contain the catalytically active material, is provided onto the macroscopic structure before a second sintering in an oxidizing atmosphere, in order to form chemical bonds between the ceramic coating and the macroscopic structure. Alternatively, the catalytically active material may be impregnated onto the ceramic coating after the second sintering. When chemical bonds are formed between the ceramic coating and the macroscopic structure, an especially high heat conductivity between the electrically heated macroscopic structure and the catalytically active material supported by the ceramic coating is possible, offering close and nearly direct contact between the heat source and the catalytically active material of the structured catalyst. Due to close proximity between the heat source and the catalytically active material, the heat transfer is effective, so that the structured catalyst can be very efficiently heated. A compact reforming reactor system in terms of gas processing per reforming reactor system volume is thus possible, and therefore the reforming reactor system housing the structured catalyst may be compact. The reforming reactor system of the invention does not need a furnace and this reduces the overall reactor size considerably. Moreover, it is an advantage that the amount of synthesis gas produced in a single pressure shell is increased considerably compared to known tubular steam reformers. In a standard tubular steam reformer, the amount of synthesis gas produced in a single tube of the tubular steam reformer is up to 500 Nm<sup>3</sup>/h. In comparison, the reforming reactor of the invention is arranged to produce up to or more than 2000 Nm<sup>3</sup>/h, e.g. even up to or more than 10000 Nm<sup>3</sup>/h, within a single pressure shell. This can be done without the presence of O<sub>2 </sub>in the feed gas and with less than 10% methane in the synthesis gas produced. When a single pressure shell houses catalyst for producing up to 10000 Nm<sup>3</sup>/h synthesis gas, it is no longer necessary to provide a plurality of pressure shells or means for distributing feed gas to a plurality of such separate pressure shells.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0085">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;3D print&#x201d; and &#x201c;3D printing&#x201d; is meant to denote a metal additive manufacturing process. Such metal additive manufacturing processes cover 3D printing processes in which material is joined to a structure under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, where the structure is to be solidified, e.g. by sintering, to provide the macroscopic structure. Moreover, such metal additive manufacturing processes cover 3D printing processes, which do not require subsequent sintering, such as powder bed fusion or direct energy deposition processes. Examples of such powder bed fusion or direct energy deposition processes are laser beam, electron beam or plasma 3D printing processes.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0086">Preferably, the catalytically active material is particles having a size from 5 nm to 250 nm. The ceramic coating may for example be an oxide comprising Al, Zr, Mg, Ce and/or</p><p id="p-0080" num="0087">Ca. Exemplary coatings are calcium aluminate or a magnesium aluminum spinel. Such a ceramic coating may comprise further elements, such as La, Y, Ti, K or combinations thereof. Preferably, the conductors are made of different materials than the macroscopic structure. The conductors may for example be of iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, silver or an alloy thereof. The ceramic coating is an electrically insulating material and will typically have a thickness in the range of around 100 &#x3bc;m, e.g. about 10-500 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0088">The macroscopic structure is advantageously a coherent or consistently intra-connected material in order to achieve electrical conductivity throughout the macroscopic structure, and thereby achieve thermal conductivity throughout the structured catalyst and in particular providing heating of the a catalytically active material supported by the macroscopic structure. By using the coherent or consistently intra-connected material, it is possible to ensure uniform distribution of current within the macroscopic structure and thus uniform distribution of heat within the structured catalyst. Throughout this text, the term &#x201c;coherent&#x201d; is meant to be synonymous to cohesive and thus refer to a material that is consistently intra-connected or consistently coupled. The effect of the structured catalyst being a coherent or consistently intra-connected material is that a control over the connectivity within the material of the structured catalyst and thus the conductivity of the macroscopic structure is obtained. It is to be noted that even if further modifications of the macroscopic structure are carried out, such as provision of slits within parts of the macroscopic structure or the implementation of insulating material within the macroscopic structure, the macroscopic structure is still denoted a coherent or consistently intra-connected material.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0089">In an embodiment, the structured catalyst has electrically insulating parts arranged to increase the current path between the conductors to a length larger than the largest dimension of the structured catalyst. The provision of a current path between the conductors larger than the largest dimension of the structured catalyst may be by provision of electrically insulating parts positioned between the conductors and preventing the current running through some part of the structured catalyst. Such electrically insulating parts are arranged to increase the current path and thus increase the resistance through the structured catalyst. In an embodiment, the at least one electrically insulating part has a length arranged to ensure that the minimum current path between the conductors is larger than the largest dimension of the macroscopic structure.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0090">Non-limiting examples of such insulating parts are cuts, slits, or holes in the structure. Optionally, a solid insulating material such as ceramics in cuts or slits in the structure can be used. In a case where the solid insulating material is a porous ceramic material, the catalytically active material may advantageously be incorporated in the pores, by e.g. impregnation. A solid insulating material within a cut or slit assists in keeping the parts of the structured catalyst on the sides of the cut or slit from each other. As used herein, the term &#x201c;largest dimension of the structured catalyst&#x201d; is meant to denote the largest inner dimension of the geometrical form taken up by the structured catalyst. If the structured catalyst is box-formed, the largest dimension would be the diagonal from one corner to the farthest corner, also denoted the space diagonal.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0091">It should be noted that even though the current through the structured catalyst may be arranged to twist or wind its way through the structured catalyst due to the electrically insulating parts arranged to increase the current path, the gas passing through the reforming reactor system is inlet at one end of the reforming reactor system, passes through the structured catalyst once before being outlet from the reforming reactor system. Inert material is advantageously present in relevant gaps between the structured catalyst and the rest of the reforming reactor system to ensure that the gas within the reforming reactor system passes through the structured catalyst and the catalytically active material supported thereby.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0092">In an embodiment according to the second aspect of the invention, the length of the gas passage through the structured catalyst is less than the length of the passage of current from one conductor through the structured catalyst and to the next conductor. The ratio of the length of the gas passage to the length of the current passage may be less than 0.6, or 0.3, 0.1, or even down to 0.002.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0093">In an embodiment, the structured catalyst has electrically insulating parts arranged to make the current path through the structured catalyst a zigzag path. Here, the terms &#x201c;zigzag path&#x201d; and &#x201c;zigzag route&#x201d; is meant to denote a path that has corners at variable angles tracing a path from one conductor to another. A zigzag path is for example a path going upwards, turning, and subsequently going downwards. A zigzag path may have many turns, going upwards and subsequently downwards many times through the structured catalyst, even though one turn is enough to make the path a zigzag path.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0094">In an embodiment according to the second aspect of the invention, the reforming reactor comprises at least two conductors electrically connected to said structured catalyst and to an electrical power supply placed outside said pressure shell, wherein said electrical power supply is dimensioned to heat at least part of said structured catalyst to a temperature of at least 500&#xb0; C. by passing an electrical current through said macroscopic structure, wherein said at least two conductors are connected to the structured catalyst at a position on the structured catalyst closer to said first end of said structured catalyst than to said second end of said structured catalyst, and wherein the structured catalyst is constructed to direct an electrical current to run from one conductor substantially to the second end of the structured catalyst and return to a second of said at least two conductors.

The eSMR <b>70</b> comprises a structured catalyst <b>72</b>. The structured catalyst <b>72</b> comprises a macroscopic structure <b>74</b> that is coated with a ceramic coating impregnated with catalytically active material. Within the structured catalyst <b>72</b> are channels <b>74</b> extending along the longitudinal direction z of the macroscopic structure. The channels are defined by walls <b>76</b>. These walls define a number of parallel, preferably square channels <b>74</b> when seen from the direction of flow as indicated by the arrows <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>. The structured catalyst <b>72</b> has a substantially square perimeter when seen from above, defined by the edge lengths e<b>1</b> and e<b>2</b>. However, the perimeter could also be circular or another shape.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0103">The walls <b>76</b> of the structured catalyst <b>72</b> are of extruded material coated with a ceramic coating, e.g. an oxide, which has been coated onto the macroscopic structure. In the figure, the ceramic coating is not shown. The ceramic coating is impregnated with catalytically active material. The ceramic coating and thus the catalytically active material are present on every wall within the structured catalyst <b>72</b> over which the gas flow flows during operation and interacts with the heated surface of the structured catalyst and the catalytically active material.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0104">Thus, during use in a reactor system for steam reforming, a hydrocarbon feed gas flows through the channels <b>74</b> and interacts with the heated surface of the structured catalyst and with the catalytically active material supported by the ceramic coating.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0105">In the structured catalyst <b>72</b>, a slit <b>82</b> has been cut into the structured catalyst <b>72</b>. This slit <b>82</b> forces a current to take a zigzag route, in this instance downwards and subsequently upwards, within the macroscopic structure thereby increasing the current path and thus the resistance and consequently the heat dissipated within the macroscopic structure. The slit <b>82</b> within the macroscopic structure may be provided with embedded insulating material in order to ensure that no current flows in the transverse direction of the slit <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0106">The channels <b>74</b> in the structured catalyst are open in both ends. In use of the structured catalyst in a reactor system, a hydrocarbon feed gas flows through the unit and gets heated via contact with the walls <b>76</b> of the channels <b>74</b> and by heat radiation. The heat initiates the desired steam reforming process. The walls <b>76</b> of the channels <b>74</b> may e.g. have a thickness of 0.5 mm, and the ceramic coating coated onto the walls <b>75</b> may e.g. have a thickness of 0.1 mm. Even though the arrows <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> indicate that the flow of the hydrocarbon feed gas is down-flow, the opposite flow direction, viz. an up-flow, is also conceivable.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0107">Connectors <b>84</b> are attached the structured catalyst <b>72</b>. The connectors <b>84</b> each connects a part of the structured catalyst <b>72</b> to a conductor <b>86</b>. The conductors <b>86</b> are both connected to a power supply (not shown). Each of the connectors <b>84</b> are connected to an upper part of the structured catalyst. When the conductors <b>86</b> are connected to a power supply, an electrical current is led to the corresponding connector <b>84</b> via the conductor and runs through the structured catalyst <b>72</b>. The slit <b>82</b> hinders the current flow in a transverse direction (horizontal direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) throughout its lengths along the height h of the structured catalyst <b>72</b>. Therefore, the current runs in a direction downwards as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in the part of the structured catalyst <b>72</b> along the slit <b>82</b>, subsequently it runs transversely to the longitudinal direction below the slit <b>82</b> and finally the current runs upwards in the longitudinal direction of the structured catalyst to the other connector <b>84</b>. The connectors <b>84</b> are mechanically fastened to the structured catalyst by means of i.a. mechanical fastening means such as screws and bolts <b>88</b>. However, additional or alternative fastening means are conceivable. In an embodiment, the electrical power supply generates a voltage of 3V and a current of 400 A. The connectors <b>84</b> are e.g. made in materials like iron, aluminum, nickel, copper, or alloys thereof.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0108">As mentioned, the structured catalyst <b>72</b> is coated with a ceramic coating, such as an oxide, supporting the catalytically active material. However, the parts of the structured catalyst <b>72</b> which are connected to the connectors <b>84</b> should not be coated with an oxide. Instead, the macroscopic structure of the structured catalyst should be exposed or connected directly to the connectors <b>84</b> in order to obtain a good electrical connection between the macroscopic structure and the connector.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0109">When the connectors <b>84</b> and thus the conductors <b>86</b> are connected to the same end of the structured catalyst, i.e. the upper end as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the gas entering into a reactor system housing the structured catalyst <b>72</b> would be able to cool the connectors <b>84</b> and the conductors <b>86</b>. For instance, the hydrocarbon gas entering into such a reactor system would have a temperature of 400&#xb0; C. or 500&#xb0; C. and would thus keep the connectors <b>84</b> and conductors <b>86</b> from reaching temperatures much higher than this temperature.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0110">Hence, in the embodiment of the eSMR of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the conductors <b>86</b> are located at one side of the reactor. The current flows from the one conductor to a second side of the reactor structure and then to the second conductor. The feed gas inlet is located at the first side and the gas outlet is located at the second side. Thereby it is possible to protect the connections between the conductors <b>86</b> and catalyst as well as precise control of the temperature of the synthesis gas produced.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0111">Higher temperatures can be reached in an eSMR compared with a fired reformer (conventional SMR), which gives a better conversion of methane in this layout. It should be noted, that the CO<sub>2 </sub>content in process gas can vary, and therefore, an addition CO<sub>2 </sub>and/or CO, e.g. from the FT tail gas, to the synthesis gas can be advantageous.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0112">Electrically heated reforming can e.g. use a monolithic-type catalyst heated directly by Joule heating to supply the heat for the reaction. In its essence, the eSMR <b>70</b> is envisioned as a pressure shell having a centrally placed catalytic monolith, which is connected to an externally placed power supply by a conductor threaded through a dielectric fitting in the shell. The shell of the eSMR is refractory lined to confine the high-temperature zone to the center of the eSMR.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0113">From a reforming reactor point of view, the eSMR has several advantages over a conventional fired reformer. One of the most apparent is the ability to make a significantly more compact reactor design when using electrically heated technology, as the reforming reactor no longer is confined to a system of high external heat transfer area. A size reduction of two orders of magnitudes is conceivable. This translates into a significantly lower capital investment of this technology. The combined preheating and reforming section of an eSMR (including power supply) configuration was estimated to have a significant lower capital investment. As the synthesis gas preparation section of a FT synthesis plant, accounts for more than 60% of the capital investment in a classical fired reformer based GTL plant, a drastic saving on the reformer equipment will translate into a significant reduction in the cost of a plant based on eSMR.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0114">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a cross section through an embodiment of an eSMR <b>700</b> according to the invention.
