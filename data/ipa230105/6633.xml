However, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A. Composite Substrate</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view for illustrating the schematic configuration of a composite substrate according to one embodiment of the present invention. A composite substrate <b>100</b> includes a piezoelectric layer <b>10</b>, a reflective layer <b>20</b>, and a support substrate <b>30</b> in the stated order. The reflective layer <b>20</b> includes a high-impedance layer having a relatively high acoustic impedance and a low-impedance layer having a relatively low acoustic impedance. The reflective layer <b>20</b> is a laminate of a plurality of impedance layers, and for example, the high-impedance layer and the low-impedance layer are alternately laminated. In the illustrated example, the reflective layer <b>20</b> includes a low-impedance layer <b>21</b>, a high-impedance layer <b>22</b>, a low-impedance layer <b>23</b>, a high-impedance layer <b>24</b>, a low-impedance layer <b>25</b>, a high-impedance layer <b>26</b>, a low-impedance layer <b>27</b>, and a high-impedance layer <b>28</b> in the stated order from the piezoelectric layer <b>10</b> side. In the illustrated example, the low-impedance layer <b>21</b> out of the respective layers of the reflective layer <b>20</b> is arranged on the side closest to the piezoelectric layer <b>10</b>. The arrangement of the reflective layer <b>20</b> having such laminated structure can effectively confine the energy of an elastic wave to the piezoelectric layer <b>10</b> side.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrated example, the reflective layer <b>20</b> is a laminate of a total of 8 layers, that is, the 4 high-impedance layers and the 4 low-impedance layers. However, the number of the impedance layers in the reflective layer is not limited thereto. Specifically, the reflective layer only needs to include at least one high-impedance layer and at least one low-impedance layer, the layers being different from each other in acoustic impedance. The reflective layer preferably has a multilayer structure including 4 or more layers.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The composite substrate <b>100</b> may further include any appropriate layer (not shown). The kinds, functions, number, combination, arrangement, and the like of such layers may be appropriately set in accordance with purposes. For example, the composite substrate <b>100</b> may include a joining layer arranged between the reflective layer <b>20</b> and the support substrate <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The composite substrate <b>100</b> may be produced in any appropriate shape. In one embodiment, the substrate may be produced in the form of a so-called wafer. The size of the composite substrate <b>100</b> may be appropriately set in accordance with purposes. For example, the diameter of the wafer is from 50 mm to 150 mm.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A-1. Piezoelectric Layer</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Any appropriate piezoelectric material may be used as a material for forming the piezoelectric layer. A single crystal having the composition of LiAO<sub>3 </sub>is preferably used as the piezoelectric material. Herein, A represents one or more kinds of elements selected from the group consisting of: niobium; and tantalum. Specifically, LiAO<sub>3 </sub>may be lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>), lithium tantalate (LiTaO<sub>3</sub>), or a lithium niobate-lithium tantalate solid solution.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the piezoelectric material is lithium tantalate, a layer whose normal direction is rotated about X-axis of the piezoelectric material, which is the direction in which a surface acoustic wave propagates, from Y-axis thereof to Z-axis thereof by from 123&#xb0; to 133&#xb0; (e.g., 128&#xb0;) is preferably used as the piezoelectric layer from the viewpoint of reducing a propagation loss. When the piezoelectric material is lithium niobate, a layer whose normal direction is rotated about X-axis of the piezoelectric material, which is the direction in which a surface acoustic wave propagates, from Y-axis thereof to Z-axis thereof by from 86&#xb0; to 94&#xb0; (e.g., 90&#xb0;) is preferably used as the piezoelectric layer from the viewpoint of reducing a propagation loss.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The thickness of the piezoelectric layer is, for example, 0.2 &#x3bc;m or more and 30 &#x3bc;m or less.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A-2. Reflective Layer</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As described above, the reflective layer includes the high-impedance layer and the low-impedance layer different from each other in acoustic impedance. The acoustic impedance of the high-impedance layer is relatively higher than the acoustic impedance of the low-impedance layer. Specifically, the acoustic impedance of a material for forming the high-impedance layer is higher than the acoustic impedance of a material for forming the low-impedance layer.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The plurality of high-impedance layers in the reflective layer may be identical to each other in configuration (e.g., material, structure state, or thickness), or may be different from each other in configuration. Similarly, the plurality of low-impedance layers in the reflective layer may be identical to each other in configuration (e.g., material, structure state, or thickness), or may be different from each other in configuration.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Examples of the material for forming the high-impedance layer include hafnium oxide, tantalum oxide, zirconium oxide, and aluminum oxide. Of those, hafnium oxide is preferably used. The use of hafnium oxide can more effectively confine the energy of an elastic wave to the piezoelectric layer side. In one embodiment, the content of hafnium oxide in the high-impedance layer is, for example, 97 wt % or more.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The thickness of the high-impedance layer is preferably 1 &#x3bc;m or less, more preferably 500 nm or less, still more preferably 300 nm or less. Such thickness can provide a composite substrate that is more excellent in heat resistance. Meanwhile, the thickness of the high-impedance layer is, for example, 0.01 &#x3bc;m or more, preferably 20 nm or more, more preferably 100 nm or more.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The high-impedance layer has the region of first structures. The first structures are, for example, columnar structures or granular structures. Herein, the columnar structures are each formed of a structural body (columnar body) extending in a direction having an angle with respect to the substrate surface (in-plane direction) of the composite substrate, and their column diameters are, for example, 5 nm or more. Meanwhile, the granular structures are each formed of a substantially spherical structural body. Such structures may be observed by, for example, observation with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The column diameter may not be satisfied at all the positions of the columnar body to be observed in its thickness direction.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first structures may be interspersed, or may be unevenly distributed in the thickness direction of the high-impedance layer. In one embodiment, the first structures are unevenly distributed from an interface with an adjacent layer or an air layer toward the other interface in the thickness direction of the high-impedance layer. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the high-impedance layer has: a region <b>71</b> positioned on one interface <b>51</b> side, the region including the first structures; and a region <b>72</b> positioned on the other interface <b>52</b> side, the region including second structures. The region <b>71</b> and the region <b>72</b> are continuously formed, and a boundary (interface) between the region <b>71</b> and the region <b>72</b> is represented by a broken line. The second structures have structures having shapes different from those of the first structures, and are, for example, granular structures or columnar structures. The high-impedance layer may include any other structure. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the columnar structures are mainly observed in the region <b>71</b>, and the granular structures are mainly observed in the region <b>72</b>. Specifically, it can be said that the region <b>71</b> is a columnar construction including a plurality of columnar structural bodies, and it can be said that the region <b>72</b> is a granular construction including a plurality of granular structural bodies. In such form, the problems of peeling and cracking to be described later tend to be liable to occur.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The ratio of the region of the first structures in the high-impedance layer is more than 70%, preferably 75% or more, more preferably 80% or more, still more preferably 90% or more. When the ratio falls within such ranges, a composite substrate excellent in heat resistance can be obtained. Specifically, the first structures and the second structures differ from each other in stress caused by heating or the like (e.g., a tensile stress may occur in a columnar structure and a compressive stress may occur in a granular structure), and at an interface between the first structures and the second structures, their respective stresses may concentrate. Peeling and cracking are liable to be caused by a thermal history at such interface. However, when the ratio of the region of the first structures is set within the above-mentioned ranges, the influences of the respective stresses are reduced, and hence the occurrence of the peeling and the cracking by the thermal history can be suppressed. As described above, one feature of the present invention lies in that attention is paid to the occurrence of the peeling and the cracking, and a structure state in the layer. It is preferred that in each of all the high-impedance layers in the reflective layer, the ratio of the region of the first structures be more than 70%. This is because the peeling and the cracking in the layer may occur irrespective of the position of the layer in the composite substrate (reflective layer).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The ratio of the region of the second structures in the high-impedance layer is preferably less than 30%, more preferably 25% or less, still more preferably 20% or less, particularly preferably 10% or less.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The ratio of the region of the first structures in the high-impedance layer may be identified by, for example, SEM observation. In one embodiment, the ratio may be determined by: measuring the maximum and minimum of distances (thicknesses) from the one interface <b>51</b> to the region <b>72</b> including the second structures; averaging the measured values to determine the thickness of the region of the first structures; and calculating the ratio of the thickness to the thickness of the high-impedance layer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A typical example of the material for forming the low-impedance layer is silicon oxide. The low-impedance layer typically has the region of granular structures.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The thickness of the low-impedance layer is, fo example, from 0.01 &#x3bc;m to 1 &#x3bc;m, preferably from 20 nm to 500 nm, more preferably from 100 nm to 300 nm.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The impedance layers may be formed by any appropriate method. The layers may be formed by, for example, physical vapor deposition, such as sputtering or ion beam-assisted deposition (IAD), chemical vapor deposition, or an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The impedance layers may each be formed by, for example, sputtering a target containing the oxide. The structure state of each of the impedance layers may be controlled by, for example, adjusting a pressure in a space for forming the impedance layer. In one embodiment, the pressure in the layer-forming space is set to 0.15 Pa or more and less than 0.30 Pa. In another embodiment, the pressure in the layer-forming space is set to more than 0.50 Pa and 0.80 Pa or less. A layer-forming temperature is, for example, from normal temperature to 200&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A-3. Support Substrate</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Any appropriate substrate may be used as the support substrate <b>30</b>. The support substrate may include a single crystalline substance, or may include a polycrystalline substance.

At the time of the direct joining, the joining surfaces are preferably activated by any appropriate activation treatment. The direct joining is performed by, for example, activating a surface <b>40</b>a of the joining layer <b>40</b>, activating a surface <b>30</b>a of the support substrate <b>30</b>, then bringing the activated surface of the joining layer <b>40</b> and the activated surface of the support substrate <b>30</b> into contact with each other, and pressurizing the resultant. Thus, a composite substrate <b>110</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is obtained. The second main surface <b>12</b>b of the piezoelectric layer precursor <b>12</b> of the resultant composite substrate <b>110</b> is typically subjected to processing (not shown), such as grinding or polishing, so that a piezoelectric layer having the above-mentioned desired thickness may be obtained.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The surface of each layer (specifically, the piezoelectric layer or the piezoelectric layer precursor, the reflective layer, the support substrate, or the joining layer) is preferably a flat surface.

A specific example of the scrub washing is a method including washing the surface in a scrub washing machine with a detergent (e.g., a SUNWASH series manufactured by Lion Corporation) and then with a solvent (e.g., a mixed solution of acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA)).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The activation treatment is typically performed by irradiating the joining surface with a neutralized beam. The activation treatment is preferably performed by generating the neutralized beam with an apparatus such as an apparatus described in JP 2014-086400 A, and irradiating the joining surface with the beam. Specifically, a saddle-field fast atomic beam source is used as a beam source, and an inert gas, such as argon or nitrogen, is introduced into the chamber of the apparatus, followed by the application of a high voltage from the DC power source thereof to an electrode thereof. Thus, a saddle-field electric field is generated between the electrode (positive electrode) and the casing (negative electrode) thereof to cause electron motion, to thereby generate the beams of an atom and an ion by the inert gas. Of the beams that have reached the grid of the fast atomic beam source, an ion beam is neutralized by the grid, and hence the beam of a neutral atom is emitted from the fast atomic beam source. The voltage at the time of the activation treatment by the beam irradiation is preferably set to from 0.5 kV to 2.0 kV, and a current at the time of the activation treatment by the beam irradiation is preferably set to from 50 mA to 200 mA.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The joining surfaces are preferably brought into contact with each other and pressurized in a vacuum atmosphere.
