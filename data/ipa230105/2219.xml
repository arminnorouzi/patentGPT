level="1">Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a process for producing and for regenerating siloxane hydrogen carrier compounds. The present invention also relates to siloxane hydrogen carrier compounds and to a method for producing hydrogen from said siloxane hydrogen carrier compounds.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The ability to store, transport and release hydrogen in a safe, convenient, and environment-friendly manner source and to produce and store hydrogen efficiently, economically and safely, are main challenges to be overcome in order to democratize the use of hydrogen as an energy vector.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently hydrogen is mainly delivered either by pipeline, by tube trailers as a compressed gas or by special tankers in its liquefied form.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are typically six routes for hydrogen delivery: it can be transported as a gas by pipeline, it can be produced on site, it can be transported as a compressed gas in tube trailers (for example as disclosed in WO2013/109918 (A1)), it can be transported as a condensed liquid in cryogenic trucks (for example as disclosed in WO2011/141287 (A1)), it can be stored in a solid-state hydrogen carrier material and released on-site (for example as disclosed in WO2009/080986 (A2)), and stored in a liquid-state hydrogen carrier material and released on-site.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hydrogen can be produced on-site by two means. It can be produced on site by one process and directly consumed in another process which is defined as captive hydrogen. The other mean of on-site production is by water electrolysis, which produces hydrogen from water and electricity. It can be considered producing an environment-friendly hydrogen if powered by renewable energy.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition to incumbent delivery solutions which are cryogenic and compressed hydrogen, alternative solutions are emerging to provide hydrogen:hydrogen carriers. Hydrogen carriers are either solid-state or liquid-state materials that have the ability to store hydrogen and release it when needed. They bring advantages either for transport or storage, compared to incumbent solutions. Solid-state carriers include metallic hydrides enabling the uptake of hydrogen, by adsorption onto metal particles resulting in metal hydride. Among them, the magnesium hydride is stable at low pressure and standard temperature, making it convenient to transport and store. When needed, the material is heated to release the hydrogen gas. Solid-state solutions have been identified as best suited for same-site reversible processes of energy storage from renewable energies. Indeed, handling solid materials is not as convenient as handling gas or liquid ones.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Liquid hydrogen carriers can be any liquid-state material able to release hydrogen under specific conditions. The class of Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) is the most represented among the liquid hydrogen carriers. During the process called hydrogenation, which is a catalytic reaction, requiring energy in the form of heat, hydrogen is chemically bonded to the liquid organic carrier. Typically the carrier, being unsaturated and/or aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, is reacted with hydrogen to produce the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon, to be transported in a liquid-state at standard temperature and pressure, for example as described in WO2014/082801 (A1) or WO2015/146170 (A1). Although the amount of hydrogen to be stored in LOHC depends on the yield of the hydrogenation process it is up to 7.2% mass of hydrogen contained per mass of liquid carrier. Then the hydrogen is released from the saturated hydrocarbons by a process called dehydrogenation, which is a catalytic reaction, requiring additional energy in the form of heat (above 300&#xb0; C. typically) due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. In order to produce on-demand hydrogen, heat may be produced from grid electricity (without control on its origin and on its impact on the environment) or heat may be retrieved by burning a part of the organic carrier.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent applications WO2010070001 (A1) and EP2206679 (A1) relate to a method for producing hydrogen comprising the steps consisting in: a) reacting a compound (C) comprising one or more groups Si&#x2014;H with a fluoride ions source, thereby forming hydrogen and a by-product (C1); and b) recovering the obtained hydrogen. All the examples use silane compounds as hydrogen carriers; with the proviso of polymethylhydrosiloxane (&#x201c;PHMS&#x201d;) in examples 1-2 and tetramethyldisiloxane in example 8.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent application WO2011098614 (A1) relates to a method for producing hydrogen comprising the steps of: i) contacting a compound (C) comprising one or more groups Si&#x2014;H with a phosphorous based catalyst in the presence of a base in water as solvent, thereby forming hydrogen and a by-product (C1) without requiring any energy input (e.g. heat, electrical power, etc. . . . ); and ii) recovering the obtained hydrogen. All the examples use silane compounds as hydrogen carriers; tetramethyldisiloxane is the only siloxane containing compound recited in the lists of potential hydrogen carrier. WO2011098614 (A1) also discloses a step c) of recycling the obtained by-product (C1) with an acyl halide and contacting the obtained product with a metal hydride, thereby regenerating compound (C), wherein the acyl halide is CH<sub>3</sub>C(&#x2550;O)Cl and the metal hydride is LiAlH<sub>4</sub>. Patent application WO2010094785 (A1) relates to a method for producing hydrogen comprising the steps of: i) contacting a compound (C) comprising one or more groups Si&#x2014;H with an amine based catalyst in a solvent selected from an alcohol or an aqueous solution, thereby forming hydrogen and a by-product (C1) without requiring any energy input (e.g. heat, electrical power etc. . . . ); and ii) recovering the obtained hydrogen. Most of the examples use silane compounds as hydrogen carriers; with the proviso of polymethylhydrosiloxane (&#x201c;PHMS&#x201d;) in example 12 and tetramethyldisiloxane in example 16. WO2010094785 (A1) also discloses a step c) of recycling the obtained by-product (C1) with an acyl halide and contacting the obtained product with a metal hydride, thereby regenerating compound (C), wherein the acyl halide is CH<sub>3</sub>C(&#x2550;O)Cl and the metal hydride is LiAlH<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Whilst WO2010070001 (A1), EP2206679 (A1), WO2011098614 (A1) and WO2010094785 (A1) already represent a breakthrough in the field of hydrogen-based carrier system that releases hydrogen on-demand, said techniques would still benefit from improved efficiency, performance, and cost effectiveness; in addition, since the overall regeneration method of the hydrogen-based carrier according to both WO2011098614 (A1) and WO2010094785 (A1) requires the use of the expensive LiAlH<sub>4 </sub>reducing agent leading to aluminium oxide by-products, which retreatment process is energy-consuming (a lot of electricity is needed for the electrolysis step), is polluting, and releases carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), fluorinated effluents and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), there is still some progress to be made in order to develop a more environmentally friendly and carbon-free regeneration method applicable to hydrogen-based carrier. Thus, there remains a need for further improvements in efficiency, performance, and cost effectiveness of such clean energy vectors, for a variety of applications, such as hydrogen delivery and hydrogen infrastructure building. There remains a need for improvements which exhibit greater amounts of hydrogen to be transported, enhanced efficiency, performance and that are cost effective. There remains a critical need for environment-friendly liquid-state hydrogen carriers that are able to release on-demand hydrogen without the need for additional energy. In addition, there remains a need for an integrated clean process wherein hydrogen carriers can not only be used as a valuable hydrogen source but also be produced without requiring carbon containing reactant and/or without carbon emissions, and also be regenerated from the by-products of the hydrogen separation environmentally friendly and without substantial carbon emissions, preferably without
