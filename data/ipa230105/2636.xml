The optical semiconductor device <b>100</b> of the present embodiment includes a light-emitting element <b>2</b> having a rectangular shape in a plan view, a pair of lead frames <b>10</b> (hereinafter also simply referred to as &#x201c;lead frames <b>10</b>&#x201d;) constituted of a plate-shaped metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device, and a resin-molded body <b>3</b> in which a portion of the lead frames <b>10</b> is embedded.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The resin-molded body <b>3</b> can be made of a resin composite containing a thermoplastic resin or a thermosetting resin. The resin-molded body <b>3</b> can contain a filler such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, which will be described below, mixed in the resin composite. The filler may be a reflective material adapted to reflect light emitted from the light-emitting element <b>2</b>. The resin-molded body <b>3</b> has a recess having a bottom surface and lateral surfaces. The bottom surface of the recess is defined by a portion of the pair of lead frames <b>10</b>, and the lateral surfaces of the recess is formed by a lateral wall portion <b>31</b> that serves as reflection surfaces inclined at predetermined angles. The gap between the pair of lead frames <b>10</b> is filled with the resin composite constituting the resin-molded body <b>3</b> to constitute a portion <b>32</b> of the bottom surface of the resin-molded body <b>3</b>. The resin-molded body <b>3</b> of the present embodiment is longer in the lateral direction in a plan view. A portion of each of the pair of plate-shaped lead frames <b>10</b> is exposed on outer surfaces of the resin-molded body <b>3</b> to serve as external terminals, and the external terminals are bent along the lower surface of the resin-molded body <b>3</b>. The light-emitting element <b>2</b> is mounted on one of the lead frames <b>10</b> constituting the bottom surface of the recess. The light-emitting element <b>2</b> is covered with a sealing member <b>5</b>. The sealing member <b>5</b> contains, for example, a sealing material and a phosphor adapted to convert wavelength of light emitted from the light-emitting element <b>2</b>. The material of the sealing member <b>5</b> preferably contains a light-transmissive resin. The phosphor is adapted to be excited by light emitted from the light-emitting element <b>2</b> and, to convert wavelength of the light emitted from the light-emitting element <b>2</b>, and to emit with at least one peak emission wavelength within a predetermined wavelength range. The light-emitting element <b>2</b> includes a pair of positive and negative electrodes each of which is electrically connected to a corresponding one of the pair of lead frames <b>10</b> by wires <b>6</b>. When electricity is supplied from an external device through the pair of lead frames <b>10</b>, light can be emitted from the optical semiconductor device <b>100</b>. The lead frames <b>10</b> or a base body constituted of the metal structure for an optical semiconductor device described in an embodiment described below includes, for example, portions that are in contact with a member, such as the resin-molded body <b>3</b> and the sealing member <b>5</b>, made of a resin material. In this case, a package including the metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device and the resin-molded body <b>3</b> constitutes the present embodiment, the metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device constituting the lead frames <b>10</b> or the base body. In the package, adhesion between the metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device constituting the lead frames <b>10</b> or the base body and the resin-molded body <b>3</b> has been improved. Details of the metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device constituting the lead frames <b>10</b> or the base body will be described below. In the present specification, the resin material refers to a material containing at least a resin. Examples of the resin material include a resin composite containing resin.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The lead frames <b>10</b> constituted of the metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device function as a mounting member on which the light-emitting element <b>2</b> is mounted, a reflection member that reflects light emitted from the light-emitting element <b>2</b>, and an electrically-conductive member electrically connected to the light-emitting element <b>2</b>. Further, the lead frames <b>10</b> may also function as a heat dissipation member that dissipates heat generated from the light-emitting element <b>2</b>. The lead frames <b>10</b> constituted of the metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device may be disposed below the light-emitting element <b>2</b> as in the first embodiment or may have the shape of a reflector surrounding the light-emitting element <b>2</b>. The lead frames <b>10</b> may be plate-shaped lead frames.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, the metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device includes an outermost layer <b>1</b><i>d </i>made of gold, silver, a gold alloy, or a silver alloy immersed in and/or applied with a solution containing a polyallylamine polymer, which provides good adhesion to resin, so that adhesion to, for example, the sealing member <b>5</b> and the resin-molded body <b>3</b> in the optical semiconductor device <b>100</b> can be increased. The outermost layer <b>1</b><i>d </i>may be formed by a known surface treatment without specific limitations, such as plating (electroplating, electroless plating, hot dipping, sputtering, and vapor deposition including physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition) and thermal spraying. In general, in an optical semiconductor device, the content of a filler such as TiO<sub>2 </sub>in the resin-molded body may be increased in order to increase the reflectance of the resin-molded body to increase the total luminous flux, or the content of a phosphor in the sealing member may be increased to improve the color rendering properties. Addition of a large amount of such an impurity to a resin material tends to cause reduction in the adhesion between the lead frames and the resin material in the optical semiconductor device. On the other hand, in the optical semiconductor device <b>100</b> of the present embodiment, adhesion between the resin material and the lead frames <b>10</b> constituted of the metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device is increased, so that, in a step of solder-reflow mounting the optical semiconductor device <b>100</b> employing the lead frames <b>10</b> on a printed circuit board, solder can be prevented from entering the optical semiconductor device <b>100</b>, and the sealing material can be prevented from leaking out of the resin-molded body <b>3</b>, even in the case in which the content of impurities such as titanium oxide and a phosphor) in the resin material is increased. Details of the solution containing a polyallylamine polymer will be described below.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device includes the outermost layer <b>1</b><i>d </i>made of gold, silver, a gold alloy, or a silver alloy immersed in and/or applied with the solution containing a polyallylamine polymer. Therefore, even in the case in which outermost layer is a silver or silver alloy plating layer, discoloration due to sulfurization or oxidation can be reduced to inhibit reduction in the luminous flux resulting from discoloration due to sulfurization or oxidation, so that a high luminous flux can be retained.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Second Embodiment: (First) Metal Structure for Optical Semiconductor Device</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The metal structure <b>1</b> for an optical semiconductor device can be used for a lead frame or a base body.

For example, 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-thiol sodium salt is on the market from Sankyo Kasei Co., Ltd. under the commercial name of Santhiol and is easily available.
