Wireless protocols for transmission of security information permit placement of a multitude of security sensors throughout a residence without a need for running wires back to a central control panel. Inexpensive wireless cameras also allow for placement of cameras throughout a residence to enable easy monitoring of the residence. A variety of home automation control protocols have also been developed to allow for centralized remote control of lights, appliances, and environmental apparatuses (e.g., thermostats). Traditionally, each of these security, monitoring and automation protocols require separate programming, control and monitoring stations. To the extent that home automation and monitoring systems have been coupled to home security systems, such coupling has involved including the automation and monitoring systems as slaves to the existing home security system. This limits the flexibility and versatility of the automation and monitoring systems and ties such systems to proprietary architectures.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A security system alerts occupants of a dwelling and emergency authorities of a violation of premises secured by the system. A home monitoring system monitors a status of a home so that a user can be made aware of any monitored state changes. A home automation system automates and remotely controls lifestyle conveniences such as lighting, heating, cooling, and appliances.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Rather than having multiple devices to control each of the security, monitoring and automation environments, it is desirable to have a centralized controller capable of operating in each environment, thereby reducing the equipment needed in a dwelling. It is further desirable for such a controller to function as a gateway for external network access. Gateway access can include user access to the controller in order to control or monitor devices in locations remote from the dwelling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional security systems communicate alarm event information directly to a central station alarm monitoring system. Non-alarm events registered by the security system are not provided to the central station. Thus, it is difficult, if not impossible, for a security system provider to track sequences of events leading to and following generation of an alarm event. This can be important in diagnosing proper functioning of a security system or in situations where a dispute arises between an end-user of a security system and the provider of the security system related to performance of the security system or the security system provider during an alarm situation. It is therefore desirable to have a system that records events leading to and following an alarm event. It is further desirable to have these recorded events available to not only an end-user but also to the provider of the security system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A premises management system located at a premises may communicate with a remote server external to the premises. The premises management system may comprise a security system, an automation system, a combination thereof, and/or the like. The premises management system may comprises devices located at the premises, such as one or more premises devices (e.g., a security device, automation device), and a controller. The premises management system may generate premises data from the devices located at the premises. The premises data may be sent to the remote server. The remote server may process (e.g., analyze) the premises device. The remote server may determine alarm event data and non-alarm event data. The alarm event data and/or the non-alarm event data may be stored (e.g., by the remote device). The alarm event data and the non-alarm event data may be processed together. The alarm event data may be analyzed using the non-alarm event data. A notification may be sent (e.g., to a monitoring station, to a user device) based on the processing of the alarm event data and the non-alarm event data.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations and omissions of detail.

Embodiments of the present invention provide for an always-on persistent network connection between the SMA controller and a remote server. Through this persistent connection, the SMA controller can report information related to sensor and system events to a server. An aspect of these embodiments further provides for reporting the cessation of the network connection to the servers. These events, and others, are recorded using embodiments of the present invention and made available to selected users of the server systems for analysis.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Architectural Overview</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of the configurable security, monitoring and automation (SMA) controller of the present invention provide not only for communicating with and interpreting signals from sensors and devices within a dwelling, but also for accessing and monitoring those sensors and devices from locations remote to the dwelling. Embodiments of the SMA controller provide such capability through linkages to external servers via access networks such as the Internet, provider network, or a cellular network. The external servers provide a portal environment through which a user can, for example, monitor the state of sensors coupled to the SMA controller in real-time, configure the controller, and provide controlling information to the SMA controller. The external servers can also monitor the state of the SMA controller and the network connections between the SMA controller and the servers. The servers further provide a connection to a traditional security central station, which can then contact authorities in the event of an alarm condition being detected by the SMA controller in the dwelling.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a simplified block diagram illustrating an architecture including a set of logical domains and functional entities within which embodiments of the present invention interact. A home domain <b>110</b> includes an embodiment of the SMA controller <b>120</b>. The home domain is coupled via an access domain <b>150</b> to an operator domain <b>160</b> that includes various servers. The servers are in turn coupled to a central station <b>190</b> and to various remote user communication options.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The home domain refers to a collection of security, monitoring and automation entities within a dwelling or other location having SMA devices. SMA controller <b>120</b> is a device that provides an end-user SMA interface to the various SMA entities (e.g., radio-frequency sensors) within home domain <b>110</b>. SMA controller <b>120</b> further acts as a gateway interface between home domain <b>110</b> and operator domain <b>160</b>. SMA gateway <b>120</b> provides such gateway access to operator domain <b>160</b> via a network router <b>125</b>. Network router <b>125</b> can be coupled to SMA controller <b>120</b> and to home network devices such as home computer <b>127</b> via either hard wired or wireless connections (e.g., WiFi, tethered Ethernet, and power-line network). A network router <b>125</b> coupled to a broadband modem (e.g., a cable modem or DSL modem) serves as one link to networks in access domain <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">SMA devices within home domain <b>110</b> can include a variety of RF or wireless sensors <b>130</b> whose signals are received and interpreted by SMA gateway <b>120</b>. RF sensors <b>130</b> can include, for example, door or window sensors, motion detectors, smoke detectors, glass break detectors, inertial detectors, water detectors, carbon dioxide detectors, and key fob devices. SMA gateway <b>120</b> can be configured to react to a change in state of any of these detectors. In addition to acting and reacting to changes in state of RF sensors <b>130</b>, SMA controller <b>120</b> also can be coupled to a legacy security system <b>135</b>. SMA controller <b>120</b> controls the legacy security system by interpreting signals from sensors coupled to the legacy security system and reacting in a user-configured manner. SMA gateway <b>120</b>, for example, will provide alarm or sensor state information from legacy security system <b>135</b> to servers in operator domain <b>160</b> that may ultimately inform central station <b>190</b> to take appropriate action.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">SMA gateway <b>120</b> can also be coupled to one or more monitoring devices <b>140</b>. Monitoring devices <b>140</b> can include, for example, still and video cameras that provide images that are viewable on a screen of SMA gateway <b>120</b> or a remotely connected device. Monitoring devices <b>140</b> can be coupled to SMA gateway <b>120</b> either wirelessly (e.g., WiFi via router <b>125</b>) or other connections.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Home automation devices <b>145</b> (e.g., home area network devices having an automation interface) can also be coupled to and controlled by SMA gateway <b>120</b>. SMA gateway <b>120</b> can be configured to interact with a variety of home automation protocols, such as, for example, Z-Wave and ZigBee.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments of SMA controller <b>120</b> can be configured to communicate with a variety of RF or wireless sensors and are not limited to the RF sensors, monitoring devices and home automation devices discussed above. A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the present invention are not limited to or by the above-discussed devices and sensors, and can be applied to other areas and devices.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Embodiments of SMA controller <b>120</b> can be used to configure and control home security devices (e.g., <b>130</b> and <b>135</b>), monitoring devices <b>140</b> and automation devices <b>145</b>, either directly or by providing a gateway to remote control via servers in operator domain <b>160</b>. SMA controller <b>120</b> communicates with servers residing in operator domain <b>160</b> via networks in access domain <b>150</b>. Broadband communication can be provided by coupling SMA controller <b>120</b> with a network router <b>125</b>, which in turn is coupled to a wide area network <b>152</b>, such as a provider network or the Internet, via an appropriate broadband modem. The router can be coupled to the wide area network through cable broadband, DSL, and the like. Wide area network <b>152</b>, in turn, is coupled to servers in operator domain <b>160</b> via an appropriate series of routers and firewalls (not shown). SMA controller <b>120</b> can include additional mechanisms to provide a communication with the operator domain. For example, SMA controller <b>120</b> can be configured with a cellular network transceiver that permits communication with a cellular network <b>154</b>. In turn, cellular network <b>154</b> can provide access via routers and firewalls to servers in operator domain <b>160</b>. Embodiments of SMA controller <b>120</b> are not limited to providing gateway functionality via cellular and dwelling-based routers and modems. For example, SMA gateway <b>120</b> can be configured with other network protocol controllers such as WiMAX satellite-based broadband, direct telephone coupling, and the like.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Operator domain <b>160</b> refers to a logical collection of SMA servers and other operator systems in an operator's network that provide end-user interfaces, such as portals accessible to subscribers of the SMA service, that can configure, manage and control SMA elements within home domain <b>110</b>. Servers can also provide management portals for the provider to configure available services to the SMA controllers. Servers in operator domain <b>160</b> can be maintained by a provider (operator) of subscriber-based services for SMA operations. Examples of providers include cable providers, telecommunications providers, and the like. A production server architecture in operator domain <b>160</b> can support SMA systems in millions of home domains <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Individual server architectures can be of a variety of types, and in one embodiment, the server architecture is a tiered Java2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) service oriented architecture. Such a tiered service oriented architecture can include an interface tier, a service tier, and a data access logic tier. The interface tier can provide entry points from outside the server processes, including, for example, browser web applications, mobile web applications, web services, HTML, XHTML, SOAP, and the like. A service tier can provide a variety of selectable functionality passed along by the operator to the end user, including widget programs. Service tiers can relate to end user subscription levels offered by the operator (e.g., payment tiers corresponding to &#x201c;gold&#x201d; level service, &#x201c;silver&#x201d; level service and &#x201c;bronze&#x201d; level service). Finally the data access logic tier provides access to various sources of data including database servers.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates an example set of servers that can be provided in operator domain <b>160</b>. Servers <b>165</b> can support all non-alarm and alarm events, heartbeat, and command traffic between the various servers and SMA controllers <b>120</b>. Servers <b>165</b> can also manage end-user electronic mail and SMS notification, as well as integration with provider billing, provisioning, inventory, tech support systems, and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A portal server <b>170</b> can provide various user interface applications, including, for example, a subscriber portal, a mobile portal, and a management portal. A subscriber portal is an end-user accessible application that permits an end-user to access a corresponding SMA controller remotely via standard web-based applications. Using such a subscriber portal can provide access to the same SMA functions that an interface directly coupled to the SMA controller would provide, plus additional functions such as alert and contact management, historical data, widget and camera management, account management, and the like. A mobile portal can provide all or part of the access available to an end-user via the subscriber portal. A mobile portal can be limited, however, to capabilities of an accessing mobile device (e.g., touch screen or non-touch screen cellular phones).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A management portal provides an operator representative access to support and manage SMA controllers in home domains <b>110</b> and corresponding user accounts via a web-based application. Using a management portal, an operator representative can provision and provide a variety of functionality via, for example, widget programs to the SMA controllers, as will be discussed in greater detail below. The management portal can provide tiers of management support so that levels of access to user information can be restricted based on authorization of a particular employee. User information can include, for example, records of events transmitted by SMA controllers to the operator domain, as will be discussed in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Telephony server <b>180</b> can process and send information related to alarm events received from SMA controllers <b>120</b> to alarm receivers at central monitoring station <b>190</b>. A server <b>165</b> that processes the alarm event makes a request to telephony server <b>180</b> to dial the central station's receiver and send corresponding contact information. Telephony server <b>180</b> can communicate with a plurality of central stations <b>190</b>. Server <b>165</b> can determine a correct central station to contact based upon user account settings associated with the transmitting SMA controller. Thus, alarms can be routed to different central stations based upon user accounts. Further, accounts can be transferred from one central station to another by modifying user account information. Telephony server <b>180</b> can communicate with alarm receivers at central station <b>190</b> using, for example, a security industry standard contact identification protocol (e.g., dual-tone multi-frequency [DTMF]) and broadband protocols.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A backup server <b>175</b> can be provided to guarantee that an alarm path is available in an event that one or more servers <b>165</b> become unavailable or inaccessible. A backup server <b>175</b> can be co-located to the physical location of servers <b>165</b> to address scenarios in which one or more of the servers fail. Alternatively, a backup server <b>175</b> can be placed in a location remote from servers <b>165</b> in order to address situations in which a network failure or a power failure causes one or more of servers <b>165</b> to become unavailable. SMA controllers <b>120</b> can be configured to transmit alarm events to a backup server <b>175</b> if the SMA controller cannot successfully send such events to servers <b>165</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A database server <b>185</b> provides storage of all configuration and user information accessible to other servers within operator domain <b>160</b>. Database server <b>185</b> can also provide storage of event data associated with all SMA controllers coupled to operator domain <b>160</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail below, such event data can be used to track event sequences occurring around the time of an alarm event. Selection of a type of database provided by database server <b>185</b> can be dependent upon a variety of criteria, including, for example, scalability and availability of data. One embodiment of the present invention uses database services provided by an Oracle database.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a simplified block diagram illustrating a logical architecture for a server <b>165</b> usable by embodiments of the present invention. A server <b>165</b> in operator domain <b>160</b> provides a variety of functionality. Logically, a server <b>165</b> can be divided into the following functional modules: a broadband communication module <b>165</b>A, a cellular communication module <b>165</b>B, a notification module <b>165</b>C, a telephony communication module <b>165</b>D, and an integration module <b>165</b>E.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Broadband communication module <b>165</b>A manages broadband connections and message traffic from a plurality of SMA controllers <b>110</b> coupled to server <b>165</b>. Embodiments of the present invention provide for the broadband channel to be a primary communication channel between an SMA controller <b>120</b> and servers <b>165</b>. The broadband communication module handles a variety of communication, including, for example, all non-alarm and alarm events, broadband heartbeat, and command of traffic between server <b>165</b> and SMA controller <b>120</b> over the broadband channel. Embodiments of the present invention provide for an always-on persistent TCP socket connection to be maintained between each SMA controller and server <b>165</b>. A variety of protocols can be used for communications between server <b>165</b> and SMA controller <b>120</b> (e.g., XML over TCP, and the like). Such communication can be secured using standard transport layer security (TLS) technologies. Through the use of an always-on socket connection, servers <b>165</b> can provide near real-time communication between the server and an SMA controller <b>120</b>. For example, if a user has a subscriber portal active and a zone is tripped within home domain <b>110</b>, a zone fault will be reflected in near real-time on the subscriber portal user interface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Cellular communication module <b>165</b>B manages cellular connections and message traffic from SMA controllers <b>120</b> to a server <b>165</b>. Embodiments of the present invention use the cellular channel as a backup communication channel to the broadband channel. Thus, if a broadband channel becomes unavailable, communication between an SMA controller and a server switches to the cellular channel. At this time, the cellular communication module on the server handles all non-alarm and alarm events, and command traffic from an SMA controller. When a broadband channel is active, heartbeat messages can be sent periodically on the cellular channel in order to monitor the cellular channel. When a cellular protocol communication stack is being used, a TCP socket connection can be established between the SMA controller and server to ensure reliable message delivery for critical messages (e.g., alarm events and commands). Once critical messages have been exchanged, the TCP connection can be shut down thereby reducing cellular communication costs. As with broadband communication, XMPP can be the messaging protocol used for such communications. Similarly, such communication can be secured using TLS and SASL authentication protocols. Non-critical messages between an SMA controller and a server can be sent using UDP. A compressed binary protocol can be used as a messaging protocol for such communications in order to minimize cellular costs for such message traffic. Such messages can be secured using an encryption algorithm, such as the tiny encryption algorithm (TEA). Cellular communication can be established over two network segments: the GSM service provider's network that provides a path between an SMA controller and a cellular access point, and a VPN tunnel between the access point and an operator domain data center.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A notification module <b>165</b>C determines if and how a user should be notified of events generated by their corresponding SMA controller <b>120</b>. A user can specify who to notify of particular events or event types and how to notify the user (e.g., telephone call, electronic mail, text message, page, and the like), and this information is stored by a database server <b>185</b>. When events such as alarm or non-alarm events are received by a server <b>165</b>, those events can be passed asynchronously to the notification module, which determines if, who and how to send those notifications based upon the user's configuration.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Telephony communication module <b>165</b>D provides communication between a server <b>165</b> and telephony server <b>180</b>. When a server <b>165</b> receives and performs initial processing of alarm events, the telephony communication module forwards those events to a telephony server <b>180</b> which in turn communicates with a central station <b>190</b>, as discussed above. Alternatively, communication between server <b>165</b> and central station <b>190</b> can be direct or using a webserver via a wide area network (e.g., <b>152</b>). Such communication would obviate the need for a telephony server and telephony communication module, or could be used in conjunction with telephony communications (i.e., telephony communications as a backup to the broadband communications).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Integration module <b>165</b>E provides infrastructure and interfaces to integrate a server <b>165</b> with operator business systems, such as, for example, billing, provisioning, inventory, tech support, and the like. An integration module can provide a web services interface for upstream integration that operator business systems can call to perform operations like creating and updating accounts and querying information stored in a database served by database server <b>185</b>. An integration module can also provide an event-driven framework for downstream integration to inform operator business systems of events within the SMA system.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As discussed above, the network connection between an SMA controller <b>120</b> and a server <b>165</b> is always on and persistent. This allows for constant remote monitoring of the state of the SMA controller, sensors, and devices coupled to the SMA controller. Notification module <b>165</b>C can be configured to report state changes of the SMA controller and sensors to previously determined entities. Such state change information can also include a current communication mode between the SMA controller and server. For example, if broadband communication becomes unavailable and a switch is made to cellular communication, an end user can be automatically notified of the change. Likewise, if all communication with the SMA controller is lost, then a different notification can be provided. The nature of a notification associated with an event can be configured by an end user or provider through portal server <b>170</b> or an input device coupled to SMA controller <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Connectivity reporting can also be used to report a loss of communication subsequent to a zone fault event and to define a response to such a scenario. An SMA controller can be configured with an entry delay timer that allows a person entering home domain <b>110</b>, and thereby triggering a zone fault event, to disarm an armed SMA controller before an alarm signal is sent to a central station <b>190</b>. An intruder to the home domain might take advantage of the unified nature of the SMA controller and disable the SMA controller prior to expiration of the entry delay (i.e., a so-called &#x201c;smash-and-grab&#x201d; scenario), in order to prevent sounding of an alarm. The continuous communication between the SMA controller and an operator domain server results in the sensor state change associated with the zone fault event to be provided to a server <b>165</b> in near real time, along with a message indicating that the SMA controller's entry delay timer has been initiated. If the server subsequently detects a loss of communication with the SMA controller before a disarm signal is received, the notification module can be configured to relay an alarm signal to, for example, one or more of the end user, the central station, and a provider administrator. The alarm signal can be defined using available central station protocols (e.g., contact ID) to indicate a &#x201c;smash and grab&#x201d; scenario or an indication that is agreed upon between the central station provider and the provider of the operator domain services.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The server can further be configured with a delay window that results in the server waiting to report an alarm associated with the zone fault event. This allows for communication to be restored with the SMA controller and a disarm signal to be received prior to transmission of the alarm report. A configurable server delay window can be defined in accord with security industry best practices. Alternatively, the configurable server delay window can be defined in accord with a provider's specifications (e.g., customer tiers or purchased services). The delay window timer can be started at the same time the message indicating that the SMA controller's entry delay timer has been initiated is received. Alternatively, the server can start the delay window timer at the same time the loss of communication is detected. As a further alternative, the server can independently track the entry delay timer when the message indicating that the SMA controller's entry delay timer has been initiated and then start the delay window time subsequent to the expiration of the entry delay timer. In general, a delay window timer tracked by the server can include an aggregation of the entry delay timer, as configured at the SMA controller, and an additional time configured by the provider (e.g., a &#x201c;smash and grab&#x201d; wait time). This general delay window timer can be started at the time the message indicating that the SMA controller's entry delay timer has been initiated is received (or alternatively, upon receipt of the zone fault event message while the system state is armed).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a simplified flow diagram illustrating reporting of loss of connectivity and possible transmission of an alarm associated with a zone fault event, in accord with embodiments of the present invention. As discussed above, state information related to the SMA controller is received by a server <b>165</b> using, for example, a persistent network connection through a broadband communication module <b>165</b>A (<b>210</b>). Such state information can include, for example, an indication of continued operation of the SMA controller, arm/disarm, and sensor event state changes (e.g., a zone fault event).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The server then detects a loss of connectivity or communication with the SMA controller (<b>220</b>). If the server determines that the SMA controller was not armed (<b>230</b>), then a notification of the loss of communication is transmitted by notification module <b>165</b>C to preconfigured recipients (e.g., the end users) (<b>240</b>). If the server determines that the SMA controller was armed at the time of loss of communication (<b>230</b>), a determination can be made as to whether a sensor zone fault event had been detected prior to the loss of communication (<b>250</b>). If no sensor event had been detected, then a notification of loss of communication can be transmitted to the preconfigured recipients (<b>240</b>). If a sensor event had been detected prior to the loss of communication, and the system was armed, then a determination is made as to whether the preconfigured server delay window has expired (<b>260</b>). The delay window is tracked solely by the server, but can include an aggregation of the entry delay configured by the SMA controller as well as an additional time configured by the provider (e.g., the &#x201c;smash and grab&#x201d; wait time). The delay window timer can begin at the time a message is received by the server that an entry delay timer has been initiated or at the time the loss of connectivity is detected.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the delay window has not expired, then a determination is made as to whether communication is restored and the SMA controller is disarmed (<b>270</b>). If communications are restored and the SMA controller is disarmed, then the process can return to a monitoring state (<b>210</b>). If communications are not restored and the SMA controller disarmed, then communications are monitored until the expiration of the delay window. Once the delay window expires without further communication with the SMA controller, an alarm event message is transmitted to a central station <b>190</b> and to other preconfigured recipients (<b>280</b>). As discussed above, the alarm event message can be designated as a &#x201c;smash and grab&#x201d; alarm event or a general alarm event, as agreed to between the central station provider and the provider of SMA services.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As indicated above, the server-based delay window is configurable by the provider of the SMA services. In one embodiment, the server-based delay window can represent an aggregate of the user-configurable entry delay on the SMA controller and a provider-configurable &#x201c;smash and grab&#x201d; delay time (e.g., entry delay of 30 seconds and a &#x201c;smash and grab&#x201d; delay time of 60 seconds results in a total delay window of 90 seconds before sending the alarm message to the central station). In another embodiment, an SMA controller can be configured to send an alarm indication message to the remote server, but then the server will wait the delay window time to receive a second alarm message or a cancel message from the SMA controller before sending the alarm message to the central station. In this embodiment, the server can wait for the delay window to expire before sending the alarm if the server hasn't received the second message from the SMA controller. If a second alarm message is received, then an alarm message will be sent to the central station immediately, without waiting for expiration of the delay window. In this scenario, the delay window is the provider-configured &#x201c;smash and grab&#x201d; time or an &#x201c;abort window&#x201d; per ANSI/SIA CP-01 or the like. In either scenario, the server-based delay time (e.g., the &#x201c;smash and grab&#x201d; delay time) can be based upon user tiers (i.e., higher paying customers getting shorter delay times) or other criteria of the provider's choosing.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a determination that a loss of connectivity has occurred.

Instead, if SMA controller <b>120</b> fails to provide a disarm or some other communication to server <b>165</b> within the delay window period, then the alarm message is provided to the central station.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">SMA Controller Architecture</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a simplified block diagram illustrating a hardware architecture of an SMA controller, according to one embodiment of the present invention. A processor <b>310</b> is coupled to a plurality of communications transceivers, interface modules, memory modules, and user interface modules. Processor <b>310</b>, executing firmware discussed below, performs various tasks related to interpretation of alarm and non-alarm signals received by SMA controller <b>120</b>, interpreting reactions to those signals in light of configuration information either received from a server (e.g., server <b>165</b>) or entered into an interface provided by SMA controller <b>120</b> (e.g., a touch screen <b>320</b>).

Audio processor <b>325</b> can, in turn, be coupled to a speaker that provides sound in home domain <b>110</b>. SMA controller <b>120</b> can be configured to provide a variety of sounds for different events detected by sensors associated with the SMA controller. Such sounds can be configured by a user so as to distinguish between alarm and non-alarm events.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As discussed above, an SMA controller <b>120</b> can communicate with a server <b>165</b> using different network access means. Processor <b>310</b> can provide broadband access to a router (e.g., router <b>125</b>) via an Ethernet broadband connection PHY <b>130</b> or via a WiFi transceiver <b>335</b>. The router can then be coupled to or be incorporated within an appropriate broadband modem. Cellular network connectivity can be provided by a cellular transceiver <b>340</b> that is coupled to processor <b>310</b>. SMA controller <b>120</b> can be configured with a set of rules that govern when processor <b>310</b> will switch between a broadband connection and a cellular connection to operator domain <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In order to communicate with the various sensors and devices within home domain <b>110</b>, processor <b>310</b> can be coupled to one or more transceiver modules via, for example, a serial peripheral interface such as a SPI bus <b>350</b>. Such transceiver modules permit communication with sensors of a variety of protocols in a configurable manner. Embodiments of the present invention can use a transceiver to communicate with a variety of RF sensors <b>130</b>, using a variety of communication protocols. Similarly, home automation transceivers (e.g., home area network devices having an automation interface) that communicate using, for example, Z-Wave or ZigBee protocols can be coupled to processor <b>310</b> via SPI <b>350</b>. If SMA controller <b>120</b> is coupled to a legacy security system <b>135</b>, then a module permitting coupling to the legacy security system can be coupled to processor <b>310</b> via SPI <b>350</b>. Other protocols can be provided for via such plug-in modules including, for example, digital enhanced cordless telecommunication devices (DECT). In this manner, an SMA controller <b>120</b> can be configured to provide for control of a variety of devices and protocols known both today and in the future. In addition, processor <b>310</b> can be coupled to other types of devices (e.g., transceivers or computers) via a universal serial bus (USB) interface <b>355</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In order to locally store configuration information and software (e.g., widget programs) for SMA controller <b>120</b>, a memory <b>360</b> is coupled to processor <b>310</b>. Additional memory can be coupled to processor <b>310</b> via, for example, a secure digital interface <b>365</b>. A power supply <b>370</b> is also coupled to processor <b>310</b> and to other devices within SMA controller <b>120</b> via, for example, a power management controller module.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">SMA controller <b>120</b> is configured to be a customer premises equipment device that works in conjunction with server counterparts in operator domain <b>160</b> in order to perform functions required for security monitoring and automation. Embodiments of SMA controller <b>120</b> provide a touch screen interface (e.g., <b>320</b>) into all the SMA features. Via the various modules coupled to processor <b>310</b>, the SMA controller bridges the sensor network, the control network, and security panel network to broadband and cellular networks. SMA controller <b>120</b> further uses the protocols discussed above to carry the alarm and activity events to servers in the operator domain for processing.

Since SMA controller <b>120</b> provides security functionality for home domain <b>110</b>, the SMA controller should be a highly available system. High availability suggests that the SMA controller be ready to serve an end-user at all times, both when a user is interacting with the SMA controller through a user interface and when alarms and other non-critical system events occur, regardless of whether a system component has failed. In order to provide such high availability, SMA controller <b>120</b> runs a micro-kernel operating system <b>370</b>. An example of a micro-kernel operating system usable by embodiments of the present invention is a QNX real-time operating system. Under such a micro-kernel operating system, drivers, applications, protocol stacks and file systems run outside the operating system kernel in memory-protected user space. Such a micro-kernel operating system can provide fault resilience through features such as critical process monitoring and adaptive partitioning. As a result, components can fail, including low-level drivers, and automatically restart without affecting other components or the kernel and without requiring a reboot of the system. A critical process monitoring feature can automatically restart failed components because those components function in the user space. An adaptive partitioning feature of the micro kernel operating system provides guarantees of CPU resources for designated components, thereby preventing a component from consuming all CPU resources to the detriment of other system components.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A core layer <b>375</b> of the firmware architecture provides service/event library and client API library components.

Non-alarm events are not provided to the central station. Nor does the central station provide server-based delay window functionality, as described above. Thus, there is no mechanism for tracking such events.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The operator domain servers, used by embodiments of the present invention, provide a mechanism for tracking all events generated by SMA controllers coupled to the operator domain. As discussed above, through the broadband and cellular communication modules, server <b>165</b> maintains persistent communication channels with an SMA controller so as to provide near real-time communication. Through these communication channels, every event (e.g., zone faults, arming/disarming, and the like) registered by an SMA controller is transmitted to a server <b>165</b>. Further, the servers can detect loss of connectivity between a SMA controller and respond to that loss of connectivity.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As these event messages are received by a server <b>165</b>, the servers process the event messages and react to the events by providing alerts to users or to a central station alarm monitoring system, if the event is an alarm event.

Communication channel status can also be recorded as events in the event database. The database can also include records related to actions taken by the servers in the operator domain in response to the SMA controller messages.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a simplified flow diagram illustrating one example of a process performed by an operator domain server (e.g., server <b>165</b>) to monitor and respond to event message from one or more SMA controllers. A server monitors one of the broadband or cellular networks for events related to an SMA controller supported by the operator domain (<b>510</b>). As discussed above, these events can include zone fault events detected by the sensors coupled to the SMA controller, SMA controller system events such as arming and disarming or power faults, losses in communication with an SMA controller, and the like. If the detected event is not a loss in communication (<b>520</b>), the received event message is processed by the server in the operator domain (<b>525</b>). The event message received from the SMA controller will include an identifier of the SMA controller transmitting the message as well as information related to the nature and source of the event being reported. For example, an event message may include an identifier of a sensor detecting the fault event as well as a time stamp for when the event occurred and other zone information. As the event message is processed, data from the event message can then be recorded in, for example, a database associated with database server <b>185</b> (<b>530</b>). Recordation of the event can consist of inclusion of a record in an appropriate table of the database that includes an identifier of the source SMA controller, and other event identifying information. The server can also respond appropriately to the event message and record the nature of and performance of the response in the database (<b>535</b>). For example, if a user of the SMA controller has configured the system to report all occurrences of doors opening and closing to a mobile device, the server can perform that reporting as well as record an entry in the database when the performance of that action has occurred.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the event is a loss of communication (<b>520</b>), then the server can record an entry in the database reflecting that loss of communication with an identified SMA controller (<b>540</b>). The entry can include not only an identifier of the SMA controller to which communication has been lost, but also information reflecting the communication conduit being utilized when communication was lost, a time stamp of when communication was lost, and the like. Once a loss of communication has been detected, the server can also respond to the loss of communication and record an entry in the database reflecting the nature of that response (<b>545</b>). For example, if the server loses communication with an SMA controller over a broadband connection, a response may be to attempt to regain communication with the SMA controller using a cellular connection (e.g., <b>154</b>). Another example of a response to loss in communication can be those steps discussed above with regard to a &#x201c;smash-and-grab&#x201d; scenario in which a timer is begun and transmission of the alarm event is provided to a central station alarm monitoring system in the event the timer expires. All the steps involved in the &#x201c;smash-and-grab&#x201d; scenario can be recorded in the database. If communication is not regained (<b>550</b>), then the system can continue to monitor for additional communication or resumption of communication with the SMA controller (<b>510</b>). If communication is restored (<b>550</b>), then a record can be made reflecting the restoration of communication (<b>555</b>). Any necessary responses to such regaining of communication can also be recorded (<b>560</b>). For example, if resumption of communication and subsequent actions from an SMA controller result in cancellation of timers associated with a &#x201c;smash-and-grab&#x201d; alarm event, then those actions can be recorded in the database.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The events stored in an operator domain database, or other data storage system, can be filtered and analyzed as required by the provider. For example, all events recorded for a particular SMA controller (or associated subscriber), can be searched for and included in a report requested either by the subscriber or the provider. Such a report can be made available through a subscriber portal or a management portal. In addition, events can be further filtered based upon event type (e.g., communication failure, zone fault, or fault within a particular zone). As discussed above, another type of report that can be useful is an alarm event report in which all events recorded within a time frame before and after a recorded alarm event for a particular subscriber can be gathered and displayed for review. These events include non-alarm events that may provide insight as to what was occurring within the home domain prior to the trigger of the alarm event and how did the system react in response (e.g., provision of an alarm event to a central station alarm monitoring system within an appropriate delay time). Traditional security systems do not provide this functionality because they do not transmit non-alarm event information to a central station and they do not provide an operator domain functionality for recording all events from a security controller.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">An Example Computing and Network Environment</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown above, the present invention can be implemented using a variety of computer systems and networks.
