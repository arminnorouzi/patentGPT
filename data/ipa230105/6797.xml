tablet personal computers (PCs), have emerged and spread. Accordingly, the volume of data throughput demanded to be processed in a cellular network has rapidly increased. In order to satisfy such rapidly increasing data throughput, carrier aggregation technology or cognitive radio technology for efficiently employing more frequency bands and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology or multi-base station (BS) cooperation technology for raising data capacity transmitted on limited frequency resources have been developed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As more and more communication devices have required greater communication capacity, there has been a need for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) communication relative to legacy radio access technology (RAT). In addition, massive machine type communication (mMTC) for providing various services at anytime and anywhere by connecting a plurality of devices and objects to each other is one main issue to be considered in next-generation communication.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Communication system design considering services/user equipment (UEs) sensitive to reliability and latency is also under discussion.

Since the amount of resources available to the BS for communication with the UE(s) is limited, a new method for the BS to efficiently receive/transmit uplink/downlink data and/or uplink/downlink control information from/to the UE(s) using the limited radio resources is needed. In other words, due to increase in the density of nodes and/or the density of UEs, a method for efficiently using high-density nodes or high-density UEs for communication is needed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method to efficiently support various services with different requirements in a wireless communication system is also needed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Overcoming delay or latency is an important challenge to applications, performance of which is sensitive to delay/latency.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The objects to be achieved with the present disclosure are not limited to what has been particularly described hereinabove and other objects not described herein will be more clearly understood by persons skilled in the art from the following detailed description.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solutions</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a method for transmitting a hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgment (HARQ-ACK) codebook by user equipment in a wireless communication system is provided.

disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The detailed description, which will be given below with reference to the accompanying drawings, is intended to explain exemplary implementations of the present disclosure, rather than to show the only implementations that may be implemented according to the present disclosure. The following detailed description includes specific details in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without such specific details.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some instances, known structures and devices may be omitted or may be shown in block diagram form, focusing on important features of the structures and devices, so as not to obscure the concept of the present disclosure. The same reference numbers will be used throughout the present disclosure to refer to the same or like parts.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A technique, a device, and a system described below may be applied to a variety of wireless multiple access systems. The multiple access systems may include, for example, a code division multiple access (CDMA) system, a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system, a time division multiple access (TDMA) system, an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system, a single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) system, a multi-carrier frequency division multiple access (MC-FDMA) system, etc. CDMA may be implemented by radio technology such as universal terrestrial radio access (UTRA) or CDMA2000. TDMA may be implemented by radio technology such as global system for mobile communications (GSM), general packet radio service (GPRS), enhanced data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE) (i.e., GERAN), etc. OFDMA may be implemented by radio technology such as institute of electrical and electronics engineers (IEEE) 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, evolved-UTRA (E-UTRA), etc. UTRA is part of universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) and 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) long-term evolution (LTE) is part of E-UMTS using E-UTRA. 3GPP LTE adopts OFDMA on downlink (DL) and adopts SC-FDMA on uplink (UL). LTE-advanced (LTE-A) is an evolved version of 3GPP LTE.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For convenience of description, description will be given under the assumption that the present disclosure is applied to LTE and/or new RAT (NR). However, the technical features of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. For example, although the following detailed description is given based on mobile communication systems corresponding to 3GPP LTE/NR systems, the mobile communication systems are applicable to other arbitrary mobile communication systems except for matters that are specific to the 3GPP LTE/NR system.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For terms and techniques that are not described in detail among terms and techniques used in the present disclosure, reference may be made to 3GPP LTE standard specifications, for example, 3GPP TS 36.211, 3GPP TS 36.212, 3GPP TS 36.213, 3GPP TS 36.321, 3GPP TS 36.300, 3GPP TS 36.331, etc. and 3GPP NR standard specifications, for example, 3GPP TS 38.211, 3GPP TS 38.212, 3GPP TS 38.213, 3GPP TS 38.214, 3GPP TS 38.300, 3GPP TS 38.331, etc.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In examples of the present disclosure described later, if a device &#x201c;assumes&#x201d; something, this may mean that a channel transmission entity transmits a channel in compliance with the corresponding &#x201c;assumption&#x201d;. This also may mean that a channel reception entity receives or decodes the channel in the form of conforming to the &#x201c;assumption&#x201d; on the premise that the channel has been transmitted in compliance with the &#x201c;assumption&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the present disclosure, a user equipment (UE) may be fixed or mobile. Each of various devices that transmit and/or receive user data and/or control information by communicating with a base station (BS) may be the UE. The term UE may be referred to as terminal equipment, mobile station (MS), mobile terminal (MT), user terminal (UT), subscriber station (SS), wireless device, personal digital assistant (PDA), wireless modem, handheld device, etc. In the present disclosure, a BS refers to a fixed station that communicates with a UE and/or another BS and exchanges data and control information with a UE and another BS. The term BS may be referred to as advanced base station (ABS), Node-B (NB), evolved Node-B (eNB), base transceiver system (BTS), access point (AP), processing server (PS), etc. Particularly, a BS of a universal terrestrial radio access (UTRAN) is referred to as an NB, a BS of an evolved-UTRAN (E-UTRAN) is referred to as an eNB, and a BS of new radio access technology network is referred to as a gNB. Hereinbelow, for convenience of description, the NB, eNB, or gNB will be referred to as a BS regardless of the type or version of communication technology.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present disclosure, a node refers to a fixed point capable of transmitting/receiving a radio signal to/from a UE by communication with the UE. Various types of BSs may be used as nodes regardless of the names thereof. For example, a BS, NB, eNB, pico-cell eNB (PeNB), home eNB (HeNB), relay, repeater, etc. may be a node. Furthermore, a node may not be a BS. For example, a radio remote head (RRH) or a radio remote unit (RRU) may be a node. Generally, the RRH and RRU have power levels lower than that of the BS. Since the RRH or RRU (hereinafter, RRH/RRU) is connected to the BS through a dedicated line such as an optical cable in general, cooperative communication according to the RRH/RRU and the BS may be smoothly performed relative to cooperative communication according to BSs connected through a wireless link. At least one antenna is installed per node. An antenna may refer to a physical antenna port or refer to a virtual antenna or an antenna group. The node may also be called a point.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the present disclosure, a cell refers to a specific geographical area in which one or more nodes provide communication services. Accordingly, in the present disclosure, communication with a specific cell may mean communication with a BS or a node providing communication services to the specific cell. A DL/UL signal of the specific cell refers to a DL/UL signal from/to the BS or the node providing communication services to the specific cell. A cell providing UL/DL communication services to a UE is especially called a serving cell. Furthermore, channel status/quality of the specific cell refers to channel status/quality of a channel or a communication link generated between the BS or the node providing communication services to the specific cell and the UE. In 3GPP-based communication systems, the UE may measure a DL channel state from a specific node using cell-specific reference signal(s) (CRS(s)) transmitted on a CRS resource and/or channel state information reference signal(s) (CSI-RS(s)) transmitted on a CSI-RS resource, allocated to the specific node by antenna port(s) of the specific node.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A 3GPP-based communication system uses the concept of a cell in order to manage radio resources, and a cell related to the radio resources is distinguished from a cell of a geographic area.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The &#x201c;cell&#x201d; of the geographic area may be understood as coverage within which a node may provide services using a carrier, and the &#x201c;cell&#x201d; of the radio resources is associated with bandwidth (BW), which is a frequency range configured by the carrier. Since DL coverage, which is a range within which the node is capable of transmitting a valid signal, and UL coverage, which is a range within which the node is capable of receiving the valid signal from the UE, depend upon a carrier carrying the signal, coverage of the node may also be associated with coverage of the &#x201c;cell&#x201d; of radio resources used by the node. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may be used to indicate service coverage by the node sometimes, radio resources at other times, or a range that a signal using the radio resources may reach with valid strength at other times.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In 3GPP communication standards, the concept of the cell is used in order to manage radio resources. The &#x201c;cell&#x201d; associated with the radio resources is defined by a combination of DL resources and UL resources, that is, a combination of a DL component carrier (CC) and a UL CC. The cell may be configured by the DL resources only or by the combination of the DL resources and the UL resources. If carrier aggregation is supported, linkage between a carrier frequency of the DL resources (or DL CC) and a carrier frequency of the UL resources (or UL CC) may be indicated by system information. For example, the combination of the DL resources and the UL resources may be indicated by system information block type 2 (SIB2) linkage. In this case, the carrier frequency may be equal to or different from a center frequency of each cell or CC. When carrier aggregation (CA) is configured, the UE has only one radio resource control (RRC) connection with a network. During RRC connection establishment/re-establishment/handover, one serving cell provides non-access stratum (NAS) mobility information. During RRC connection re-establishment/handover, one serving cell provides security input. This cell is referred to as a primary cell (Pcell). The Pcell refers to a cell operating on a primary frequency on which the UE performs an initial connection establishment procedure or initiates a connection re-establishment procedure. According to UE capability, secondary cells (Scells) may be configured to form a set of serving cells together with the Pcell. The S cell may be configured after completion of RRC connection establishment and used to provide additional radio resources in addition to resources of a specific cell (SpCell). A carrier corresponding to the Pcell on DL is referred to as a downlink primary CC (DL PCC), and a carrier corresponding to the Pcell on UL is referred to as an uplink primary CC (UL PCC). A carrier corresponding to the Scell on DL is referred to as a downlink secondary CC (DL SCC), and a carrier corresponding to the Scell on UL is referred to as an uplink secondary CC (UL SCC).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For dual connectivity (DC) operation, the term SpCell refers to the Pcell of a master cell group (MCG) or the Pcell of a secondary cell group (SCG). The SpCell supports PUCCH transmission and contention-based random access and is always activated. The MCG is a group of service cells associated with a master node (e.g., BS) and includes the SpCell (Pcell) and optionally one or more Scells. For a UE configured with DC, the SCG is a subset of serving cells associated with a secondary node and includes a PSCell and 0 or more Scells. For a UE in RRC CONNECTED state, not configured with CA or DC, only one serving cell including only the Pcell is present. For a UE in RRC CONNECTED state, configured with CA or DC, the term serving cells refers to a set of cells including SpCell(s) and all Scell(s). In DC, two medium access control (MAC) entities, i.e., one MAC entity for the MCG and one MAC entity for the SCG, are configured for the UE.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A UE with which CA is configured and DC is not configured may be configured with a Pcell PUCCH group, which includes the Pcell and 0 or more Scells, and an Scell PUCCH group, which includes only Scell(s). For the Scells, an Scell on which a PUCCH associated with the corresponding cell is transmitted (hereinafter, PUCCH cell) may be configured. An S cell indicated as the PUCCH Scell belongs to the Scell PUCCH group and PUCCH transmission of related uplink control information (UCI) is performed on the PUCCH Scell. An Scell, which is not indicated as the PUCCH Scell or in which a cell indicated for PUCCH transmission is a Pcell, belongs to the Pcell PUCCH group and PUCCH transmission of related UCI is performed on the Pcell.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a wireless communication system, the UE receives information on DL from the BS and the UE transmits information on UL to the BS. The information that the BS and UE transmit and/or receive includes data and a variety of control information and there are various physical channels according to types/usage of the information that the UE and the BS transmit and/or receive.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The 3GPP-based communication standards define DL physical channels corresponding to resource elements carrying information originating from a higher layer and DL physical signals corresponding to resource elements which are used by the physical layer but do not carry the information originating from the higher layer. For example, a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), a physical broadcast channel (PBCH), a physical multicast channel (PMCH), a physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH), a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), etc. are defined as the DL physical channels, and a reference signal (RS) and a synchronization signal (SS) are defined as the DL physical signals. The RS, which is also referred to as a pilot, represents a signal with a predefined special waveform known to both the BS and the UE. For example, a demodulation reference signal (DMRS), a channel state information RS (CSI-RS), etc. are defined as DL RSs. The 3GPP-based communication standards define UL physical channels corresponding to resource elements carrying information originating from the higher layer and UL physical signals corresponding to resource elements which are used by the physical layer but do not carry the information originating from the higher layer. For example, a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH), and a physical random access channel (PRACH) are defined as the UL physical channels, and a DMRS for a UL control/data signal, a sounding reference signal (SRS) used for UL channel measurement, etc. are defined.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the present disclosure, the PDCCH refers to a set of time-frequency resources (e.g., resource elements) that carry downlink control information (DCI), and the PDSCH refers to a set of time-frequency resources that carry DL data. The PUCCH, PUSCH, and PRACH refer to a set of time-frequency resources that carry UCI, UL data, and random access signals, respectively. In the following description, the meaning of &#x201c;The UE transmits/receives the PUCCH/PUSCH/PRACH&#x201d; is that the UE transmits/receives the UCI/UL data/random access signals on or through the PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH, respectively. In addition, the meaning of &#x201c;the BS transmits/receives the PBCH/PDCCH/PDSCH&#x201d; is that the BS transmits the broadcast information/DL data/DCI on or through a PBCH/PDCCH/PDSCH, respectively.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As more and more communication devices have required greater communication capacity, there has been a need for eMBB communication relative to legacy radio access technology (RAT). In addition, massive MTC for providing various services at any time and anywhere by connecting a plurality of devices and objects to each other is one main issue to be considered in next-generation communication. Further, communication system design considering services/UEs sensitive to reliability and latency is also under discussion. The introduction of next-generation RAT is being discussed in consideration of eMBB communication, massive MTC, ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC), and the like. Currently, in 3GPP, a study on the next-generation mobile communication systems after EPC is being conducted. In the present disclosure, for convenience, the corresponding technology is referred to as a new RAT (NR) or fifth-generation (5G) RAT, and a system using NR or supporting NR is referred to as an NR system.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a communication system <b>1</b> to which implementations of the present disclosure are applied.

Here, the wireless devices represent devices performing communication using RAT (e.g., 5G NR or LTE (e.g., E-UTRA)) and may be referred to as communication/radio/5G devices.

For example, the vehicles may include a vehicle having a wireless communication function, an autonomous driving vehicle, and a vehicle capable of performing vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Here, the vehicles may include an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (e.g., a drone). The XR device may include an augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR)/mixed reality (MR) device and may be implemented in the form of a head-mounted device (HMD), a head-up display (HUD) mounted in a vehicle, a television, a smartphone, a computer, a wearable device, a home appliance device, a digital signage, a vehicle, a robot, etc. The hand-held device may include a smartphone, a smartpad, a wearable device (e.g., a smartwatch or smartglasses), and a computer (e.g., a notebook). The home appliance may include a TV, a refrigerator, and a washing machine. The IoT device may include a sensor and a smartmeter. For example, the BSs and the network may also be implemented as wireless devices and a specific wireless device <b>200</b><i>a </i>may operate as a BS/network node with respect to another wireless device.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The wireless devices <b>100</b><i>a </i>to <b>100</b><i>f </i>may be connected to a network <b>300</b> via BSs <b>200</b>.

N<sup>RB</sup><sub>sc </sub>is the number of subcarriers per RB. In the 3GPP-based wireless communication system, N<sup>RB</sup><sub>sc </sub>is typically 12. There is one resource grid for a given antenna port p, a subcarrier spacing configuration u, and a transmission link (DL or UL). The carrier bandwidth N<sup>size,u</sup><sub>grid </sub>for the subcarrier spacing configuration u is given to the UE by a higher layer parameter (e.g. RRC parameter). Each element in the resource grid for the antenna port p and the subcarrier spacing configuration u is referred to as a resource element (RE) and one complex symbol may be mapped to each RE. Each RE in the resource grid is uniquely identified by an index k in the frequency domain and an index/representing a symbol location relative to a reference point in the time domain. In the NR system, an RB is defined by 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain. In the NR system, RBs are classified into CRBs and physical resource blocks (PRBs). The CRBs are numbered from 0 upwards in the frequency domain for the subcarrier spacing configuration u. The center of subcarrier 0 of CRB 0 for the subcarrier spacing configuration u is equal to &#x2018;Point A&#x2019; which serves as a common reference point for RB grids. The PRBs are defined within a bandwidth part (BWP) and numbered from 0 to N<sup>size</sup><sub>BWP,i</sub>&#x2212;1, where i is a number of the BWP.

The BWP includes a plurality of consecutive RBs in the frequency domain. A carrier may include a maximum of N (e.g., 5) BWPs. The UE may be configured to have one or more BWPs on a given component carrier. Data communication is performed through an activated BWP and only a predetermined number of BWPs (e.g., one BWP) among BWPs configured for the UE may be active on the component carrier.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating exemplary slot structures which may be used in the 3GPP-based system.

predefined slot formats to be used for a specific slot, the BS may configure a set of slot format combinations available for each serving cell in a set of serving cells by higher-layer signaling (e.g., RRC signaling), and configure the UE to monitor a group-common PDCCH for slot format indicator(s) (SFI(s)) by higher-layer signaling (e.g., RRC signaling). DCI carried on the group-common PDCCH for the SFI(s) is referred to as SFI DCI. DCI format 2_0 is used for the SFI DCI. For example, for each serving cell in a set of serving cells, the BS may provide the UE with the (starting) position of a slot format combination ID (i.e., SFI-index) for the serving cell, a set of slot format combinations applicable to the serving cell, and a reference SCS configuration for each slot format in a slot format combination indicated by an SFI-index value in the SFI DCI. For each slot format combination in the set of slot format combinations, one or more slot formats are configured and a slot format combination ID (i.e., SFI-index) is assigned. For example, when the BS is to configure a slot format combination with N slot formats, the BS may indicate N ones of slot format indexes for the predefined slot formats (e.g., refer to Table 4) for the slot format combination. To configure the UE to monitor the group-common PDCCH for SFIs, the BS indicates an RNTI used for SFIs, SFI-RNTI and the total length of DCI payload scrambled with the SFI-RNTI to the UE. Upon detection of a PDCCH based on the SFI-RNTI, the UE may determine slot format(s) for a corresponding serving cell from an SFI-index for the serving cell among SFI-indexes in DCI payload of the PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0103">Symbols indicated as flexible by a TDD DL-UL pattern configuration may be indicated as UL, DL, or flexible by SFI DCI.

For example, the PDCCH (i.e., DCI) carries information about transport format and resource allocation of a downlink shared channel (DL-SCH), information about resource allocation of an uplink shared channel (UL-SCH), paging information about a paging channel (PCH), system information about the DL-SCH, information about resource allocation for a control message, such as a random access response (RAR) transmitted on a PDSCH, of a layer (hereinafter, higher layer) positioned higher than a physical layer among protocol stacks of the UE/BS, a transmit power control command, information about activation/release of configured scheduling (CS), etc. DCI including resource allocation information about the DL-SCH is referred to as PDSCH scheduling DCI, and DCI including resource allocation information about the UL-SCH is referred to as PUSCH scheduling DCI. The DCI includes a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). The CRC is masked/scrambled with various identifiers (e.g., radio network temporary identifier (RNTI)) according to an owner or usage of the PDCCH. For example, if the PDCCH is for a specific UE, the CRS is masked with a UE identifier (e.g., cell-RNTI (C-RNTI)). If the PDCCH is for a paging message, the CRC is masked with a paging RNTI (P-RNTI). If the PDCCH is for system information (e.g., system information block (SIB)), the CRC is masked with a system information RNTI (SI-RNTI). If the PDCCH is for a random access response, the CRC is masked with a random access-RNTI (RA-RNTI).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0109">If a PDCCH on a serving cell schedules a PDSCH or PUSCH of another serving cell, this is referred to as cross-carrier scheduling. Cross-carrier scheduling using a carrier indicator field (CIF) may permit a PDCCH of a serving cell to schedule resources on another serving cell. On the other hand, if a PDSCH on a serving cell schedules a PDSCH or PUSCH of the serving cell, this is referred to as self-carrier scheduling. If cross-carrier scheduling is used on a cell, the BS may provide information about a cell for scheduling the cell on which cross-carrier scheduling is used to the UE. For example, the BS may provide the UE with information as to whether a serving cell is scheduled by a PDCCH on another (scheduling) cell or by the serving cell, or which cell signals DL assignments and UL assignments for the serving cell when the serving cell is scheduled by another (scheduling) cell. In the present disclosure, a cell carrying a PDCCH is referred to as a scheduling cell, and a cell on which PUSCH or PDSCH transmission is scheduled by DCI included in the PDCCH, i.e., a cell carrying a PUSCH or a PDSCH scheduled by the PDCCH, is referred to as a scheduled cell.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0110">A PDCCH is transmitted through a control resource set (CORESET). One or more CORESETs may be configured for the UE. The CORESET consists of a set of PRBs with a duration of 1 to 3 OFDM symbols. The PRBs and a CORESET duration that constitute the CORESET may be provided to the UE through higher layer (e.g., RRC) signaling. A set of PDCCH candidates in the configured CORESET(s) is monitored according to corresponding search space sets. In the present disclosure, monitoring implies decoding (called blind decoding) each PDCCH candidate according to monitored DCI formats. A master information block (MIB) on a PBCH provides the UE with parameters (e.g., CORESET #0) for monitoring a PDCCH for scheduling a PDSCH carrying system information block 1 (SIB1). The PBCH may indicate that there is no associated SIB1. In this case, the UE is informed of not only a frequency range within which it may be assumed that there is no SSB associated with SSB1 but also another frequency range within which the SSB associated with SIB1 is to be discovered. CORESET #0, which is a CORESET for scheduling at least SIB1, may be configured through either the MIB or dedicated RRC signaling.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0111">The set of the PDCCH candidates that the UE monitors is defined in terms of PDCCH search space sets. The search space sets may be common search space (CSS) sets or UE-specific search space (USS) sets. Each CORESET configuration is associated with one or more search space sets and each search space set is associated with one CORESET configuration. The search space set is determined based on the following parameters provided by the BS to the UE.<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0112">controlResourceSetId: Indicator for identifying a CORESET associated with the search space set;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0113">monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset: A PDCCH monitoring periodicity and a PDCCH monitoring offset, for configuring slots for PDCCH monitoring.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0114">duration: The number of consecutive slots that the search space lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0115">monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot: A PDCCH monitoring pattern in a slot, indicating the first symbol(s) of the CORESET in a slot for PDCCH monitoring.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0116">nrofCandidates: The number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0110" num="0117">The UE monitors PDCCH candidates only in PDCCH monitoring occasions. The UE determines the PDCCH monitoring occasions from a PDCCH monitoring periodicity, a PDCCH monitoring offset, and a PDCCH monitoring pattern in a slot. Parameter monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot indicates, for example, the first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in slots configured for PDCCH monitoring (e.g., refer to parameters monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration). For example, if monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot is 14 bit, the bit of monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot may represent 14 OFDM symbols of a slot, respectively, such that the most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM symbol in the slot and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in the slot.

The PDSCH carries DL data (e.g., DL-SCH transport block) and is subjected to modulation such as quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), 64 QAM, 256 QAM, etc. A codeword is generated by encoding a transport block (TB). The PDSCH may carry a maximum of two codewords. Scrambling and modulation mapping per codeword may be performed and modulation symbols generated from each codeword may be mapped to one or more layers. Each layer is mapped to a radio resource together with a DMRS and generated as an OFDM symbol signal. Then, the OFDM symbol signal is transmitted through a corresponding antenna port.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0122">A PUCCH means a physical layer UL channel for UCI transmission. The PUCCH carries UCI.

The HARQ-ACK codebook may be categorized as a semi-static HARQ-ACK codebook and a dynamic HARQ-ACK codebook according to a HARQ-ACK payload determination scheme. In the present disclosure, the semi-static HARQ-ACK codebook is also referred to as a type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook, and the dynamic HARQ-ACK codebook is also referred to as a type-2 codebook.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0201">In the case of the semi-static HARQ-ACK codebook, parameters related to a HARQ-ACK payload size that the UE is to report are semi-statically configured by a (UE-specific) higher layer (e.g., RRC) signal. For example, the HARQ-ACK payload size of the semi-static HARQ-ACK codebook and the (maximum) HARQ-ACK payload (size) transmitted through one PUCCH in one slot may be determined based on the number of HARQ-ACK bit corresponding to a combination (hereinafter, bundling window) of all DL carriers (i.e., DL serving cells) configured for the UE and all DL scheduling slots (or PDSCH transmission slots or PDCCH monitoring slots) in which the HARQ-ACK transmission timing may be indicated. That is, in a semi-static HARQ-ACK codebook scheme, the size of the HARQ-ACK codebook is fixed (to a maximum value) regardless of the number of actually scheduled DL data. For example, DL grant DCI (PDCCH) includes PDSCH-to-HARQ-ACK timing information, and the PDSCH-to-HARQ-ACK timing information may have one (e.g., k) of a plurality of values. For example, when the PDSCH is received in slot #m and the PDSCH-to-HARQ-ACK timing information in the DL grant DCI (PDCCH) for scheduling the PDSCH indicates k, HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH may be transmitted in slot #(m+k). As an example, k &#x2208; {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. When the HARQ-ACK information is transmitted in slot #n, the HARQ-ACK information may include possible maximum HARQ-ACK based on the bundling window. That is, HARQ-ACK information of slot #n may include HARQ-ACK corresponding to slot #(n-k). For example, when k E {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, the HARQ-ACK information of slot #n may include HARQ-ACK corresponding to slot #(n-8) to slot #(n-1) regardless of actual DL data reception (i.e., HARQ-ACK of a maximum number). Here, the HARQ-ACK information may be replaced with a HARQ-ACK codebook or a HARQ-ACK payload. A slot may be understood/replaced as/with a candidate occasion for DL data reception. As described in the example, the bundling window may be determined based on a PDSCH-to-HARQ-ACK timing based on a HARQ-ACK slot, and a PDSCH-to-HARQ-ACK timing set may have predefined values (e.g., {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}) or may be configured by higher layer (RRC) signaling. In the case of the dynamic HARQ-ACK codebook, the HARQ-ACK payload size that the UE is to report may be dynamically changed by the DCI etc. In a dynamic HARQ-ACK codebook scheme, DL scheduling DCI may include a counter-DAI (i.e., c-DAI) and/or a total-DAI (i.e., t-DAI). Here, the DAI indicates a downlink assignment index and is used by the BS to inform the UE of transmitted or scheduled PDSCH(s) that are to be included in one HARQ-ACK transmission. Particularly, the c-DAI is an index indicating order between PDCCHs carrying DL scheduling DCI (hereinafter, DL scheduling PDCCHs), and t-DAI is an index indicating the total number of DL scheduling PDCCHs up to a current slot in which a PDCCH with the t-DAI is present. For example, the c-DAI represents a {CC, slot} scheduling order value calculated in a component carrier (CC)-first (or cell-first) manner and is used to designate the location of a HARQ-ACK bit in a HARQ-ACK codebook. The t-DAI represents a slot-unit scheduling accumulation value up to a slot in which a PDCCH carrying the t-DAI is present and is used to determine the size of the HARQ-ACK codebook.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0202">In the NR system, a method of implementing a plurality of logical networks in a single physical network is considered. The logical networks need to support services with various requirements (e.g., eMBB, mMTC, URLLC, etc.).

As an example, the physical layer of NR may change, if necessary, an OFDM symbol length (OFDM symbol duration) and a subcarrier spacing (SCS) (hereinafter, OFDM numerology).

Each PUCCH resource may be defined by a start symbol and a transmission interval. When PUCCH resources for PUCCH transmission overlap in a single slot, the UE may perform UCI multiplexing based on a PUCCH resource with the earliest start symbol. For example, the UE may determine overlapping PUCCH resource(s) (in time) (hereinafter, PUCCH resource(s) B) based on a PUCCH resource with the earliest start symbol (hereinafter, PUCCH resource A) in a slot (S<b>1001</b>).

To multiplex UCI associated with the PUCCH resource A and the PUCCH resource(s) B, the UE may determine a single PUCCH resource (hereinafter, MUX PUCCH resource) (S<b>1003</b>). For example, the UE determines a PUCCH resource set corresponding to a payload size of the MUX UCI (hereinafter, PUCCH resource set X) among PUCCH resource sets configured or available for the UE and determines one of PUCCH resources belonging to the PUCCH resource set X as a MUX PUCCH resource. For example, the UE may determine one of the PUCCH resources belonging to the PUCCH resource set X as the MUX PUCCH resource, using a PUCCH resource indicator field in the last DCI among DCIs having a PDSCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field that indicates the same slot for PUCCH transmission.

intends to transmit a plurality of overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or transmit overlapping PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot, the UE may multiplex the UCI types when specific conditions are fulfilled. The specific conditions may include multiplexing timeline condition(s). For example, PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) to which UCI multiplexing is applied in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> to <b>12</b></figref> may be UL channels that satisfy the multiplexing timeline condition(s). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the UE may need to transmit a plurality of UL channels (e.g., UL channels #1 to #4) in the same slot. Here, UL CH #1 may be a PUSCH scheduled by PDCCH #1. UL CH #2 may be a PUCCH for transmitting HARQ-ACK for a PDSCH. The PDSCH is scheduled by PDCCH #2 and a resource of UL CH #2 may also be indicated by PDCCH #2.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0227">In this case, if overlapping UL channels (e.g., UL channels #1 to #3) on the time axis satisfy the multiplexing timeline condition, the UE may perform UCI multiplexing for overlapping UL channels #1 to #3 on the time axis. For example, the UE may check whether the first symbol of UL CH #3 from the last symbol of the PDSCH satisfies the condition of T1. The UE may also check whether the first symbol of UL CH #3 from the last symbol of PDCCH #1 satisfies the condition of T2. If the multiplexing timeline condition is satisfied, the UE may perform UCI multiplex for UL channels #1 to #3. In contrast, if the earliest UL channel (e.g., UL channel having the earliest start symbol) among overlapping UL channels does not satisfy the multiplexing timeline condition, the UE may not be allowed to multiplex all of the corresponding UCI types.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0228"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates transmission of a plurality of HARQ-ACK PUCCHs in a slot.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0229">The current NR standard specification (e.g., 3GPP TS 38.213 V15.2.0) specifies that the UE is not expected to transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in more than one slot. Accordingly, according to the current NR standard specification, the UE may transmit at most one PUCCH with the HARQ-ACK information in one slot. In order to prevent a situation in which the UE fails to transmit the HARQ-ACK information due to restrictions on the number of HARQ-ACK PUCCHs transmittable by the UE, the BS needs to perform DL scheduling so that the HARQ-ACK information may be multiplexed on one PUCCH resource. However, when taking into consideration a service with stringent latency and reliability requirements, such as a URLLC service, a scheme of concentrating a plurality of HARQ-ACK feedbacks only on one PUCCH in a slot may not be desirable in terms of PUCCH performance. Furthermore, in order to support a latency-critical service, the BS may be required to schedule a plurality of consecutive PDSCHs with a short duration in one slot. Although the UE may transmit a PUCCH in random symbol(s) in a slot by the configuration/indication of the BS, if the UE is allowed to transmit only a maximum of one HARQ-ACK PUCCH in a slot, it may be impossible for the BS to perform fast back-to-back scheduling for PDSCHs and for the UE to perform fast HARQ-ACK feedback. Accordingly, in order to flexibly and efficiently use resources and support services, it is better to allow transmission of a plurality of (non-overlapping) HARQ-ACK PUCCHs (or PUSCHs) in one slot as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0230">One of the representative scenarios of the next system, URLLC has the low-latency and high-reliability requirements of a user-plane delay of 0.5 ms and transmission of X bytes of data within 1 ms at or below an error rate of 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>. In general, eMBB is characterized by a large traffic capacity, a file size equal to or less than tens to hundreds of bytes, and sporadic occurrence. Therefore, eMBB requires transmission at a maximum transmission rate with minimum overhead of control information, whereas URLLC requires a short scheduling time unit and a reliable transmission method.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0231">Depending on application fields or traffic types, various reference time units may be assumed/used to transmit/receive a physical channel.

Some embodiments/implementations of the present disclosure are described in the context of a slot or mini-slot as a reference time unit, for convenience of description. A slot may be, for example, a basic scheduling unit used for general data traffic (e.g., eMBB).

Here, the &#x201c;candidate PDSCH receptions&#x201d; may include a PDSCH scheduled through dynamic DL assignment DCI and/or an SPS PDSCH transmitted on a determined resource indicated by an SPS configuration activated through DL SPS activation DCI. For example, referring to Section 9.1.2.1 of 3GPP TS 38.213 V15.5.0, for a serving cell c, an active DL BWP, and an active UL BWP, the UE may determine a set of M<sub>A,c </sub>occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions for which the UE is to transmit corresponding HARQ-ACK information on a PUCCH in a slot nu, based on a) a set of slot timing values K<sub>1 </sub>associated with the active UL BWP and b) a set of row indexes R of a table provided by row indexes (hereinafter, TDRA table row indexes) that define slot offsets K0, start and length indicators SLIV, and PDSCH mapping types, which are associated with the DL BWP and are for PDSCH reception. For the set of the slot timing values K<sub>1</sub>, the UE determines the set of M<sub>A,c </sub>occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions or SPS PDSCH releases. The M<sub>A,c </sub>occasions are indexed in ascending order of used TDRA table row indexes for the same cell index and the same slot timing value, indexed in descending order of slot timing values for the same cell index, and indexed in ascending order of serving cell indexes for different cells.

In this case, the TDRA table row indexes are considered in ascending order with respect to each slot timing value in descending order of the slot timing values. In the HARQ-ACK codebook, locations of HARQ-ACK information bits for candidate PDSCH receptions and/or SPS PDSCH releases are determined based on occasion(s) M<sub>c </sub>for candidate PDSCH reception(s) or SPS PDSCH release(s) per cell and a maximum number of codewords (i.e., a maximum number of transport blocks) capable of being transmitted in a corresponding cell. For example, one HARQ-ACK information bit for one transport block or two HARQ-ACK information bits for two transport blocks are determined for each occasion according to a maximum number of transport blocks configured for a corresponding serving cell in ascending order of indexes of occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions or SPS PDSCH releases for one serving cell and then are included in the HARQ-ACK codebook. In the case of a HARQ-ACK codebook for multiple serving cells, HARQ-ACK information bits for the multiple serving cells are included in the HARQ-ACK codebook in ascending order of serving cell indexes from HARQ-ACK information bits for a serving cell of the lowest serving cell index. Consequently, according to Section 9.1.2.1 of 3GPP TS 38.213 V15.5.0, HARQ-ACK information bit(s) for a cell of a lower serving cell index precede HARQ-ACK information bit(s) for a cell of a higher serving cell index in the HARQ-ACK codebook. In addition, in HARQ-ACK information bits for the same serving cell index, HARQ-ACK information bits for a higher slot timing value precedes HARQ-ACK information bits for a lower slot timing value and, in HARQ-ACK information bits for the same slot timing value, HARQ-ACK information bits for a lower (TDRA table) row index precedes HARQ-ACK information bits for a higher (TDRA table) row index.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0243">&#x3c;2-1&#x3e; In some scenarios, a minimum periodicity of a DL SPS is 10 ms. In scenarios in which the minimum periodicity of the DL SPS is 10 ms, a HARQ-ACK bit, corresponding to the DL SPS, which is capable of being included in one PUCCH resource, is one bit corresponding to candidate PDSCH reception indicated through DL SPS activation DCI. If the minimum periodicity of the DL SPS is reduced to a predetermined value or less, a DL SPS based PDSCH may be received on a resource other than candidate PDSCH reception indicated through the DL SPS activation DCI. For example, if a TDRA table is configured for the UE through a higher layer (e.g., RRC) signal, the periodicity of a DL SPS is set to 7 symbols, and starting symbol index=1 and length=2 are indicated through a TDRA field of the DL SPS activation DCI, then the UE may receive a PDSCH in symbols {#1, #2} and a PDSCH in symbols {#8, #9} in a slot (assuming that a subcarrier spacing is 15 kHz). However, in the case of the symbols {#8, #9}, a start and length indicator value (SLIV) indicating a corresponding resource in the TDRA table may not be present, and a HARQ-ACK bit corresponding to the SLIV may not be included in the type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook.

In some scenarios, if an available UL resource is not present due to a TDD configuration in the slot n+K<sub>1</sub>, a rule is defined such that the UE cancels PUCCH transmission for HARQ-ACK. However, to support URLLC targeted at (i.e., requiring) lower latency and higher reliability than existing latency and reliability, a shorter SPS periodicity and/or a plurality of SPS configurations may be considered. In this case, cancellation for PUCCH transmission caused by absence of an available UL resource may be more frequently generated.
