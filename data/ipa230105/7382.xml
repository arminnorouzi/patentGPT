The headphone <b>100</b> is wired to or wirelessly connected to an unillustrated audio device (e.g., music player, sound mixer, smartphone). The headphone <b>100</b> has a headband <b>102</b> and a pair of housings <b>10</b>. The headphone <b>100</b> may have a noise canceling function. An earphone shall be a kind of the headphone <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a plan view of the housing <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a III-III cross-sectional perspective view of the housing <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A first driver unit <b>12</b> is attached to the housing <b>10</b>. The first driver unit <b>12</b> is configured to reproduce sound from electrical signals of original sound such as music. If it is a dynamic type, the sound is reproduced by passing an electric current through a coil based on the electric signals and vibrating a first diaphragm <b>20</b> by magnetic force.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The housing <b>10</b> has a first opening <b>18</b> in an output surface <b>16</b> opposed to a user's ear. The first diaphragm <b>20</b> of the first driver unit <b>12</b> is attached to the output surface <b>16</b> to block the first opening <b>18</b>. An ear cup <b>22</b> is attached to the output surface <b>16</b>, surrounding the first opening <b>18</b> and the first driver unit <b>12</b>. In addition to the first opening <b>18</b>, the housing <b>10</b> may have an aperture (port) for adjusting acoustic characteristics.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A partition wall <b>24</b> is attached to the housing <b>10</b>. For example, the partition wall <b>24</b> is attached to a back of the output surface <b>16</b> and includes a side wall portion <b>26</b> enclosing the first driver unit <b>12</b> and a lid portion <b>28</b> closing a space enclosed by the side wall portion <b>26</b>. The partition wall <b>24</b> covers the first driver unit <b>12</b>. The partition wall <b>24</b> divides an internal space of the housing <b>10</b> into a first space <b>30</b>, where the first driver unit <b>12</b> is located, and a second space <b>30</b>. The first driver unit <b>12</b> faces the first space <b>30</b> and an external space.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The partition wall <b>24</b> (housing <b>10</b>) has a second opening <b>34</b>. The second diaphragm <b>38</b> of the second driver unit <b>36</b> is attached to the partition wall <b>24</b> to block the second opening <b>34</b>. The second driver unit <b>36</b> faces both the first space <b>30</b> and the second space <b>32</b>. The second driver unit <b>36</b> may have the same structure (e.g., dynamic type) as the first driver unit <b>12</b> or a different structure. The second driver unit <b>36</b> may be smaller than or the same in size as the first driver unit <b>12</b>. Two or more second driver units <b>36</b> may block respective two or more second openings <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first space <b>30</b> is a closed space because the first opening <b>18</b> and the second opening <b>34</b> are blocked by the first diaphragm <b>20</b> and the second diaphragm <b>38</b>, respectively. The housing <b>10</b> (partition wall <b>24</b>) has the closed space. The second diaphragm <b>38</b> is located between the first space <b>30</b> and the second space <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Since there is a first space behind the first diaphragm <b>20</b>, air pressure in the first space affects vibration of the first diaphragm <b>20</b>, thereby determining sound quality of the first driver unit <b>12</b>. On the other hand, since the first space is in front of the second diaphragm <b>38</b>, vibration of the second diaphragm <b>38</b> increases or decreases volume (capacity) of the first space, thereby changing the air pressure in the first space. In the housing <b>10</b> (e.g., between the partition wall <b>24</b> and the housing <b>10</b>), an electrical board <b>40</b> is located.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of an acoustic adjustment circuit. An acoustic adjustment circuit <b>42</b> for driving the second driver unit <b>36</b> is included in the electrical board <b>40</b>.

The acoustic adjustment circuit <b>42</b> is configured to generate a second signal S<b>2</b> based on the first signal S<b>1</b>. The second signal S<b>2</b> is input to the second driver unit <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the acoustic adjustment circuit <b>42</b> is configured to generate the second signal S<b>2</b> in an opposite phase to the first signal S<b>1</b> in a first band arbitrarily configurable. The first band is a frequency band in which sound pressure level is controlled to be lowered, and may be a partial frequency band or an entire frequency band. By setting the second signal S<b>2</b> in the opposite phase to the first signal S<b>1</b> in the first band, the first diaphragm <b>20</b> and the second diaphragm <b>38</b> vibrate in opposed directions or in opposite directions, so volume of the closed space (first space <b>30</b>) changes much, increasing an impact of an air spring. This means that the sound pressure level of the first driver unit <b>12</b> can be lowered in the first band. This enables flexible adjustment of the acoustic characteristics.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">[Modification]</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a circuit diagram of an acoustic adjustment circuit according to Modification 1.

The second band is a frequency band where the sound pressure level is controlled to be increased, and may be a partial frequency band or an entire frequency band. By making the second signal S<b>2</b> in the same phase as the first signal S<b>1</b> in the second band, the first diaphragm <b>20</b> and the second diaphragm <b>38</b> vibrate in the same direction, so the volume of the closed space (first space <b>30</b>) changes little, decreasing the impact of the air spring.
