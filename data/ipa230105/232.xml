No. 63/212,110 filed Jun. 18, 2021, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Currently, most skincare products (including any form of topical agent) are applied to the skin using a finger or fingers. Typically, a person that wishes to apply skincare products to their own skin or the skin of another person uses their finger(s) for topical application. This typical practice creates genuine problems, whether the skincare product being applied to the skin is for beauty, medication, or protection purposes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Beauty skincare products, such as lotions, oils, creams, serums, ointments, make-up, and the like, are often costly due to a combination of active ingredients, some of which have been developed through unique technological and/or biological advancements or formulations. Beauty skincare products are typically applied by a person to the face, neck, or chest areas using finger(s). This poses a two-fold problem. The first problem is that by inserting finger(s) into the jar or container that holds the beauty skincare product, a person can inadvertently introduce germs, bacteria, and other impurities that can degrade and compromise the integrity of the beauty skincare product. Some beauty skincare companies have tried to address this problem in various ways including by utilizing a dropper, pump or other device or tool to apply the beauty skincare product directly to the desired area, but this can be clumsy and/or result in ineffective application because skin application by finger(s) remains necessary. The second problem is the amount of beauty skincare product that can be absorbed by the skin of a person's finger(s) in connection with the application of the beauty skincare product. Considering the high price and low volume of many beauty skincare products, the unavoidable wastage of product can result in significant cost downsides.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Medication skincare products, such as medicated lotions, oils, creams, serums, ointments, and the like, have active medicated ingredients which may also be expensive. Medication skincare products are typically applied topically by a person to the skin. This poses a two-fold problem. The first problem is that by inserting finger(s) into the jar or container that holds the medication skincare product, a person can inadvertently introduce germs, bacteria, and other impurities that can degrade and compromise the integrity of the medication skincare product. The second problem is the amount of medication skincare product that can be absorbed by the skin of a person's finger(s) in connection with the application of the medication skincare product. This can cause medical concern if the skin of the finger(s) absorbs undue medication, such as steroids, and also can cause wastage of product and consequent expense through unnecessary absorption. Medication skincare products can include steroids, antibiotics, antiviral agents, nanoparticles, and or other therapeutic agents formulated to treat the skin.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Protection skincare products, such as sunscreen, zinc oxide, tanning lotion, lotions, and other such oils, creams, serums, ointments, and the like, pose additional problems when applied to the skin using finger(s). Protection skincare products are typically applied in an outdoor setting with limited or no access to washing facilities. Finger(s) can be sandy, dirty, or sweaty at the time of application, necessitating washing hands before application or risk having sand, dirt, or sweat rubbed on the skin along with the protection skincare product. The presence of protection skincare product on the finger(s) after application can cause additional problems, such as leaving hands oily or greasy which is a particular issue for athletes who require unsullied/dry grip, or by forcing the applying person to get rid of the excess, such as by wiping on a towel, blanket, or other fabric, which can be inconvenient and messy and risk staining or damaging the fabric, or generally leave residue in the environment of application such as in a vehicle or on belongings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates generally to the field of applicators for a variety of skincare products. More specifically, the present invention relates to an applicator apparatus having a handle and an applicator head, which may pivot, on or over which a removable applicator pad can be stretched or otherwise attach, and which serves as a means to apply to the skin a variety of skincare products such as lotions, oils, or serums for beauty, medication, or protection purposes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To provide easy, clean, and effective application of skincare products, an applicator according to the disclosed embodiments may be used. The applicator solves, for example, the various problems discussed above by providing systems and methods of applying skincare products that avoid contamination, wastage through absorption, and/or mess and inconvenience.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of the invention relates to an applicator for skincare products. The applicator includes a handle and applicator head which may pivot. The applicator further includes an, optionally removable, applicator pad that can be stretched on or over or otherwise attach to the applicator head. The applicator pad may be re-usable, washable, disposable, soft, smooth and/or textured, and/or configured to be heated (for example in a microwave) and/or cooled (for example in a freezer) to enhance the application process and/or to enable the use of the pad for massaging and/or depuffing purposes. For example, in some embodiments the applicator pad is configured to be heated and used with heat activated skincare products.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the handle is removable from the applicator head. In some embodiments the applicator pad has different shapes or textures that assist in the application of the skincare products.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the invention relates to methods of applying skincare products. The methods include holding the applicator by the handle and dipping the head covered with the pad into the skincare product and then applying the skincare product residue picked up by the pad on the skin.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the method further includes holding the applicator by the handle and directly dripping, applying, or squirting the skincare product onto the head covered with the pad and applying the skincare product residue on the pad to the skin.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the method further includes having the skincare product applied by way of ejection or expulsion from within the applicator head or the applicator handle onto the applicator pad and applying the skincare product residue on the pad to the skin. The applicator pad is optionally provided pre-loaded with one or more of the skincare products discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting.
