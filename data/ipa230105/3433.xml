No. 16/779,049 filed on Jan. 31, 2020, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT CONCERNING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not applicable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure is generally related to refrigeration technology. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to an improved device for storing and chilling ingredients and accessories, such as beverage containers and ice, for example.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Restaurants, taverns, clubs, and other establishments in the hospitality industry often aim to serve beverages (e.g., cocktails) to patrons in an efficient and flavorful manner. Many of such establishments offer patrons a wide variety of beverages. Such beverages may be served in an individual bottle or concocted from a number of ingredients. Often these beverages and ingredients are best served chilled. As a result, storage and retrieval of containers holding these beverages and ingredients can present logistical issues for the establishment. For instance, without sufficient storage space for containers, a bartender may be required to step away from the bar frequently to retrieve additional containers from auxiliary refrigerators.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to storing containers, often establishments aim to store ice in an accessible and efficient configuration. Establishments may employ ice in a variety of shapes and sizes, for example, cubes and spheres, to enhance aesthetics and drinkability of artisanal drinks. For instance, use of a single large ice format (e.g., cube, spear, globe, etc.) can enhance the flavor profile of the cocktail by reducing the surface area of the ice as compared to use of multiple smaller ice cubes, thereby slowing the melt time and inhibiting dilution of the cocktail. Moreover, premium ice with less trapped air tends to melt slower and thus further reduces the dilution rate. In general, the overall storage of disparate ice geometries and the efficiency of retrieval is improved when each ice type is partitioned and the bartender can retrieve the desired shape without excessive sorting, digging, or rearranging. In the absence of a dedicated storage solution, operators are often left to devise makeshift solutions for specialty ice, such as storing the ice in a portable cooler with dry ice or in an auxiliary cooler that is often inconveniently removed from the ideal bar area.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, artisanal ice often comes with heightened expectations regarding its appearance. For example, globe-shaped cocktail ice, in addition to other geometries, is generally expected to be clear without any sign of clouds or cracks. As a result, this ice is preferably stored within a particular temperature range and tempered prior to use to prevent cracking when the ice is placed in a beverage. Without a refined process of storing, retrieving, and tempering the specialty ice, the bartender is subject to various time and energy inefficiencies as well as compromising the intended aesthetic of the beverage.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, in view of at least the above, a need exists for an improved device for the storage of beverage ingredients, beverage containers, and/or ice in a refrigerated environment having a controlled temperature variation.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some embodiments described herein provide a refrigeration device capable of chilling beverage ingredients and accessories, such as beverage prep containers and ice. The refrigeration device includes a first compartment that defines a first open top area, a second compartment that defines a second open top area, and a wall disposed between the first compartment and the second compartment. The refrigeration device further includes a controller configured to control the temperature in at least one of the first compartment and the second compartment, a temperature regulator configured to adjust a thermal communication between the first compartment and the second compartment, and a lid assembly configured to cover the first open top area when in a fully closed position.

Additionally, the first compartment <b>132</b> defines a volume of approximately 0.34 cubic feet and the second compartment <b>136</b> defines a volume of approximately 0.21 cubic feet; however, other configurations and form factors are contemplated. In other embodiments, a storage portion of a refrigeration device can include first and second compartments, each having a volume between about 0.05 cubic feet and about 2 cubic feet, or between about 0.1 cubic feet and about 0.5 cubic feet, for instance.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The storage portion <b>104</b> further includes a wall <b>164</b> that is disposed between the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b>, and a temperature regulator <b>168</b>, which will be described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>14</b></figref>.

In use, for example, the movable divider <b>172</b> may be used to separate products, such as ice, within the first compartment <b>132</b> to facilitate organization, tempering, and the like. In some embodiments, the first compartment <b>132</b> may be divided into a plurality of sections by a plurality of movable or stationary dividers. In other embodiments, the second compartment <b>136</b> may be divided into one or more sections by a movable or stationary divider.

Though not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, it should be appreciated that the first panel <b>188</b> similarly includes first and second protrusions extending from a left lateral side. The first panel further includes a cavity <b>212</b>. The cavity <b>212</b> includes a track <b>216</b> disposed along lateral sides of the cavity <b>212</b> and is defined on one side by a front lip <b>218</b>. Correspondingly, the second panel <b>192</b> includes a sliding portion <b>220</b> that is dimensioned to be received by the track <b>216</b>. The second panel <b>192</b> further includes a rear stop <b>222</b> that extends vertically from a top side of the second panel <b>192</b> along a back edge.

In the retracted position, the second panel <b>192</b> is nested within the cavity <b>212</b> of the first panel <b>188</b>. In the example embodiment, when nested in the cavity <b>212</b>, the second panel <b>192</b> is partially bounded between the track <b>216</b> and multiple cylindrical projections <b>206</b> that extend inward from interior surfaces of the lateral sides (e.g., the right lateral side <b>208</b> and, while not shown, mirrored cylindrical projections on the opposite lateral side), thus helping to inhibit excessive nonplanar movement between the first panel <b>188</b> and the nested second panel <b>192</b>. In the extended position, the rear stop <b>222</b> may engage the front lip <b>218</b>, thereby retaining the second panel <b>192</b> at least partially within the cavity <b>212</b>. In one example of disassembling the lid assembly <b>184</b>, the second panel <b>192</b> can be tilted relative to the first panel <b>188</b> when in the extended position, such that the rear stop <b>222</b> is disengaged from the front lip <b>218</b>.

While the following description will refer to the hinge <b>200</b>A, it should be appreciated that a like-description may be applied to the hinge <b>200</b>B. In the illustrated embodiment, the hinge <b>200</b>A includes a first arm <b>224</b> and a second arm <b>228</b> with a slot <b>232</b> disposed therebetween. The second arm <b>228</b> includes a guide surface <b>236</b> that terminates in an engagement feature, which is configured as a notch <b>240</b> in the illustrated embodiment; however, other configurations are possible. For example, the second arm <b>228</b> may include an engagement feature that is configured as a protrusion that is dimensioned to engage a recess on the lid assembly <b>184</b>. As illustrated in the partial view of the lid assembly <b>184</b>, the first protrusion <b>204</b>A engages the slot <b>232</b> and the second protrusion <b>204</b>B engages the guide surface <b>236</b>.

The open end <b>244</b> of the slot <b>232</b> facilitates installation of the lid assembly <b>184</b> with the refrigeration device <b>100</b>; however, other configurations are possible. For example, the slot <b>232</b> may not include an open top end <b>244</b> such that the slot <b>232</b> forms a closed boundary. In other embodiments, a hinge may include additional or alternative engagement features that interact with the lid assembly <b>184</b>, such that the lid assembly <b>184</b> can be moved between a fully opened and a fully closed position. For example, the lid assembly <b>184</b> may be pivotably secured to the refrigeration device <b>100</b> via a barrel, piano, or butterfly hinge. Further, while the lid assembly <b>184</b> in the example embodiment is shown to include the first panel <b>188</b> and the second panel <b>192</b>, other configurations are possible. For example, a lid assembly may include a single panel movable between an opened position and a closed position.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the coils <b>124</b> are illustrated as at least partially surrounding the storage portion <b>104</b>. In the embodiment shown, the coils <b>124</b> surround the storage portion <b>104</b> proximate to the first compartment <b>132</b> around the exterior sides and back of the storage portion <b>104</b>. As such, the controller <b>148</b> is configured to control the temperature of the first compartment <b>132</b>. While the example refrigeration system <b>108</b> is generally depicted as employing a refrigeration cycle (e.g., such as via a compressor, condenser, and evaporator arrangement), other techniques can be implemented, such as a piezoelectric refrigeration system. In one example, a user may adjust the controller <b>148</b> to set the temperature of the first compartment <b>132</b> to a temperature that is between &#x2212;25 degrees Fahrenheit and 10 degrees Fahrenheit; however, other temperature ranges are possible, for example, between &#x2212;30 degrees Fahrenheit and 32 degrees Fahrenheit. In the illustrated embodiment, the controller <b>148</b> is shown on a cover <b>248</b> of the refrigeration system <b>108</b>; however, other configurations are possible. For example, the controller <b>148</b> may be located on alternative areas of the refrigeration device <b>100</b>, such as the top surface <b>156</b> or a backsplash <b>252</b>. In other embodiments, a controller that is configured to control the temperature of at least one of the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b> may be remote from the refrigeration system.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>14</b></figref>, an example embodiment of the temperature regulator <b>168</b> is shown.

The temperature regulator <b>168</b> includes a damper <b>256</b> that has a tab <b>260</b>. The tab <b>260</b> facilitates sliding the damper <b>256</b> relative to the wall <b>164</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the damper <b>256</b> includes interface features (e.g., a pair of openings through the tab <b>260</b>) and is configured to slide between a first rail <b>264</b> and a second rail <b>268</b>; however, other configurations are possible. For example, a damper may use a single track to translate relative to the wall <b>164</b>. In the embodiment shown, the first rail <b>264</b> and the second rail <b>268</b> each extend in a direction that is substantially parallel to the top surface <b>156</b> of the storage portion <b>104</b> within the second compartment <b>136</b>. In other embodiments, the first rail <b>264</b> and the second rail <b>268</b> may extend in a direction non-parallel to the top surface <b>156</b>. In other embodiments, a mechanism for adjusting a temperature regulator may be disposed within the first compartment <b>132</b>. In still other examples, the damper may comprise a series of louvers, slots, triangular segments, and the like that are adapted to be incrementally moveable to alter the overlap between the particular damper form factor and a particular form factor of the duct, thus altering the amount of thermal communication between compartments.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The temperature regulator <b>168</b> and its practicality will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>14</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates the damper <b>256</b> fully overlapping a duct <b>272</b>. The duct <b>272</b> is defined by the wall <b>164</b> and provides thermal communication between the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b>. Thermal communication is primarily achieved via natural convection through the duct <b>272</b> due to the temperature difference of air in the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b>; however, other forms of heat transfer, including conduction and radiation, can be considered as part of the overall thermal communication. In other forms, forced convection may be used to enhance the thermal communication via the duct <b>272</b>, such as by placement of a fan along the duct <b>272</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown, the damper <b>256</b> is in a minimum position, such that airflow is inhibited through the duct <b>272</b> between the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates the damper <b>256</b> in an intermediate position such that the duct <b>272</b> is partially exposed and intermediate thermal communication between the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b> is allowed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the damper <b>256</b> is in a maximum position such that the damper <b>256</b> does not overlap the duct <b>272</b> and the duct <b>272</b> is substantially fully exposed. The maximum position, as illustrated, allows maximum thermal communication between the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b>. Given the benefit of this disclosure, one skilled in the art will appreciate the various alternative form factors available, such as a circular duct with a circular damper having a fixed plate and a rotatable plate, each plate defining alternating triangular openings and solid segments that can be rotated to alter the overlap between the openings and the segments.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The temperature regulator <b>168</b> allows the temperature of the second compartment <b>136</b> to be adjusted, such as by a user sliding the damper <b>256</b> to a desired position of overlap with the duct <b>272</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the temperature of the second compartment <b>136</b> may be adjusted between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 55 degrees Fahrenheit; however, other temperature ranges are possible. For example, the temperature of the second compartment <b>136</b> may be adjusted between &#x2212;25 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. In use, a user may engage the tab <b>260</b> and slide the damper <b>256</b> relative to the duct <b>272</b> towards the maximum position, thereby lowering the temperature of the second compartment <b>136</b>. Alternatively, the user may slide the damper <b>256</b> towards the minimum position, thereby increasing the temperature of the second compartment <b>136</b>. Based on the thermal communication through the duct <b>272</b>, it should be understood that the temperature of the first compartment <b>132</b> affects the achievable temperature range within the second compartment <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, the wall <b>164</b> defines a thickness <b>276</b> that facilitates thermal insulation in each of the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b>. The duct <b>272</b> extends through the entire thickness <b>276</b> of the wall <b>164</b> in a direction substantially perpendicular to the wall <b>164</b>. The direction that the duct <b>272</b> extends through the wall facilitates the thermal communication therethrough while providing the shortest airflow path through the wall between each of the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In other forms, the form factor (e.g., cross section) and/or orientation (e.g., longitudinal orientation relative to horizontal) of the duct <b>272</b> can be adapted to alter the resulting thermal communication properties. For instance, increasing the cross section and angling the duct to slope downwardly from the second compartment <b>136</b> to the first compartment <b>132</b> may enhance thermal communication via a duct. Furthermore, the vertical placement of the duct <b>272</b> on the wall <b>164</b> (relative to the bottom of the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b>) can impact the thermal communication as the temperature gradient in the first compartment <b>132</b> can be altered, for instance. In the example shown, the duct <b>272</b> is positioned approximately below the vertical middle of the wall <b>164</b>. In other forms, the position of the duct <b>272</b> can be raised or lowered to increase or decrease the temperature gradient achievable between the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b>. In other embodiments, the wall <b>164</b> may define additional ducts to alter the thermal communication properties and provide a higher resolution of user control, such as increased precision in temperature adjustability.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref> further illustrate a method of attachment for each of the first rail <b>264</b> and the second rail <b>268</b> to the wall <b>164</b>.

The seal <b>288</b> is dimensioned to surround an outer edge <b>292</b> of the duct <b>272</b> and provide a seal between the damper <b>256</b> and the wall <b>164</b>. The seal <b>288</b> reduces unwanted airflow between the first compartment <b>132</b> and the second compartment <b>136</b>, particularly when the damper <b>256</b> is in the minimum position. The seal <b>288</b> may also act as a point of resistance between the damper <b>256</b> and the wall <b>164</b>, such that additional force is required to translate the damper <b>256</b> relative to the wall <b>164</b>. Such resistance may limit unwanted movement of the damper <b>256</b> when the refrigeration device <b>100</b> is in use. For instance, a user may be taking a bottle, or other items, in and out of the second compartment <b>136</b>.
