One specific example provides either five or seven spaced apart striations <b>273</b> on each lug <b>264</b>. With respect to the range of numbers of striations <b>273</b> on each lug <b>264</b>, it has been determined that there may be criticality in the claimed range.

The rear surface <b>275</b> is more vertical or more closely to parallel to the imaginary vertical axis of the lug, whereas the front surface <b>277</b> is more inclined or more angled relative to the imaginary vertical axis of the lug. In one particular embodiment, the angle of inclination of the striations <b>273</b> is equal to that of the front surface <b>277</b> relative to a vertical axis. For example, if the striations are angled at 60 degrees relative to an imaginary horizontal axis that is coplanar with bottom surface <b>271</b> and 30 degrees relative to an imaginary vertical axis, then the front surface <b>277</b> would also be angled at 60 degrees relative to an imaginary horizontal axis and 30 degrees relative to an imaginary vertical axis.

With respect to the range of angles of inclination relative to the imaginary axes, it has been determined that there may be criticality in the claimed range. Particularly, the range from about 60 degrees to about 85 degrees relative to an imaginary horizontal axis and the range from about 30 to 15 degrees relative to an imaginary vertical axis provides improved flexibility of the striations to operate as the plurality of squeegees or &#x201c;mini-squeegees&#x201d; when placed on bottom surface <b>271</b> of lugs <b>264</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The first squeegee <b>258</b> may be made of a flexible material but is still more rigid than the second squeegee <b>262</b>.

Striations or ribs <b>257</b> may extend fully or partially, depending on application specific needs, in the transverse direction from the left side to the right side of base member <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, the squeegee portion <b>253</b> of squeegee <b>262</b> includes striations <b>257</b> that are formed as grooves or channels that extended inwardly into the body or material forming the squeegee portion <b>253</b> of the second squeegee <b>262</b>. More particularly, the striations <b>257</b> are formed in the upper surface of the squeegee portion and extend downwardly (i.e., into the squeegee) to a depth that terminates above a lower surface of second squeegee <b>262</b>. Given the flexibility of the material used to form squeegee <b>262</b>, when force is applied to the end of the squeegee, the striations <b>257</b> operate to capture additional pet hair <b>100</b> when the tool is used in the mode or operational engagement position depicted below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>E</figref>. Namely, the striations may slightly flex and open or spread apart at their upper end to assist in gathering pet hair <b>100</b> in the depth of the striation or channel. The number of striations <b>257</b> will depend on the physical size of apparatus <b>210</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> depicts six striations <b>257</b>, it is to be understood that the number of striations <b>257</b> may range from two striations to about eight or ten striations depending on the size of the squeegee <b>262</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, while the striations <b>257</b> generally form channels defined by generally parallel sidewalls, the striations may take other configurations to assist in gathering pet hair <b>100</b> used in conjunction with squeegee <b>262</b>. Thus, the present disclosure envisions any type of squeegee, such as squeegee <b>262</b> or another type of squeegee, that has a component added to or formed in at least one surface of the squeegee that assists the primary edge of the squeegee <b>262</b> to remove pet hair <b>100</b> from an inanimate object. For example, the striations may define a groove or channel that has angled sidewalls such that the channel or groove is V-shaped, C-shaped, U-shaped or W-shaped (or any other suitable configuration) in cross section.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Alternatively to the configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>, the squeegee <b>262</b> may be formed with ribs, nubs, bumps, projections, mounds, bosses, or another feature that project outwardly from the upper surface of squeegee portion <b>253</b> that assists the primary edge of the squeegee <b>262</b> to remove pet hair <b>100</b> from an inanimate object.

For example, it is typical that squeegees are formed from a flexible material, such as natural or synthetic rubber or other polymer that is rubber-like. In these instances, the material forming the squeegee is generally smooth. The present disclosure improves on this traditional smooth squeegee by providing squeegee <b>262</b> with a textured surface, such as a texture similar to sandpaper. The textured surface on the squeegee refers to a textured that can be felt to the touch of the user as opposed to a traditional smooth finish on a squeegee. For example, the sandpaper-like finish or texture of at least one surface of squeegee <b>262</b> may be embodied as a texture that is in a range from 25-grit to 400-grit sandpaper that is integrally formed with the squeegee as a unibody monolithic singular member. The textured surface, such as a sandpaper-like texture, assists the primary edge of the squeegee <b>262</b> to remove pet hair <b>100</b> from an inanimate object. Thus, the textured surface on squeegee <b>262</b> refers to any type of squeegee having any configuration in which a surface on the squeegee is not a smooth.

The pointed end <b>225</b> may be considered to be another engagement member, or the sixth engagement member <b>216</b>F. The pointed end <b>225</b> is configured to be a sixth engagement member inasmuch as the pointed end <b>225</b> is utilized to perform a sixth mode of operation (i.e., a sixth operational engagement position) to remove pet hair <b>100</b> from a surface <b>13</b>. Namely, the pointed tip <b>231</b> of end <b>225</b> can be inserted into a crack or crease in the surface <b>13</b> to assist in the removal of pet hair <b>100</b> from surface <b>13</b> at the crack or crease by dragging the pointed tip <b>231</b> along the length of the crease or crack in the surface <b>13</b>. The pointed end <b>225</b> includes an outer surface <b>233</b> that may define a generally conical configuration. As such, the outer surface <b>233</b> may be smoothly or convexly curved extending circumferentially around axis X. In one exemplary embodiment, the outer surface <b>233</b> is interrupted by one or more grooves <b>235</b> extending circumferentially around the axis X in the outer surface <b>233</b>. Grooves <b>235</b> may be spaced apart from each other and have a depth extending inwardly towards the axis X from the outer surface <b>233</b>.

Namely, the striations <b>273</b> flex from their normal/resting or first angled position to a second angled position.

The pointed end <b>225</b> may be considered to be another engagement member, or the sixth engagement member <b>216</b>F. The pointed end <b>325</b> is configured to be a sixth engagement member inasmuch as the pointed end <b>325</b> is utilized to perform a sixth mode of operation (i.e., a sixth operational engagement position in addition to the first five modes of operation discussed with reference to apparatus <b>210</b> that were not repeated for brevity) to remove pet hair <b>100</b> from a surface <b>13</b>.

According to the present disclosure, the coextrusion technique utilized to manufacture the embodiments of the pet hair removal apparatus detailed herein includes a coextrusion machine that extrudes two or more materials through a die to create a single piece of plastic. This is distinct from a single extrusion which cuts single thermoplastic or other polymer materials into varying lengths. With respect to the embodiments of the pet hair remove apparatus, an exemplary advantage of manufacturing via a coextrusion process is that each material used imparts a desired characteristic such as hardness, stiffness, heat-seal-ability, impermeability, or resistance to a particular element. It would be impossible for to make elements of the pet hair removal apparatus tool containing a variety of these attributes with a single material.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Coextrusion is a complex process that begins with large pellets being combined in large computer controlled bins which deliver the specified formula of materials to a coextrusion machine. After the pellets are mixed and heated/melted, they are passed through a single extrusion head, commonly known as the die, having one or more apertures formed therein. As the materials continue through the die, a multi-layered shape is made of the combined materials, may be cooled with water or air, and cut into specified lengths. The layer thicknesses are controlled by the relative speeds and sizes of the individual extruders delivering the materials. The multi-layered shape coextruded through the die forms the tool or apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, or <b>410</b> detailed herein. For example, the present disclosure provides a method for coextruding materials to form a pet hair removal apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, or <b>410</b> comprising: coextruding a first material (i.e., one of the materials identified below in Table 1) and a different second material (i.e., a different one of the materials identified below in Table 1) through a die coupled to a coextrusion machine. This method provides forming, via the coextrusion, a body, such as body <b>411</b> (or another one of the identified bodies detailed herein), composed of the first material and the body defining a gripping portion, the body including a first end opposite a second end defining a first direction therebetween, and the body including a first side opposite a second side defining a second direction therebetween, wherein the second direction is perpendicular to the first direction, and the body including a top surface opposite a bottom surface a third direction therebetween, wherein the third direction is perpendicular to the first direction and perpendicular to the second direction. This method provides forming, via the coextrusion, a first engagement member composed of the second material having been coextruded onto a first location on the body. This method provides forming, via the coextrusion, a second engagement member composed of the second material having been coextruded onto a second location on the body. Then, allowing the first material and second material to cool, wherein subsequent to cooling the pet hair removal apparatus is adapted for use in a first operational engagement mode in which the pet hair removal apparatus is in a first position to engage the first engagement member with an inanimate object and adapted for use in a second operational engagement mode in which the apparatus is in a second position to engage the second engagement member with the inanimate object, wherein the second position is different than the first position.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">The engagement members on the base member or &#x201c;head&#x201d; of the tool or apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, or <b>410</b> (which may also be referred to as the &#x201c;working portion&#x201d;) may be made through the coextrusion process such that they are less stiff than other portions of the tool, like the handle or the gripping portion. In one exemplary embodiment, the engagement members are in a range from about 20% to about 80% less stiff than the gripping portion or handle of the tool or apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, or <b>410</b>. The stiffness values may be measured by determining the flexural modulus and comparing the relative flexural modulus of each element to determine and confirm that they fall within these percentage ranges. One exemplary manner of calculating the flexural modulus is via ASTM D790 and ISO 178. For an ASTM D790 test of the flexural modulus, the test is stopped when the specimen reaches 5% deflection or the specimen breaks before 5%. For an ISO 178 test, the test is stopped when the specimen breaks. If the specimen does not break, the test is continued as far as possible and the stress at 3.5% (conventional deflection) is reported.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">The flexural modulus is represented by the slope of the initial straight line portion of the stress-strain curve and is calculated by dividing the change in stress by the corresponding change in strain. Hence, the ratio of stress to strain is a measure of the flexural modulus. The flexural property is often used to measure stiffness of plastic materials. It is called as &#x201c;modulus of elasticity in bending,&#x201d; but other names are also used, such as modulus of elasticity, elastic modulus, or simply modulus. The International Standard unit of Flexural Modulus is the pascal (Pa or N/m<sup>2 </sup>or m<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xb7;kg&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>). The practical units used are megapascals (MPa or N/mm<sup>2</sup>) or gigapascals (GPa or kN/mm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">As detailed herein, various components of the pet hair removal apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, or <b>410</b>, such as the engagement members or the body defining the handle or gripping portion, may utilize or be composed by an extruded polymer. Notably, given the difference in stiffness between various components, there may be two or more types of polymers that are coextruded. Some exemplary polymer materials that may be utilized to form the either the engagement members or the other portions of the tool, such as the handle, body or the gripping portion, along with their respective flexural modulus are detailed in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>flexural</entry><entry>flexural</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>modulus</entry><entry>modulus</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Min Value</entry><entry>Max Value</entry></row><row><entry>Polymer Name</entry><entry>(GPa)</entry><entry>(GPa)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>ABS -

Thus, if the Shore A hardness of the handle or gripping portion is a value of about 100, then at least one of the engagement members may have a Shore A hardness of about 25.

Further alternatively, if the Shore D hardness of the handle or gripping portion is a value of that ranges from about 40 to 80, then the at least one of the engagement members may have a Shore D hardness of that ranges from about 20 to 40.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0182">In yet another particular embodiment, the engagement members are about 55% less hard than the gripping portion or handle of the body of apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, or <b>410</b>.

A system to manufacture the pet hair removal tool or apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, or <b>410</b> performs a coextrusion process in which there is provide a die block having a machined opening or orifice at one end thereof through which is extruded the body or sidewalls of the handle or the gripping portion. The body of the handle or gripping stream is provided by a molten stream of a first polymer from an extruder which is introduced into the die block at a point spaced apart from the opening or orifice. At points spaced along the path to the opening or orifice, molten streams of a second polymer from at least one, but likely two or more, extruder(s) are deposited on portions of the body of the handle or gripping portion to provide the engagement members of the softer, less stiff, and/or more flexible second polymer along the upper and lower surfaces of the body of the handle or gripping portion. The die or a die box includes manifold chambers spaced along its length to receive the streams of molten second polymer from the at least one, but likely two extruders, so as to deposit the molten second polymer material in the upper or top engagement member and the lower or bottom engagement member on the body of the handle or gripping portion. The passage through the die is initially of the configuration of the underlying body of the handle or gripping portion and thereafter provides the clearance at top and bottom surfaces for the deposition of the engagement members on the partially solidified body.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0184">Following the coextrusion of the composite pet hair removal tool or apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, or <b>410</b>, it is severed into lengths. The lengths of the pet hair removal tool or apparatus <b>10</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, or <b>410</b> may be placed in a machining center which may machine various edges to make them suitable for usage in removing pet hair from an inanimate object. For example, portions of the coextruded engagement members may be fabricated to form the shape as shown and described herein. Following the machining of the, it may be desirable to polish the surfaces which have been machined.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0185">From the standpoint of ease of extrusion and fabrication and from the standpoint of economy in requiring a relatively thin layer of the softer polymer forming the engagement members, the confirmation of the cross section of the illustrated embodiments has proven highly advantageous. If so desired, the die may be altered to provide thinner sidewalls with a larger bore that extends fully through the body of the handle or gripping portion, thus reducing the cost of the resin for the body. The cross sectional shape may be changed to hexagonal, triangular or other as desired. One exemplary advantage to the coextrusion process is that the extrusion die required for practice of the present disclosure is of relatively low cost as compared to injection molding, overmolding, and/or other process. By using the technique of coextrusion to provide the softer polymer in only the top and bottom portions of the cross section of the gripping portion, minimization of the amount of typically more expensive polymer required for the softer but wear resistant engagement members is possible.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0186">An exemplary of the method of the present disclosure is the following specific example. Into an extrusion die is introduced a first polymer or resin. Introduced at two spaced points along the length of the path to the die orifice are introduced two molten streams of a second polymer that results in a more flexible and/or less stiff resultant material when fully cured. The second polymer adheres firmly to the first polymer or resin.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0187">The die is maintained at a temperature of 340&#xb0;-380&#xb0; Fahrenheit and a composite rod is pulled from the extrusion die. The composite rod is rapidly cooled and then cut into sections or lengths to form the pet hair removal tool. The first polymer for the body of the handle may have a durometer value of about 70-90 on the A scale and the second polymer for the engagement members has a durometer value of about 30-50 on the A scale.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0188">Various inventive concepts may be embodied as one or more methods, of which an example has been provided.

This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified.
