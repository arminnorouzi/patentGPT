Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a transmission device for an electrically driveable vehicle, to a drive device for an electrically driveable vehicle, and to a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The document DE 10 2015 217 875 A1 discloses a drive system with an electric machine and a transmission for a motor vehicle. The transmission has a transmission output shaft and a transmission housing, and also a parking lock.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">By integrating a parking lock in a transmission housing, construction space that is scarce, in particular with regard to the use of the transmission device in an electric drive device of a vehicle, can be saved. However, this poses special challenges due to the presence of lubricants and higher temperatures inside the transmission housing. In particular, a parking lock actuator of the parking lock can react sensitively to the lubricant, even to the extent of a functional failure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention is based on the object of specifying a construction-space-saving and robustly operable option for arranging a parking lock in a transmission housing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This object is achieved according to the invention by a transmission device for an electrically driveable vehicle, comprising a transmission element, a parking lock, by means of which the transmission element can be blocked and which has a parking lock actuator, a transmission housing, which encloses the transmission element and the parking lock, a connection apparatus with a cable arrangement extending in the transmission housing and a plug connector by means of which a first end of the cable arrangement can be contacted from the exterior of the transmission housing, wherein a second end of the cable arrangement is electrically connected to the parking lock actuator, and a pressure equalization apparatus, which runs through the plug connector of the connection apparatus and forms a gas-permeable connection between the interior of the parking lock actuator and the exterior of the transmission housing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is based on the finding that functional failures of the parking lock actuator can frequently be attributed to the penetration of lubricants into the parking lock actuator. This intrusion is due to a pressure difference between the interior of the parking lock actuator and the surroundings thereof. The pressure equalization apparatus provided in the transmission device according to the invention equalizes the pressure between the interior of the parking lock actuator and the exterior of the transmission housing, and thereby prevents the lubricant from penetrating. This advantageously enables a more robust operation of the transmission device. Owing to the fact that the pressure equalization apparatus runs through the plug connector, advantageously no additional construction space is required for the passage of the pressure equalization apparatus.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The transmission housing typically has a transmission housing opening through which the connection apparatus passes. In a preferred embodiment, it is provided that the plug connector of the connection apparatus is arranged in the transmission housing opening and/or is fastened to the transmission housing. The parking lock can be configured to be electrically supplied and/or activated via the connection apparatus.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the case of the transmission device according to the invention, it is preferred if the pressure equalization apparatus has a fluid guiding element, in particular a hose or a pipe, which connects the plug connector to the interior of the parking lock actuator. The fluid guiding element is preferably formed from a plastic, in particular PTFE.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It can advantageously be provided that the fluid guiding element is guided together with the cable arrangement from the parking lock actuator to the plug connector. As a result, the construction space provided in the transmission housing can be optimally utilized by the connection apparatus and the fluid guiding element. It is possible, for example, for the fluid guiding element to be guided parallel to individual cables of the cable arrangement. In a preferred embodiment, it is also provided that the cable arrangement and the fluid guiding element are sheathed together.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also advantageous if the plug connector has a plug connector housing, contact elements, and through openings which are formed in the plug connector housing and which are each designed to receive one of the contact elements, wherein the fluid guiding element is inserted into one of the through openings. In this way, the gas-permeable connection can be implemented with little effort in the region of the plug connector by, for example, in the case of a commercially available plug connector, a through opening not being provided with a contact element and instead accommodating the fluid guiding element. Provision is typically made for a respective contact element to be arranged in some of the through openings.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">With regard to the connection of the pressure equalization apparatus on the parking lock actuator side, it is preferred, in the case of the transmission device according to the invention, if the second end of the cable arrangement is electrically connected to the parking lock actuator by a second plug connector of the connection apparatus and the pressure equalization apparatus extends into the second plug connector.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It can also be provided here that the second plug connector has a plug connector housing, contact elements, and through openings which are formed in the plug connector housing and which are each designed to receive one of the contact elements, wherein the fluid guiding element is inserted into one of the through openings. Provision can be made for a respective contact element to be arranged in some of the through openings.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">On the parking lock actuator side, in particular on a parking lock actuator housing, it is possible to provide a plug connector which is diametrically opposed to the second plug connector of the connection apparatus and by means of which the pressure equalization apparatus extends into the interior of the parking lock actuator. This plug connector on the parking lock actuator side can also have a plug connector housing, contact elements, and through openings which are formed in the plug connector housing and which are each designed to receive one of the contact elements, wherein a through opening provides a clearance with respect to the interior of the parking lock actuator housing as part of the pressure equalization apparatus.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a development of the transmission device according to the invention, it can be provided that it furthermore comprises a second connection apparatus with a cable arrangement and a plug connector which is arranged at one end of the cable arrangement and by means of which an electrical plug-in connection is formed or can be formed with the plug connector of the first connection apparatus, wherein the pressure equalization apparatus has a fluid guiding element, in particular a hose or a pipe, wherein one end of the fluid guiding element extends into the plug connector of the second connection apparatus. This fluid guiding element can also be understood to be or can be referred to as a second fluid guiding element. The fluid guiding element of the first connection apparatus can then also be understood to be or can be referred to as a first fluid guiding element.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">With regard to the plug connector of the second connection apparatus, it can be provided that it has a plug connector housing, contact elements, and through openings which are formed in the plug connector housing and which are each designed to receive one of the contact elements, wherein the second fluid guiding element is inserted into one of the through openings. Provision can be made for a respective contact element to be arranged in some of the through openings.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">With regard to the second connection apparatus, it can be provided that it has a second plug connector at the other end of the cable arrangement.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, it is expedient if the pressure equalization apparatus has a pressure equalization adapter at the other end of the fluid guiding element. The pressure equalization adapter serves in particular to close off the pressure equalization apparatus outside the transmission housing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The pressure equalization adapter can, for example, have a membrane and/or a fastening means for fastening the pressure equalization adapter. The pressure equalization adapter can also include a protective device, for example a protective cap, for protecting the membrane. The protective cap typically provides protection against water and/or protection against foreign bodies, in particular within the meaning of a corresponding IP class of protection.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an advantageous embodiment, it is also provided that the pressure equalization adapter and the second plug connector of the second connection apparatus are designed as separate components. In this way, the pressure equalization adapter can be attached outside the housing at a suitable location separate from the second plug connector.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As already indicated at the beginning, it is also preferred, in the case of the transmission device according to the invention, if a lubricant bath for lubricating the transmission element is provided in the transmission housing and the parking lock is at least partially located in the lubricant bath. Owing to the pressure equalization realized according to the invention, an arrangement of the parking lock in the lubricant bath is then advantageously also possible, as a result of which previously unused arrangement positions of the parking lock in the transmission housing are opened up.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The object on which the invention is based is also achieved by a drive device for an electrically driveable vehicle, comprising an electric machine, a transmission device according to the invention, and a shaft which transmits a rotational motion of the electric machine to the transmission device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It can be provided that the transmission housing is part of a housing enclosing the electric machine, the transmission device, and the shaft. The pressure equalization adapter is preferably fastened to the housing, in particular to an end plate, by the fastening means.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The drive device can also include an inverter, wherein the second plug connector of the second connection apparatus can be electrically connected to the inverter. The inverter is typically configured to convert a DC voltage into an AC voltage that supplies the electric machine.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Finally, the object on which the invention is based is also achieved by a vehicle, comprising a drive device according to the invention which is configured to drive the vehicle.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further advantages and details of the present invention emerge from the exemplary embodiments described below and on the basis of the drawings.
