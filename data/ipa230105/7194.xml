On the other hand, signal charge accumulated in the charge accumulation section <b>41</b> in the high-sensitivity exposure period is not eliminated and is held until a reset operation of the pixel is performed. The signal charge is not discarded by switching between the low-sensitivity exposure state and the high-sensitivity exposure state. As a result, even if the high-sensitivity exposure period and the low-sensitivity exposure period are repeated, the signal charge accumulated in respective high-sensitivity exposure periods is integrated. In the high-sensitivity exposure periods, in the above example, the bias voltage is 10 V.

In addition, the cycle of the bias voltage to be applied to the photoelectric converter slightly differs from the cycle in which the LED blinks. That is, the cycle of the ITO voltage in the chart (c) slightly differs from the cycle in which the LED light source blinks in the chart (e).

Furthermore, this change is repeated cyclically over a plurality of frames. In a frame in which the period in which the high-sensitivity exposure period and the LED-on period overlap each other is long, the luminance of the subject increases. On the other hand, in a frame in which the period in which the high-sensitivity exposure period and the LED-on period overlap each other is short, the luminance of the subject decreases. Since the length of the period in which the high-sensitivity exposure period and the LED-on period overlap each other changes cyclically, the frame in which the luminance of the subject is high and the frame in which the luminance of the subject is low are repeated cyclically. Flicker occurs in this manner.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the imaging device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, the occurrence of flicker is reduced by any of exposure controls described in the following first to sixth exposure control examples.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">First Exposure Control Example</heading><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a timing chart illustrating the first exposure control example using the imaging device <b>100</b> according to the embodiment.

The signal readout periods in the respective rows are represented by black squares. Signal readout and reset are sequentially performed on Row R<b>0</b> to Row R<b>5</b> in the low-sensitivity exposure period, and subsequently, high-sensitivity exposure is performed for six HD ranges. Subsequently, signal readout and reset are sequentially performed on Row R<b>6</b> to Row R<b>11</b> in the low-sensitivity exposure period, and subsequently, high-sensitivity exposure is performed for three HD ranges. In this manner, by differing the length of the high-sensitivity exposure period after the signal readout scanning, the exposure frequency is dispersed. Thus, the occurrence of flicker is suppressed. Note that dispersion of the exposure frequency can also be said as dispersion of the exposure cycle.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the above manner, in this exposure control example, the voltage supply circuit <b>32</b> alternately supplies a first voltage and a second voltage to the photoelectric converter <b>13</b> in a first frame period so as to form a first low-sensitivity exposure period, a first high-sensitivity exposure period, a second low-sensitivity exposure period, and a second high-sensitivity exposure period successively in this order, and the total length of the first low-sensitivity exposure period and the first high-sensitivity exposure period (&#x201c;T<b>1</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>) differs from the total length of the second low-sensitivity exposure period and the second high-sensitivity exposure period (&#x201c;T<b>2</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>). Thus, since the total length of the successive low-sensitivity exposure period and high-sensitivity exposure period varies in one frame period, it is possible to obtain an image in which the occurrence of flicker is reduced even under a light source that blinks with a specific frequency.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In addition, in this exposure control example, the length of the first high-sensitivity exposure period (&#x201c;T<b>1</b><i>a</i>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>) differs from the length of the second high-sensitivity exposure period (&#x201c;T<b>2</b><i>a</i>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>). In this manner, by changing the lengths of the high-sensitivity exposure periods in the frame, the exposure cycle may be changed. Furthermore, by making the lengths of the low-sensitivity exposure periods fixed in the frame, signal readout may be performed for pixels in the same number of rows in each of the low-sensitivity exposure periods. In addition, in this exposure control example, the imaging device <b>100</b> includes the signal detection transistor <b>24</b> including a gate connected to the photoelectric converter <b>13</b>, and the signal detection transistor <b>24</b> outputs a signal corresponding to a potential of the gate in a period in which the first voltage is supplied to the photoelectric converter <b>13</b>. Thus, the signal is read out in the low-sensitivity exposure period.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Although this exposure control example employs a rolling shutter in which exposure is performed on every six rows in the pixel array PA at the same time, the number of rows is not limited to this number, and the method is not limited to the rolling shutter. For example, the present disclosure is also applicable to a global shutter sensor in which exposure is performed on all the rows in the pixel array PA at the same time.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition, strictly speaking, although a rise/fall edge of &#x201c;ITO voltage&#x201d; and the timing of a row signal readout period (black square in the drawing) do not overlap each other in this exposure control example, they may overlap each other. In the imaging device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, exposure and signal readout are independent of each other, and may or may not be performed simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In addition, whether LED flicker has occurred may be determined, for example, on the basis of whether an average of output of a region designated in a screen varies in different frames. In addition, the determination result may be fed back to the cycle of the bias voltage to be applied to the photoelectric converter. That is, by changing the cycle of the bias voltage to be applied to the photoelectric converter in a frame depending on the determination result, flicker may be suppressed.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Second Exposure Control Example</heading><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a detailed timing chart illustrating the second exposure control example using the imaging device <b>100</b> according to the embodiment. Here, exposure control timings including row scanning for two frames are illustrated. In this exposure control example, although the cycle of the bias voltage is kept fixed in a frame, the cycle of the bias voltage is changed in different frames. Here, bias voltage cycles &#x201c;T_F<b>2</b>&#x201d; in a second frame are shorter than bias voltage cycles &#x201c;T_F<b>1</b>&#x201d; in a first frame.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the imaging device according to the reference example, since the cycle of the bias voltage is fixed in a frame, if a light source emits light with a specific frequency, suppression of the occurrence of flicker may fail in some cases. However, when the occurrence of flicker is detected, by changing the exposure cycle in the next frame to an exposure cycle with which the exposure frequency is comparatively largely separated from the frequency of the light source as in this exposure control example, the occurrence of flicker can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In addition, in this exposure control example, the length of the high-sensitivity exposure period differs in different frames. Thus, the length differs for each of the total of high-sensitivity exposure periods for Row R<b>0</b> to Row R<b>5</b> (i.e., the total of high-sensitivity exposure periods in EXP_R<b>0</b>-R<b>5</b> in the drawing), the total of high-sensitivity exposure periods for Row R<b>6</b> to Row R<b>11</b>, the total of high-sensitivity exposure periods for Row R<b>12</b> to Row R<b>17</b>, the total of high-sensitivity exposure periods for Row R<b>18</b> to Row R<b>23</b>, and the total of high-sensitivity exposure periods for Row R<b>24</b> to Row R<b>29</b> (i.e., the total of high-sensitivity exposure periods in EXP_R<b>24</b>-R<b>29</b> in the drawing).
