The thermoplastic polymer enables an assembly of parts to larger structural units by welding due to its nature to melt when exposed to high temperatures and to solidify during the cool down afterwards. Different working principles of welding are known of which ultrasonic welding is the one to which the disclosure herein belongs to.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic polymers is based on the principle that the kinetic energy of an acoustic wave (of ultrasonic frequency) propagating inside a part will partly dissipate as heat energy, when this wave is trespassing the interface into an adjacent part. The heat will melt quantities of thermoplastic polymer close to the interface leading to a welded joint of both parts after cool down.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Ultrasonic welding is an applied and established technique in many industries where mostly nonreinforced, at low or moderate temperature melting polymers are applied (up 250&#xb0; C.), e.g. in packaging industry for the sealing of bags and blister packages, in automotive for assembly of interior structures and fixation of system brackets or in many consumer goods consisting of assemblies of injection molded plastic parts. However, ultrasonic welding of high performance fiber reinforced thermoplastic materials based on either PPS, PEI, PEEK or PEKK matrix for aerospace or other high technology applications is at a low maturity level. The ideas herein aim to improve that. Hence, ultrasonic welding of those materials has not reached a significant industrial level, yet, apart from the use of ultrasonic welding as a fast fixation aid applied within the stacking of thermoplastic carbon fiber tapes before they are further processed to consolidated laminates.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Control of the energy dissipating at the interface is key for mastering of the ultrasonic welding of fiber reinforced thermoplastic materials. Several investigations were launched, which target at optimization of the ultrasonic sonotrode (geometry, working frequency and amplitude) and processing key characteristics such as clamping pressure, geometry and processing time. However, a significant improvement of the quality of the weld was made after implementation of specific design features, so called energy directors, between the parts to be welded. Such energy directors are typically of pyramidal shape, single or multiple flat polymeric film which are placed between the parts.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The mentioned energy directors are mostly used in static ultrasonic welding where they show good performance in realizing a robust welding process that can achieve high quality welds. In continuous ultrasonic welding which is preferred for long weld seams, which can be found during the integration of stiffener elements, those energy directors can lead to quality issues and an unstable welding process. Their stiff nature can lead to non-uniform contact between the energy director and the adherends which influence the heat generation and transfer and can finally lead to hot spots and un-welded areas. Non-uniform contact can be a result of manufacturing tolerances of the adherends and the energy director.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Hence, for stiff energy directors during continuous ultrasonic welding more compliant energy directors are preferred. The thermoplastic non-woven material which is described in this disclosure herein disclosure can be seen as such compliant energy director. The nature of the non-woven material allows a compaction due to the applied welding pressure (through the sonotrode) and therefore lead to uniform contact between the energy director and the adherends. The non-woven material is made of the same material as the matrix of the adherends which is usually the case for ultrasonic welding and also preferred to avoid compatibility issues between different polymers. The advantages of the use of a compliant energy director is not limited to continuous ultrasonic welding but can also be beneficial for static ultrasonic welding as manufacturing tolerances can also occur here which can lead to non-uniform contact between energy director and adherends.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">This disclosure herein disclosure describes the use of a polymer non-woven material as energy director during ultrasonic welding. The feasibility of the material as energy director was assessed in the frame of feasibility study which also involved the comparison to more usual polymer films. The initial assessment indicated that the polymer non-woven material is suitable and moreover is advantageous compared to the polymer film as less quality defects (polymer and fiber squeeze out at edges of adherends) were observed. Therefore, it contributes to a more robust and reliable welding process. Within the assessment a 180 g/m<sup>2 </sup>PEI non-woven material was welded using also adherends with a PEI surface. Based on the experience with ultrasonic welding of other materials this approach is not limited to PEI material but can be transferred to any other high-performance thermoplastic material such as PEEK, PEKK, PPS or LMPAEK and even to widely used &#x201c;low-performance&#x201d; materials such as Polyamide (PA). Moreover, the aerial weight of the non-woven material is not limited to 180 g/m<sup>2 </sup>but was chosen based on availability for the mentioned study.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The non-woven material is based on PEI fibers with a maximum length of ca. 10 mm that are randomly distributed to achieve isotropic properties within one layer. The fibers of the non-woven material are mechanically connected by needling but also other technique such as the melt-blow-technique or spinning are possible.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The particular advantage of the non-woven material compared to more commonly used polymer films or pyramidal protrusion is its compliance which leads to a very uniform contact between the energy director and the adherends. During the welding process the energy director melts primarily and conducts heat into the adherends. This finally leads to melting of the first layer(s) of the adherends. Due to the uniform contact this heat transfer is also very uniform and reduces so called hot spots and un-welded areas. Those two effects are common defects in the frame of ultrasonically welded joints.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The energy director is placed in the interface of the two adherends to be joint. To avoid movement during the welding process, the non-woven material is fixed to the lower adherend by adhesive tape. Afterwards the adherends are welded by ultrasonic vibrations and a static welding and consolidation force. The results are two adherends welded to each other. In this case, the adherends are welded in a so-called single overlap configuration and can be mechanically tested.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Embodiments of the disclosure herein are described in more detail making reference to the accompanying drawings wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref> depict an embodiment and a method for joining fiber composite parts.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Initially as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a first fiber composite part <b>10</b> is provided that is to be joined to a second fiber composite part <b>12</b>.
