In the embodiments of the present disclosure, no other transistor is connected between the amplification circuit and at least one of the bit line or complementary bit line, so that the adverse impact caused by the connected other transistors on the pre-charge speed is avoided. For example, it is not necessary to consider the driving ability of other transistors.
