The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was first demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821 and later quantified by the work of Hendrik Lorentz.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a traditional electric motor, a central core of tightly wrapped current carrying material creates magnetic poles (known as the rotor) spins or rotates at high speed between the fixed poles of a magnet (known as the stator) when an electric current is applied. The central core is typically coupled to a shaft which will also rotate with the rotor. The shaft may then be used to drive gears and wheels in a rotary machine and/or convert rotational motion into motion in a straight line.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generators are usually based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. Faraday discovered that when an electrical conducting material (such as copper) is moved through a magnetic field (or vice versa), an electric current will begin to flow through that material. This electromagnetic effect induces voltage or electric current into the moving conductors.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current power generation devices such as rotary alternator/generators and linear alternators rely on Faraday's discovery to produce power. In fact, rotary generators are essentially very large quantities of wire spinning around the inside of very large magnets. In this situation, the coils of wire are called the armature because they are moving with respect to the stationary magnets (which are called the stators). Typically, the moving component is called the armature or rotor and the stationary components are called the stator or stators.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In most conventional motors, both linear and rotating, enough power of the proper polarity must be pulsed at the right time to supply an opposing (or attracting) force at each pole segment to produce a particular torque. In conventional motors at any given instant only a portion of the coil pole pieces is actively supplying torque.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With conventional motors, a pulsed electrical current of sufficient magnitude must be applied to produce a given torque/horsepower. Horsepower output and efficiency then is a function of design, electrical input power plus losses.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With conventional generators, an electrical current is produced when the rotor is rotated. The power generated is a function of flux strength, conductor size, number of pole pieces and speed in RPM. However output is a sinusoidal output which inherently has losses similar to that of conventional electric motors.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Specifically, the pulsed time varying magnetic fields produces undesired effects and losses, i.e. iron hysteresis losses, counter-EMF, inductive kickback, eddy currents, inrush currents, torque ripple, heat losses, cogging, brush losses, high wear in brushed designs, commutation losses and magnetic buffeting of permanent magnets. In many instances, complex controllers are used in place of mechanical commutation to address some of these effects.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additionally, in motors or generators, some form of energy drives the rotation and/or movement of the rotor. As energy becomes more scarce and expensive, what is needed are more efficient motors and generators to reduce energy consumption, and hence costs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In response to these and other problems, there is presented various embodiments disclosed in this application, including methods and systems of increasing flux density by permanent magnet manipulation using multiple magnetic tunnels. Disclosed are various embodiments for a motor/generator comprising: a plurality of coils radially positioned about a coil assembly, a plurality of magnetic tunnels forming a relative rotational path for the coil assembly, wherein the all of plurality of magnets forming each magnetic tunnel have like poles facing inward toward the interior of the magnetic tunnel or facing outward away from the interior of the magnetic tunnel such that each magnetic field of any magnetic tunnel is of an opposite polarity to the magnetic field of an adjacent magnetic tunnel.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other features, and advantages, will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is important to note the drawings are not intended to represent the only aspects of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

In certain embodiments, the coil assembly support <b>502</b> comprises a cylindrical or ring core <b>504</b> coupled to a plurality of teeth <b>506</b> radially spaced about the ring core. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows a portion of teeth <b>506</b> removed so that the ring core <b>504</b> is visible.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In certain embodiments, the ring core <b>504</b> and coil assembly support <b>502</b> may be made out of iron or back iron materials so that it will act as a magnetic flux force concentrator. Some back iron materials are listed above. In yet other embodiments, the coil assembly support <b>502</b> may be made from a composite material which would allow it to be sculptured to allow for cooling and wiring from inside. The composite material may be formed of a &#x201c;soft magnetic&#x201d; material (one which will produce a magnetic field when current is applied to adjoining coils). Soft magnetic materials are those materials which are easily magnetized or demagnetized. Examples of soft magnetic materials are iron and low-carbon steels, iron-silicon alloys, iron-aluminum-silicon alloys, nickel-iron alloys, iron-cobalt alloys, ferrites, and amorphous alloys. In yet other embodiments, portions of the coil assembly support may be made from laminate materials.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In yet other embodiments, a powdered metal, such as Somaloy 7003P may be used to form the coil assembly support <b>502</b>. Somaloy 7003P is not sintered, but heat treated in a steam oxygen environment which causes its particles to bond when exposed to high pressure, such as 50 tons per square inch.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In certain embodiments, a wiring connection (not shown) can also be formed in the shape of a &#x201c;plug&#x201d; for coupling to the stator teeth. Thus, certain teeth of the plurality of teeth <b>506</b> may have holes <b>508</b> for such plugs (or wires) defined on one side for attachment to a structural support in embodiments where the coil assembly <b>500</b> acts as a stator. In yet other embodiments, these plugs <b>508</b> may be formed on an inside surface <b>509</b> of the coil assembly support <b>502</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, a single tooth <b>506</b> is illustrated coupled to a portion of the core <b>504</b>. The tooth <b>506</b> may be made from a material similar to the material forming the core <b>504</b>, for example, iron, a composite magnetic material, or laminated steel. In the illustrated embodiment, each tooth <b>506</b> extends from the ring core <b>504</b> in radial and vertical (or longitudinal) directions. Thus, each tooth <b>506</b> comprises an outer radial portion <b>510</b> extending radially away from the longitudinal axis <b>401</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>), an inner radial portion <b>512</b> extending radially toward the longitudinal axis <b>401</b>, a top vertical or longitudinal portion <b>514</b> extending in one vertical or longitudinal direction, and a bottom vertical or longitudinal portion <b>516</b> extending in the opposing longitudinal direction. The ring core <b>504</b> supports the individual tooth <b>506</b><i>a </i>as well as other teeth as described above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In certain embodiments, an exterior fin <b>520</b> couples to an exterior portion of the outer radial portion <b>510</b> and extends outward from the outer radial portion <b>510</b> in both circumferential or tangential directions with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>401</b>. Similarly, in certain embodiments, an interior fin <b>522</b> couples to an interior portion of the inner radial portion <b>512</b> and extends outward from the inner radial portion <b>512</b> in both tangential directions.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Coils or Coil Windings</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Adjacent teeth <b>506</b> supported by the core ring <b>504</b> form radial slots <b>524</b> within the coil assembly support structure <b>502</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. A plurality of coils or coil windings <b>526</b> may be positioned radially about the ring core <b>504</b> and within the slots <b>524</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrates the plurality of coil windings <b>526</b> distributed about the ring core <b>504</b> with a number of teeth <b>506</b> removed for clarity. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> illustrates a complete coil assembly <b>500</b> showing all of the teeth <b>506</b> and coil windings <b>526</b> positioned within the slots <b>524</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Each individual coil <b>526</b> in the coil assembly <b>500</b> may be made from a conductive material, such as copper (or a similar alloy) wire and may be constructed using conventional winding techniques known in the art. In certain embodiments, concentrated windings may be used. In certain embodiments, the individual coils <b>526</b> may be essentially cylindrical or rectangular in shape being wound around the ring core <b>504</b> having a center opening sized to allow the individual coil <b>526</b> to surround and be secured to the ring core <b>504</b>. Thus, in such embodiments, the winding does not overlap.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">By positioning the individual coils <b>526</b> within the slots <b>524</b> defined by the teeth <b>506</b>, the coils are surrounded by the more substantial heat sink capabilities of the teeth which, in certain embodiments, can incorporate cooling passages directly into the material forming the teeth. This allows much higher current densities than conventional motor geometries. Additionally, positioning the plurality of coils <b>526</b> within the slots <b>524</b> and between teeth <b>506</b> reduces the air gap between the coils. By reducing the air gap, the coil assembly <b>500</b> can contribute to the overall torque produced by the motor or generator.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In certain embodiments, the horizontal fins <b>518</b> and <b>519</b>, the circumferential fins <b>520</b> and <b>522</b> of the teeth <b>506</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) of the coil assembly <b>500</b> reduce the air gaps between the magnetic material and the coil structure to allow flux forces to flow in the proper direction when the coils are energized and the coil assembly <b>500</b> begins to move relative to the magnetic tunnel. Thus, all portions of the coil support assembly <b>502</b> contribute to the overall torque developed by the system. In yet other embodiments, the teeth <b>506</b> may not have any fins. Although the fins create a more efficient design, the fins complicate the fabrication of the coil windings, thereby increasing the motor costs. Unconventional winding techniques may be used when using fins&#x2014;such as fabricating the coil assembly support <b>502</b> in conjunction with the coil windings. In some embodiments, a winding may be started at the center of the conductor length with two bobbins rotating in opposite directions around the core with the wound segments in separate parallel planes. This method has the advantage of both conductor ends exiting at the same location and eliminating compression of one conductor length exiting from the center of the winding.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The number of individual coils <b>526</b> can be any number that will physically fit within the desired volume and of a conductor length and size that produces the desired electrical or mechanical output as known in the art. In yet other embodiments, the coils <b>526</b> may be essentially one continuous coil, similar to a Gramme Ring as is known in the art.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The windings of each coil <b>526</b> are generally configured such that they remain transverse or perpendicular to the direction of the relative movement of the magnets (e.g. the rotor) comprising the coil assembly <b>500</b> and parallel with the longitudinal axis <b>401</b>. In other words, the coil windings are positioned such that their sides are parallel with the longitudinal axis <b>401</b> and their ends are radially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. As will be explained below, the coil windings are also transverse with respect to the magnetic flux produced by the individual magnets of the rotor at their interior face as described below in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A to <b>7</b>C</figref>. Consequently, the entire coil winding or windings may be used to generate movement (in motor mode) or voltage (in generator mode).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In sum, the windings are placed in an axial/radial direction in multiple slots <b>524</b> (e.g. 48 slots) which can form a single phase or multi-phase winding. The radial/axial placement of the windings may create a maximum force in the direction of motion for all four sides of the windings.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The Magnetic Cylinder</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an isometric view of the magnetic disc assembly <b>400</b> with the coil assembly <b>500</b> removed for clarity. The magnets of the magnetic disc assembly <b>400</b> form a toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>430</b> defining a toroidal magnetic tunnel <b>440</b> positioned about the longitudinal axis <b>401</b>. As described previously, the toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>430</b> includes: the top axial or side wall of magnets <b>402</b>, the bottom or second axial or side wall of magnets <b>404</b>, the outer cylindrical wall <b>406</b> of magnets positioned longitudinally between the first side wall <b>402</b> of magnets and the second side wall <b>404</b> of magnets; and the inner cylindrical wall <b>408</b> of magnets positioned concentrically within the outer cylindrical wall <b>406</b> of magnets.

Thus, the flux forces produced by the magnets of the interior wall <b>104</b> of the partial magnetic cylinder <b>150</b> have an unobstructed path to exit through one of the open ends of the partial magnetic cylinder and return to its opposing pole on the exterior or interior of the cylinder.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As discussed above, the magnetic flux lines <b>112</b> and <b>118</b> will tend to develop a concentrating effect and the configuration of the exterior magnetic cylinder manipulates the flux lines <b>112</b> and <b>118</b> of the magnets in the partial magnetic cylinder <b>150</b> such that most or all of the flux lines <b>112</b> and <b>118</b> flow out of the open ends <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> of the partial magnetic cylinder. In conventional configurations, the opposing poles of the magnets are usually aligned longitudinally.

Because of opposing magnetic forces, the magnetic flux continues to flow circumferentially through the coil core <b>504</b> until the flux reaches an opening (for instance, open end <b>414</b>) of the tunnel <b>440</b>. The flux then bends back around an open end (e.g. open end <b>414</b>) of the radial segment <b>420</b> to an exterior face of the respective magnetic wall containing a south pole.

Thus, the radial segment <b>420</b> generates a flux field which is conceptually similar to the flux fields of the flux lines <b>112</b> and <b>118</b> discussed above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> (In situations where a radial segment <b>420</b> is adjacent to another radial segment of an opposite magnetic polarity configuration, the flux lines could extend into the adjacent partial toroidal magnetic cylinder).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In certain embodiments, the core <b>504</b>/coil assembly <b>500</b> may generate its own magnetic field fluxes as current is introduced into the supporting coils <b>526</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>). The majority of magnetic field fluxes are also constrained and channeled to interact with the magnetic flux generated from the magnetic tunnel (e.g., from permanent magnets) in a similar manner to that described above. Thus, all portions of the coil <b>504</b>/coil assembly <b>500</b> may interact with the flux lines of the magnetic tunnel <b>440</b> to allow full utilization of the flux lines and all forces working together in the direction of motion.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In certain embodiments, the longitudinal length or &#x201c;width&#x201d; of the outer walls <b>406</b> and inner walls <b>408</b> may be greater than the radial or lateral depth (or length) of the side walls <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>. This geometric proportion results in greater torque generation along the interface of the outer wall <b>406</b> and coil assembly <b>502</b>.

In any event, the contribution to torque from the outer wall <b>406</b> and the inner wall <b>408</b> may be greater than the contribution from the side walls <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> due to the geometry of the cross-section of the radial segment <b>420</b> and the varying radius of the components.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, this embodiment may be thought of as a four rotor motor.

The first torque producing area may be the area and coil portion adjacent to the outer wall <b>406</b>. The second torque producing area is the area and coil portion adjacent to the inner wall <b>408</b>. The third torque producing area is the area and coil portion adjacent to the side wall <b>402</b>. The fourth torque producing area is the area and coil portion adjacent to the side wall <b>404</b>. In certain embodiments, the torque generated by the first two torque producing areas (those generally parallel with the longitudinal axis) are greater than the torque produced by the side areas (those generally transverse to the longitudinal axis).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Although the core, coil assembly, and magnetic radial segments are illustrated in cross-section as rectangular, any cross-sectional shape may be used depending on the design and performance requirements for a particular motor or generator. In a preferred embodiment, there is more magnetic material positioned in or along an outer wall (such as the magnetic wall <b>406</b>) along the longitudinal direction than magnetic material positioned in or along a radial wall (such as the axial or side walls <b>402</b> or <b>408</b>). For instance, if the magnets forming the magnetic walls are all the same thickness, the length of the outer wall in the longitudinal direction is greater than the length of the axial or side walls in the radial direction. In alternative embodiments, the length of the magnets forming the outer magnetic wall may be the same or shorter than the length of the magnets forming the axial or side walls.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The unique configurations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref> also leads to several unique properties. For instance, an individual coil <b>526</b> and core portion <b>504</b> will tend to move out of the tunnel <b>440</b> on its own accord (e.g. with no power applied). The natural tendency of this configuration is for the coil <b>526</b> to follow the flux lines to the nearest exit <b>412</b> or <b>414</b>. Conversely if a current is applied the coil <b>526</b>, the coil <b>526</b> will move though the entirety of the magnetic tunnel depending on polarity of the power applied. The encapsulation of the coil <b>526</b> in the magnetic flux of the magnetic tunnel <b>440</b> also allows all magnetic fields to be used to generate motor or electric power. Cogging effects can be reduced as the coil will tend to travel out of the tunnel when no current applied. This also means that the coil <b>526</b> does not have to be pulsed with an opposing magnetic field at any point while in the magnetic tunnel <b>440</b>. Additionally, the coil <b>526</b> will travel through the entire magnetic tunnel <b>440</b> length with a single DC pulse of the correct polarity. Non-sinusoidal torque or voltage is generated throughout the duration of time that the coil <b>526</b> is under the influence of the magnetic tunnel <b>440</b> and alternating polarities are not required for this effect to occur.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>, the illustrative embodiment of the toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>430</b> comprises eight radial segments where four radial segments <b>421</b> are interspersed between the four radial segments <b>420</b>. The four radial segments <b>421</b> are identical to the radial segments <b>420</b> except that the magnetic pole orientation of the magnets has been reversed. So, in the radial segment <b>420</b>, all of the interior facing magnetic poles are north forming a NNNN magnetic tunnel configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>. In contrast, in the radial segment <b>421</b>, all of the interior facing magnetic poles are south forming a SSSS magnetic tunnel configuration. Thus, the tunnels radial segments <b>420</b> generate flux fields which are of an opposite polarity to the flux fields generated by the radial segments <b>421</b>. In traditional motor terminology, each radial segment is a motor magnet pole. Thus, each radial segment is a three dimensional magnetic pole which can create a three dimensional symmetric magnetic field. Alternating the segments then produces a sinusoidal field.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">With regard to the toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>430</b>, each magnetic or radial segment (e.g. radial segments <b>420</b> or <b>421</b>) has their respective magnetic configuration (NNNN or SSSS) of like magnetic polarities reversed for each adjacent radial segment. Although, an eight segment toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>430</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>, in other embodiments, two, four, six, ten, etc. segments may be used. The number of segments selected for any given application may be based on engineering design parameters and the particular performance characteristics for an individual application. The scope of this invention specifically includes and contemplates multiple segments having an opposite polarity to the adjacent partial toroidal magnetic cylinders. For simplicity and illustrative purposes, an eight segment toroidal magnetic cylinder is described herein. However, this design choice is in no way meant to limit the choice or number of segments for any multi-segment toroidal magnetic cylinder.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In certain embodiments, the radial segments <b>420</b> and <b>421</b> may be sized to allow circumferential gaps <b>416</b> to form when the partial toroidal magnetic cylinders are assembled into the complete cylinder <b>430</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">As described above, in certain embodiments, the individual magnets forming the toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>430</b> couple to various components of the back iron circuit <b>200</b>.

The natural tendency of the flux lines is to flow along the shortest path&#x2014;which is usually in the radial, lateral or &#x201c;sideways&#x201d; direction <b>434</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). Although some flux leakage may be acceptable, if the flux leakage is large, the integrity of the magnetic tunnel <b>440</b> will be compromised and the flux lines will no longer travel in the circumferential direction. If the flux lines do not travel in the circumferential direction, many of the advantages of certain embodiments will be lost.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> for instance, there are a number of slots or &#x201c;gaps&#x201d; between the magnet walls, such as the circumferential slot <b>410</b> or slot <b>411</b>. These gaps may be carefully controlled or too much flux will leak through the gaps and essentially destroy the magnetic flux integrity of the magnetic tunnel <b>440</b>. In an ideal world, there would be no slots or gaps in the tunnel and thus, it would be impossible for the flux lines to escape laterally. However, if there were no slots, it would be difficult to support the coil assembly and to providing electrical and cooling conduits to the coil assembly.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">One method of controlling gap flux leakage is to limit the lateral width of the gaps. For instance, the total length of the sides of the &#x201c;magnetic tunnel&#x201d; may be substantially larger than the circular support mechanism slot and the slot reluctance may be high enough to force a circumferential magnetic flux field to form in the magnetic tunnel <b>440</b>. As an example, limiting the lateral width of the circumferential slots to roughly a ratio of 1 unit of slot width to every 12 units of circumference/perimeter length may provide enough transverse flux lines to steer the majority of the flux lines along the circumferential direction <b>422</b> as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Another solution is placing another group or group of magnets in close proximity with the slots such they generate an addition flux field lines across the gap or slot. For instance, two groups of magnets positioned on either side of coil assembly may produce enough &#x201c;cross flux&#x201d; to keep the flux in the magnetic tunnel from escaping. A magnet on one side of the slot may have its north pole facing the slot. An opposing magnet on the other side of the slot may have is south pole facing the slot. Thus, cross flux lines from the north pole to the south pole would be generated across the slot.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In one embodiment, permanent magnets orientated to provide a cross flux may be embedded in a coil assembly supporting structure or embedded in the back iron material.

Thus, the entire back iron circuit <b>200</b> includes the inner cylindrical walls <b>208</b> and <b>218</b>, the outer cylindrical walls <b>206</b> and <b>216</b>, and the side or axial walls <b>210</b> and <b>220</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. In certain embodiments, the back iron circuit <b>200</b> combined with the toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>430</b> may form a rotor (or a stator depending on the motor configuration). In certain embodiments, the back iron circuit <b>200</b> may be used to channel part of the magnetic flux path. The back iron material channels the magnetic flux produced by the toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>430</b> through the back iron material (as opposed to air) to reduce the reluctance of the magnetic circuit. In certain embodiments, therefore, the amount or thickness of the magnets forming the toroidal magnetic cylinder (if permanent magnets are used) may be reduced when using the appropriately designed back iron circuit.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Applying Mechanical Torque or Current</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In &#x201c;motor&#x201d; mode, current is induced in the coils <b>526</b>, which will cause electromotive forces to move the coil assembly <b>500</b> relative to the toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>430</b> or vice versa. In &#x201c;generator&#x201d; mode, on the other hand, the movement of the coil assembly <b>500</b> relative to the toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>430</b> will cause current to be generated in the individual coils <b>526</b> to produce a DC current as the individual coils move through each tunnel or radial segment <b>420</b> or <b>421</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In order to maintain the generated torque and/or power the individual coils <b>526</b> in the coil assembly <b>500</b> may be selectively energized or activated by way of a switching or controller (not shown). The individual coils <b>526</b> in the coil assembly <b>500</b> may be electrically, physically, and communicatively coupled to switching or controller which selectively and operatively provides electrical current to the individual coils in a conventional manner.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">For instance, the controller may cause current to flow within an individual coil <b>526</b> when the individual coil is within a magnetic tunnel segment <b>420</b> with a NNNN magnetic pole configuration as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>. On the other hand, when the same individual coil rotates into an adjacent magnetic tunnel segment <b>421</b> with a SSSS magnetic pole configuration, the controller causes the current within the individual coil <b>526</b> to flow in a direction opposite to that when the coil was in the NNNN magnetic pole segment <b>420</b> so that the generated magnetic force is in the same direction as coil rotates from one adjacent magnetic segment to the other.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">As discussed above, the individual coils <b>526</b> may use toroidal winding without end windings and in some embodiments, the individual coils may be connected to each other in series. In other embodiments, a multi-phasic winding arrangement such as six phase, three phase, etc. winding connection may be used where the proper coils <b>526</b> are connected together to form a branch of each phase. For instance, two adjacent coils may be phase A coils, the next two adjacent coils may be phase B coils, and the next two adjacent coils may be phase C coils. This three phase configuration would then repeat for all individual coils <b>526</b> within the coil assembly <b>500</b>. In one embodiment, there are eight (8) pairs of adjacent phase A coils for a total of 16 phase A coils. Similarly, there are eight (8) pairs of adjacent phase B coils for a total of 16 phase B coils, and there are eight (8) pairs of adjacent phase C coils for a total of 16 phase C coils. Thus, in such an embodiment, there are 48 individual coils.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the coils are energized, the multi-phasic winding can produce a rotating magnetomotive force in the air gap around the coil assembly <b>500</b>. The rotating magnetomotive force interacts with the magnetic field generated by the toroidal magnetic tunnel <b>430</b>, which in turn produces torque on all sides of the coil assembly <b>500</b> and relative movement between the coil assembly and the toroidal magnetic tunnel.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In such embodiments, the individual coils <b>526</b> may be connected to a brushless motor controller (not shown) to be activated by a controller or in a similar manner known in the art. For each phase, the motor controller can apply forward current, reverse current, or no current. In operation, the motor controller applies current to the phases in a sequence that continuously imparts torque to turn the magnetic toroidal tunnel in a desired direction (relative to the coil assembly) in motor mode. In certain embodiments, the motor controller can decode the rotor position from signals from position sensors or can infer the rotor position based on back-emf produced by each phase. In certain embodiments, two controllers may be used. In other embodiments, a single controller may be used. The controller(s) controls the application of current of the proper polarity for the proper amount of time at the right time and controls the voltage/current for speed control. Regardless, the controllers allow for a switching action and a varying voltage action.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In other embodiments, a brushed motor/generator may be used. In such embodiments, one or more commutators (not shown) may be used and positioned, for instance, within the rotor hub <b>300</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). In certain embodiments, the number of brushes used may equal the number of toroidal magnetic segments used in the design of the particular motor/generator. For instance, if eight toroidal magnetic segments are used, then eight brushes may be used. The individual coils <b>526</b> in the coil assembly <b>500</b> may be connected in series having toroidal wound windings. In a brushed design in motor mode, a simplified reverse switching circuit is all that is necessary to switch the current direction as the coils enter and exit the respective toroidal magnetic segment.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">A Multi-Layer Coil Assembly Embodiment:</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">An alternative embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> through <b>17</b></figref>. In this embodiment, the coil assembly support <b>502</b> of previous embodiments has been replaced with a first coil assembly support <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and a second coil assembly support <b>1502</b><i>b</i>. In the present example, the coil assembly supports <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and <b>1502</b><i>b </i>form part of a stator, but in other embodiments they may form part of a rotor.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">For brevity and clarity, a description of those parts which are identical or similar to those described in connection with the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>8</b></figref> will not be repeated here. Reference should be made to the foregoing paragraphs with the following description to arrive at a complete understanding of this alternative embodiment.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the motor/generator <b>900</b>. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a section view of the assembled motor/generator <b>900</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, a back iron circuit <b>1200</b> comprises a first flat side wall <b>1210</b>, an outer cylindrical wall <b>1216</b>, and a second flat side wall <b>1220</b>. A first inner cylindrical wall <b>1208</b> and a second inner cylinder wall <b>1218</b> are concentrically positioned within the outer cylindrical wall <b>1206</b>. As described previously, the coil assembly <b>1500</b> may move relative to a magnetic tunnel formed by magnets that are coupled to or otherwise positioned proximate to the walls of the back iron circuit <b>1200</b>. In this embodiment, the coil assembly <b>1500</b> comprises a first coil assembly support <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and a second coil assembly support <b>1502</b><i>b</i>. Longitudinally positioned between the first coil assembly <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and the second coil assembly <b>1502</b><i>b </i>is a locking disc <b>906</b> which surrounds a shaft <b>1302</b>. In certain embodiments, the locking disc <b>906</b> is used to couple the coil assembly supports <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and <b>1502</b><i>b </i>to a shaft <b>1302</b> of a rotor assembly <b>1300</b>. Bearings <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> interact with the shaft <b>1302</b> and laterally support the shaft <b>1302</b> while allowing the shaft to rotate with respect to the back iron circuit <b>1200</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Although two coil assembly supports <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and <b>1502</b><i>b </i>and a single locking disc <b>906</b> are illustrated, other embodiments employ multiple coil assemblies and multiple locking discs. For instance in alternative embodiments, three coil assemblies may be used with two locking discs. Such embodiments are still within the scope of the present invention and the claims.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In certain embodiments, the individual coil assembly supports <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and <b>1502</b><i>b </i>may be formed from pressing a powdered metal into the appropriate shaped mold. For instance, powered metals, such as Somaloy 7003P, may be pressed at a high pressure to form the coil assembly supports <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and <b>1502</b><i>b</i>. Once the segment is pressed, the segment is heat-treated in a nitrogen steam environment which causes the resin coatings on the powdered metal to be oxygenated together and provides strength for the segment. Thus, there is an external layer on the particles that are then oxidized together. After heat treatment, any remaining slag can be removed by sandblasting or other techniques known in the art.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Using such powdered metal provides an electrically resistant material because each particle is essentially coated with an insulating or oxidized material. In other embodiments, iron particles may be mixed with a low melting point epoxy. In such an environment, once the iron/epoxy solution is heated (e.g., 105 degrees), the epoxy turns to liquid and the applied pressure can bleed the epoxy out of the mold&#x2014;leaving almost pure iron. Using multiple coil assembly supports made from powdered metals may make fabrication of the coil supports easier.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In yet, other embodiments, the coil assembly supports <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and <b>1502</b><i>b </i>may be made of laminated metal. When using laminated metal, the flux can be controlled as the flux will only enter from a direction that is in parallel to the laminations and not transverse to the laminations. Thus, it is possible to specifically control the flux path based on the orientation of the laminations. It is also possible to turn off different areas of the lamination to obtain specific control for the flux path. Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, for instance, it is possible that the pole portions <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> be made of laminated sections where the laminations are parallel to the of the pole. The flux will then easily flow to or from the center or core <b>504</b> of the segment. On the other hand, if the yoke or core protrusion <b>504</b> was also made of laminated metal with the laminations running parallel to the face of the pole or tooth, the flux would not flow easily through the core or yoke. In other embodiments, the laminations could either end at the yoke or be bent so that the laminations going through the yoke run in a circumferential direction. An individual tooth of coil assembly supports <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and <b>1502</b><i>b </i>are similar to the segment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> except the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> uses a single support where two supports are used in the alternative embodiment.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> in assembled form.

Accordingly, this engagement means the coil assembly supports <b>1502</b><i>a </i>and <b>1502</b><i>b </i>will rotate with the locking disc <b>906</b> and, in turn, with the shaft <b>1302</b>.
