More specifically, the present invention relates to rewarding user on-line course performance via blockchain mining for a distributed learning environment. In some embodiments, the invention provides a method and system for using a block chain configured on a public ledger for securing user information associated with an on-line course, hybrid on-line and on-campus course, a certification or degree, or other information in the field of education. More particularly, the invention provides a method and system using data capturing devices configured with artificial intelligence techniques for determining user performance. The invention may provide securing storing a certification associated with a learning process associated with such method and system. In some embodiments, the invention provides a method and apparatus for generating and/or securing a block for a blockchain or crypto-coin. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to a mobile computing device configured to a worldwide network of computers, however, the invention has many other applications.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">&#x201c;Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.&#x201d; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Education originally occurred through a one by one basis between teacher and student or master and apprentice or partner and associate. Classrooms eventually took over to teach children in masses from pre-school to higher education. Most recently, education has been implemented on-line via the Internet to facilitate learning for students. The inventor of the present invention believes there are some drawbacks with on-line learning. Some drawbacks for students include that because on-line students tend to learn in a solitary way, there is little, if any way to provide individualized learning and to help students succeed. Some drawbacks for the providers of on-line education systems includes that providers must purchase enough hardware or software services to serve the worst-case scenarios, e.g. every student</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although education has progressed, it is desired that techniques to overcome difficulties in education, and more particularly learning are desired.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the present invention, techniques related to course materials.

In an example, a main chain consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis block to the current block. Orphan blocks exist outside of the main chain. In an example, a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree root hash or other type of hash or configuration). By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. The blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.

For example, course materials provided directly from an institution (e.g. lecturer, professor) or the modified course materials provided to the user using embodiments of the present invention may be encoded into a first block (not necessarily the ordinal first block) in a block chain. In various embodiments, the authentication may also include proof of accreditation of the course and/or the institution itself. In some embodiments, prior to hashing, the materials may be encoded with a provider private key. In some embodiments, prior to hashing, the materials may be authenticated by an accrediting body with a private key. It is contemplated that the first block can help verify the materials provide to the user are genuine and authorized.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In some embodiments, education materials provided to the user are customized for each user, for example, by adding the user's name, address, student identifier, or the like to the documents, videos, etc. Accordingly, the blockchain hash of educational materials for different users should also be different. Such techniques are usable in embodiments where course materials are highly valuable, and only students who enroll in the course should be able to receive credit or certification for the course. In such cases, if a third-party attempts use the course materials without registering, the third party cannot receive accreditation for the course. This is because the block corresponding to the course materials in the third party's blockchain will not be authenticated with the third party's name.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Next, in various embodiments, if a user completes a course successfully, an additional block is added to the blockchain. The blockchain hash may be performed upon the student data (e.g. name, student ID, course, time, etc.), one or more certificates of completion, course information (e.g. institution name, professor name, course name, credit hours, etc.), grade, and the like. In various embodiments, the user may be authenticated by other means, such as social security number, private key, password, or the like. In various embodiments, the new block includes a hash of the previous block (e.g. proof that the education materials used were authorized) plus the hash of the above user information. As a result, the blockchain can be used to prove that the authorized user completed a specific course authorized by a specific accredited institution.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In various embodiments of the present invention, as a user repeats the above process for different courses, additional blocks are added to the blockchain. The blockchain thus can verify the user's credits, grades, etc.; can verify that the course was provided by an authorized institution, and can verify that the user was authorized to take the course. In various embodiments, various educational providers, educational institutions, and other distributed stakeholders by store blockchains geared towards educational achievements.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some embodiments, transactions within the process described above may also include payment information. In various embodiments, payment information may be made using available coin offerings. In other embodiments, payment information may be made using a custom coin offering directed to education on all different levels, education from institutions of higher learning, offerings in conjunction with educational <b>529</b> plans, and the like. The inventor is not currently aware of such educationally-directed coin offerings, but believes they may be used in various embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In an example, the invention also includes a method for a secure learning experience using an encrypted encoded network. The method includes configuring a course module information derived from an interactive course platform coupled to a server and a network. In an example, the course module comprises information provided from a human user coupled to a plurality of sensing devices, including at least an image capturing device, a motion sensor, and an ambient sensor. The method includes assigning a time and date stamp on the course module and processing the course module to validate it against a predetermined quality metric, coding format, and ratification information to configure a second course module in a canonical format. The method includes processing the course module in the second format using an encryption process and configuring the course module on a public ledger in a block chain configuration.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In various embodiments of the present invention, using one or more of the above-described sensors, associated with the user's client system (e.g. smart phone, laptop, etc.) the user's actions may be monitored. More specifically, while the user is interacting with course materials, e.g. video or audio lectures, interactive presentations, or the like, actions of the user may be captured. Types of user actions may include, the user's use of a keyboard or mouse; the user moving or tilting the user's client system; the movement of the user's head, eyes, hands; whether the user's eyes are open; whether the user is talking or listening to a different audio source; and the like. In various embodiments, the user's interactions may be stored on the client system and/or uploaded to a remote (educational) server.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In various embodiments various methods may be used to determine whether the user actions indicate the user is paying attention to the lecture or presentation or not. As an example, in one embodiment, the video camera on the (user's) client system may monitor whether the user's head is facing the client system display, whether the user's eyes are directed toward the screen, and the like. Next, based upon an analysis of the video image, it can be determined whether the user is paying attention or not. In one example, the amount of time the user's eyes face the screen per time period (e.g. per minute) is computed, and compared to other time periods. In one embodiment if there is a negative slope over multiple time periods (e.g. two, three or more), the remote server may conclude that the user is not paying attention. In one example, the amount of time the user's eyes faces the display per minute is as follows: 1 minute, 45 seconds; 2 min, 50 sec; 3 min, 40 sec; 4 min, 40 sec; 5 min, 30 sec; 6 min 20 sec; etc. Based upon this example, because there is a pronounced negative slope over several time periods, the remote server may determine that by the sixth minute, the user is not paying attention to the lecture. In other embodiments, other types of metrics, and other periods of time may be utilized. For example, the user may be asked to answer questions within a certain amount of time; to strike a key on a keyboard; to say a word; or the like. In various embodiments of the present invention, the metrics used to make the above determinations may be termed a user efficiency factor or a learning utilization factor.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In various embodiments, based upon the user efficiency factor, the client system and/or the remote system may provide immediate feedback to the user, or feedback at a later time. In some embodiments, the feedback may be positive feedback to the user, praising the user for their efforts and/or further encouraging the user. Examples of positive feedback may include giving the user rewards for paying attention to a lecture, or the like, such as points the user may spend on in-application purchases (e.g. stickers, outfits, decorations, additional courses or lectures, etc.); points the user may apply to real-world items (e.g. coffee cards, Amazon gift cards, etc.); crypto currency (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.); and the like.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some embodiments of the present invention, the user rewards may include assigning the user one or more block chain (e.g. crypto currency) processes. In such a case, the remote server may include one or more dedicated hardware crypto currency mining rigs, and/or block chain mining software. When a reward is earned by a user, the remote server may instantiate a copy of the block chain mining software and assign the process to the user. It is contemplated that multiple users of the remote server may have one or more mining processes associated therewith. In some cases, each user may mine independently; in other cases all uses of the educational server(s) may form a mining pool; and in still other cases, groups of users may form smaller mining pools, e.g. groups of students taking a specific course; or the like. In some embodiments, the block-chain mining may be associated with a general purpose crypto-currency (e.g. Bitcoin), and in other embodiments, the mining may be associated with an educational crypto-currency, a blockchain, and the like.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments of the present invention, the user efficiency factor may lead to an inference that the user is not actively paying attention and/or that the user is not actively learning. Accordingly, different ways of attempting to get the user's attention may be performed. In some cases, the actions may be performed by the user's client system with or without receiving further instructions from the remote server. Examples of actions that may be performed include: modifying (e.g. increasing) the volume of audio; modifying the presentation (e.g. increasing brightness or contrast, providing bright flashes); playing audio output (e.g. spoken words, music, a beep sound, sound effects); modifying or overlaying graphics associated with the presentation (e.g. changing a background to orange, overlaying an icon of a flying bird over the presentation, and the like); pausing the lecture or presentation; presenting one or more questions about the lecture; and the like.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In some embodiments, other types of actions may be performed when the user learning utilization indicates inattention, such as reducing computer and network resource allocation and usage. Examples of reducing resource usage includes reducing the frame rate or resolution of a video presentation, reducing audio and/or video bit rate, decreasing a quality of service level, increasing a client response latency (e.g. decreasing a user priority level), reducing a communication data rate or bandwidth, changing a communication channel (e.g. from 4G to 3G or Edge), and the like. In light of the present patent disclosure, one of ordinary skill in the art will consider other alternatives that are still within embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In various embodiments of the present invention, it is contemplated that over time, user actions from multiple users will be captured for each lecture or presentation. Such data may be used to dynamically allocate computer and network resources intra-lecture (e.g. during the lecture). For example, if multiple users have a user action drop off during a specific portion of a lecture or presentation, embodiments may reduce the computer and/or network resources used during the specific portion for other users. Embodiments may also be used inter-lecture (e.g. for different lectures) such that different levels of resources are utilized or provided according to previous users' actions. As an example, a first lecture may be output using 1&#xd7; computer and network resources, whereas a second lecture may be output using 0.8&#xd7; computer and network resources. As can be seen, the user action may be used to adjust, e.g. reduce server requirements (e.g. amount of memory, number of processor cores, number of virtual servers, and the like.) In various embodiments, if physical servers are owned and used, the number of servers, e.g. footprint may be reduced; and if the servers are subscribed from the cloud (e.g. AWS), the level of cloud service may be reduced. In various embodiments, the computer and network resources described in the paragraph above may be adjusted as described in this paragraph.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In various embodiments, the user efficiency factor for a lecture or presentation may be correlated with user performance for the lecture. It is contemplated that numerous questions will be provided to the user during a lecture, and the user answers them to complete the lecture. In some embodiments, the user performance may include an efficiency factor that indicates how many times the user submits answers to questions, before they answer all the question correctly; in some embodiments, the user performance may include a persistence factor that indicates the number of times the user watches a lecture, until they answer all of the questions correctly; and the like. In some embodiments, based upon the efficiency factor, persistence factor, and the like the user for a lecture, user feedback may also be provided. For example, users may be given a reward for having a high efficiency factor, users may be given a reward for having a high persistence factor, and the like. Such embodiments thus reward the user, not based upon one metric, but multiple (potentially orthogonal) metric. In various embodiments, the rewards discussed herein, e.g. points, coins, mining processes, and the like, may be provided as feedback.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some embodiments, the user performance may also be used by the remote server to provide feedback to the user. As an example, a user watches the first two lectures for a class at 9 pm and has a user performance of 90%; the user watches the next lecture for the class at midnight and has a user performance of 80%, and the user watches the next three lectures for the class at 3 am and has a user performance of 70%. In such a case, the user may be encouraged by embodiments to watch lectures earlier at night, e.g. 9 pm, rather than late at night e.g. 3 am, as the user's performance has shown to suffer the later they watch the lecture. Such feedback may be given intra-lecture (as described above); may be given inter-lecture (e.g. for different lectures for a particular class); and may also be given inter-course (e.g. user feedback for one course given to the user when beginning a different course.)</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some cases, the user feedback described above may be provided on one or more dashboards provided to the user. As an example, the user may see a graph of their eyes facing the screen during a lecture; the user may see a graph of their user efficiency points and their persistence points for different lectures (e.g. net learner improvement); the user may see their net user efficiency for different classes (e.g. net learner improvement); and the like. In other embodiments, other types of data associated with the user for different lectures and or different classes may also be provided to the user.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Having described various embodiments, examples, and implementations, it should be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art that the foregoing is illustrative only and not limiting, having been presented by way of example only. Many other schemes for distributing functions among the various functional elements of the illustrated embodiment or example are possible. The functions of any element may be carried out in various ways in alternative embodiments or examples.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Also, the functions of several elements may, in alternative embodiments or examples, be carried out by fewer, or a single, element. Similarly, in some embodiments, any functional element may perform fewer, or different, operations than those described with respect to the illustrated embodiment or example. Also, functional elements shown as distinct for purposes of illustration may be incorporated within other functional elements in a particular implementation. Also, the sequencing of functions or portions of functions generally may be altered. Certain functional elements, files, data structures, and so one may be described in the illustrated embodiments as located in system memory of a particular or hub. In other embodiments, however, they may be located on, or distributed across, systems or other platforms that are co-located and/or remote from each other. For example, any one or more of data files or data structures described as co-located on and &#x201c;local&#x201d; to a server or other computer may be located in a computer system or systems remote from the server. In addition, it will be understood by those skilled in the relevant art that control and data flows between and among functional elements and various data structures may vary in many ways from the control and data flows described above or in documents incorporated by reference herein. More particularly, intermediary functional elements may direct control or data flows, and the functions of various elements may be combined, divided, or otherwise rearranged to allow parallel processing or for other reasons. Also, intermediate data structures of files may be used and various described data structures of files may be combined or otherwise arranged.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In other examples, combinations or sub-combinations of the above disclosed invention can be advantageously made. The block diagrams of the architecture and flow charts are grouped for ease of understanding. However, it should be understood that combinations of blocks, additions of new blocks, re-arrangement of blocks, and the like are contemplated in alternative embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
