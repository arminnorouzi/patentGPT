By using such a resin laminate as, for example, an electric or electronic circuit board material, it is possible to reduce curling and warping of the circuit board due to a difference in shrinkage ratio between the resin laminate and a metal layer, while also reducing the dielectric loss.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230007767A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230007767A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
