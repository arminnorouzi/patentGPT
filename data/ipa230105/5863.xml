However, as feature sizes of the semiconductor devices approach a lower limit, planar process and fabrication techniques become challenging and costly. A 3D semiconductor device architecture can address the density limitation in some planar semiconductor devices, for example, Flash memory devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A 3D semiconductor device can be formed by stacking semiconductor wafers or dies and interconnecting them vertically so that the resulting structure acts as a single device to achieve performance improvements at reduced power and a smaller footprint than conventional planar processes. Among the various techniques for stacking semiconductor substrates, bonding, such as hybrid bonding, is recognized as one of the promising techniques because of its capability of forming high-density interconnects.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a 3D memory device is disclosed.

As such, other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Also, the present disclosure can also be employed in a variety of other applications. Functional and structural features as described in the present disclosures can be combined, adjusted, and modified with one another and in ways not specifically depicted in the drawings, such that these combinations, adjustments, and modifications are within the scope of the present discloses.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context. For example, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; as used herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures or characteristics in a plural sense. Similarly, terms, such as &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the,&#x201d; again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context. In addition, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be readily understood that the meaning of &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; and &#x201c;over&#x201d; in the present disclosure should be interpreted in the broadest manner such that &#x201c;on&#x201d; not only means &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; something but also includes the meaning of &#x201c;on&#x201d; something with an intermediate feature or a layer therebetween, and that &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; not only means the meaning of &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something but can also include the meaning it is &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something with no intermediate feature or layer therebetween (i.e., directly on something).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; refers to a material portion including a region with a thickness. A layer can extend over the entirety of an underlying or overlying structure or may have an extent less than the extent of an underlying or overlying structure. Further, a layer can be a region of a homogeneous or inhomogeneous continuous structure that has a thickness less than the thickness of the continuous structure. For example, a layer can be located between any pair of horizontal planes between, or at, a top surface and a bottom surface of the continuous structure. A layer can extend horizontally, vertically, and/or along a tapered surface. A substrate can be a layer, can include one or more layers therein, and/or can have one or more layer thereupon, thereabove, and/or therebelow. A layer can include multiple layers. For example, an interconnect layer can include one or more conductor and contact layers (in which interconnect lines and/or via contacts are formed) and one or more dielectric layers.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to a material onto which subsequent material layers are added. The substrate itself can be patterned. Materials added on top of the substrate can be patterned or can remain unpatterned. Furthermore, the substrate can include a wide array of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, etc. Alternatively, the substrate can be made from an electrically non-conductive material, such as a glass, a plastic, or a sapphire wafer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, the term &#x201c;3D memory device&#x201d; refers to a semiconductor device with vertically oriented strings of memory cell transistors (referred to herein as &#x201c;memory strings,&#x201d; such as NAND memory strings) on a laterally-oriented substrate so that the memory strings extend in the vertical direction with respect to the substrate. As used herein, the term &#x201c;vertical/vertically&#x201d; means nominally perpendicular to the lateral surface of a substrate.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some 3D memory devices, such as 3D NAND memory devices, a stack of devices includes memory array devices and peripheral devices, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) chips. As the number of layers in the array memory devices continues to increase, the sizes of either the memory array devices or the peripheral devices continue to decrease. Hence, the area of the CMOS chips needs to be reduced to ensure that the array efficiency will not be significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a cross-section of an exemplary 3D memory device <b>100</b>, according to some aspects of the present disclosure. 3D memory device <b>100</b> includes a first semiconductor structure <b>102</b> and a second semiconductor structure <b>104</b>.
