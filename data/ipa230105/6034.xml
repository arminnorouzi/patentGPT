Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to the field of semiconductor integrated circuits, and in particular to a semiconductor transistor structure and a manufacturing method.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Metal-oxide semiconductor transistors (MOS transistors) are a class of critical electronic components in today's semiconductor products, and their electrical performance is the key to the quality of integrated circuits. A MOS transistor is a 4-terminal electronic component consisting of a gate, a source, a drain, and a substrate. There is an oxide insulating layer between the gate structure and the substrate. When the MOS transistor operates, an operating voltage is applied to the gate such that an inversion channel is formed on a side of the substrate close to the oxide insulating layer. Since the source and the drain are also inversely doped, they are turned on, thereby achieving the purpose of controlling the operation of the transistor switch.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, after the source and drain regions of a MOSFET are formed, specific regions are opened in the source and drain regions through a photolithography mask, and then etched to form a contact hole in which a conductive material is deposited. In order to reduce a contact resistance of the contact hole, the current process typically involves implanting, prior to deposition of the conductive material in the contact hole and subsequent to doping of the source and drain regions, impurity ions into the bottom of the contact hole for purpose of the same type of ion doping superposition (low-concentration doping, usually one-tenth of the doping concentration in the source and drain regions). As a result, the doping concentration of the impurity ions in the source and drain regions is increased, and a PN junction with a larger ion concentration difference is formed between the source and drain regions and the substrate. If a voltage is applied to the source and drain regions, it is easier to turn on the PN junction, resulting in leakage currents. In addition, higher electric field strengths will be created at the bottom corner or tip of the contact hole, and under the effect of a tip electric field, the leakage currents of the PN junction will be strengthened. Current leakage has a tremendous impact on device performances, so there exists a need to propose a novel MOS transistor structure and manufacturing method to reduce the leakage currents.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present application is to provide a semiconductor transistor structure. In order to solve the problem of leakage currents between the source and drain regions and the substrate caused by contact hole doping in the existing semiconductor transistors, the impurity ion concentration at a peripheral region where the bottom of the contact hole comes into contact with the source and drain regions is set to be lower than the impurity ion concentration at a middle region, the ion concentration difference between the source and drain regions and the substrate is decreased while the value of resistance in a vertical direction of the contact hole remains unchanged, thereby reducing the leakage currents.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To solve the above-mentioned technical problem, a first aspect of the present application provides a semiconductor transistor structure, which includes: a substrate formed with a well region of a first conductive type, a gate structure being disposed on the substrate; a source/drain region of a second conductive type disposed in the well region of the first conductive type, the source region and the drain region being located on two sides of the gate structure respectively; a contact hole formed at a position corresponding to the source/drain region, the contact hole extending downwards into the well region of the first conductive type; and a conductive metal filled in the contact hole, the bottom of the contact hole being implanted with impurity ions for decreasing the contact resistance of the contact hole, and the impurity ion concentration at a peripheral region where the bottom of the contact hole comes into contact with the source/drain region being lower than the impurity ion concentration at a middle region.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A second aspect of the present application provides a manufacturing method of semiconductor transistors, which includes: providing a substrate formed with a well region of a first conductive type; forming a gate structure on a surface region of the well region of the first conductive type; forming a source/drain region of a second conductive type in the well region of the first conductive type on two sides of the gate structure respectively; forming a contact hole respectively at the source/drain region; forming a high concentration region with impurity ions at a middle region of the bottom of the contact hole, and forming a low concentration region with impurity ions at a peripheral region where the bottom of the contact hole comes into contact with the source/drain region; and depositing a conductive layer in the contact hole to create conductive contact.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic full section structure diagram according to an embodiment of the present application;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for formation of the MOS transistor structure according to an embodiment of the present application;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> are schematic sectional diagrams illustrating a main process during formation of the MOS transistor structure according to a specific implementation of the present application.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For a better clarity of the objects, technical solutions, and advantages of the present application, the present application will be further described in detail below in conjunction with the specific implementation and with reference to the accompanying drawings.
