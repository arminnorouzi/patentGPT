THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The object of the present invention, as stated in the title thereof, is a floating platform for supporting different types of power generators, adopting a generally disc-shaped configuration with a circular or polygonal perimeter, designed in such a way that it collects the wind, ocean current and wave energy in a substantially more profitable and sustainable manner than those existing to date, and without the floating platform and its equipment overturning or suffering damage.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is characterised in its particular, painstaking configuration and design, particularly its dimensions, due to which the platform is the optimal result with regard to its dimensions and costs; likewise to its hydrodynamic properties, thanks to which its stability is substantially improved.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, the present invention is included within the field of means of supporting and installing wind, wave and ocean current energy generators on the ocean surface.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The

idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> portrays a platform of the &#x201c;Barge&#x201d; type (<b>12</b>) (a group to which the present invention belongs).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0013">With regard to these, the well-known American technician Jason Jonkman states:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0014">The &#x201c;spar&#x201d; type has considerable static angles of inclination which require special mechanical projects,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0015">The &#x201c;barge&#x201d; type sustains greater movements of the nacelle due to the combination of wind and waves; a suitable project for the turbines is therefore necessary, which will be more costly, and the movements must be smoothed out with alternative solutions. However, when the swell diminishes, the loads are considerably reduced,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0016">The risk of &#x201c;slamming&#x201d; should also be borne in mind.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0017">The Spar type undergoes less movement; however, non-linear forces appear, which require more advanced tools,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0018">The manufacture of these floating systems can be optimised, due to their being mass-produced,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0019">Controls must be devised in the response of the turbine/platform combination to the random movement of the waves, such as a smart variation in the pitch of the turbine blades to reduce the fore-aft sway,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0020">However, these platforms are complex in their execution and assembly, and also very costly, restricting considerably their scope of application and their future availability.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0021">The prior art reveals patent ES2650275 B1, which discloses a multi-purpose disc-shaped floating platform for supporting marine wind turbine generators and other marine energy generators, which claims to be a floating platform that supports wind turbine generators or generators driven by waves and/or ocean currents or the tides, where the platform has a height-to-diameter ratio of less than 5%, stating that its weight is considerably less than that of other platforms.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0022">Although said platform fulfils the requirement sought, it nonetheless presents a number of aspects which clearly leave room for improvement. Indeed, on the one hand, with the aforementioned height-to-diameter ratio of the platform, it must necessarily have a relatively large radius, resulting in greater dimensions, a greater quantity of material and therefore a greater environmental impact, and consequently, significantly high manufacturing, testing and transport costs. Furthermore, additional factors have not been taken into account, such as the period of the waves, which may cause the platform to enter into resonance and even overturn.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0023">A solid, when disturbed from its resting position, tends to vibrate at certain frequencies, called natural frequencies, when excited. For each natural frequency, the solid acquires a particular shape, called mode shape. Frequency analysis calculates the natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes. When the frequency of the wave-emitting source coincides with the natural frequency of the resonator (the object that oscillates), a condition known as resonance is reached. Resonance is defined as the tendency of a physical system to oscillate with a much higher amplitude at some frequencies. If the platform amplifies its oscillation with lists of 45, 60 degrees or more, said movements might even cause the platform to overturn.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0024">Therefore, the object of the present invention is to overcome the drawbacks stated concerning the floating disc-shaped platform disclosed in ES2650275 B1, fundamentally concerning its excessive size, and therefore costs and associated complexities, likewise the possibility of entering into resonance with the movement of the ocean waves and even overturning, by developing a platform which overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks and which takes into account all the possible factors that come into play in its stability on the ocean surface.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0025">This platform has the characteristics described below, the essential nature whereof is described in claim <b>1</b>.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0026">The object of the present invention is a floating platform for supporting marine power generators of any type and nature, either wind turbine generators, or generators that exploit the movement of the tides or the undulating movement of the waves.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0027">It will be disc-shaped, and its perimeter may be circular or multiple-sided polygonal, this choice depending solely on the ease of construction.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0028">It will be located by means of anchoring, and due to it being totally regular, it will present an identical surface to the waves, wherever they come from. However, the nacelle (where the wind power generator is housed) will swivel, in order to absorb the energy of the wind, from whichever direction it comes.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0029">The power generators driven by the waves and currents will consist of devices specifically designed for this purpose, with either vertical-shaft rotors (waves) or horizontal-shaft (currents), or other devices which, located on the periphery of the platform at the height of the waterline, enable the collection of the energy foreseen to be performed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0030">For the design of the platform which is the object of the invention, the following factors, described below, and the inter-relationship between them, have been taken into account.<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0031">Radius (m),</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0032">Depth (height of the disc) (m),</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0033">Bulwark (non-watertight upper structure acting as a breakwater).
