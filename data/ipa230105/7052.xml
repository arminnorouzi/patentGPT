The wireless communication between the UE and the mobile communication networks may be performed using various Radio Access Technologies (RATs), such as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) technology, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) technology, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology, Code Division Multiple Access 2000 (CDMA-2000) technology, Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA) technology, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) technology, Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) technology, etc. In particular, GSM/GPRS/EDGE technology is also called 2G technology; WCDMA/CDMA-2000/TD-SCDMA technology is also called 3G technology; and LTE/LTE-A/TD-LTE technology is also called 4G technology.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These RAT technologies have been adopted for use in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. An example of an emerging telecommunication standard is the 5G New Radio (NR). The 5G NR is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). It is designed to better support mobile broadband Internet access by improving spectral efficiency, reducing costs, and improving services.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a 4G/5G network, an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) may be deployed to provide a reliable way of establishing a signaling plane between two or more UEs. For example, in Voice over LTE (VoLTE) or Voice over NR (VoNR), the audio data is transmitted over this signaling plane to provide reliability and dedicated Quality of Service (QoS).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present application proposes solutions for providing a reliable way of delivering specific application data, such as gaming data, Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR)/Mixed Reality (MR) data, and medical data. In a session based solution, the application data is allowed to be delivered over a Real-Time Protocol (RTP) stream established in an IMS session (e.g., an IMS Voice over Packet-Switched (IMSVoPS) session, or an IMS Data over PS (IMSDoPS) session), with or without the operator (e.g., the operator of a mobile communication network) being aware of this particular data-delivery scenario. In a non-session based solution, the application data is allowed to be delivered in a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) message (e.g., in a Short Message Service (SMS) message within the SIP message), without the operator being aware of this particular data-delivery scenario.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect of the application, a User Equipment (UE) comprising a wireless transceiver and a controller is provided. The wireless transceiver is configured to perform wireless transmission and reception to and from a mobile communication network. The controller is configured to determine whether the mobile communication network supports IMS services, establish a Packet Data Network (PDN) connection or a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) session with the mobile communication network for the IMS services via the wireless transceiver in response to the mobile communication network supporting the IMS services, and send application data on the PDN connection or PDU session via the wireless transceiver.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect of the application, a method executed by a UE is provided. The method comprises the following steps: determining whether a mobile communication network supports IMS services; establishing a PDN connection or a PDU session with the mobile communication network for the IMS services in response to the mobile communication network supporting the IMS services; and sending application data on the PDN connection or PDU session.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the IMS services comprise IMS voice services. Furthermore, the UE may send a first Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INVITE message comprising Session Description Protocol (SDP) attributes which indicate using an audio or video Real-Time Protocol (RTP) stream to send the application data on the PDN connection or PDU session. For example, the SDP attributes comprise a session name field indicating an IMSDoPS session, a session information field indicating a type and an identifier of the application data, and a media information field indicating audio or video RTP. Furthermore, the UE may send a second SIP INVITE message to initiate a voice call session prior to sending the first SIP INVITE message, wherein the first INVITE message is sent to modify the voice call session to an IMSDoPS session. Alternatively, the application data may be sent in a SIP message.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the IMS services comprise IMS data services. Furthermore, the UE may send a SIP INVITE message comprising header fields indicating to use an audio or video RTP stream to send the application data on the PDN connection or PDU session. For example, the header fields comprise a subject indication that indicates an IMSDoPS session, and a reason indication that indicates a type and an identifier of the application data.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other aspects and features of the present application will become apparent to those with ordinarily skill in the art upon review of the following descriptions of specific embodiments of the apparatuses and methods for providing reliable delivery of application data.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present application can be more fully understood by reading the subsequent detailed description and examples with references made to the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a wireless communication environment according to an embodiment of the application;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating the UE <b>110</b> according to an embodiment of the application;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating the method for providing reliable delivery of application data according to an embodiment of the application;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> show an example of said configuration regarding the mappings of applications to corresponding parameters for the operator unaware mode;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a message sequence chart illustrating the session based solution for delivering gaming data using the operator unaware mode according to an embodiment of the application;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> show a message sequence chart illustrating the session based solution for delivering gaming data using the operator unaware mode according to another embodiment of the application;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a message sequence chart illustrating the session based solution for delivering gaming data using the operator unaware mode according to an embodiment of the application;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> show a message sequence chart illustrating the session based solution for delivering gaming data using the operator aware mode according to an embodiment of the application; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref> show a message sequence chart illustrating the non-session based solution for delivering gaming data using the operator unaware mode according to an embodiment of the application.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the application and should not be taken in a limiting sense.
