Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a light source module. Specifically, the light source module of the present invention has a heat conducting element partially covering the ceramic substrate and the metal substrate.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Light-emitting diode (LED) has the advantages of power saving, high luminous efficiency, long service life, and fast response speed, and are becoming more and more popular in various light source modules. In terms of vehicle lighting, with the development of electric vehicles in recent years, how to improve the power consumption efficiency or reduce power loss of all electrical equipment (especially vehicle lighting fixtures) is an important issue for the development of electric vehicles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the temperature of the LED will rise sharply when used. If a high-power LED is used to achieve a certain brightness of the lamp, it will be accompanied by the problem of high temperature and heat dissipation. As far as the entire lamp is concerned, the temperature near the LED is getting higher, if the high temperature cannot be effectively dissipated, it will not only affect the luminous efficiency of the LED, but also damage the LED and reduce its service life. From another perspective, if the LED only relies on the back-end heat dissipation components (such as fins, fans, etc.), since the high temperature is still mainly accumulated in the LED, the heat dissipation problem may not be able to solve effectively. It is not easy to get a better heat dissipation structure since the heat dissipation components occupy a large volume and cause power consumption. In other words, high power LEDs are used to increase the brightness of the lamps, and the high temperatures will accumulate in the LED modules. Common solutions are nothing more than reducing the driving power of the LEDs or trying to increase the scale of the back-end heat dissipation components. However, the above methods are obviously not good solutions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional LED light source module is to dispose the LED die on a ceramic substrate, and then dispose the ceramic substrate on a metal substrate. By the configurations of the copper traces and through holes on the ceramic substrate, the LED on top of the ceramic substrate can be driven to emit light, and part of the heat generated by the LED is conducted to the metal substrate through the lower surface of the ceramic substrate, and then dissipates heat to the rear end (fins, fans and other heat dissipation elements can be placed under the metal substrate). However, not all the unidirectional heat dissipation paths are made of materials with high thermal conductivity, and an insulating layer will inevitably be encountered in the middle which results in an unsatisfactory overall heat dissipation effect, and high temperatures are still accumulated around the LED die.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a light source module which includes a metal substrate, a ceramic substrate, a heat conducting element, and a light emitting unit.

When the light emitting unit emits light, a portion of the heat generated by the light emitting unit is conducted from the upper surface of the ceramic substrate to the upper surface of the metal substrate via the heat conducting element. Accordingly, when the light source module of the present invention is using, in addition to the existing heat dissipation path, a new heat dissipation path is established, that is, the heat is directly conducted from the upper surface of the ceramic substrate to the upper surface of the metal substrate. The starting point of this heat dissipation path is closer to the center of the high temperature of the light emitting unit, so the heat dissipation effect can be increased, the heat can be prevented from accumulating in the light emitting unit, and the work efficiency and service life of the light source module can be improved.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the aforesaid objective, the present invention discloses a light source module, which includes a metal substrate, a ceramic substrate, a heat conducting element, and a light emitting unit.

The metal layer <b>23</b> is formed on the peripheral area <b>213</b> of the upper surface <b>21</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b>, and the metal layer <b>23</b> is used to quickly conduct the heat of the upper surface <b>21</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> to the heat conducting element <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The heat conducting element <b>3</b> partially covers the upper surface <b>21</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> and the first surface <b>11</b> of the metal substrate <b>1</b>. Specifically, the heat conducting element <b>3</b> has a central through hole <b>31</b>, a first area <b>33</b>, a second area <b>35</b>, and a connecting area <b>37</b>. The size of the central through hole <b>31</b> is smaller than the area of the upper surface <b>21</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> and greater than or equal to the area of the central area <b>211</b> of the upper surface <b>21</b>.

In detail, when the heat conducting element <b>3</b> covers the ceramic substrate <b>2</b>, the first area <b>33</b> of the heat conducting element <b>3</b> covers the peripheral area <b>213</b> of the upper surface <b>21</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b>, so the metal layer <b>23</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> and the first area <b>33</b> of the heat conducting element <b>3</b> contacts. The second area <b>35</b> of the heat conducting element <b>3</b> covers the first surface <b>11</b> of the metal substrate <b>1</b>, and the central through hole <b>31</b> can expose the central area <b>211</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> and the light emitting unit <b>4</b>, thus the light generated by the light emitting unit <b>4</b> can penetrates through the central through hole <b>31</b>. The light emitting unit <b>4</b> may be a light-emitting diode (LED) module, but is not limited thereto. When the light emitting unit <b>4</b> emits light, part of the heat generated by the light emitting unit <b>4</b> is conducted from the peripheral area <b>21</b> of the upper surface <b>21</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b>, the metal layer <b>23</b>, and then to the metal substrate <b>1</b> via the heat conducting element <b>3</b>. In addition, the heat conducting element <b>3</b> can be made of a metal material with high thermal conductivity (e.g., copper, aluminum) or non-metallic materials (e.g., High thermal conductivity ceramics) to quickly dissipate heat close to the light emitting unit <b>4</b> as much as possible to prevent the temperature of the light emitting unit <b>4</b> from being too high.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the light source module <b>100</b> further includes a heat sink <b>5</b>, the metal substrate <b>1</b> has a second surface <b>13</b> opposite to the first surface <b>11</b>, and the heat sink <b>5</b> is disposed on the second surface <b>13</b>.

When the light source module <b>100</b> is assembled with other parts or accessories such as lamps, the third insulating layer <b>8</b> can protect the light source module <b>100</b> by preventing the light source module from being affected when other assembled parts or accessories are damaged.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> for another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the metal substrate <b>1</b> further has a copper bump <b>15</b> for the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> to be disposed. The copper bump <b>15</b> directly contacts the lower surface of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> to ensure that the heat of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> can be conducted to the metal substrate <b>1</b>. In addition, the copper traces <b>17</b> and corresponding insulating layers <b>19</b> are partially formed on the metal substrate <b>1</b>. The copper traces <b>17</b> are connected to the upper surface <b>21</b> through the through holes <b>25</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> and are then electrically connected to the light emitting unit <b>4</b> for supplying electricity to light up the light emitting unit <b>4</b>. As shown in the figures, the connecting area <b>37</b> is partially formed with a step difference <b>371</b> for avoiding the copper traces <b>17</b> on the metal substrate <b>1</b>. In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the metal substrate <b>1</b> may form with a concave area for accommodating the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> to make the upper surface <b>21</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b> and an upper surface of the metal substrate <b>1</b> become coplanar. Under the circumstances, the heat conducting element <b>3</b> is designed as a plate shape instead of step difference shape. Thus, the first area <b>33</b> is located at the innermost side and contacts the peripheral area <b>213</b> of the upper surface <b>21</b> of the ceramic substrate <b>2</b>, the connecting area <b>37</b> surrounds the first area <b>33</b>, and the second area <b>35</b> is located at the outermost surrounding the connecting area <b>37</b> and contacting with the first surface <b>11</b> of the metal substrate <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the above, the light source module of the present invention has an additional heat conduction path by partially covering the upper surface of the ceramic substrate and the upper surface of the metal substrate by the heat conducting element. The heat conduction path directly conducts the heat from the upper surface of the ceramic substrate (which is closest to the light emitting unit and is most common in heat accumulation) to the metal substrate to further dissipate to the rear end, thereby increasing the heat dissipation effect of the light emitting unit when it emits light, avoiding heat accumulation in the light emitting unit, and improving the working efficiency and service life of the light source module. Besides, insulating layers are disposed at different positions to ensure that the light emitting unit will not be short-circuited and will not be affected by other external parts.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain embodiments thereof, other embodiments are possible.
