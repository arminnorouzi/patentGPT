When used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;one&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the/this&#x201d; are also intended to include plural forms, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

When used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of related listed items.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a manufacturing process of semiconductor memories, the manufactured semiconductor memories have different process corners due to the position difference on a same wafer, or the difference in the parameters of field-effect transistors between different batches of wafers. Therefore, the clock signal generated by a ring oscillator in the semiconductor memory will change with the change of a process, and the signal controlled by this clock signal will also change with the process. As a result, the signal controlled by this clock signal in different semiconductor memories will have a certain error from an expected value in different process corners, and may even exceed a standard requirement.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the specification (SPEC) of a DDR4 chip, the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of a ALERT signal output by a command/address (C/A) bus parity check alert system is specified between 60 ns and 120 ns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a parity check alert circuit of a DDR4 chip. In this circuit design, after a parity check error occurs, a PAR_Error_Flag signal is output to enable a ring oscillator, so that the ring oscillator generates a clock signal CLK with a fixed cycle of T&#x2032;. Then the stage N&#x2032; of a counter is determined according to the SPEC requirement of tPAR_ALERT_PW. Through this circuit design, the parity check alert circuit outputs logic 1 when receiving the PAR_Error_Flag signal, and then outputs logic 0 after the counting of the counter ends, and the final result is the pulse width of the output ALERT signal tPAR_ALERT_PW=T&#x2032;&#xd7;N&#x2032;, T&#x2032; being the cycle of the clock signal generated by the ring oscillator, and N&#x2032; being the stage of the counter.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, although the pulse width of the ALERT signal output in this circuit design does not change with the change of the operating frequency of the chip, it will change with the change of a process. In a manufacturing process of semiconductor devices, due to the position difference on a same wafer, or the difference in the parameters of field-effect transistors between different batches of wafers, there will be variations. Such variations are called process corners. The process corners are generally divided into three process corners, i.e., slow-slow (SS), typical-typical (TT), and fast-fast (FF). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a pulse width variation of an ALERT signal in different process corners. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the case of a particularly large process variation, the cycle T&#x2032; of a clock signal CLK generated by a ring oscillator will be very different. For example, in an FF process corner, the cycle T&#x2032; of the clock signal CLK generated by the ring oscillator is relatively small, while in an SS process corner, the cycle T&#x2032; of the clock signal CLK generated by the ring oscillator is relatively large. Under the amplification of the stage N&#x2032; of a counter, finally the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of a ALERT signal in the SS process corner would easily exceed the 60 ns-120 ns range specified by the SPEC, while the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the ALERT signal in the FF process corner would also be easily smaller than the 60 ns-120 ns range specified by the SPEC.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In view of the above, the following technical solutions of embodiments of the present disclosure are proposed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a signal generation circuit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a signal generation circuit provided by embodiments of the present disclosure.

This signal generation circuit can be widely used in semiconductor memories, such as DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, LPDDR2, and LPDDR3, which will not be listed here.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The clock module <b>310</b> provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure includes a ring oscillator. When the flag signal changes from the first level to the second level, the ring oscillator generates the clock signal. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the ring oscillator is used to generate the clock signal as an internal clock signal.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the control module <b>320</b> includes a ZQ calibrator <b>321</b> and an arithmetic unit <b>322</b>, where the ZQ calibrator <b>321</b> is configured to perform a ZQ calibration operation and output a ZQ calibration code used for calibrating output impedance; and the arithmetic unit <b>322</b> is configured to receive the ZQ calibration code, divide a coefficient by the ZQ calibration code and output a division result as the control signal. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the control signal is obtained by dividing the coefficient by the ZQ calibration code.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An output drive circuit is provided in the memory chip of a DRAM memory and configured to output a data signal externally when the DRAM memory performs a read operation. The output impedance of the output drive circuit will affect the quality of the output data signal. In addition, an On-Die Termination (ODT) resistor is generally provided in the memory chip of the DRAM memory to reduce the reflection of the signal at a terminal, thereby achieving a higher memory clock frequency speed. Because the output impedance and the resistance value of a ODT resistor will change with a manufacturing process, an application environment such as voltage, temperature and other factors, it is necessary to calibrate the output impedance and the ODT resistor by means of ZQ calibration. Specifically, a port, i.e., a ZQ port, is provided on the DRAM memory. One end of the ZQ port is connected to the memory chip, and the other end is connected to an external resistor, i.e., a 240-ohm low-tolerance reference resistor. The output impedance and the ODT resistor are calibrated through an on-chip ZQ calibrator. After a system sends out a ZQ calibration command, the on-chip ZQ calibrator calibrates the output impedance and the ODT resistor according to a specified ZQ calibration cycle.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The ZQ calibrator may perform a ZQ calibration operation in response to a ZQ calibration enable signal to generate a ZQ calibration code. For example, if the ZQ calibration enable signal is enabled, the ZQ calibrator can perform a ZQ calibration operation to generate a ZQ calibration code, and the output impedance and the ODT resistor are calibrated through the ZQ calibration code, so that the impedance between the memory and an external device is matched, thereby improving signal quality during data reading and writing. Because the ZQ calibration is to calibrate the output impedance and the ODT resistor in the current process of the chip, the ZQ calibration code can reflect the information of the current process.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Because the ZQ calibration code increases with the change of the process, and the control signal is obtained by dividing the coefficient by the ZQ calibration code, the target value represented by the control signal decreases with the change of the process. Moreover, the cycle of the clock signal increases with the change of the process. Specifically, different chips on a same wafer or a same batch of wafers may have different process corners, and therefore, the frequencies/cycles of the clock signals of these chips with different process corners will be different, and the ZQ calibration code used for calibrating the output impedance and the ODT resistor will also be different. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, such a difference caused by different process corners is called as a change with a process. In this way, the target duration determined based on the target value represented by the control signal and the cycle of the clock signal will not change significantly with the change of the process. The change of the process is a change from an FF process corner to an SS process corner.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the pulse width of the target signal is adjusted by using the change of the ZQ calibration code with the process and the change of the clock signal with the process to control the pulse width of the target signal within a certain range, so as to reduce or eliminate the change of the pulse width of the target signal with the process, thereby stabilizing the pulse width of the target signal.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a specific implementation, when the signal generation circuit is applied to a DDR4 chip, the ZQ calibrator <b>321</b> is configured to output a ZQ calibration code; and the arithmetic unit <b>322</b> is configured to receive the ZQ calibration code M, divide a coefficient N by the ZQ calibration code M and then output as the control signal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a trend diagram of the change of a ZQ calibration code with a process provided by embodiments of the present disclosure. The ZQ calibration code M is used for calibrating the output impedance and the ODT resistor, the ZQ calibration code M increases with the change of the process, therefore, the trend of the change of the target value represented by the control signal with the process is opposite to the trend of the change of the cycle of the clock signal with the process, and therefore, the control signal generated based on the ZQ calibration code M can effectively compensate for the change of the pulse width of the target signal with the process.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Here, the coefficient N is divided by the ZQ calibration code M to convert the ZQ calibration code M into a signal that decreases with the change of the process, and therefore, the trend of the change of the target value represented by the control signal with the process is opposite to the trend of the change of the cycle of the clock signal with the process. In actual application, the corresponding coefficient N can be selected according to the actual pulse width of the target signal. Here, the stage of a counter is a target value N/M represented by the control signal. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the ZQ calibration code M increases with the change of the process, so that the target value N/M represented by the control signal decreases with the change of the process. The change of the process is a change from an FF process corner to an SS process corner.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, the control signal is a counter stage selection signal of the counter, and the counter can determine its stage according to the control signal, so as to perform counting based on the stage.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the flag signal is a check flag signal, and the check flag signal is used for representing a parity check error or a redundancy check error.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the generation module <b>330</b> includes a counter. When the flag signal changes from the first level to the second level, the counter starts to count the clock signal, and when a count value reaches the target value represented by the control signal, controls the target signal to change from the fourth level to the third level. When the flag signal is used for representing a parity check error, after a parity check error occurs, the flag signal PAR_Error_Flag is output. The flag signal PAR_Error_Flag is valid at a high level, so that when the flag signal PAR_Error_Flag changes from a low level to a high level, the generation module controls the target signal from a low level to a high level. Meanwhile, the counter starts to count the clock signal, and when the count value reaches the target value represented by the control signal, controls the target signal to change from the high level to the low level.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the flag signal is used for representing a parity check error. After a parity check error occurs, the check flag signal PAR_Error_Flag is output. Then the target signal generated by the generation module is a parity check alert signal ALERT. Therefore, the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal can be adjusted through the signal generation circuit provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure to control the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal within a certain range, so as to reduce or eliminate the change of the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal with the process, thereby stabilizing the pulse width tPAR_ALERT_PW of the parity check alert signal within the range specified by the SPEC.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be noted that the ALERT signal here is not a signal that is finally output through an alert_n pin, and the ALERT signal needs to pass through several inverters or output buffer circuits before it is output to the alert_n pin of the chip. In a specific example, the ALERT signal can be output to the alert_n pin of the chip after passing through an odd number of inverters, so as to ensure that the alert_n signal output by the alert_n pin is valid at a low level.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, the stage of the counter is the target value N/M represented by the control signal. If the cycle of the clock signal is T, the target duration (the pulse width of the target signal) is T&#xd7;N/M. The trends of the changes of N/M and T with the process are opposite. Therefore, the target duration (the pulse width of the target signal) hardly changes with the change of the process, in other words, the target duration (the pulse width of the target signal) is stabilized within the range specified by the SPEC in different processes.

In an SS process corner, the cycle T of the clock signal CLK generated by the ring oscillator is relatively large, but the target value N/M (the stage of the counter) represented by the control signal is relatively small. Therefore, the pulse width of the finally output ALERT signal does not change much in an FF process corner and an SS process corner.

In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the target duration is determined according to the cycle of the clock signal and the target value represented by the control signal, and the trends of the changes of the cycle of the clock signal and the target value represented by the control signal with the process are opposite.
