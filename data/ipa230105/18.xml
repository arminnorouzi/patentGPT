Rather, various modifications may be made in the details within the scope and range of the equivalents of the claims and without departing from the invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention relates to a picking-up device for bales formed by compression of an, in particular, long-stemmed plant material. The picking-up device comprises a first side part, a second side part spaced apart relative thereto in a first spatial direction, and connecting units for connecting the side parts along the first spatial direction. The side parts are formed so as to assume a transport state relative to one another in which a receiving space between the side parts is defined and bales are positioned, for transport purposes, between the side parts in the receiving space, and to assume a filling state in which the side parts are at a greater distance relative to one another in the first spatial direction than in the transport state, and in which filling state the bales can be inserted into the receiving space along a second spatial direction transverse to the first spatial direction via an insertion opening arranged between the side parts.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the picking-up device in accordance with the invention, two side parts spaced apart along one spatial direction are provided, the distance of which side parts from one another is variable. In the filling state, the bales can be introduced into the receiving space. If the side parts are brought closer to one another, they can assume the transport state, in which the receiving space preferably is completely or substantially completely filled. The filling of the receiving space takes place along the second spatial direction, which is oriented to be transverse and, in particular, perpendicular to the first spatial direction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The picking-up unit can preferably be lifted by means of a lifting device and loaded onto a vehicle for transport. This can, for example, be a road vehicle or a rail vehicle. After transport, the picking-up device can be lifted from the vehicle and brought into a position provided for the purpose of unloading. The unloading of the bales preferably takes place in the opposite manner to the filling, wherein the side parts are first transferred into the &#x201c;filling state,&#x201d; i.e., in this case, a state intended for unloading, and the bales are subsequently removed from the receiving space.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, several connection units are provided, between which the receiving space is arranged and which are spaced apart from one another along a third spatial direction, which is oriented transverse and, in particular, perpendicular to the first spatial direction, wherein the connection units engage in each case the first side part and the second side part. In relation to the third spatial direction, connection units can be spaced apart from one another and engage sides of the first side part and of the second side part facing away from one another. The receiving space is arranged between the connection units in the third spatial direction.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably, a plurality of connection units spaced apart from one another in the second spatial direction are provided, wherein an engagement opening is formed in the receiving space, in each case, between the connection units. For each side part, it can be provided that in each case a plurality of connection units engage sides facing away from each other with respect to the third spatial direction.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It can be provided that, in the third spatial direction, at the end, a connection unit be arranged in each case in the picking-up device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The third spatial direction is preferably oriented transverse and, in particular, perpendicular to the second spatial direction.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The insertion opening is advantageously formed on an end side of the picking-up device, between the side parts and/or between the connection units. In this case, the insertion opening preferably extends over the entire or substantially entire end side. This facilitates the insertion of bales into the receiving space.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is advantageous if the picking-up device is open at the insertion opening in the transport state. In this way, a structurally simple design of the picking-up device can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order to achieve the same advantage, it is advantageous if the picking-up device is open opposite the insertion opening in relation to the second spatial direction.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The side parts are advantageously interconnected in the filling state, wherein the connection units are designed to be variable in length in order to enable the transfer of the side parts from the transport state into the filling state, and vice versa. By changing the length of the connection units, the distance between the side parts can be increased. For example, the connection units are extendable&#x2014;for example, telescopic. In a preferred embodiment, the connection units can assume different clamping states, for example. In the case of decreasing or reduced tension, it is preferably possible to increase the distance of the side parts from one another. On the other hand, with increased tension, the distance can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is advantageous if the first side part is a base part of the picking-up device, and the second side part is a cover part of the picking-up device. The picking-up device can be placed on a set-down surface or a supporting device, e.g., a vehicle, via the base part.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Position and orientation information such as &#x201c;base&#x201d; and &#x201c;cover&#x201d; in the present case refer to an intended use of the picking-up device and the picking-up system. In this case, the base part is arranged at the bottom of the picking-up device in the direction of gravity, and the cover part is arranged at the top of the picking-up device in the direction of gravity.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first spatial direction can accordingly, in particular, be a height direction&#x2014;for example, a vertical. The second and/or the third spatial direction can extend along a transverse direction&#x2014;for example, in each case, in a horizontal.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is advantageous if the cover part comprises or forms a plate-shaped cover element which covers the receiving space at least in part, and preferably completely. As a result, the bales are, in particular, protected against rain in the receiving space.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The connection units can preferably extend or be oriented in a height direction of the picking-up device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is found to be advantageous for the first side part and/or the second side part to be formed as or to comprise a grating. In the present case, this can be understood, in particular, to mean that the first and/or the second side part comprises or forms a frame&#x2014;for example, of interconnected components such as profile parts or carriers. The grating or frame is made of metal, for example.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The formation as a grating or frame enables a, structurally, particularly simple design of the picking-up device at a simultaneously low weight. The payload that can be carried with a transport vehicle can thereby be increased.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is found to be advantageous if engagement openings for a transport device to engage in the receiving space are formed in the base part. This will be discussed below. The receiving space can be filled with bales in a simpler manner by means of the transport device.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a preferred embodiment, the picking-up device can be designed as a frame that can be expanded from the filling state into the transport state in the first spatial direction, or can comprise such a frame.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">With regard to a structurally simple configuration, it is advantageous if the picking-up device between the side parts is free of side walls. In particular, as already mentioned, the picking-up device can be open at the insertion opening and opposite thereto, and can moreover comprise connection units which are spaced apart from one another in the second spatial direction and are separated by gaps.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is advantageous if the picking-up device in the receiving space is free of intermediate floors and/or free of intermediate walls. In this way, a structurally simple design of the picking-up device can be achieved. By omitting intermediate floors and/or intermediate walls, the payload that can be carried by a transport vehicle can be increased.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is found to be advantageous if the picking-up device comprises or forms a clamping device, under the action of which, in a clamping state, the first side part and the second side part are braced relative to one another in the transport state, wherein the clamping device can be transferred into a release state in which the side parts are movable relative to one another in order to assume the filling state. If the clamping device assumes a clamping state, the side parts are braced relative to one another&#x2014;in particular, in order to assume the transport state. In the release state of the clamping device, a &#x201c;relaxed state&#x201d; or a state of reduced tension, so to speak, the side parts can be moved relative to one another and, in particular, brought to a greater distance from one another, in order to assume the filling position.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Providing the clamping device makes it possible to fix the bales in the receiving space between the side parts and, in particular, to the side parts. A separate load securing of the bales in the receiving space can be dispensed with. In this way, a particularly simple structural configuration of the picking-up device can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, it is advantageous if the bales are held, in the transport state, by the side parts, and the picking-up device is free of separate load securing means for the bales.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is found to be advantageous if the connection units each comprise a tension element which engages the first side part and the second side part, if the picking-up device comprises at least one clamping device for tensioning the respective tension element, and if the first side part and the second side part, relative to one another, can be braced against one another under a tensioning effect of the tension element.

The deflecting element <b>84</b> is, for example, a shaft <b>86</b> extending along the longitudinal profile <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The drum <b>76</b> is arranged centrally on the cover element <b>64</b> so that the cables <b>72</b> run tangentially onto the drum <b>76</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The respective connection unit <b>66</b> comprises at least one and preferably two guide elements <b>88</b> for guiding the respective cable <b>72</b>. Guide elements <b>88</b> are arranged on the base part <b>52</b> and on the cover part <b>54</b>, and are of identical construction.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The guide element <b>88</b> is designed as a strip <b>90</b>. The strip <b>90</b> is pivotably mounted, by a fixed end, on a pivot element <b>92</b>. The pivot element <b>92</b> is in turn held on the longitudinal profile <b>58</b> via a holding part <b>94</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The pivot element <b>92</b> defines a pivot axis <b>96</b>, in the present case, extending in the direction of the longitudinal profile <b>58</b>. This makes it possible to pivot the strip <b>90</b> relative to the base part <b>52</b> or cover part <b>54</b> about the pivot axis <b>96</b>. In this case, a free end <b>98</b> can assume a folded-out position relative to the respective side part <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>. In this case, the strip <b>90</b> points away from the side part <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> in the direction of the respective other side part <b>50</b>, <b>48</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">By pivoting about the pivot axis <b>96</b>, the strip <b>90</b> can assume a folded-in position.

In the present case, two restoring elements <b>102</b> in the form of torsion springs <b>104</b> are provided. The torsion springs <b>104</b> surround the pivot element <b>92</b> and engage the longitudinal profile <b>58</b> and the strip <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The restoring element <b>102</b> can, in particular, be a pretensioning element which acts on the strip <b>90</b> with a pretensioning force directed towards the side part <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The cable <b>72</b> is guided on both side parts <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> in such a way that it extends so as to face the receiving space <b>40</b>, and rest on the guide element <b>88</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the already mentioned transport state, the base part <b>52</b> and the cover part <b>54</b> are spaced apart from one another along the spatial direction <b>42</b>.

In this case, the bales <b>14</b> lie on the transverse profiles <b>60</b> of the base part <b>52</b>. From above, the transverse profiles <b>60</b> of the cover part <b>54</b> lie on the bales <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The cables <b>72</b> are tensioned such that the base part <b>52</b> and the cover part <b>54</b> are braced against each other and against the bales <b>14</b>. A separate load securing for the bales <b>14</b> is, in particular, not necessary.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">For easier filling, and in a corresponding manner for unloading, of the receiving space <b>40</b>, the base part <b>52</b>, and the cover part <b>54</b> can be transferred relative to one another into a filling state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). For this purpose, the tension of the cables <b>72</b> can be reduced by means of the clamping device <b>78</b>, and in particular by unwinding cables <b>72</b> from the drum <b>76</b>. This allows the base part <b>52</b> and the cover part <b>54</b> to move relative to one another.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The relative movement of the base part <b>52</b> and the cover part <b>54</b> can take place in different ways.

Particularly when the receiving space <b>40</b> is empty, the cover part <b>54</b> can be lowered in the direction of the base part <b>52</b>. For this purpose, a support device or a lifting device, for example, can be provided. The guide elements <b>88</b> fold from the folded-out state into the folded-in state by pivoting them at the longitudinal profiles <b>58</b>. The cable <b>72</b> rests against the guide elements <b>88</b> and is thereby guided away from the edges of the picking-up device <b>12</b> into the narrowing receiving space <b>40</b>. The cable length can be controlled via the drum <b>76</b> in such a way that the picking-up device <b>12</b> is tidily folded in, and the cable <b>72</b> does not sag.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">It is possible to place the base part <b>52</b> and the cover part <b>54</b> against each other.
