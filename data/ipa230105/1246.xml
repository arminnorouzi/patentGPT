Known pumper trucks include control systems used to regulate the operation of the truck and to control the flow of fluid from the truck into the hose lines. Such control systems generally include a plurality of valves used to control the flow of fluid to a fire pump from a storage tank transported onboard the truck or from another fluid supply source (e.g., a fire hydrant). The valves also facilitate control of the flow of fluid from the fire pump to fire hoses or other discharge devices. Known control systems include pressure and flow rate sensors used to monitor the pressure and flow rate of fluid at various locations within the pumper truck. For example, pressure sensors may monitor the pressure of the fluid received by the fire pump from the supply source. Generally, the pumper truck controls used to regulate the valves and the fire pump are commonly positioned in a control panel on the side of the pumper truck.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some known fire-fighting systems, during use, the firefighter may open a nozzle valve using a bail on the nozzle to release fluid from the nozzle to a target area. If the firefighter becomes separated from the nozzle, the nozzle valve may remain open, causing the nozzle to flail about erratically. In some fire-fighting systems, the associated discharge valve at the truck must be shut off in order to stop the flailing of the nozzle. Additionally, in some other known fire-fighting systems, if the firefighter becomes separated from the nozzle, the nozzle may be difficult to locate in a low visibility fire-fighting scene. As such, at least some known nozzles may include an indicator to aid the firefighter in locating the nozzle. However, such nozzles generally require that the indicator be activated at a pumper truck or at another control location not immediately accessible to the firefighter. Accordingly, known fire-fighting safety systems generally require some communication between the firefighter and an operator at the pumper truck. As a result, such systems may not be well-suited for instances where the firefighter has become separated from his nozzle and/or is unable to communicate with a crewmember at the pumper truck.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, some known fire-fighting control systems may control the valves and pump based on desired preset pressures or user-requested pressures at the nozzles. Such systems may generally include a pressure sensor located at the pumper truck. However, pressure measurements taken from a pressure sensor located at the pumper truck may not accurately reflect the fluid pressure at the nozzle, due to for example, a delay in fluid flow between the pumper truck and the nozzle. Accordingly, at least some known control systems may include a pressure sensor at the nozzle. However, in some such systems, transmission gaps or a loss of signal between the pressure sensor and the control system at the pumper truck can cause disruptions to the desired fluid flow. Accordingly, known fire-fighting control systems generally are either unable to account for the actual pressure at the nozzle and/or are unable to control the system in a transmission loss with a pressure sensor at a nozzle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, some known fire-fighting systems include a storage compartment at the pumper truck for storing one or more hose lines during transportation to and from a scene. The hose lines may be either coupled to a discharge valve during transportation or coupled to the discharge valve upon arriving on the scene. However, at least some such fire-fighting systems may result in a premature charging of the hose line, wherein the discharge valve is opened while the hose is still stored, thereby expanding the hose within the confined area of the hose storage compartment. Premature charging of the hose line(s) in the confined area may result in damage to pumper truck equipment and/or hose line and result in delays in responding to a fire at a scene. Accordingly, known fire-fighting systems require that the firefighters confirm that the hose has been removed from the hose storage compartment prior to charging the line. The reliance on the human observation at the scene increases the firefighter response time by having to delay charging the line until it can be communicated that a sufficient portion of the hose line has been withdrawn from the storage compartment. Moreover, the possibility of human error is also increased as the engineer must also confirm that they are charging the withdrawn hose line and that the hose line is sufficiently withdrawn from the storage compartment. As used herein, the term &#x201c;engineer&#x201d; refers to a firefighter generally positioned at a firefighting device whose role relates to controlling operation of the firefighting device. As used herein, the term &#x201c;nozzleman&#x201d; generally refers to a firefighter whose role is to control and/or operate a nozzle of the firefighting device to direct fluid flow to target area.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, a fire-fighting system includes a pump, a nozzle for directing fluid flow from the pump to a target area, a discharge valve controlling fluid flow between the pump and the nozzle, a sensor coupled to the nozzle, and a controller communicatively coupled to the sensor.

The nozzle may include a series of lights that blink at different rates and change color to convey the fluid level in a tank. For example, a slow, green-blinking light may indicate a full tank, an intermittent yellow-blinking light may indicate a partially filled tank, a rapid red-blinking light may indicate a low tank, a solid blue light may indicate a permanent fluid supply, and no light present may indicate a signal loss. In other embodiments, other color combinations and/or blink speeds may be used. In further embodiments, the nozzle may communicate the fluid level of the tank in any manner. For example, in some embodiments, the fluid level of the tank may be communicated via visual (e.g., a bar graph), audible, or haptic feedback. More specifically, in some embodiments, the nozzle includes a speaker and audible signals used to indicate fluid availability and/or the fluid level of the tank. Moreover, a &#x201c;time to tank empty&#x201d; signal may be incorporated into a visual or audible system for identification of fluid availability.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Some embodiments described herein enable remote control of fluid pressure and flow to a nozzle. For example, in some embodiments a closed loop control of fluid pressure and flow is accomplished using a pressure transducer, flow meter, and/or some other device in the nozzle. This closed loop system is responsive to the truck system pressure and flow presets and adjusts itself to maintain the rated or specified pressure and/or flow of the nozzle. In some embodiments, the nozzle may include a button or other actuator integrated into the nozzle to enable selective increase or decrease of nozzle pressure and/or flow based on scene identified situations. For example, in some embodiments the nozzle may include multiple buttons that, when pressed simultaneously, actuate a discharge valve at the truck. The nozzle may also include an indicator to the firefighter that the buttons have been depressed. For example, in one embodiment, pressing the buttons cycle LED's on the nozzle through all the colors (e.g., green, yellow, red, blue) for a limited time to indicate that buttons have been pressed and an indication that the valve is opening to provide fluid.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some embodiments, described herein include nozzles having various nozzle components/remote components that facilitate remote control of the fire-fighting system at the nozzle. For example, the nozzles described herein may include any of a toggle switch, a rocker switch, and/or a locking collar. In some embodiments, a bail handle on the nozzle may be used to control the discharge valve. Moreover, in some embodiments, the nozzle may include a tactile safety device that indicates to the operator whether a nozzle valve or discharge valve is in the open position. Furthermore, some embodiments include a slide lock on the nozzle. Additionally, in some embodiments, the nozzle and/or other components of the systems may include biometric scanners (e.g., finger print/retinal scanners). In some of such embodiments, biometric scanners may enable selective locking and unlocking of nozzle controls. In yet some other embodiments, the nozzle may include an auto-dimming touchscreen that facilitates control of the systems described herein. For example, in some of such embodiments, a user may be prompted to swipe the screen in a predefined pattern to enable a charge button to be activated, which may open or close a selected discharge valve.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the systems include a radio frequency identification (RFID) or near-field communication (NFC) system that controls discharge valves of the fire truck to initiate a line charge. For example, in some of such embodiments, a passive RFID tag is positioned on the apparel of the firefighter or incorporated into a part of the fire-fighting equipment, which may trigger a line to be charged. In some embodiments, the RFID system enables automatic pairing of the nozzle with a discharge valve line. For example, in some embodiments, the hose includes a non-intrusive ring/collar/tag that identifies the line. In such embodiments, a fire department could exchange a hose to different lines while only having to confirm that the hose that is being used with the line has the correct RFID tag on it. In alternative embodiments, the hose may be color-coded in accordance with an RFID scanner. Pairing can happen automatically when providing power to the nozzle (e.g., via a charging dock). Alternatively, pairing may be performed via a magnetic pad on a lanyard that could also perform the charging function. In such embodiments, to pair nozzles to a new discharge line, an operator may simply set the magnetic pad near an RFID reader and/or near a tag at the discharge line, until a colored light indicating signaling pairing is displayed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments described herein, the nozzle may store (e.g., via a memory) a pre-set pressure that is communicated to the base controller during operation. Exchanging the nozzles with different calibration pressures may automatically update the setting in the closed loop feedback system. As such, the nozzles can also be switched between different discharge lines and/or valves at the truck with the system/base controller automatically updating the specific discharge lines to control fluid flow to the nozzles based on the associated pre-set pressures stored in the nozzles. Nozzles can be switched at the end of the hose, or entire hose sections that include nozzles can be switched at the truck discharge. The nozzle may be paired with the truck and/or valve to enable the ability to selectively exchange nozzles from one discharge valve to another. In some embodiments, the base controller reverts to a pressure sensor in the truck when a signal to the nozzle is lost. In such embodiments, the base controller includes a memory that stores the last known specified pressure set point received from the nozzle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some embodiments described herein include a sensor coupled to the nozzle that detects a movement of the nozzle. Various components of the fire-fighting system may be controlled based on the detected movement. For example, in some embodiments an accelerometer is provided on the nozzle. The nozzle may communicate with a base controller located at the fire truck using a wireless transmitter or a physical communication line. The communication loop can react to, and mitigate hazards, in real-time by detecting unsafe or unintended operating conditions at the nozzle such as, but not limited to, an uncontrolled nozzle. Additionally, in some embodiments, the nozzle may include a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) or Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors which may enable an accelerated nozzle deployment by communicating nozzle deployment status or location. In some embodiments, the RFID or GPS sensors included in the nozzle can detect when a nozzle is removed from the truck hose bed to be deployed. In addition, in some embodiments, the nozzle may include a shutoff-valve that is mechanically incorporated into the nozzle and in communication with a controller at the nozzle. In some embodiments an actuator or triggered shut-off may be deployed by a controller at the nozzle and/or a base controller at the fire truck. The actuator or triggered shut-off could then be re-set by the firefighter. In alternative embodiments, the remote controller may trigger a shut-off at the truck (e.g., cause a discharge valve to be closed). In some embodiments, the valve could be controlled to re-open from the nozzle via a detection at the nozzle that the nozzle is secured, or by receiving at the nozzle, a new remote demand for fluid. In other alternative embodiments, the remote controller could control a discharge valve at the fire truck via direct communication with a discharge valve controller. For example, in such embodiments, a simple &#x201c;close&#x201d; command could be transmitted to a valve controller or a receiving device that is tagged to a valve controller.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the sensor may additionally or alternatively detect an orientation of the nozzle. For example, in some such embodiments, the remote controller may signal to the base controller that the hose is charged and the nozzle is not substantially horizontal (e.g., +60/&#x2212;30 degrees). In response, a signal may be generated indicating an error in the hose line or signaling an operator to check the hose line. In other embodiments, a hose line may be charged via a predefined motion or a combination of predefined motions, such as for example, three quick, successive, 90&#xb0; jerks to the left that are detected by the sensor.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, a wireless radio transmitter or hardwired communication line in the nozzle may communicatively couple a remote controller in the nozzle to the fire truck and/or to the base component located at the fire truck. The sensor signal can be used to automatically adjust the nozzle fluid flow and/or pressure by selectively adjusting the discharge valve that controls flow through the nozzle. Furthermore, in some embodiments, fluid flow through the nozzle may be measured by the sensor based on vibrations generated by the flow and detected by the sensor as fluid flows through the nozzle. For example, in embodiments where the sensor is an accelerometer, the accelerometer may detect minute vibrations in the nozzle generated by the fluid flow. Moreover, the remote controller may apply a smoothing function to the readings from the accelerometer to enable an approximate fluid flow measurement based on the detected minute vibrations. Some of the embodiments described herein provide advantages over some known systems in that they may automate the detection and reaction to both intentional and unintentional nozzle deployment. Moreover responsiveness and safety to the operation of the fire truck are facilitated to be improved, thus decreasing reaction time to deployment events.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the above-described sensor or other systems may be used to trigger an automatic nozzle shutoff. For example, in some embodiments, a Deadman-like switch is provided at a grip on the nozzle. If the Deadman switch is released, a timer may be triggered which causes a short delay before the fluid is turned off. Such embodiments enable an operator to switch hands or to re-position themselves without losing flow. The fluid flow from the nozzle can be selectively turned off using a solenoid that biases a spring which, when triggered will close the handle and shut off the fluid supply. In some embodiments, under normal operations the spring does not impede operation of the nozzle as it is biased by the solenoid.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In alternative embodiments, a sensor (e.g., an accelerometer) in the nozzle detects whether fluid is flowing based on a position of the handle and a determination of whether the nozzle is moving erratically. In response to the sensor detecting such motion, a solenoid or motor may be activated causing the nozzle valve to close. Programming of the remote controller and/or base controller can be accomplished with hysteresis to prevent oscillations and to enable a determination of whether the firefighter is using the nozzle to poke holes in a wall or break glass or doors, rather than determining that the nozzle is loose and/or it was a false trigger.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the embodiments described herein, communication between nozzle and its associated components, and the fire truck and its associated components, may be achieved via wired or wireless communication. For example, in some embodiments, optical cables extend between the nozzles and the fire truck. Alternatively, twisted wire, co-axial cable, HDMI cable, and/or flat wire mesh (including plastic coated wire mesh) may be used. In some embodiments, the wire may extend through a passageway of the hose for carrying fluid and/or may be embedded within the hose jacket. Alternatively, the wire may be wrapped around the exterior of the hose. Moreover, in some embodiments, communication between the nozzle and fire truck may be achieved via a combination of wireless and wired communication. For example, in some embodiments, transmitters and receivers are coupled to and spaced along the length of the hose line to facilitate reducing wireless transmission length (commonly 50&#x2032; hose lengths, for example) to a more reliable distance and to allow communications to be transmitted past typical hose connections such as swivel, storz, etc., without requiring wired connections between individual hose lengths. Wired connections could potentially be contained/protected in the hose to connect one transmitter/receiver at one hose end to another transmitter/receiver at the other end. In some embodiments, a wire is embedded in the hose to function as a radio antenna for wireless data communications from the nozzle to the system/base controller on the fire truck. In some such embodiments, the loosely coupled antenna boosts the signal into and out of structures where wireless signals may otherwise be attenuated by the construction of the structure (e.g. sheet metal buildings). In some embodiments, communication between the nozzle and valve is achieved via sonar or ultrasound transmissions through a fluid in the hose line. In further embodiments, a wireless transmission mesh network may be established by providing transceiver nodes on the firefighters' equipment/clothing. In some such embodiments, the remote controller may be located on the firefighters' equipment/clothing and/or a firefighter may control operation of the valve via a control on their clothing/other equipment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments described herein, the fire-fighting control systems include a sensor for determining whether a hose is located within a hose storage compartment on the fire truck. For example, in some embodiments an electrical or mechanical sensor is coupled in a hose bed of the fire truck. The sensor communicates with a base controller at the truck, to facilitate preventing the opening of the hose bed control valve/discharge valve when the hose is in a stored or packed condition and, as such, prevents the line from being charged. In some such embodiments, only when the sensor detects that the hose has been removed from the storage compartment, is the discharge valve permitted to open to enable the hose to be charged, such that inadvertent pressurization of a packed or stored hose is facilitated to be prevented.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the remote controller, the base controller, and/or an operator proximity assembly may determine that a firefighter has been separated from their nozzle and in response, may trigger a beacon/alert. For example, in some embodiments, when it is detected that a firefighter has become separated from their nozzle, a remote controller transmits a signal to a base controller, which in turn transmits a response signal to the remote controller/nozzle to increase or decrease an intensity of the LED, and/or LED blinking, thereby making the nozzle more visible and easier for the firefighter to find the hose line which can be used to help the firefighter exit a structure if necessary. In some such embodiments, the nozzle may include a clear cover plate and/or a display plate that permits the LED light to shine through the top, as well as along the edges of the plate, thus making the nozzle LED more visible about a circumference of the nozzle. In other embodiments, the beacon may also include an audible system.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The exemplary systems and methods described herein overcome disadvantages of known fire-fighting control systems by enabling automated control of safety components of a fire-fighting system. For example, some embodiments described herein enable control of fire-fighting system components based on detected movement of the nozzle or based on a detected proximity of the nozzle to a firefighter (e.g., a nozzleman). Accordingly, the systems described herein improve firefighter safety by automatically triggering emergency procedures when a firefighter is incapacitated or becomes separated from their nozzle. Additionally, some embodiments described herein allow for improved control of fluid flow by controlling components of a pumper truck based on a sensed pressure at the nozzle and reverting to a sensed pressure in the line, at the truck, when communication with the nozzle is lost. Furthermore, some embodiments described herein enable automated control of charging a hose line when the hose line is substantially removed from a storage compartment of the pumper truck. As a result, the systems and methods described herein facilitate increasing the efficiency of the fire-fighting control system in a cost-effective and reliable manner, while also improving firefighter safety.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of an exemplary fire-fighting control system <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view of a portion of fire-fighting system <b>100</b>.

For example, and without limitation, screen <b>250</b> may display an operating parameter (e.g., fluid pressure, flow rate, etc.) of fluid flow through nozzle <b>156</b> and may receive a user-requested fluid flow parameter (e.g., pressure, absolute flow rate, relative flow rate, etc.). In the exemplary embodiment, screen <b>250</b> is an auto-dimming touchscreen that requires a user to purposely swipe it to access a line charge button (i.e., to transmit a command to open a specific discharge valve <b>154</b> and/or <b>164</b>). In the exemplary embodiment, any and/or all of the controls may be selectively controllable by a firefighter via remote controller <b>184</b>.

For example, first nozzle <b>156</b> may also include a bumper (not labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) that is rotatable by a firefighter (e.g., a nozzleman) to adjust the spread of a spray of fluid exiting outlet <b>244</b> between a dispersed spray pattern (also referred to as a &#x201c;fog&#x201d; pattern) and a concentrated spray or straight stream. In alternative embodiments, baffle <b>243</b> is operable to control the spread of fluid to exit radially from outlet <b>244</b> about the circumference of outlet.

The set of rules broadly define the conditions and/or operating limitations for system <b>100</b>. For example, the predefined logic may indicate maximum operating pressures for hose lines <b>150</b> and/or <b>160</b>, a maximum or minimum operating speed of pump <b>120</b>, a maximum or minimum operating pressure in source line <b>146</b>, and/or a maximum or minimum amount of fluid to be maintained in tank <b>130</b>. Such rules may also define the operational responses of base controller <b>110</b> for system <b>100</b>, based on inputs to system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, when base controller <b>110</b> receives a communication from a remote controller <b>184</b> associated with first nozzle <b>156</b> demanding an increase in fluid pressure in first hose line <b>150</b>, base controller <b>110</b> controls operation of system <b>100</b> based on the predefined logic. In such an example, the set of rules may cause first discharge valve <b>154</b> to be opened until a desired operating pressure is sensed by first pressure sensor <b>152</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, measured operating values fall within a predefined tolerance (e.g., &#xb1;5 psi). For example, the desired operating pressure may include a user-requested operating pressure, or a preset pressure stored in memory <b>176</b> of remote controller <b>184</b>. If the desired pressure is not attained, base controller <b>110</b> causes the operating speed of pump <b>120</b> to increase until the desired operating pressure is sensed by first pressure sensor <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another example, base controller <b>110</b> may receive a communication from remote controller <b>184</b> associated with first nozzle <b>156</b> requesting that fluid flow to first nozzle <b>156</b> be ceased. In response, base controller <b>110</b> controls operation of system <b>100</b> based on inputs received and based on predefined logic. The predefined logic causes first discharge valve <b>154</b> to close after receiving such a communication from remote controller <b>184</b> and to reduce the operating speed of pump <b>120</b> such that the operating pressure sensed by third pressure sensor <b>162</b> at second nozzle <b>166</b> remains substantially constant as fluid is being pumped through second hose line <b>160</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the predefined logic may cause an additional valve at fire-fighting device <b>102</b> (e.g., a relief valve) coupled in flow communication with pump <b>120</b> to open to reduce the discharge pressure of the pump <b>120</b> without changing the operating speed of pump <b>120</b>.

First sensor <b>252</b> detects movement of first nozzle <b>156</b>, or more specifically, of first nozzle body <b>238</b>, and generates a signal indicative of the detected movement.

More specifically, first sensor <b>252</b> generates a signal indicative of detected motion of first nozzle <b>156</b>, and either remote controller <b>184</b> and/or base controller <b>110</b> compares the received signal to a predetermined threshold to determine if the threshold has been exceeded. An operational status of first discharge valve <b>154</b>, pump <b>120</b>, and/or nozzle valve <b>246</b> may be changed based on the determination. More specifically, in one example, remote controller <b>184</b> may transmit readings from first sensor <b>252</b> to base controller <b>110</b>. Base controller <b>110</b> may determine whether the readings from first sensor <b>252</b> exceed a predetermined threshold. For example, the predetermined threshold may indicate that either remote component <b>180</b> and/or first nozzle <b>156</b> is moving erratically (thereby indicating that the firefighter has dropped or otherwise lost control of first nozzle <b>156</b>). Additionally or alternatively, base controller <b>110</b> may determine whether readings from first sensor <b>252</b> indicate that nozzle <b>256</b> has not been moved.

Moreover, in some embodiments, either remote controller <b>184</b> and/or base controller <b>110</b> generates and transmits an alert to other components of system <b>100</b>, such as, for example, additional remote components (not shown) associated with additional firefighters and/or a general alert/display at fire-fighting device <b>102</b> to indicate that a firefighter associated with remote controller <b>184</b> has dropped or otherwise lost control of their nozzle.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the exemplary embodiment, system <b>100</b> also controls first discharge valve <b>154</b>, pump <b>120</b>, and nozzle valve <b>246</b> based on an orientation of first nozzle <b>156</b> as detected by first sensor <b>252</b>. For example, during operation, after opening first discharge valve <b>154</b>, base controller <b>110</b> may close first discharge valve <b>154</b> and/or activate an alert (e.g., at first nozzle <b>156</b>, second nozzle <b>166</b>, and/or fire-fighting device <b>102</b>) in response to receiving a signal from remote controller <b>184</b> indicating that remote component <b>180</b> is misaligned and its orientation is out of predetermined threshold bounds (e.g., not horizontally oriented +60/&#x2212;30 degrees). Additionally, in some embodiments, components of system <b>100</b> may be controlled by distinct movements of the nozzle <b>156</b> and/or remote component <b>180</b> by the firefighter. For example, in some embodiments, three quick successive 90&#xb0; twists may cause a signal to be transmitted from base controller <b>110</b> to cause the corresponding discharge valve <b>154</b> and/or <b>156</b> to open or close. Moreover, in the exemplary embodiment, base controller <b>110</b> and/or remote controller <b>184</b> may selectively permit fluid flow to and/or from first nozzle <b>156</b> in response to determining that a signal from the first sensor <b>252</b> has returned to being within predefined limits and after the firefighter has requested that fluid flow resume at nozzle (e.g., either via input at screen <b>250</b> or by adjusting a position of bail <b>234</b>).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is schematic view of an exemplary nozzle valve control assembly <b>256</b> that may be used with nozzle <b>156</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In the exemplary embodiment, nozzle valve control assembly <b>256</b> selectively controls nozzle valve <b>246</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) between the open and closed positions.

In alternative embodiments, biasing element <b>262</b> may be any other biasing element that enables nozzle valve control assembly <b>256</b> to function as described herein. An arm <b>264</b> extends from a hinge <b>266</b> of nozzle valve <b>246</b>. Arm <b>264</b> rotates with hinge <b>266</b> such that rotational movement of arm <b>264</b> causes rotation of hinge <b>266</b> which causes nozzle valve <b>246</b> to move between the open and closed positions. Hinge <b>266</b> is also coupled to bail <b>234</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) such that movement of bail <b>234</b> causes hinge <b>266</b> to rotate.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">During operation, when plunger <b>260</b> is in the extended position <b>261</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), plunger <b>260</b> engages biasing element <b>262</b> and inhibits biasing element <b>262</b> from biasing arm <b>264</b>. As a result, during normal operations, nozzle valve <b>246</b> may be selectively moved between the open and closed positions without interference and/or bias from biasing element <b>262</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, when plunger <b>260</b> is moved to the retracted position (e.g., based on a signal from remote controller <b>184</b>), biasing element <b>262</b> is released from plunger <b>260</b> and engages arm <b>264</b> to rotate hinge <b>266</b>, and therefore biases nozzle valve <b>246</b> to the closed position.

More specifically, as described above, remote controller <b>184</b> may determine that a firefighter has become separated from first nozzle <b>156</b> based on a detection from first sensor <b>252</b> indicating erratic movement of first nozzle <b>156</b> or that first nozzle <b>156</b> is positioned at an orientation that exceeds a predefined orientation range. Additionally, or alternatively, remote controller <b>184</b> may determine that a firefighter has become separated from first nozzle <b>156</b> based on a detection from first sensor <b>252</b> indicating a lack of movement of first nozzle <b>156</b> for a predetermined time period. For example, in some embodiments, at least one of base controller <b>110</b> and remote controller <b>184</b> may store at least one predetermined time period and a minimum detected movement threshold.

Base controller <b>110</b> may then increment the control settings (e.g., by increasing the speed of pump <b>120</b> and/or closing one or more valves of system <b>100</b>) until the first pressure of 100 psi is sensed at first nozzle <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Additionally, base controller <b>110</b> may store the various control settings and/or the pressure sensed at second pressure sensor <b>157</b> when the desired first pressure was achieved at the first nozzle <b>156</b>, as sensed by first pressure sensor <b>152</b>. For example, base controller <b>110</b> may determine that a pressure of 125 psi at second pressure sensor <b>157</b> resulted in the first pressure of 100 psi being sensed at first pressure sensor <b>152</b>. Accordingly, on subsequent deployment, when a first pressure of 100 psi is requested at first nozzle <b>156</b>, machine learning algorithm may cause base controller <b>110</b> to control system <b>100</b> to operate such that fluid at second pressure sensor <b>157</b> has a pressure of 125 psi. Although described sequentially herein, during operation, base controller <b>110</b> may continuously monitor first pressure sensor <b>152</b> and second pressure sensor <b>157</b>, and update the machine learning algorithm based on the detected pressures and/or pressure differentials between pressure sensors <b>152</b>, <b>157</b>. As a result, during normal operation, base controller <b>110</b> may control system <b>100</b> based on the pressures sensed at pressure sensors <b>157</b> and <b>167</b> while also accounting for pressure losses in hoses <b>150</b> and <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the exemplary embodiment, base controller <b>110</b> is operable to determine that any one of first pressure sensor <b>152</b>, second pressure sensor <b>162</b>, and/or remote controllers <b>184</b> of remote components <b>180</b> are out of communication with base controller <b>110</b>. For example, in some embodiments, memory <b>170</b> of base controller <b>110</b> stores instructions including a maximum signal lag time for receiving a signal from remote controllers <b>184</b>. If the stored maximum signal lag is exceeded for remote controller <b>184</b> on first nozzle <b>156</b> (i.e., indicating that base controller <b>110</b> has not received a communication from remote controller <b>184</b> during the signal lag time) base controller <b>110</b> determines that communication with first pressure sensor <b>152</b> and/or remote controller <b>184</b> is interrupted. In alternative embodiments, base controller <b>110</b> determines that communication with first pressure sensor <b>152</b> and/or remote controller <b>184</b> is interrupted by determining that a signal strength of a transmission received at transceiver <b>172</b> of base controller <b>110</b> from transceiver <b>178</b> of remote controller <b>184</b> is below a predetermined threshold. In further alternative embodiments, base controller <b>110</b> determines that communication with any one of first pressure sensor <b>152</b>, second pressure sensor <b>162</b>, and/or remote controllers <b>184</b> is interrupted in any manner that enables base controller <b>110</b> to function as described herein.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the exemplary embodiment, in response to determining that communication with first pressure sensor <b>152</b> and/or remote controller <b>184</b> is interrupted, base controller <b>110</b> controls system <b>100</b> based on the pressure sensed at second pressure sensor <b>157</b>. For example, base controller <b>110</b> may control valves <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>154</b>, and/or <b>164</b> and pump <b>120</b> based on the operating pressures sensed by second pressure sensor <b>157</b>, a last received user-requested operating pressure received from remote controller <b>184</b> and/or preset pressures stored in memory <b>170</b> of base controller <b>110</b>, and machine learning algorithm to account for pressure loss within the hose <b>150</b>, as described above. In the exemplary embodiment, if base controller <b>110</b> determines that communication with third pressure sensor <b>162</b> is interrupted, base controller <b>110</b> is further operable to control fluid flow to second nozzle <b>166</b> in a substantially similar manner as described above with respect to first nozzle <b>156</b>. Accordingly, in the exemplary embodiment, second pressure sensor <b>157</b> and fourth pressure sensor <b>167</b> provide a back-up input for controlling system <b>100</b> in the event communication between base controller <b>110</b> and remote controllers <b>184</b> and/or sensors <b>152</b> and <b>162</b> is lost.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the exemplary embodiment, after determining that communication with first pressure sensor <b>152</b> and/or remote controller <b>184</b> is interrupted, base controller <b>110</b> may determine that communication with first pressure sensor <b>152</b> and/or remote controller <b>184</b> is reestablished. For example, transceiver <b>172</b> of base controller <b>110</b> may receive a new transmission from transceiver <b>178</b> of remote controller <b>184</b>.
