Instrument <b>100</b> includes a tool or end effector <b>110</b> at the distal end of a shaft <b>120</b>. The proximal end of shaft <b>120</b> attaches to a transmission or drive mechanism <b>130</b> that is sometimes referred to as backend mechanism <b>130</b>. During a medical procedure, end effector <b>110</b> and the distal end of shaft <b>120</b> can be inserted through a small incision or a natural orifice of a patient to position end effector <b>110</b> at a work site in the patient. End effector <b>110</b> as illustrated includes jaws <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> that may be used at the work site for clamping, gripping, cutting, or other purposes. Other types of end effectors, for example, scalpels, wire loops, and cauterizing instruments, are known and could alternatively be mounted on the distal end of shaft <b>120</b>. Normally, a surgical instrument would further include a wrist mechanism (not shown) at the distal end of shaft <b>120</b> to provide additional degrees of freedom of motion for positioning, orienting, and using end effector <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b>, which may be stranded cables, rods, tubes, or similar structures, run from backend mechanism <b>130</b> through shaft <b>120</b> and attach to end effector <b>110</b>. A typical surgical instrument would also include additional tendons (not shown) that connect backend mechanism <b>130</b> to other structural members of end effector <b>110</b> or of a wrist mechanism, so that backend mechanism <b>130</b> can manipulate the tendons to operate end effector <b>110</b> and/or the wrist mechanism when performing the desired procedure at the work site. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates two tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> attached to jaw <b>112</b> in a pin joint structure, where jaw <b>112</b> is mounted for rotation about a pivot pin <b>116</b>. To enable both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations of jaw <b>112</b>, tendon <b>121</b> acts on jaw <b>112</b> at a moment arm about pivot pin <b>116</b> such that pulling on tendon <b>121</b> causes a torque tending to rotate jaw <b>112</b> clockwise in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Similarly, tendon <b>122</b> acts at a moment arm such that pulling on tendon <b>122</b> causes a torque tending to rotate jaw <b>112</b> counterclockwise in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Jaw <b>112</b> is thus provided with bi-directional actuation through pulling in a length of one tendon <b>121</b> or <b>122</b> and simultaneously releasing an identical length of the other tendon <b>122</b> or <b>121</b>. Mechanisms other than pin joints are known or can be devised that provide bi-directional actuation of a distal joint through pulling in a length of one tendon <b>121</b> or <b>122</b> and releasing an equal and opposite length of the other tendon <b>122</b> or <b>121</b>. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,817,974 (filed Jun. 28, 2002) entitled &#x201c;Surgical Tool Having Positively Positionable Tendon-Actuated Multi-Disk. Wrist Support&#x201d; by Cooper et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,394,998 (filed Sep. 17, 1999) entitled &#x201c;Surgical Tools For Use In Minimally Invasive Telesurgical Applications&#x201d; by Wallace et al., both of which are incorporated herein by reference, describe some known medical instrument structures in which actuation requires pulling one or more tendons while releasing lengths of one or more other tendons.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Slack in tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> can cause malfunctions, for example, by permitting tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> to derail from guides or pulleys (not shown) that route tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> through instrument <b>100</b>. Slack can also cause jumpy or unpredictable motion of the instrument. To avoid creating slack in tendon <b>121</b> or <b>122</b> when moving jaw <b>112</b>, backend mechanism <b>130</b> operates to release a length of one tendon <b>121</b> or <b>122</b> while simultaneously reeling in an equal length of the other tendon <b>122</b> or <b>121</b>. Tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> can be attached to the same capstan <b>132</b> but wrapped in opposite directions to provide the desired movements of tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> when a drive motor (not shown) turns capstan <b>132</b>. In cases where an end effector has several degrees of freed&#xa9;m that are controlled by several tendons, for instance as described in patent U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,394,998 and 6,817,974, the backend mechanism can include mechanisms other than capstans to perform the function of releasing and reeling in related lengths of tendons in order to avoid slack in the tendons as distal joints are turned. It can be seen that tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> can be two separate components, or they may be part of a closed loop component with a capstan actuator, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,316,681 B2 (filed Oct. 4, 2005) entitled &#x201c;Articulated Surgical Instrument For Performing Minimally Invasive Surgery With Enhanced Dexterity And Sensitivity&#x201d; by Madhani et al., which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Avoiding slack may also require tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> to be pre-tensioned, particularly when end effector <b>110</b> may be used for pushing and pulling, clamping, gripping, or other actions that encounter resistance. In particular, backend mechanism <b>130</b> can apply tension to tendon <b>122</b> to cause jaw <b>112</b> to clamp down on material between jaws <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. Increasing tension in tendon <b>122</b> causes higher clamping force but also causes tendon <b>122</b> to stretch. To prevent the stretching of tendon <b>122</b> from causing a corresponding amount of slack in tendon <b>121</b>, tendon <b>121</b> can be preloaded with a tension that stretches tendon <b>121</b>. For example, assuming tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> are identical, tendon <b>121</b> can be pre-loaded with a tension about equal to or greater than maximum clamping tension used in tendon <b>122</b>. As a result, tendon <b>121</b> starts stretched by the preloaded tension, and when applying a clamping force, the stretching of tendon <b>122</b> reduces the tension in tendon <b>121</b>, allowing tendon <b>121</b> to contract without becoming slack.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The tensions preloaded in tendons can increase the forces that a backend mechanism must apply to operate an instrument. In particular, tension increases friction where tendons may ride on guides or solid surfaces. Also, if shaft <b>120</b> is a flexible tube such as might be employed to follow a natural lumen in a patient's body, the preloaded tension causes friction where tendons <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> contact curved surfaces of shall <b>120</b>. In all the above cases, increased friction quickly makes accurate control of the motion of end effector <b>110</b> difficult and can lead to, imprecise manipulation of, e.g., tissue, sutures, and needles during a surgical procedure. Further, preloading of the correct tension in tendons of a medical instrument can also increase the complexity of the manufacturing process of the medical instrument. Accordingly, medical instruments are desired that can avoid slack in drive tendons without requiring high preloaded tension.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a passive preload system, such as a spring based mechanism, is attached to a tendon that is wrapped around a capstan, so that the passive preload system can control the relaxed tension in the tendon. The capstan can be driven by a motor when the tendon is needed to pull on a structural member of the instrument. For example, when applying clamping pressure or moving the structural member against resistance, capstan friction can produce tensions in the tendon that are many times the passive preload tension. However, when the tendon is not needed to apply force to the member, the capstan can be effectively and quickly made free to spin by zeroing or releasing the torque applied to the capstan by a drive motor, so that the passive preload system controls tendon tension and can provide just enough tension to prevent derailment or other malfunctions of the tendon. It should be noted that when the capstan is freed, the tendon can easily slide on the capstan since the tendon is not permanently attached to the capstan. In other words, forces are exchanged between the capstan and the tendon solely through friction. The reduced tension in relaxed tendons can reduce tendon friction, particularly in instruments with bent or flexible shafts. Two modes of operation of an instrument using a tendon attached to a passive preload system includes a mode where a motor turns a capstan about which the tendon is wrapped and thereby pulls on the tendon, and a mode where the capstan is freed and the tendon tension matches a tension of the passive preload system. A system can quickly switch between these two modes of operation by controlling the torque output by a drive motor and thus has a large bandwidth torque control.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One specific embodiment of the invention is a surgical instrument. The surgical instrument includes a shaft, a member mounted at a distal end of the shaft, a mechanism attached to a proximal end of the shaft, and a tendon. The member can be a link, or a jaw of an end effector, or a group of links coupled together, and the member is mounted to permit movement of the member relative to the shaft. The mechanism includes a capstan and a passive preload system, such as a spring system. The capstan can normally be free to roll and has a coupling through which a motor can attach to and rotate the capstan. The tendon has a first end attached to the member, runs down the shaft, wraps around the capstan, and has a second end attached to the passive preload system, which controls relaxed tension in the tendon.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another specific embodiment of the invention is a robotic surgical system. The robotic surgical system includes a motor and an instrument coupled to the motor by means of a docking port. The robotic surgical system can also include an articulated arm holding the motor pack and the docking port. The instrument generally includes a shaft a member mounted at a distal end of the shaft, a backend mechanism attached to a proximal end of the shaft, and a tendon. The member is mounted to permit movement of the member relative to the shaft. The backend mechanism includes a capstan and a passive preload system. The capstan is coupled to a drive motor in the docking port, so that the drive motor can rotate the capstan. The tendon has a first end attached to the member, runs down the shaft, wraps around the capstan, and has a second end attached to the passive preload system.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another embodiment of the invention is a method for operating a surgical instrument containing a movable member, a first tendon attached for movement of the member in one direction, and a second tendon attached for movement of the member in another direction. The method includes: applying a torque to a first capstan about which a first tendon is wrapped; and at the same time, freeing from motor torques a second capstan about which the second tendon is wrapped so that a passive preload system attached to an end of the second tendon extending from the second capstan controls tension in the second tendon.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a simplified version of a conventional robotically controlled medical instrument.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> show a medical instrument in accordance with an embodiment of the invention using a spring and capstan friction to maintain a minimum tendon tension in the instrument.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention that couples a drive motor to a capstan.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows a system in accordance with an embodiment of the invention in which capstans for multiple tendons engage a motor pack.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an expanded view schematically illustrating an embodiment of the invention using three capstans to control an instrument wrist or joint having two degrees of freedom corresponding to rotations about two perpendicular axes.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> show embodiments of the invention employing constant-force spring systems to maintain constant tendon tension in relaxed tendons.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a medical instrument in accordance with an embodiment of the invention having an effect or at the distal end of a flexible shaft.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> show side and perspective views of a medical instrument in accordance with an embodiment of the invention using drive motors with shafts parallel to the shaft of the instrument.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a robotically controlled system in which medical instruments in accordance with embodiments of the present invention can be mounted for performance of medical procedures.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Use of the same reference symbols in different figures indicates similar or identical items.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument can avoid tendon slack and maintain a relatively low tension in a relaxed drive tendon by wrapping the tendon around a capstan that is allowed to rotate freely and attaching an end of the tendon to a passive preload system such as a spring system. When operating the surgical instrument, friction between the tendon and the capstan allows a drive motor that turns the capstan to reel in a length of the tendon, and capstan friction can apply a maximum tension to the tendon that depends exponentially on the total angle of wrap the tendon about the capstan. The force from the passive preload system, e.g., spring force from a spring, and the tension in a relaxed tendon can therefore be kept relatively low while still being able to produce the high tensions needed for clamping or other movement of the instrument against resistance. When the motor torque on the capstan is zeroed, the capstan can rotate freely, and the passive preload system can pull in the tendon and prevent the tendon from becoming slack. The low relaxed tensions can decrease the forces needed for manipulation of the instrument, and tendon friction, which can be particularly problematic in medical instruments with curved or flexible shafts, can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> respectively show top and side views of a surgical instrument <b>200</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.

End effector <b>210</b> in the illustrated embodiment includes jaws <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>, which are both mounted to enable relative movement of jaws <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>.

The materials and structure of jaws <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> can generally be selected for the particular uses of instrument <b>200</b>, and many suitable effector architectures are known or may be developed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Jaw <b>212</b> is connected to a first pair of tendons <b>221</b> and <b>222</b>, and jaw <b>214</b> is connected to a second pair of tendons <b>223</b> and <b>224</b>. Each pair of tendons <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> or <b>223</b> and <b>224</b> may be portions of a continuous tendon having a point that is attached to jaw <b>212</b> or <b>214</b>, for example, by an adhesive or by a crimp residing in a notch in jaw <b>212</b> or <b>214</b>. In a typical embodiment, additional tendons (not shown) would be connected in instrument <b>200</b> to a wrist mechanism or joints (not shown) that provide additional degrees of freedom for movement for positioning and orienting end effector <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> apply force and torques to jaws <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> when pulled by backend mechanism <b>230</b> and can have any structure suitable for that task. For example, tendons can be stranded cables, wires, rods, or tubes made of metal, a polymer, or other material. In an exemplary embodiment, tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> include portions of stranded cable that are fused to tubes, with the stranded cable being used where significant bending or flexing of the tendons is expected, and the tubes being used elsewhere to reduce stretching of the tendons. In another embodiment, particularly useful when shaft <b>220</b> is flexible, tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> can be made of a woven polymer material and run inside individual sheaths (not shown).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate the example embodiment where tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> attach to a pivot joint structure in which relative motion of jaws <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> corresponds to independent rotations of jaws <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> about a pivot pin <b>216</b>. This joint structure is only an example, and other mechanisms for moving members of a surgical instrument in response to tensions applied to tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> are known and could be employed in alternative embodiments of the invention. For example, a planar, cylindrical, or spherical rolling joint could provide similar freedom of motion to jaws <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> in end effector <b>210</b>, or a prismatic linear joint or slide could be employed in end effector <b>210</b> to provide a linear bidirectional degree of freedom of motion.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Shaft <b>220</b> is a hollow tube through which tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> run. Shaft <b>220</b> may be rigid or flexible. For example, shaft <b>220</b> may be a rigid stainless steel tube if instrument <b>200</b> is intended to be inserted through a straight cannula during a medical procedure, but shaft <b>120</b> would need to be flexible if instrument <b>200</b> is intended to follow the variable path of natural lumens. In a typical configuration, shaft <b>220</b> may have a diameter of about 5 mm or 8 mm for use with some existing cannulae and may have a length on the order of several tens of centimeters. In case the shaft <b>220</b> is flexible, the tendons can run inside sheaths in a Bowden cable arrangement (i.e., like bicycle cables). As used herein, the term &#x201c;flexible&#x201d; includes continuously flexible components (such as a rubber tube, which bends at each point along its length) and constrained series of short, discrete links that allow the links to approximate the movement of a continuously flexible unit (such as a series &#x201c;snake-like&#x201d; vertebrae).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Backend mechanism <b>230</b> attaches to the proximal end of shaft <b>220</b> and acts as a transmission that converts the rotation of drive motors (e.g., drive motors <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) into movement of end effector <b>210</b>. Backend mechanism <b>230</b> particularly manipulates tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> to operate end effector <b>210</b> and may additionally be able to rotate or move shaft <b>220</b> to change the orientation or position of end effector <b>210</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, backend mechanism <b>230</b> includes one capstan <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, or <b>234</b> per tendon <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, or <b>224</b>. In accordance with an aspect of the current invention, each tendon <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, or <b>224</b> wraps for a set wrapping angle (that could be less than a full turn or as large as one or more turns) around the corresponding capstan <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, or <b>234</b> and has an end extending from the capstan <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, or <b>234</b>. Tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> are not required to be permanently attached to capstans <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, and <b>234</b> and may be able to slip relative to the capstans <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, and <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The ends of tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> attach to passive preload systems, here implemented as linear coiled springs <b>235</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>237</b>, and <b>238</b>, which can be anchored to a case or chassis of backend mechanism <b>230</b>. Springs <b>235</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>237</b>, and <b>238</b> are biased, e.g., stretched, so that springs <b>235</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>237</b>, and <b>238</b> apply a non-zero force to respective attached tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> throughout the range of motion of surgical instrument <b>200</b>. With this configuration, when capstans <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, and <b>234</b> are free to rotate, the corresponding spring <b>235</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>237</b>, or <b>238</b> controls the tension in the associated tendon <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, or <b>234</b> and avoids slack by pulling in the required length of tendon <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, or <b>234</b>. Tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> do not require a preloaded tension that is higher that the maximum tensions used for operation of surgical instrument <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each passive preload system more generally can be any structure or system that is able to apply a force to the free end of a tendon while allowing the tendon end to displace. The preload system is passive in that the system does not need to respond to a control or feedback system. Such systems can use linear coil springs as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> or use other spring elements, such as rotary coil springs, leaf springs or compliant members, such as bending beams, cantilever beams, or elastic bands. Further, the spring elements or compliant members can work through extension or compression to apply force directly or indirectly to the end of the attached tendons. Other methods for applying the desired force, such as a system using weights or magnets, might alternatively be employed. In addition to the source of force, the passive preload system may include mechanical elements that direct or control the magnitude of the force applied to the attached tendon.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">End effector <b>210</b> can be operated using drive motors which are under the active control of human input (e.g., master control input in a master-slave servo control system) and software executed in a robotically controlled system. In particular, four drive motors, which are provided in a docking port of a control system (not shown), can be respectively coupled to capstans <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, and <b>234</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows two drive motors <b>242</b> and <b>244</b>, which are coupled to capstans <b>232</b> and <b>234</b>. The orientations of capstans <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, and <b>234</b> in backend mechanism <b>230</b> are not required to have particular fixed relations to the position or configuration of instrument <b>200</b>. Accordingly, any mechanical coupling that allows a motor to rotate or apply a torque to a capstan can be used for the coupling of motors <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> to capstans <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> in backend mechanism <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Backend mechanism <b>230</b> can be removably attached to a motor pack including motors <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> through a sterile barrier, such as a sterile sheet of plastic, and the instrument <b>200</b> can be designed to be disposable or reusable and sterilizable. When the instrument is detached from the motor pack, the passive preload systems (e.g., springs <b>235</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>237</b>, and <b>238</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) still keep tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>224</b> from slacking and allow end effector <b>210</b> and shaft <b>220</b> (when flexible) to be manually arranged (or posed) in any configuration without damaging backend mechanism <b>230</b> or creating slack in any tendons <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b>, or <b>224</b>. This &#x201c;backdriving&#x201d; capability is generally a desirable property of a surgical instrument, particularly an instrument with a flexible shaft that may be bent or manipulated during instrument insertion while the instrument is not under active control. For example, the flexible shaft can be manually posed, and the tendons within the shaft do not experience undue tension or slack.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">One system for mechanically coupling a motor to a capstan uses a friction connection where a pinion of the motor fits tightly into a bore in the capstan and relies on friction between the pinion and bore. Generally, when the motor rotates the capstan, the tendon wrapped around the capstan will tighten, which can increase the frictional connection when the capstan is sufficiently elastic to shrink in radius in response to the squeezing force from the tendons. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows an alternative technique for mechanically coupling a drive motor <b>310</b> to a capstan <b>320</b>. With this particular technique, a shaft <b>312</b> of drive motor <b>310</b> fits into a bore <b>322</b> of capstan <b>320</b>. Shaft <b>312</b> has a slot <b>314</b>, and capstan <b>320</b> has a spring loaded lever or other projection <b>324</b> that extends into bore <b>322</b>. Projection <b>324</b> can be compressed when shaft <b>312</b> is inserted in bore <b>322</b>, but projection <b>324</b> can spring back and engage slot <b>314</b> when slot <b>314</b> is rotated to become aligned with projection <b>324</b>. Motor <b>310</b> can thus apply a torque to capstan <b>320</b>. It should be understood that in other implementations, male-female mechanical relationships and their many variations can be reversed (e.g., so that a projection extends from the motor shaft and engages a slot in the capstan).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Backdriving capabilities of an instrument can also create situations where the orientation of capstan <b>320</b> relative to shaft <b>312</b> may be unknown when shaft <b>312</b> is inserted into bore <b>322</b>. Regardless of the relative orientation, with the mechanical coupling of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, motor <b>312</b> can simply rotate shaft <b>312</b> until projection <b>324</b> engages slot <b>314</b>. This ability is particularly important when a backend mechanism <b>330</b> includes multiple capstans arranged in an array to engage shafts <b>312</b> of motors in a motor pack <b>340</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, where all of the motor shafts <b>312</b> may have different and unknown orientations relative to the bores <b>322</b> of associated capstans.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The drive motors coupled to backend mechanism <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are generally operated to either apply a torque to the associated capstan or to allow the associated capstan to turn freely. In a process that controls a pair of tendons that are connected for rotation of a structural member of instrument <b>200</b>, one drive motor applies a torque to a capstan around which one tendon is wrapped, and the capstan about which the other tendon is wrapped is allowed to freely rotate. For example, to rotate jaw <b>212</b> counterclockwise in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, motor <b>242</b>, which engages capstan <b>232</b>, is activated and turns capstan <b>232</b> in a direction that pulls on tendon <b>222</b>. The resulting torque that tendon <b>222</b> applies to jaw <b>212</b> tends to rotate jaw <b>212</b> counterclockwise toward jaw <b>214</b>. The maximum tension that capstan <b>232</b> can apply to tendon <b>222</b> without tendon <b>222</b> slipping on capstan <b>232</b> is proportional to the force from spring <b>236</b> and increases exponentially with the wrap angle of tendon <b>222</b> about capstan <b>232</b>. Accordingly, with a suitable wrap angle for tendon <b>222</b> about capstan <b>232</b>, the force from spring <b>236</b> can be much less than the maximum tension that may need to be applied to tendon <b>222</b> when rotating jaw <b>212</b> against resistance. While capstan <b>232</b> pulls in tendon <b>222</b>, capstan <b>231</b> is free to rotate and pays out a length of tendon <b>221</b> corresponding to the rotation of jaw <b>212</b>. Capstan <b>221</b> being free to rotate allows the tension in the portion of tendon <b>212</b> between capstan <b>231</b> and jaw <b>212</b> to equalize with the tension in the portion of tendon <b>221</b> between capstan <b>231</b> and spring <b>235</b>. Tendon <b>221</b> does not become slack, and the tension in tendon <b>221</b>, which is controlled by spring <b>235</b>, can be kept much lower than the maximum anticipated tension applied to tendon <b>222</b>. When jaw <b>212</b> reaches the desired position and no clamping tension is required in tendon <b>222</b>, both capstans <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> can be released to rotate freely. Clockwise rotation of jaw <b>212</b> can be achieved through operation of a drive motor coupled to capstan <b>231</b> to pull on tendon <b>221</b> while capstan <b>232</b> is left free to rotate. Rotations of jaw <b>214</b>, or movements of other elements of instrument <b>200</b>, can also be performed using similar procedures.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The control of jaws <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> and any joint in end effector <b>210</b> or shaft <b>220</b> can be effected in a closed loop by basing the motor control torques for that joint on measurement of the current position of the joint. Such measurements can, for example, be done by using a sensing technology such as the one described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. US 2007/0156019 A1 (filed Jul. 20, 2006), entitled &#x201c;Robotic Surgery System Including Position Sensors Using Fiber Bragg Gratings&#x201d; by Larkin et al., and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/164,829 (filed Jun. 30, 2008) entitled &#x201c;Fiber optic shape sensor&#x201d; by Prisco, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate an illustrative shape sensing fiber <b>250</b> that extends to jaw <b>212</b> for sensing of the position of jaw <b>212</b>. For the control loop, a control system compares a desired joint position with a measured joint position to compute a joint position error. A control or correction torque is then computed based on the current value of the joint position error, for instance using a Proportional Derivative Integral control law. Depending on the control torque sign indicating a clockwise or counterclockwise correction, one of the motors associated with the joint is commanded to apply a torque to its associated capstan while the other motor associated with the joint is commanded to zero its motor torque, thereby letting go of its associated capstan. In this way, the joint is placed in the desired position.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates portions of a medical instrument <b>400</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention using three tendons <b>421</b>, <b>422</b>, and <b>423</b> to control rotation of a structural member <b>410</b> about two perpendicular axes defined by pivots <b>412</b> and <b>414</b>.

Passive preload systems <b>435</b>, <b>436</b>, and <b>437</b> can be anchored to the case or chassis of the backend mechanism.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Controlled rotation of member <b>410</b> about pivot <b>412</b> relies on tendons <b>421</b> and <b>422</b> being attached to member <b>410</b> at moment arms such that pulling tendon <b>421</b> or <b>422</b> can cause rotation of member <b>410</b> about pivot <b>412</b> in a direction that is opposite to the rotation that pulling on tendon <b>423</b> can cause. Similarly, rotation of member <b>410</b> about pivot <b>414</b> relies on tendons <b>422</b> and <b>423</b> being attached to member <b>410</b> at moment arms such that pulling tendon <b>422</b> or <b>423</b> can cause rotation of member <b>410</b> about pivot <b>414</b> in a direction that is opposite to the rotation that pulling on tendon <b>421</b> can cause.

Passive preload systems as described above are readily implemented employing flexible members or springs, such as linear or rotational coil springs. Most common springs produce forces that are at least approximately described by Hooke's law over a range of forces and deflections. In particular, most springs apply a force that is proportional to the deflection of the spring from its equilibrium length. With Hooke's law springs, the tensions in relaxed tendons of an instrument of the types described above will depend on how far the springs are stretched, which in turn depends on the general configuration of the instrument, including the positions and orientations of the joints and effector in the instrument. This variation may not be significant if the range of motion of the tendons is small compared to the stretch already in the springs for biasing. However, simple Hooke's law springs will tend to create a minimal energy configuration for the instrument, and the instrument will tend to approach that configuration when all of the capstans are free to rotate. In practice, as mentioned above, this effect is small since the spring length change can be designed to he small compared to the spring bias. Further, spring systems that apply constant force can be used to avoid or reduce variations in the tensions in relaxed tendons.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> shows a surgical instrument <b>500</b>A in accordance with an embodiment of the invention employing a constant-force spring <b>535</b>A. Instrument <b>500</b>A includes an end effector <b>510</b>, a shaft <b>520</b>, and a backend mechanism <b>530</b>, all of which can be substantially the same as described for similar elements above. A tendon <b>521</b> attaches to end effector <b>510</b>, extends back through shaft <b>520</b> to backend mechanism <b>530</b>, wraps around a capstan <b>531</b>, and attaches to constant-force spring <b>535</b>A. A constant-force spring is a spring that exerts a constant force over the range of motion of the spring. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, constant-force spring <b>535</b>A is a rolled ribbon of spring material that is relaxed when the ribbon is fully rolled up. As the ribbon unrolls, the portion of the ribbon near the roll produces the spring force. This spring force remains nearly constant as the ribbon unrolls because the portion of the ribbon that produces the spring force, i.e., the portion near the roll, has nearly the same shape as the spring unrolls.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Constant-force spring systems can also be produced or approximated using a spring obeying Hooke's law and one or more cams or variable radius pulleys. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> shows a surgical instrument <b>500</b>B containing the same elements as in surgical instrument <b>500</b>A, with the exception that constant-force sprig <b>535</b>A is replaced with a constant-force spring system <b>535</b>B that includes a spring element <b>538</b> that obeys Hooke's law and a variable radius cam <b>539</b>. In particular, cam <b>539</b> has an input radius that is different from its output radius, with the ratio of the input radius and the output radius being the cam force transmission ratio at the specific angular position of cam <b>539</b>. As spring element <b>538</b> extends, the input force to cam <b>539</b> increases proportionally and cam <b>539</b> rotates. The cam profile is designed to reduce the cam force transmission ratio as cam <b>539</b> rotates an amount that cancels the increase in input spring force. The spring element <b>538</b> can also be implemented, for example, as a linear spring, a rotational spring, or a leaf spring or as a compliant member such as a cantilever beam or elastic band. In one particular embodiment, spring element <b>538</b> is a rotational spring that is integrated with the cam <b>539</b> on the same cam axis.

Such bending may result during a minimally invasive medical procedure when end effector <b>610</b> and shaft <b>620</b> are guided through a natural lumen, such as a portion of the digestive tract of a patient. The shape of shaft <b>620</b> will generally be different during different procedures. A tendon <b>621</b> used to operate end effector <b>610</b> runs through flexible shaft <b>620</b> and therefore follows almost the same path as shaft <b>620</b>. Tendon <b>621</b> may have a surrounding sheath <b>626</b> that is more rigid than tendon <b>621</b> to aid in guiding tendon <b>621</b> through shaft <b>620</b> and prevent lateral movement of tendon <b>621</b> during actuation of effector <b>610</b>. Bends in shaft <b>620</b> can cause tendon <b>621</b> to ride on the solid surface of sheath <b>626</b>, and frictional forces at these bends increase with the tension in tendon <b>621</b>. Accordingly, reducing the relaxed tension in tendon <b>621</b> when shaft <b>620</b> is bent can reduce the force that backend mechanism <b>630</b> must be able to exert to operate effector <b>610</b>. Backend mechanism <b>630</b> may thus be able to use small components that may not be robust enough to overcome the higher tendon friction that results from higher tendon tension.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The above-described embodiments illustrate embodiments of surgical instruments having backend mechanisms in which capstans have rotation axes that are generally perpendicular to the direction of the instruments' shafts. However, many mechanical systems for routing and directing tendons are known and could be employed in a backend mechanism to alter configuration of the capstans. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, for example, illustrates an embodiment of a medical instrument <b>700</b> having a backend mechanism <b>730</b> containing a capstan <b>723</b> that has a rotation axis parallel to a shaft <b>720</b> on which an end effector <b>710</b> is mounted. In this embodiment, a tendon <b>721</b> attached to end effector <b>710</b> runs the length of shaft <b>730</b> into backend mechanism <b>730</b>. Tendon <b>721</b> then winds around a first cam or pulley <b>731</b>, wraps around capstan <b>732</b>, winds around a second cam or pulley <b>733</b> and attaches to a spring <b>735</b> that is anchored in backend mechanism <b>730</b>. Cams or pulleys <b>731</b> and <b>733</b> may be shaped to provide a constant tension in tendon <b>721</b> when tendon <b>721</b> is relaxed, even if spring <b>735</b> obeys Hooke's law.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows that the bores of the capstans for multiple tendons in medical instrument <b>700</b> can be arranged on the back (most proximal surface) of backend mechanism <b>730</b>. A docking port for instrument <b>700</b> can provide a matching array of motor shafts that fit into the bores of the capstans <b>732</b> for use of instrument <b>700</b> when instrument <b>700</b> is connected to the control system. As described above, many male-female mechanical mating configurations can be used, as well as many ways to rotationally align the capstans and motor shafts.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an example of a robotically controlled system <b>800</b> capable of using medical instruments in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. System <b>800</b>, which may, for example, be a da Vinci&#xae; Surgical System available from Intuitive Surgical, Inc. includes multiple surgical instruments <b>810</b>, each of which is mounted in a docking port <b>820</b> on a robotic manipulator arm <b>830</b>. Each instrument <b>810</b> generally includes an end effector <b>812</b>, a shaft <b>814</b>, and a backend mechanism <b>816</b>, which may be of any of the types described above. In particular, instruments <b>810</b> may have shafts <b>816</b> that are rigid or flexible. When shafts <b>816</b> are flexible for insertion into and following of a natural lumen, robotically controlled and jointed arms <b>830</b> may not be needed, and instruments <b>810</b> can be mounted in mounting ports <b>820</b> on a cart or other fixed structure. Instruments <b>810</b> can be made interchangeable, so that the instruments <b>810</b> mounted in docking ports <b>820</b> can be selected for a particular medical procedure or changed during a medical procedure to provide the clinical functions needed. Instruments <b>810</b> can implement many functions, including but not limited to forceps or graspers, needle drivers, and scissors of many different shapes and sizes. An endoscopic camera, for example, a stereoscopic camera, can also be mounted on an arm <b>840</b> to provide visual information, particularly images, of the work site at which instruments <b>810</b> are operating.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Docking ports <b>820</b> generally include drive motors that provide mechanical power for operation of instruments <b>810</b> and systems for establishment of a sterile barrier between instrument <b>810</b> and the rest of robotically control system <b>800</b>. Some suitable sterile barriers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,368 (filed Nov. 21, 1997) entitled &#x201c;Multi-Component Telepresence System And Method&#x201d; by Cooper, which is incorporated herein by reference. Docking ports <b>820</b> may additionally include an electrical interface for communication with instruments <b>810</b>, for example, to identify the type of instrument in the docking port and to access parameters of the instrument. The electrical interface may also convey measurements such as measurements of the position and orientation of effectors <b>812</b> or shaft <b>814</b>. A computer system <b>850</b> can receive the measurements and execute software that controls drive motors in the docking ports <b>820</b> as needed to manipulate instruments <b>810</b> as directed by a surgeon or other medical personnel using system <b>800</b> to perform a surgical procedure.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Although the invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, the description is only an example of the invention's application and should not be taken as a limitation.
