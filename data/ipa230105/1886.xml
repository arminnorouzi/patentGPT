Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Vehicle theft, insurance fraud claims, car crashes, and/or hit and runs are unfortunate situations that some vehicle owners confront when owning a vehicle. In most cases, it is incredibly difficult to identify the thief and/or aggressor by providing hard evidence of such events after they occurred. Moreover, vehicle owners are left unable to receive proper compensation and/or provide police authorities with the required information as most standard security systems are limited to only audio support, using an alarm.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, the alarm in the vehicle is limited to activating when the thief actually does something to trigger the alarm, such as opening a locked door. However, it doesn't prevent other types of damage, such as scratches and/or denting the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for a vehicle security system that records a visual image and/or video around the vehicle in response to activity around the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present general inventive concept provides a vehicle security system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additional features and utilities of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which
