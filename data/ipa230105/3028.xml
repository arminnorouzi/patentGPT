The water that backs up behind the ice dam can leak into a home and cause damage to walls, ceilings, insulation, and other areas. Some conventional deicing systems can include heating elements that prevent ice dam formation, but such elements are prone to elevated risks such as house fires (see, e.g., https://www.contractormag.com/columns/vates/cm_column_456&#x2014;page accessed Oct. 11, 2018). Some other conventional deicing systems include pumping a deicing solution to melt ice dams. However, no conventional deicing system teaches, suggests, or discloses a cost-efficient method of melting and preventing ice dams regardless of the source of the water or power to the building, and regardless of whether there was a loss of power to the system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some aspects, the systems and methods described herein relate to systems for removing and preventing ice dams regardless of the source of the water to the building, and regardless of whether there was a loss of power to the system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A common ice dam prevention system incorporates large heating elements that are costly to install and operate, as well as being aesthetically unappealing to many homeowners. Importantly, however, these traditional systems require power to operate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Unfortunately for New England homeowners, the weather conditions that are conducive to ice formation are often accompanied by downed trees and power lines. Blizzards or ice storms can cause widespread power outages. For example, one storm in March of 2017 left over 60,000 customers without power in Massachusetts alone. (See, e.g., http://www.masslive.com/weather/index.ssf/2017/03/60000_power_outages_reported_a.html&#x2014;page accessed Oct. 11, 2018).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Despite the frequency of power outages, no conventional deicing system teaches, suggests, or discloses a cost-efficient method of melting and preventing ice dams regardless of the source of the water to the building, and regardless of whether there was a loss of power to the system. Therefore, it is an object of the systems and methods described herein to provide both urban and rural properties the advantages associated with a low-cost, environmentally friendly, aesthetically pleasing system that is operable when connected to either city water or a well, and that incorporates the ability to provide easy and safe ice dam removal and prevention even if there is a loss of power to the system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the invention features a deicer system to distribute a deicing fluid along a roof (and also possibly in a gutter) of a building (e.g., a house or an office) to limit or mitigate ice dam formation.

In some embodiments, the systems and methods as described herein include a method of distributing a fluid onto a first selected surface. In some embodiments, the systems and methods as described herein include a system of distributing a fluid onto a first selected surface. In some embodiments, the systems and methods as described herein include a method of preventing ice dam formation. In some aspects, systems described herein can have the following advantages, including providing users the ability to remove and prevent ice dams regardless of the water supply and despite suffering from power outages. In some aspects, systems described herein can be run with an electric pump (e.g., one that is connected to an electrical outlet or is battery powered).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the schematic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in some embodiments, an example deicer system <b>100</b> can be arranged on or along one or components of living structure (e.g., a house) <b>50</b> and be configured to limit (e.g., reduce or prevent) the formation and build-up of ice dams along one or more selected surfaces <b>75</b> of the house <b>50</b>, such as a roof surface at or near the gutter end of the roof (e.g., a rooftop).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the system <b>100</b> can include one or more fluid emitters <b>130</b> used to distribute deicer fluid to the desired selected surfaces (e.g., roof) <b>75</b>. The deicer fluid can be used to melt or otherwise form flow channels within or through an existing ice dam to promote better liquid flow off of the roof <b>75</b>. As described in detail below, the emitters <b>130</b> can include any of various fluid dispensers to expel deicer fluid, typically, at relatively low pressures.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The system <b>100</b> can also include a water source <b>140</b> that utilizes its inherent water pressure to propel water through tubing <b>112</b> to a passive mixer <b>110</b>. The water is typically mixed with a deicer solution from a deicer solution container <b>120</b> to together form a deicer fluid. In some cases, the system <b>100</b> can be configured to form (e.g., mix, blend, or otherwise combine the water and deicer solution) a deicer solution of a predetermined concentration. A solenoid valve <b>170</b> can be operated by a sensor suite <b>180</b> and control the flow of deicer fluid to the emitters <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The water source <b>140</b> provides water to the system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the water source <b>140</b> is connected to an existing pressurized water source, such as a city water supply. Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, the water source <b>140</b> can include a residential well. Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, the water source <b>140</b> can include an alternative container (e.g., water holding container), by way of example and not limitation, a 55 gallon drum.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The tubing <b>112</b> connects most or all fluid handling components of the deicer system <b>100</b> and allow for the flow of the deicer fluid to the emitters <b>130</b>. The tubing <b>112</b> can be made from any commonly used tubing material, by way of example and not limitation, PVC, metal tubing, and/or rubber tubing. As used herein, the term tubing can include any of various flow conduits configured to facilitate flow of a fluid therefore, such as tubing, piping, conduit or other structures made of rigid, flexible, and/or braided materials.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The passive mixer <b>110</b> is a component or device that can mix two or more liquids, such as to be combined at a predetermined ratio, without the need for additional electricity or active, moving components. Additional electricity in this context can refer to electricity other than that used to propel one of the liquids relative to the others with which it is mixed. As used herein, the term passive mixer or passive mixing can be used to refer to any component that does not require an additional pump or other electrically controlled device to ensure proper mixing of the two or more liquids. In some cases, the system described herein can take advantage of water pressure provided from a city water supply or hydrostatic pressure from a water column to facilitate mixing. For example, in some embodiments, the passive mixer relies on the venturi effect. The venturi effect is the reduction in fluid pressure that results when a fluid flows through a constricted section (or choke) of a pipe. For example, a base fluid (e.g., a diluent fluid (e.g., water)) can flow through a constriction of a pipe, which generates a low pressure region in the pipe. A second fluid (e.g., the active ingredient fluid (e.g., a deicer solution)) can be drawn into the pipe by the low pressure region, such that the deicer solution mixes with the water and is carried away in the pipe. For example, the venturi effect facilitates the mixing of water and deicer solution, thereby creating a deicer fluid, by creating a pressure differential that draws deicer solution from the deicer solution container <b>120</b> into the water flow at a controlled rate. By way of example and not limitation, the passive mixer can be a HydroBlend&#xae; Model #6850. As the mixing is accomplished automatically by the reliability of fluid mechanics, no power supply is required to maintain or monitor the mixing process. As discussed above, the description of no power supply can be exclusive of a power or pressure used to pressurize the water to flow through the venturi pipe.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The deicer solution container <b>120</b> contains the deicer solution and is connected to the passive mixer <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the deicer solution includes one or more of inorganic chemical deicer crystals, by way of example and not limitation, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, and/or potassium chloride. In some embodiments, the deicer solution includes organic chemical deicer crystals, by way of example and not limitation, one or more of calcium magnesium acetate, potassium acetate, potassium formate, sodium formate, calcium formate, and/or urea. In some embodiments, the deicer solution includes, by way of example and not limitation, one or more of alcohol-based materials, such as, proplene glycol, and/or glycerol. The deicer solution can also include any of various combinations of the inorganic chemical deicer crystals, organic deicer crystals, or alcohol based components described above. In some cases, a pure deicer solution can be applied directly to the intended surface. However, in some embodiments, in order to lower operating costs with limited impact on practical efficiency, the deicer solution is mixed (e.g., diluted) with a diluent (e.g., water) to create a deicer fluid. The deicer fluid is then distributed to the intended surface. The specific blend of deicer solution and diluent can vary based on the desired properties. For example, in some embodiments, the deicer fluid ratio is at least 30% deicer solution (e.g., about 30% to about 99% deicer solution (e.g., about 30% to about 50% deicer solution (e.g., about 35% to about 45% deicer solution (e.g., about 38% to about 42% deicer solution (e.g., about 40% deicer solution))))). In some embodiments, the deicer fluid ratio is about 90% to about 99% deicer solution. In some embodiments, the deicer fluid ratio is about 80% to about 89% deicer solution. In some embodiments, the deicer fluid ratio is about 70% to about 79% deicer solution. In some embodiments, the deicer fluid ratio is about 60% to about 69% deicer solution. In some embodiments, the deicer fluid ratio is about 50% to about 59% deicer solution. In some embodiments, the deicer fluid ratio is about 40% to about 49% deicer solution. In some embodiments, the deicer fluid ratio is about 30% to about 39% deicer solution. In some embodiments, the deicer fluid ratio is at least 40% deicer solution. In some embodiments, the deicer fluid ratio is at least 50% deicer solution.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the deicer solution container <b>120</b> includes a unique connection to the passive mixer <b>110</b>. The unique connection can increase the likelihood that the user replaces the initial deicer solution container <b>120</b> with an OEM replacement. This feature protects the user and the manufacturer from warranty concerns that might stem from counterfeit replacements. In addition, it increases the likelihood that end users do not replace the environmentally friendly deicer solution with a harmful alternative, by way of example and not limitation, methanol or ethylene glycol. In some embodiments, the unique connection is a fitting with a particular shape. In some embodiments, the unique connection is a microchip. In some embodiments, the unique connection is an alternative method of ensuring the user replaces the deicer solution container <b>120</b> with an OEM replacement. In some embodiments, the deicer solution is about 100% deicer fluid that can be drawn by a pipe and/or a tube.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some cases, it can be useful to determine (e.g., predict, detect, etc.) that deicer solution is available when the sensor suite <b>180</b> confirms that environmental conditions are likely to promote ice dam formation. As a result, it can be important to be able to check the amount of deicer solution that remains in the deicer solution container <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the deicer solution container <b>120</b> has a transparent (e.g., clear) windowed wall that allows for visual inspection of the deicer solution. In some embodiments, the deicer solution container <b>120</b> includes an ultrasonic sensor that detects the current deicer solution level in the deicer solution container <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the ultrasonic sensor provides an alert to the user when the deicer solution levels are low.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The sensor suite <b>180</b> can control the operation of the deicer system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the sensor suite <b>180</b> incorporates a microcontroller and sensors to measure temperature and moisture in the exterior environment. When the temperature and moisture sensors determine or predict that a predetermined condition is satisfied, the sensor suite <b>180</b> can automatically operate a solenoid valve <b>170</b> to allow for operation of the deicer system <b>100</b>. For example, opening the solenoid valve <b>170</b> can cause water to begin flowing through the system, permit water mixing with the deicer solution to form deicer fluid, and/or cause dispensing or expulsion of the deicer fluid from the emitters <b>130</b> onto the roof <b>75</b>. In some embodiments, the systems and methods as described herein have a bypass valve for manual operation of the solenoid valve <b>170</b> during a power outage. Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, the sensor suite <b>180</b> includes a timer, wherein the solenoid valve <b>170</b> is opened at periodic times (e.g., during times of day), by way of example and not limitation, during the night or other times when the selected surface does not receive direct sunlight.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The emitters <b>130</b> dispense the deicer fluid onto the selected surface. In some embodiments, the emitters <b>130</b>, by way of example and not limitation, are drip emitters. The drip emitters can be a cost effective method of distributing the deicer fluid. For example, the emitters can include simple drip emitters, such as drip irrigation tubing (e.g., tubing with a series of one or more openings (e.g., fluid flow paths)). Additionally, drip emitters can be effective at distributing deicer fluid in a more controlled and predictable way that with traditional nozzles. For example, fluid being expelled from a drip emitter typically flows along a single path leaving each of the openings, rather than being sprayed in a fan-like pattern. Single path deicer fluid can be useful in forming discrete flow paths through an ice dam, rather than covering an entire ice dam in a thin mist of fluid. Furthermore, unlike some deicer systems on the market, the emitters <b>130</b> typically do not require high deicer fluid pressure to operate. For example, some conventional deicers utilize traditional &#x201c;pop-up&#x201d; sprinkler heads that require a particular fluid pressure to operate. With drip emitters however, a low fluid pressure should not inhibit the effectiveness of the system. In some embodiments, the emitters <b>130</b> incorporate directional nozzles to allow for directional application of the deicer fluid. By way of example, the emitters described herein can be configured to operate with fluid that is less than about 70 psi (e.g., less than about 30 psi (e.g., about 10 psi to about 30 psi (e.g., about 10 psi to about 25 psi))). However, the specific liquid pressures can vary. For example, in some cases, to raise the liquid to the top of a one story home, we calculated it would take roughly 8 psi (0.5 psi/ft), which meant that 22 psi was the pressure of the liquid at the emitters, assuming that the inlet pressure is 30 psi and there are no losses. However, changing various parameters, such as increasing the diameter of the tubing or the height of the emitters, could vary the desired pressure at the output.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic of an example deicer system <b>100</b> that includes a secondary container <b>150</b> and a secondary container bypass valve <b>190</b>. Rural homes can be serviced by wells as their water source <b>140</b>, and as such, there can be a loss of water pressure to the deicer system <b>100</b> during power outages. Unlike some common deicing systems that would require the use of expensive generators or solar panels to either run heating coils or a pump, the incorporation of the secondary container <b>150</b> can afford a low cost alternative to generators and solar panels. The secondary container <b>150</b> can be installed above the emitters <b>130</b> to allow for gravity fed distribution of the deicer fluid, thereby allowing for continued ice dam protection despite the loss of power to the deicer system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the secondary container <b>150</b> is integrated into the deicer system <b>100</b> fulltime. In some embodiments, the secondary container <b>150</b> can be manually incorporated into the deicer system <b>100</b> by the user through the operation of the secondary container bypass valve <b>190</b>.

The electric pump <b>115</b> draws deicer solution from a deicer solution container <b>120</b> at a controlled rate. The electric pump <b>115</b> can be operated by a sensor suite <b>180</b> and control the flow of deicer fluid to the emitters <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, there is a manual pump <b>160</b>.

The deicer solution has to mix with a certain amount of pressurized water to get to the top of the building. In the electric pump deicer system, however, an electromechanical force can be used to pump fluid to the top of the building. This means that there may be no need to dilute the deicer solution (although it can be diluted if it is sold and shipped as a concentrate), so the base model of the system can include simply a pump, tubing, a deicer container, sensors, and emitters. Additional add-ons can also be included, such as the secondary container, the manual pump, and the release valve shown and described above. In some embodiments, the deicer solution can be non-corrosive. In some embodiments, the deicer solution can be biodegradable. In some embodiments, the system can be powered by at least one of a battery or an outlet, e.g. a wall plug.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to the drawings in general, the illustrations are for the purpose of describing an embodiment of the application and are not intended to limit the application thereto.
