It will be apparent, however, that the embodiments described by the present disclosure can be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Specific arrangements or orderings of schematic elements, such as those representing systems, devices, modules, instruction blocks, data elements, and/or the like are illustrated in the drawings for ease of description. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the specific ordering or arrangement of the schematic elements in the drawings is not meant to imply that a particular order or sequence of processing, or separation of processes, is required unless explicitly described as such. Further, the inclusion of a schematic element in a drawing is not meant to imply that such element is required in all embodiments or that the features represented by such element may not be included in or combined with other elements in some embodiments unless explicitly described as such.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, where connecting elements such as solid or dashed lines or arrows are used in the drawings to illustrate a connection, relationship, or association between or among two or more other schematic elements, the absence of any such connecting elements is not meant to imply that no connection, relationship, or association can exist. In other words, some connections, relationships, or associations between elements are not illustrated in the drawings so as not to obscure the disclosure. In addition, for ease of illustration, a single connecting element can be used to represent multiple connections, relationships or associations between elements. For example, where a connecting element represents communication of signals, data, or instructions (e.g., &#x201c;software instructions&#x201d;), it should be understood by those skilled in the art that such element can represent one or multiple signal paths (e.g., a bus), as may be needed, to affect the communication.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although the terms first, second, third, and/or the like are used to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. The terms first, second, third, and/or the like are used only to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first contact could be termed a second contact and, similarly, a second contact could be termed a first contact without departing from the scope of the described embodiments. The first contact and the second contact are both contacts, but they are not the same contact.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The terminology used in the description of the various described embodiments herein is included for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used in the description of the various described embodiments and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well and can be used interchangeably with &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this description specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;communication&#x201d; and &#x201c;communicate&#x201d; refer to at least one of the reception, receipt, transmission, transfer, provision, and/or the like of information (or information represented by, for example, data, signals, messages, instructions, commands, and/or the like). For one unit (e.g., a device, a system, a component of a device or system, combinations thereof, and/or the like) to be in communication with another unit means that the one unit is able to directly or indirectly receive information from and/or send (e.g., transmit) information to the other unit. This may refer to a direct or indirect connection that is wired and/or wireless in nature. Additionally, two units may be in communication with each other even though the information transmitted may be modified, processed, relayed, and/or routed between the first and second unit. For example, a first unit may be in communication with a second unit even though the first unit passively receives information and does not actively transmit information to the second unit. As another example, a first unit may be in communication with a second unit if at least one intermediary unit (e.g., a third unit located between the first unit and the second unit) processes information received from the first unit and transmits the processed information to the second unit. In some embodiments, a message may refer to a network packet (e.g., a data packet and/or the like) that includes data.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term &#x201c;if&#x201d; is, optionally, construed to mean &#x201c;when&#x201d;, &#x201c;upon&#x201d;, &#x201c;in response to determining,&#x201d; &#x201c;in response to detecting,&#x201d; and/or the like, depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase &#x201c;if it is determined&#x201d; or &#x201c;if [a stated condition or event] is detected&#x201d; is, optionally, construed to mean &#x201c;upon determining,&#x201d; &#x201c;in response to determining,&#x201d; &#x201c;upon detecting [the stated condition or event],&#x201d; &#x201c;in response to detecting [the stated condition or event],&#x201d; and/or the like, depending on the context. Also, as used herein, the terms &#x201c;has&#x201d;, &#x201c;have&#x201d;, &#x201c;having&#x201d;, or the like are intended to be open-ended terms. Further, the phrase &#x201c;based on&#x201d; is intended to mean &#x201c;based at least partially on&#x201d; unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various described embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various described embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">General Overview</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some aspects and/or embodiments, systems, methods, and computer program products described herein include and/or implement a system for operating a vehicle based on feedback from in-vehicle sensor and//or an application installed on a passenger's communication device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an example embodiment, a system of a vehicle (e.g., autonomous vehicle) detects signals from in-vehicle sensors and/or an application installed on a passenger's communication device (e.g., phone) in communication with the vehicle, and uses those signals to modify at least one operational parameter (e.g., route or speed) of the vehicle to enhance convenience of the passenger.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, the system of the vehicle determines that the passenger is starting a video call, and in response the system of the vehicle causes the vehicle to decelerate until vibration within the vehicle reduces or modifies the route to a smoother route (e.g., a route with a smoother material, such as asphalt instead of gravel).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another example, the system of the vehicle determines that the passenger is sleeping or relaxing, and in response the system of the vehicle causes the vehicle to decelerate until vibration within the vehicle reduces. Additionally, or alternatively, the system of the vehicle can cause modification of the route the vehicle is traveling along, resulting in a smoother route than the vehicle was previously traveling along.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In yet another example, the system of the vehicle determines that the passenger needs to be in a meeting during the route, and in response the system of the vehicle selects a route that has the best internet connectivity among available routes.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one example, the system of the vehicle determines that the passenger is going to an event (e.g., by detecting that the person is wearing a formal garment or suit and inferring that the passenger is going to a meeting), and in response the system of the vehicle causes the vehicle to accelerate. Additionally, or alternatively, the system of the vehicle may select a faster route.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">By virtue of the implementation of systems, methods, and computer program products described herein, a vehicle can be operated more efficiently and/or more effectively. A system of a vehicle can modify an action of the vehicle based on actions and/or appearance of the passenger. Such modification can advantageously enhance the convenience of a passenger, and that too without requiring constant or multiple user inputs indicating a preference of the passenger. This advantageously allows for simpler graphical user interfaces of an application that the passenger uses for riding the vehicle. A simpler graphical user interface minimizes computational bugs and errors, reduces redundant communication and enables a more optimal use of the bandwidth while the passenger is using the application and/or while the application communicates with the vehicle. Simpler graphical user interfaces can be more user friendly, increase engagement and retention of users (including the passenger) of the application, require less computational resources such as storage (which can include memory as well as databases), lower computational costs for addressing customer queries, decrease time taken to return search results or browse various features of the application, and/or the like. In addition, installment of multiple discrete sensors at various locations in the vehicle can provide many benefits, including easier and simultaneous access of different data (e.g. actions and/or appearance of the passenger), and high speed with which optimization (e.g. modification of route and/or speed) can be performed because input data is being acquired quickly by sensors operating in parallel.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrated is example environment <b>100</b> in which vehicles that include autonomous systems, as well as vehicles that do not, are operated.

For instance, a low degree of privacy (e.g., due to the presence of or a high frequency of crowds, pedestrians, other vehicles, roadside cameras, etc.) can correspond to lower ride quality or passenger comfort, whereas a higher degree of privacy (e.g., due to an absence of or a lower frequency of crowds, pedestrian, other vehicles, roadside cameras, etc.) can correspond to higher ride quality or passenger comfort.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As another example, ride quality and passenger comfort can depend on the views from the vehicle <b>200</b> along a route. For instance, views that are more pleasant (e.g., scenic or touristic views, such as views of landmarks, landscapes, scenic points, and other points of interest, etc.) can correspond to higher ride quality or passenger comfort, whereas views that are less pleasant (e.g., views without scenic or touristic views) can correspond to higher ride quality or passenger comfort.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">As another example, ride quality and passenger comfort can depend on user reviews of the points of interest that are visible from the vehicle <b>200</b> along the route.

In successive convolution layers, the filters associated with neurons may be configured to identify successively more complex patterns in the image (e.g., arcs, objects, and/or the like). In successive convolution layers, the filters associated with neurons may be configured to identify patterns in other types of data (e.g., audio signals, accelerometer measurements, vital signs, eye tracking and movement measurements, etc.).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some embodiments, CNN <b>640</b> performs the first convolution function based on CNN <b>640</b> multiplying the values provided as input to each of the one or more neurons included in first convolution layer <b>642</b> with the values of the filter that corresponds to each of the one or more neurons.
