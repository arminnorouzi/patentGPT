The linear patterns in the two directions enclose a blank parallelogram pattern. After dry etching, the pattern is transferred downward, and finally an array of connecting pads in a substantially hexagonal arrangement mode is formed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, taking a single connecting pad as an example, during the pattern transfer process, a hole corresponding to the connecting pad changes from an original parallelogram to an ellipse and is transferred downward. Due to an etching load effect, a top of the hole is constantly subjected to plasma effect and shaped like a relatively regular circle. A near-bottom of the hole is primarily subjected to bombardment of an etching gas, causing the bottom of the hole to maintain its original elliptical shape, so the connecting pad is shaped like an oval. Dimensions of the elliptical connecting pad are not uniform in a long axis direction and a short axis direction, resulting in insufficient margin in the short axis direction during a capacitor patterning process, and it cannot be stopped on the connecting pad during etching, which may cause breakdown, thus leading to problems such as capacitor leakage.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One aspect of embodiments of the present disclosure provides a method for forming a connecting pad, wherein the method includes: providing a substrate; sequentially forming a conductive layer, a first pattern definition layer and a second pattern definition layer on a surface of the substrate; sequentially forming a first group of patterns, a second group of patterns, and a third group of patterns intersecting with each other at 120&#xb0; on the second pattern definition layer, an intersection portion of the three groups of patterns forming a hexagonal pattern definition structure on the second pattern definition layer; transferring the pattern definition structure downward, and etching away a portion of the first pattern definition layer, such that the remaining first pattern definition layer forms a columnar structure, wherein a bottom of the columnar structure is circular in shape under an action of an etching load effect; and etching the conductive layer by using the remaining first pattern definition layer as a mask, such that the remaining conductive layer forms a circular connecting pad.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure provides a semiconductor structure having a connecting pad, wherein the connecting pad is formed by means of the method for forming a connecting pad proposed in the present disclosure and described in the above-mentioned embodiments.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> to <b>13</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> to <b>17</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> respectively are schematic structural diagrams of a semiconductor structure formed in some steps of a method for forming a connecting pad according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> respectively are plan views of the semiconductor structure in some steps of the method for forming a connecting pad according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> to <b>23</b></figref> are schematic structural diagrams of the semiconductor structure in some steps of the method for forming a connecting pad according to another embodiment of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> is a plan view of the semiconductor structure in the step as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Exemplary embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.
