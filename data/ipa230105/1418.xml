Such refined particles are for instance needed for laboratory analysis testing of material samples. Ball mills usually comprise of a milling jar and a lid. The material to be refined to small particles size is inserted into the milling jar together with milling balls. The milling jar is then closed and optionally sealed. The closed milling jar is than set in motion such that the balls move inside the milling jar. During a milling process the material is exposed to the moving balls and broken down to smaller particles when in contact with the balls and a surface inside the jar. In some applications it is desirable that a maximum size of particles in not exceeded in a material sample. In some cases, it is also desirable, to have a high purity or homogeneity in the material sample and to avoid mixing of unwanted material, components, compounds or elements with the sample.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the utility model DE 20 2017 107 052 U1 is disclosed a grinding jar and a grinding jar assembly for refining a milling material and/or for separating a milling material from at least a milling body. The utility model discloses a laboratory mill with a grinding jar with multiple grinding fractions vertically arranged above one another. The grinding jar comprises a lid and a bottom jar part. Retaining elements can be clamped between jar parts for separating grinding space fractions from each other. The retaining element can be designed as a strainer. A size of openings in the strainer can decrease from a top to a bottom, such that multiple grinding stages are formed. In operation the grinding bodies decrease a particle size of the milling material and the milling material passes through the openings of the retaining element once a particle size is small enough. According to the teaching the grinding material can be continually decreased in particle size from milling space fraction to milling space fraction. The milling material of a final particle size passes through the openings of a bottom retaining element and can be collected in a bottom jar part. The teaching of the utility model document includes to seal the grinding jar and to clamp the jar parts together. The milling jar assembly allows to decrease a milling material particle size to a very small size and ensure that milling bodies are separated from the milling material. The milling jar assembly also ensures, that the milling material particles are of a minimum size when reaching the bottom jar part.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The document CN 203 750 627 U discloses a milling assembly for a ball mill with a housing for refining and separating a substrate and with a collection vessel for retaining the refined substrate, wherein the housing comprises, in vertical order a lid, a milling vessel for receiving milling balls and a screen with a refining section and with apertures, and wherein the collection vessel is releasably mounted to a bottom end of the housing, and wherein in the housing an orifice is arranged, wherein in the orifice a valve is arranged for selectively allowing gas to pass between an outside and an inside of the housing in an open position of the valve and to seal the housing against the outside in a closed position of the valve.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a means and method to safely mill a substrate to a desired quality.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object is achieved by a portable laboratory scale milling assembly for a ball mill as taught by claim <b>1</b> of the present invention. The object is also achieved by a ball mill according to claim <b>9</b>. The object is furthermore achieved by a method for refining a substrate with a milling assembly according to claim <b>10</b>. Advantageous embodiments of the milling assembly, the ball mill and advantageous steps in the method for refining the substrate are disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention discloses the technical teaching, that the milling vessel comprises a taper for receiving a sealing screw. The invention also discloses the technical teaching of a ball mill with an actuator for holding and moving a milling assembly. Furthermore the solution to the object lies in an inventive method for refining a substrate with a milling assembly comprising the step of providing a housing with a screen and with a milling vessel with balls, and with the step of inserting a substrate into a milling vessel, and with the step of inserting a sealing screw into a taper in the milling vessel, and with the step of mounting a lid to the milling vessel and sealing the housing with the lid, and with the step of closing at least one valve of an orifice to maintain an atmosphere in the housing, and with the step of milling the substrate by movement of the balls in the milling vessel, wherein the substrate is refined by contact with the balls and wherein the refined substrate passes through apertures in a screen towards a bottom end of the housing, and with the step of collecting the refined substrate in a collection vessel connected to the bottom end of the housing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The taper and the sealing screw reinforce the cylindrical milling vessel structurally. Furthermore, the taper and sealing screw function as a deflection surface for balls inside the milling vessel and avoid damage to the lid and the orifice in the lid. The deflection surface also causes the ball to frequently come in contact with substrate and the refining section such that the substrate is refined at a high frequency. The application of the taper and the sealing screw in the milling vessel on the top end of the housing thus allows a particularly safe milling operation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a preferred embodiment an additional second milling vessel is arranged below the milling vessel. This arrangement allows for consecutively refining substrate to a desired particle size in a controlled environment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention multiple milling vessels are arranged in vertical order below one another. This allows for consecutively refining substrate for instance to submicron level without the need of decreasing aperture size and particle size from one milling vessel to the milling vessel below at a high degree. In other words, the particle size can be decreased gradually in incremental steps.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to yet another preferred embodiment the housing further comprises a catch basin for attachment of the collection vessel and for guiding refined substrate into the collection vessel, wherein the catch basin is mounted between the milling vessel and the collection vessel. According to another advantage, different sizes of collection vessels can be arranged, in particular when the mating dimensions of collection vessels with different sizes are the same in such a way that collection vessels with different sizes can be mutually exchanged.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The arrangement of a catch basin allows for a small collection vessel by facilitating the catch basin as an adapter piece. A small collection vessel is easy to handle and transported. The use of a catch basin particularly allows to use a screen with a comparatively large diameter and surface. Consequently, an area of the refining section of the screen is large. Consequently, the number of apertures in the screen is high. Consequently, an effective area for the milling and separation of the substrate is large and the milling operation can be performed efficiently and in a short time span.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the screen is arranged, in particular clamped, between the neighboring milling vessel and/or between the milling vessel and the neighboring catch basin. This has the advantage, that an assembling of the milling assembly is eased. The use of equally dimensioned parts, in particular milling vessels, screens and a catch basin of equal or fitting diameter allows to selectively adjust the milling assembly in a modular manner to serve a specific desired milling task. A cleaning of the circular flat screen, the cylindrical tube shaped milling vessel and the round shaped catch basin is eased.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention is also embodied in that the apertures in respective screens decrease in size for consecutively reducing the particle size of the substrate from a top end to the bottom end of the housing. In other words, the apertures in the screen located closest to the top end of the housing features the largest diameter. The screen closest to the bottom end of the housing and the collection vessel features the smallest diameter. The apertures are preferably circular. This allows for instance to hold back substrate, material or particles which are not yet decreased to a desirable size. Material or substrate which cannot be broken to a desired size will not pass the aperture of the respective screen. Consequently, a separation and high purity and homogeneity in the substrate is achieved. Different ball sizes or balls of different material can be used in combination with decreasing diameter of the apertures of respective screens. Thus, a selectively adjustable milling assembly to increase the efficiency of the milling operation is provided.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Advantageously the collection vessel and/or the bottom end of the housing comprises a stopcock for sealing the collection vessel and/or the housing against the outside before detaching the collection vessel from the housing. The stopcock can be arranged in the catch basin. Alternatively, a stopcock can be arranged in the bottom end of the milling vessel next to the collection vessel. In each case the stopcock on one side hinders for instance oxygen or other material to enter into the housing or into the collection vessel. Thus, a reaction of the delicate or sensitive or unstable substrate can be avoided. For instance, an oxidation of the substrate can be avoided. This is particularly critical in view to a substrate with a small particle size with a large surface to volume ratio. Another advantage of the stopcock lies in the fact, that it hinders for instance poisonous or dangerous substrate from leaving the housing or the collection vessel to enter the environment and cause harm or danger to the environment. The stopcock allows to safely retain the substrate inside the housing or inside the collection vessel. The stopcock functions as a safety device for safely transporting the milling assembly or the collection vessel or the housing to a save environment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a preferred embodiment the orifice comprises a filter. The filter can be a high efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA). The orifice is arranged in the wall of the housing, in particular in the wall of the milling vessel. The filter may be attached to the wall. The use of such a filter in the orifice avoids harmful material to pass between an inside of the housing and an outside of the housing when the valve of the orifice is in an open position. Also, in case of a defect valve leaking gas is filtered. The filter also avoids contamination of the substrate from gas flowing into the housing through the orifice.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The application of the aforementioned ball mill with an actuator allows for an efficient milling operation. A milling result is reproducible with an automated ball mill with an actuator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The conduct of the aforementioned inventive method for refining the substrate with the milling assembly has the advantage, that a safe refinement in a controlled environment without the need to process or contact the substrate even until finally retained in the collection vessel is achieved.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A further preferred method step, comprises setting a desired atmosphere in the housing by evacuating or inserting a gas into the housing through the orifice. This for instance allows for controlling a chemical reaction or to avoid a chemical reaction during the milling process. The contamination of a substrate from gas can be avoided by performing a milling operation under vacuum. Also, the processing of gas contaminated from the substrate during the milling operation inside the housing can be avoided by applying a vacuum to the housing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Yet another preferred method step, comprises the step of opening a valve to flush refined substrate particles towards the collection vessel. This can particularly be achieved by opening the valve of the orifice in the top end of the housing, particularly in the lid and letting gas pass into the vacuum of the housing. This allows for an effective milling operation without remainders of substrate particles left in the housing. This has the advantage, that a cleaning operation and handling of remaining substrate is decreased.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A further preferred method step, comprises the step of closing a stopcock in the collection vessel and/or closing a stopcock in the bottom end of the housing for sealing the inside against the outside before removing the collection vessel from the housing. This allows to avoid a dangerous material to enter the environment from the inside of the collection vessel or from the inside of the housing. This also avoids for instance gas or particles or material from the environment and the outside to enter into the inside of the housing or the inside of the collection vessel.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In yet another application the orifices can be used to clean the housing inside by flushing air from one orifice to another orifice and through the housing. In yet another application a continuous flow of gas through the housing between one orifice at a bottom end of the housing and one orifice at the top end of the housing can cause movement of particles and facilitate refinement and sieving. Depending on the gas a drying or moisting of substrate can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an application gas may be circulated in a closed loop between two orifices through the housing. In this setup the inside of the housing is a part of the closed loop and another part of the closed loop lies on the outside of the housing, wherein the two orifices are connected by a tube on the outside.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The aforementioned components as well as the claimed components and the components to be used in accordance with the invention in the described embodiments, are not subject to any special exceptions with respect to their size, shape, material selection and technical concept such that the selection criteria known in the pertinent field can be applied without limitations.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts in a perspective view a milling assembly in an exploded view;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts in a side view a ball mill with an actuator and the milling assembly attached to the actuator;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts in a sectional view the milling assembly with a housing and a collection vessel attached to the housing;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>depicts in a sectional view according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> a view into an upper milling chamber with a first screen, milling balls and a substrate;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>depicts in a sectional view according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> a view into a bottom milling chamber with a screen, milling balls and the substrate to be further refined;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an alternative embodiment of the milling assembly in a sectional side view.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts in a perspective view in an exploded view a milling assembly <b>1</b>.

The orifice <b>19</b> in the catch basin <b>21</b> is closed and sealed by the valve <b>20</b>. The outlet <b>32</b> of the catch basin <b>21</b> of the housing <b>10</b> is connected to the collection vessel <b>11</b>, such that the outlet <b>32</b> is also closed and sealed by the collection vessel <b>11</b>. In this operational arrangement an exchange of a substrate, gas or materials between an inside of the housing <b>10</b> and the outside is avoided.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a sectional view of the milling assembly <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The milling assembly <b>1</b> with the housing <b>10</b> and the collection vessel <b>11</b> is in the operational arrangement and the inside <b>38</b> of the housing is entirely sealed against the environment outside <b>39</b>. The sealing is achieved by clamping the lid <b>12</b> to the flange <b>31</b> of the top end milling vessel <b>13</b> with the clamping means <b>29</b>, wherein a gasket <b>30</b> is arranged between the lid <b>12</b> and the flange <b>31</b>. The flange <b>31</b> of the top end milling vessel <b>13</b> facing the bottom end <b>18</b> and the flange <b>31</b> of the bottom end milling vessel <b>13</b> facing the top end <b>23</b> are connected by the clamping means <b>29</b>, wherein the gasket <b>30</b> and the screen <b>15</b> is clamped between the flanges <b>31</b>. The flange <b>31</b> of the catch basin <b>21</b> and the flange <b>31</b> of the bottom end milling vessel <b>13</b> facing the bottom end <b>18</b> are connected by the clamping means <b>29</b>, wherein the gasket <b>30</b> and the screen <b>15</b> are clamped in between the flanges <b>31</b>. The valves <b>20</b> are set into a closed position. The orifice <b>19</b> in the lid <b>12</b>, the orifice <b>19</b> in the milling vessel <b>13</b> and the orifice <b>19</b> in the catch basin <b>21</b> are thus closed and sealed by the valves <b>20</b>. The outlet <b>32</b> is closed and sealed by the collection vessel <b>11</b> screwed onto the outlet <b>32</b> by the threads <b>33</b>. The stopcock <b>24</b> in the outlet <b>32</b> and the stopcock <b>24</b> in the collection vessel <b>11</b> are in an open position such that refined substrate particles <b>22</b> can fall into the catch basin <b>21</b> and further into the collection vessel <b>11</b> by gravity. The top end milling vessel <b>13</b> comprises the circular taper <b>26</b> with the sealing screw <b>27</b> screwed into the center of the taper <b>26</b>. The taper is welded onto an inside wall <b>40</b> of the milling vessel <b>13</b>. A deflection surface <b>36</b> is formed on a screen <b>15</b> facing side of the taper <b>26</b>. The deflection surface <b>36</b> and the sealing screw <b>27</b> cause a deflection of the balls <b>14</b> and avoid the balls <b>14</b> from hitting the lid <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An upper milling chamber <b>34</b> is formed between the wall <b>40</b> of the top end milling vessel <b>13</b>, the deflection surface <b>36</b> and, the screen <b>15</b> clamped between milling vessel <b>13</b> at the top end <b>23</b> and the milling vessel <b>13</b> at the bottom end <b>18</b>. A lower milling chamber <b>35</b> is formed between the wall <b>40</b> of the bottom end milling vessel <b>13</b>, the screen <b>15</b> clamped between milling vessel <b>13</b> at the top end <b>23</b> and the milling vessel <b>13</b> at the bottom end <b>18</b>, and the screen <b>15</b> clamped between the milling vessel <b>13</b> at the bottom end <b>18</b> and the catch basin <b>21</b>. The screen <b>15</b> of the upper milling chamber <b>34</b> and the screen <b>15</b> of the lower milling chamber <b>35</b> at the bottom end <b>18</b> comprise of the apertures <b>17</b> and the refining sections <b>16</b> respectively. The upper milling chamber <b>34</b> and the lower milling chamber <b>35</b> is filled with milling balls <b>14</b> and the substrate <b>22</b> to be refined. In a first step before the milling operation the substrate <b>22</b> is filled into the upper milling chamber <b>34</b> from a top end <b>23</b> through the hole in the taper <b>26</b>. In a second step the sealing screw <b>27</b> is screwed into the hole of the taper <b>26</b>. In a further step the lid <b>12</b> is mounted to the top end milling vessel <b>13</b> by the clamping means <b>29</b>. In a further step the housing <b>10</b> is evacuated through the orifice <b>19</b> such that the sealed milling assembly <b>1</b> is set under vacuum. During the evacuation process filters <b>25</b> of the orifice <b>19</b> filter the gas sucked from the inside <b>38</b> of the housing <b>10</b> such that no substrate, particles or harmful components or material in the gas enter the outside <b>39</b> of the housing <b>10</b>. In a subsequent step the valves <b>20</b> of the orifice <b>19</b> are set to a closed position to maintain the vacuum. During the milling operation the milling assembly <b>1</b> is set in motion, such that the balls <b>14</b> move and refine the substrate <b>22</b> by breaking it up into particles under contact with the balls <b>14</b> and under contact with the refining section <b>16</b> of the screen <b>15</b>. The diameter of the apertures <b>17</b> in the screen <b>15</b> of the upper milling chamber <b>34</b> is larger than the diameter of the apertures <b>17</b> in the screen <b>15</b> of the lower milling chamber <b>35</b>. Once the substrate <b>22</b> is broken down to a particle size which allows a passage through the aperture <b>17</b> of the screen <b>15</b> of the upper milling chamber <b>34</b> by gravity, it will fall into the lower milling chamber <b>35</b>. The particles of the substrate <b>22</b> in the lower milling chamber <b>35</b> are again refined. Once the particles have a size small enough to pass through the apertures <b>17</b> in the screen <b>15</b> of the lower milling chamber <b>35</b> the particles of the substrate <b>22</b> will fall into the catch basin <b>21</b>. Then the particles of the substrate <b>22</b> will fall or slide further into the collection vessel <b>11</b> under the influence of gravity and movement from the actuator. This ensures, that only particles of a size smaller than the diameter of the apertures <b>17</b> of the lower milling chamber <b>35</b> are collected. Furthermore, it is ensured that the substrate <b>22</b> is separated from the milling balls <b>14</b> in the milling process. These two aspects are not achievable with a conventional milling jar, where only by statistical probability and the original quality of the substrate <b>22</b> a particle size is determined. The aforesaid separation of milling balls <b>14</b> from the substrate <b>22</b> is also not possible with a conventional milling jar.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">During the milling operation the stopcock <b>24</b> of the outlet <b>32</b> of the catch basin <b>21</b> and the stopcock <b>24</b> of the collection vessel <b>11</b> are open, such that the refined substrate particles <b>22</b> can fall through the outlet <b>32</b> into the collection vessel <b>11</b>. Once the substrate <b>22</b> is entirely refined and has passed the upper milling chamber <b>34</b>, the lower milling chamber <b>35</b>, the catch basin <b>21</b> and is collected in the collection vessel <b>11</b> the stopcock <b>24</b> of the outlet <b>32</b> is closed and the stopcock <b>24</b> of the collection vessel <b>11</b> is closed. After closing of the stopcock <b>24</b> of the catch basin <b>21</b> and after closing of the stopcock <b>24</b> of the collection vessel <b>11</b>, the collection vessel <b>11</b> can be screwed of the catch basin <b>21</b>. With the closed stopcock <b>24</b> the refined substrate <b>22</b> remains in a vacuum and is sealed from the outside <b>39</b>. This has the advantage, that an undesirable reaction between the particles of the substrate <b>22</b> and the environment, in particular air is avoided. This also has the advantage that a contamination of the environment outside <b>39</b> with the refined particles of the substrate <b>22</b> is avoided.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an alternative operation the sealing screw <b>27</b> is not screwed into the taper <b>26</b>. This allows that remaining particles of the substrate <b>22</b> can be flushed into the collection vessel <b>11</b> by setting the valve <b>20</b> of the orifice <b>19</b> in the lid <b>12</b> from the close position of the valve <b>20</b> to the open position of the valve <b>20</b>. In the open position of the valve <b>20</b> air from the outside <b>39</b> flows into the housing <b>10</b> due to the low pressure from the vacuum. With inflowing air remaining particles of the substrate <b>22</b> are flushed towards and into the collection vessel <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The orifice <b>19</b> in particular in the lid <b>12</b> may feature an adapter arrangement with an exchangeable coupling part for a tubing with different sizes.
