More specifically, the present disclosure describes devices, systems, and methods related to improving the viability of a premature fetus outside of the womb. According to one aspect, the present disclosure relates to improving viability of premature fetuses at a stage of development prior to 28 weeks gestation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Extreme prematurity is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality in the United States, with over one third of all infant deaths and one half of cerebral palsy diagnoses attributed to prematurity. The 2010 Center for Disease Control National Vital Statistics Report notes birth rates at a gestational age of less than 28 weeks in the United States over roughly the past decade have remained stable at approximately 0.7%, or 30,000 births annually. Similarly, birth rates at gestational ages 28-32 weeks over the past decade in the United States have been stable at 1.2%, or 50,000 births annually.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Premature birth may occur due to any one of a multitude of reasons. For example, premature birth may occur spontaneously due to preterm rupture of the membranes (PROM), structural uterine features such as shortened cervix, secondary to traumatic or infectious stimuli, or due to multiple gestation. Preterm labor and delivery is also frequently encountered in the context of fetoscopy or fetal surgery, where instrumentation of the uterus often stimulates uncontrolled labor despite maximal tocolytic therapy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Respiratory failure represents the most common and challenging problem associated with extreme prematurity, as gas exchange in critically preterm neonates is impaired by structural and functional immaturity of the lungs. Advances in neonatal intensive care have achieved improved survival and pushed the limits of viability of preterm neonates to 22 to 24 weeks gestation, which marks the transition from the canalicular to the saccular phase of lung development. Although survival has become possible, there is still a high rate of chronic lung disease and other complications of organ immaturity, particularly in fetuses born prior to 28 weeks gestation. The development of a system that could support normal fetal growth and organ maturation for even a few weeks could significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of extreme prematurity, and improve quality of life in survivors.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The development of an &#x201c;artificial placenta&#x201d; has been the subject of investigation for over 50 years with little success. Previous attempts to achieve adequate oxygenation of the fetus in animal models have employed traditional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with pump support, and have been limited by circulatory overload and cardiac failure in treated animals. The known systems have suffered from unacceptable complications, including: 1) progressive circulatory failure due to after-load or pre-load imbalance imposed on the fetal heart by oxygenator resistance or by circuits incorporating various pumps; and 2) contamination and fetal sepsis.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, a system and method configured to provide extracorporeal support for a premature fetus, or fetuses (preterm or term) with inadequate respiratory gas exchange to support life, due to a spectrum of conditions/disorders, may improve viability.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the disclosure, a chamber configured to enclose a fetus within an interior space of the chamber is disclosed. The chamber includes a housing including a first shell and a second shell, the first shell and the second shell cooperate to at least partially define the interior space, the housing configured such that the second shell is movable with respect to the first shell from a first position to a second position, such that in the first position the chamber is in an open configuration, and in the second position the chamber is in a closed configuration. The chamber further includes a stop assembly including a clamp and an actuator, the clamp positioned in the interior space when the housing is in the closed configuration, the actuator coupled to the clamp such that movement of the actuator moves the clamp, the actuator positioned at least partially outside the interior space when the housing is in the closed configuration. When the chamber is in the open configuration the first shell and the second shell cooperatively define an opening into the interior space, the opening defines a first distance measured from a portion of the first shell to a portion of the second shell, when the chamber is in the closed configuration the opening defines a second distance measured from the portion of the first shell to the portion of the second shell, and the second distance is less than the first distance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the disclosure, a chamber configured to enclose a fetus within an interior space of the chamber is disclosed. The chamber includes an outer wall that defines an outer boundary of the interior space, an inner wall that extends from the outer wall into the interior space such that the inner wall partially defines both a first portion of the interior space and a second portion of the interior space, a clamp positioned within the second portion, the clamp movable in a direction from one of the outer wall and the inner wall toward the other of the outer wall and the inner wall, and an actuator operably coupled to the clamp such that movement of the actuator moves the clamp in the direction.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the disclosure, a system configured to provide oxygen to a fetus is disclosed. The system includes a cart including a housing that defines a housing interior space, a chamber defining a chamber interior space that is sized to receive the fetus, a first fluid circuit including a container of a liquid, a pump configured to move the liquid from the source to the chamber, the pump further configured to move the liquid from the chamber to a reservoir, a second fluid circuit including an oxygenator configured to transfer oxygen to the fetus. The system defines a first configuration in which both the chamber and the oxygenator are positioned outside of the housing interior space, and the chamber is disconnected from the first fluid circuit, and the system defines a second configuration in which both the chamber and the oxygenator are positioned within the housing interior space, and the chamber is in fluid connection with the first fluid circuit.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments of the application, will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings.

The inclusion of a volume adjustment assembly <b>210</b> allows adjustment of the volume of the interior space <b>102</b> while the chamber <b>100</b> is in the closed configuration. A chamber <b>100</b> capable of varying the volume of the interior space <b>102</b> while the chamber <b>100</b> is in the closed configuration enables the chamber <b>100</b> to adapt to the fetus <b>2</b> as the fetus <b>2</b> develops, for example the volume of the interior space <b>102</b> can be increased to accommodate the increasing size of the fetus <b>2</b> as the fetus matures, without the need to remove the fetus <b>2</b> from the interior space <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a method of moving a premature fetus <b>2</b> from the uterus of a patient <b>6</b> to an ex utero environment is provided. The method includes the step of accessing the umbilical cord <b>4</b> of the fetus <b>2</b>. According to one aspect of the disclosure, the accessing step includes making an opening in the uterus of the patient <b>6</b> while maintaining uteroplacental perfusion and flow through the umbilical cord. Once the uterus is open and umbilical cord exposed, the method includes the steps of cannulating the umbilical cord vessels (<b>2</b> arteries and one vein), connecting the cannulas to an oxygenator <b>60</b>, and then clamping the umbilical cord and severing the umbilical cord <b>4</b>. The severing step may include the step of separating the fetus from the placenta by clamping and dividing the umbilical cord on the placental side of the cord relative to the cannulas. The connecting step includes the step of attaching the fetus <b>2</b> to the oxygenator <b>60</b> such that deoxygenated blood is delivered from the fetus <b>2</b> to the oxygenator <b>60</b>, and oxygenated blood is delivered from the oxygenator <b>60</b> to the fetus <b>2</b>.

The system being configured such that the chamber <b>100</b> is removable from the cart <b>12</b>, for example to a location closer to the patient <b>6</b> than the cart <b>12</b> would be able to go, may reduce the amount of time the fetus <b>2</b> is exposed to an ex utero environment during the method, and reduce the potential for contamination, thereby reducing the risk to the fetus <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The method further includes, after the cannulating step, the step of positioning the fetus <b>2</b> within the chamber interior space <b>102</b>, and after the positioning step, the step of transitioning the chamber <b>100</b> from the open configuration to the closed configuration. The method may further include the step of attaching the chamber <b>100</b>, with the fetus <b>2</b> positioned in the chamber interior space <b>102</b>, to the cart <b>12</b>. The method may further include, after the transitioning step, the step of pumping a fluid, for example a sterile fluid, into the chamber interior space <b>102</b>.

Blood flow may be measured by ultrasound.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure, the heart of the fetus <b>2</b> drives blood flow through the second portion <b>502</b> of the second fluid circuit <b>400</b>, such that the second portion <b>502</b> of the second fluid circuit <b>400</b> is devoid of a pump. In other words, according to one aspect of the disclosure, the second portion <b>502</b> of the second fluid circuit <b>400</b> is a pumpless circuit. The use of a pumpless system avoids exposure of the heart of the fetus <b>2</b> to excess preload encountered in non-pulsatile pump-assisted circuits. The pumpless system also permits intrinsic fetal circulatory regulation of flow dynamics. The oxygenator <b>60</b> preferably has very low resistance, low priming volume, low transmembrane pressure drops, and provides efficient gas exchange. The first portion <b>500</b> of the second fluid circuit <b>400</b> may be driven by an external pressure source.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In accordance with one embodiment, the oxygenator <b>60</b> has a pressure drop of less than about 50 mmHg or about 40 mmHg at 1.5 liters per minute of blood flow. In a particular embodiment, the priming volume of the oxygenator <b>60</b> is less than about 100 milliliters and in particular is less than about 85 milliliters. In a particular embodiment, the oxygenator <b>60</b> has a blood flow range up to about 2.0 liters per minute, about 2.5 liters per minute, about 2.8 liters per minute, or greater. In a particular embodiment, the oxygenator <b>60</b> has a gas transfer rate of about 150 milliliters per minute, about 160 milliliters per minute, about 180 milliliters per minute, or greater for oxygen. In a particular embodiment, the oxygenator <b>60</b> is a hollow fiber membrane oxygenator (for example, but not limited to, a polymethyl pentene hollow fiber membrane oxygenator). The oxygenator <b>60</b> may be lined with anti-clotting measures/compounds such as immobilized polypeptide and/or heparin).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The system <b>10</b> may be configured for use with fetuses, including term and preterm fetuses. The preterm fetus may be a premature fetus (for example, less than 37 weeks estimated gestational age, particularly 28 to 32 weeks estimated gestational age), extreme premature fetuses (24 to 28 weeks estimated gestational age), or pre-viable fetuses (20 to 24 weeks estimated gestational age). The gestation periods are provided for humans, though corresponding preterm fetuses of other animals may be used. In a particular embodiment, the preterm fetus has no underlying congenital disease. In a particular embodiment, the term or preterm fetus has limited capacity for pulmonary gas exchange, for example, due to pulmonary hypoplasia or a congenital anomaly affecting lung development, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia. In a particular embodiment, the subject is a preterm or term neonate awaiting lung transplantation, for example, due to congenital pulmonary disease (e.g., bronchoalveolar dysplasia, surfactant protein B deficiency, and the like). Such transplantation surgeries are currently rarely performed in the United States. However, the number of transplantation surgeries may be increased with the more stable method for pulmonary support provided by the instant invention. The fetus <b>2</b> may also be a candidate for ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) delivery, including patients with severe airway lesions and a long expected course before definitive resection. The fetus <b>2</b> may also be a fetal surgical or fetoscopic procedure patient, particularly with preterm labor precipitating early delivery. According to one aspect of the disclosure the system <b>10</b> is configured such that the fetus <b>2</b> may be maintained in the system <b>10</b> for as long as needed (for example, for days, weeks or months, until the fetus <b>2</b> is capable of life without the system <b>10</b>).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">It will be appreciated that the foregoing description provides examples of the disclosed system and methods.
