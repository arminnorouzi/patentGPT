The computer program consisting of a code sequence also is referred to as software or software program or application throughout this specification. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium that stores the executable computer program consisting of a code sequence or software program also is referred to as host internet server throughout this specification.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More particularly, the invention is a computer software program that facilitates potential juror questioning and jury selection through the internet with a website. The invention's internet based website has individual programs respectively designed for the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the Court Reporter, the Court Administrator, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, the Master User, and each Potential Juror in the jury pool. Each said individual program also is referred to as a function or a database.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This summary is limited to describing the invention's process of merely questioning potential jurors through its internet website. If the invention is used to merely question potential jurors through its website, it is intended to be used in conjunction with the conventional in-court jury selection process and is intended to be implemented before the conventional in-court jury selection process takes place which allows the judge and/or attorneys to question and analyze all potential jurors summoned for a jury trial through the invention's website well before the in-court jury selection process begins. Ultimately, if the invention is used to merely question potential jurors before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins, the invention produces an all video supplemental juror questionnaire through its website.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In any typical criminal jury trial, Courts generally schedule jury trials approximately 60-90 days after the defendant's arraignment and plea of not guilty. In any typical civil jury trial, Courts generally schedule jury trials approximately 60-90 days after the deadline for pre-trial motions to be submitted. The invention's process of questioning potential juror's through its website is intended to begin about 2 months before the in-court jury selection process begins. As previously stated, the invention's internet based website has individual programs respectively designed for the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, the Court Reporter, the Court Administrator, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, the Master User, each Potential Juror in the jury pool, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention contains a Master User program. A master user is any judge, clerk, or employee in a courthouse that can be trusted to allow and deny court administrators access to the invention's website. The invention provides the Master User with a confidential code to access the Master User program in the website. A Master User logs into the Master User program in the website by entering his/her confidential code. Through the website, the Master User for a particular courthouse types the name, cellular phone number, email address, and assigns a confidential code for each court administrator assigned to a judge in a courthouse to permit such court administrators to access the invention's website and complete their required functions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">When a jury trial is scheduled and the judge elects to use the invention's website and process, the Court Administrator assigned to the particular judge logs into the invention's website and enters the name, cellular phone number, email address, and assigns a confidential code for the judge, court reporter, plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and plaintiff if the case is civil. Once the court administrator enters such information, the judge, court reporter, plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff will then be allowed to access the invention's website. Also, once the court administrator enters such information, email messages are automatically sent to the judge, court reporter, plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff. The email message sent to the judge informs the judge of his/her confidential code and instructs the judge to log into his/her program in the website and complete the following: 1) Set the deadlines for the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney to submit their typed and video recorded jury selection questions through the invention's website; 2) Set the date and time for an in-court hearing for the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney to object to each other's typed and video recorded jury selection questions; 3) Set the deadline for the potential jurors to have finished responding to the video recorded and typed jury selection questions; 4) Set the date and time and enter the location for the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff to view privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present; 5) Type in the date and time the in-court jury selection process is scheduled to begin; and 6) Enter the total number of potential jurors who are to be summoned for jury duty. Such email message also instructs the judge that after he/she completes such tasks he/she must log into the website and submit an order prohibiting disclosure of potential juror questionnaires through the website to prohibit all of the participants who are allowed to view the potential juror questionnaires through the website from showing or disclosing any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone and to prohibit such participants from playing any video and audio recorded response of any potential juror to anyone. The purpose of the judge submitting such order prohibiting disclosure of potential juror questionnaires through the website is to protect potential juror privacy. Such email message also instructs the judge that after he/she completes such tasks he/she may submit typed and video recorded jury selection questions through the invention's website and instructs the judge that if he/she does not desire to submit typed and video recorded jury selection questions through the invention's website or is in a jurisdiction that only allows attorneys to question potential jurors in the in-court jury selection process, he/she has to log into the judge's program for the respective case and select &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; without submitting typed and video recorded jury selection questions to allow the Plaintiff Attorney to submit his/her typed and video recorded jury selection questions through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The email messages sent to the court reporter, plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff informs each of them of their respective confidential code and instructs them to familiarize themselves with their respective programs in the invention's website. Also, once the court administrator enters such information, text messages are automatically sent to the judge, court reporter, plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff. The text messages alert them that their participation is required and instructs them to check their personal email accounts for an instructive email message.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Once the judge receives his/her email message, he/she logs into the invention's website and completes the following: 1) Sets the deadlines for the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney to submit their typed and video recorded jury selection questions through the invention's website; 2) Sets the date and time for an in-court hearing for the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney to object to each other's typed and video recorded jury selection questions; 3) Sets the deadline for the potential jurors to have finished responding to the video recorded and typed jury selection questions; 4) Sets the date and time and enters the location for the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff to view privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present; 5) Types in the date and time the in-court jury selection process is scheduled to begin; and 6) Enters the total number of potential jurors who are to be summoned for jury duty. The judge is instructed to set the plaintiff attorney's deadline before the defense attorney's deadline to prevent the attorneys from duplicating their questions. Thus, if the defense attorney's deadline is later than the plaintiff attorney's deadline, the defense attorney would be allowed to review the plaintiff attorney's questions which will prevent the defense attorney from duplicating the plaintiff attorney's questions. Also, the invention's website instructs the judge to set the date and time for the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff to view privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present before the date the in-court jury selection process is scheduled to begin to give the parties time to process the privatized video recorded responses of the potential jurors before the in-court jury selection process begins.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">After the judge completes such tasks, the judge then submits an order prohibiting disclosure of potential juror questionnaires through the website. Thus, in the judge's main menu of functions, the judge has an option to issue an order prohibiting disclosure of potential juror questionnaires that will be shown to all of the participants who are allowed to view the potential juror questionnaires before they view such questionnaires through the invention's website. When the judge selects such option, the invention's website provides the judge with a template of such order. The template essentially states that potential jurors have a substantial privacy interest in their responses to the questionnaire and none of the participants are allowed to show or disclose any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone and are not allowed to play any video and audio recorded response of any potential juror to anyone. It also will state that a participant shall be held in contempt of court if he/she shows or discloses any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone or plays any video and audio recorded response of any potential juror to anyone, and the possible punishment(s) for being held in contempt of court could be jail time and/or a fine. The judge will be able to customize the order template by modifying, editing, and/or deleting any of the information in the order template, and he/she may add any information to the order template. The possible punishment(s) of jail time and/or a fine in the order inevitably will make an impression on the participants of the seriousness of the situation and will help deter participants from disclosing any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">After the judge completes such tasks, he/she may submit typed and video recorded jury selection questions through the invention's website. A portion of jurisdictions will allow both the judge and the attorneys to submit typed and video recorded questions through the invention's website while another portion of jurisdictions will only allow the attorneys to submit typed and video recorded questions through the invention's website. In jurisdictions that will allow both the judge and the attorneys to submit typed and video recorded questions through the invention's website, the process of jury questioning through the invention's website begins with the Judge typing his/her jury selection questions through the invention's website in his/her own respective program. Thus, when the Judge logs into his/her respective program in the invention's website to type his/her jury selection questions, the website instructs the Judge to type his/her own jury selection questions into the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">After the Judge types his/her jury selection questions into his/her respective program in the website, the Judge then orally reads each of his/her typed jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the website on a personal computer, tablet, or a cellular phone making an individual video recording of each of his/her respective jury selection questions. Thus, when the Judge orally reads each of his/her own typed jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the website, only one question will appear on the screen at a time for the Judge to orally read in front of a webcam. For example, when the Judge begins to orally read his/her jury selection questions into the website, only the first question of his/her jury selection questions will appear on the screen. The Judge then orally reads the question in front of a webcam and into the website making an individual video recording of the Judge reading the first question. After the Judge finishes orally reading the first question of his/her jury selection questions, the Judge selects Orally Read Next Question in the website, and only his/her second typed jury selection question appears on the screen. The Judge then orally reads his/her second typed question in front of a webcam and into the website making an individual video recording of the Judge orally reading his/her second jury selection question. The Judge continues this pattern until he/she has produced an individual video recording of each of his/her jury selection questions. Ultimately, the Judge makes an individual video recording for each typed question the Judge orally reads in front of a webcam. When the Judge orally reads each question in front of a webcam, the Judge's video recording will appear and play on the Judge's screen on the website at the same time the Judge orally reads each question so the Judge can monitor the quality of each of his/her video recordings. Ultimately, the invention's code sequence automatically pairs each video recording of the Judge with its respective type formatted question. If the Judge is not satisfied with a video recording he/she made for any particular type formatted question, the invention allows him/her to delete it and make a new video recording. When the Judge is satisfied with all of his/her video recordings and type formatted questions, the website instructs the Judge to select a &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; option. Upon selecting the &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; option, the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of any portion of any video recording that the Judge deleted in his/her respective program, and the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of any typed formatted letter that became deleted when the Judge word processed his/her type formatted questions. After the invention automatically deletes all of such metadata, the invention makes the Judge's video recordings and type formatted questions viewable through the website to the programs of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, the Court Reporter, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff. In the jurisdictions that will only allow the attorneys to submit typed and video recorded questions through the invention's website, the process of jury questioning through the invention's website begins with the Judge logging into his/her respective program in the invention's website and simply selects the &#x201c;submit&#x201d; option without typing any questions or make any video recordings.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Upon the Judge completing his/her above said tasks of typing jury selection questions and making an individual video recording for each of his/her typed jury selection questions or upon the Judge simply selecting the &#x201c;submit&#x201d; option without typing any questions or making any video recordings, the invention's process automatically sends email messages to the personal email accounts of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff that they may view the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge and view the Judge's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions through the website in their respective programs if the judge submitted any, and they are instructed the Plaintiff Attorney must now log into the website and review the Judge's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions if the judge submitted any, and type his/her own jury selection questions into the website and produce video recordings of him/her orally reading each of his/her typed jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the website on a personal computer, tablet, or a cellular phone. If the case is civil, the email message further instructs the Plaintiff Attorney to make a video recording of the Plaintiff through the website by having the Plaintiff sit in front of a webcam on a personal computer or a cellular phone in a silent and stationary state which will be viewed by the potential jurors through the website when they respond to the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions. The email message further instructs them that the Plaintiff may now submit perspective jury selection questions to the Plaintiff Attorney through the website to be used as recommendations before the Plaintiff Attorney submits his/her jury selection questions through the website. Also, upon the Judge completing his/her above said tasks, the invention's process automatically sends the Court Reporter an email message to his/her personal email account instructing him/her to print through the website the Judge's typed jury selection questions; the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge; and all email messages sent to all of the parties and place the printed copies in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes. Such email message further instructs the Court Reporter to log onto the website to transcribe every word in each of the Judge's video recordings into a typed format and print such transcriptions and place them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes only if the judge submitted any video recordings and typed jury selection questions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, the invention provides an optional feature where instead of having the Court Reporter log into the website to transcribe every word the invention has the capability of transcribing and converting all audible words of each captured audible and video recording of the Judge into a tangible typed format automatically using the code sequence in communication with the server. Thus, the invention transcribes all audible words of each captured audible and video recording of the Judge into a tangible typed format by the code sequence having voice recognition capability which parses the audio data to identify recognizable wave forms and sounds that correspond to words and makes the corresponding words appear in a typed format. If such feature is used, the email message will instruct the Court Reporter to review each transcription in his/her respective program and review each corresponding video recording of the Judge and make any typographical corrections to the transcriptions and print such transcriptions and place them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes only if the judge submitted any video recordings and typed jury selection questions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">After the Judge submits through the website the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors that he/she set and entered, the invention automatically sends an email message to the personal email account of the respective Court Administrator assigned to the particular judge, and the email message instructs the Court Administrator to log into his/her Court Administrator's program in the invention's website, view the total number of potential jurors making up the jury pool that was set and submitted by the Judge, and enter the name and address of each potential juror making up the total number potential jurors in the jury pool, and assign a confidential code for each of such potential jurors.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally, upon the Judge completing his/her above said tasks, the invention sends text messages to the personal cellular phones of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, the Court Reporter, the Court Administrator, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff advising them that their participation is now required through the invention's website, and they must now check their personal email accounts for instructive email messages and complete their respective tasks through the website.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention allows the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney to hire their own respective Professional Jury Consultant through its website to provide jury selection questions through its website to their respective attorneys to be used as recommendations before their respective attorneys submit their jury selection questions through its website. Thus, the invention provides the Plaintiff Attorney's program and the Defense Attorney's program with a list of every participating professional jury consultant and professional jury consultant firm. If the Plaintiff Attorney selects and retains a professional jury consultant through the invention's website, the retained professional jury consultant will no longer appear on the list of professional jury consultants in the Defense Attorney's program and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">If the Plaintiff Attorney hired a Professional Jury Consultant through the website to provide jury selection questions to the Plaintiff Attorney through the website, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Plaintiff Attorney's selected Professional Jury Consultant instructing him/her to provide the Plaintiff Attorney with jury selection questions through the website upon the Judge completing his/her above said tasks. Additionally, if the Plaintiff Attorney hired a Professional Jury Consultant through the website to provide jury selection questions to the Plaintiff Attorney through the website, the invention sends a text message to the personal cellular phone of the Plaintiff Attorney's selected Professional Jury Consultant advising him/her that his/her participation is now required through the website, and he/she must now check his/her personal email account for instructive email messages and complete his/her respective tasks through the website.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Upon the Judge completing his/her above said tasks, the Plaintiff, if the case is civil, may log into his/her respective program in the website and review the Judge's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions if the Judge submitted any, and type jury selection questions through the website and submit them to the Plaintiff Attorney's respective program in the website to be used as recommendations by the Plaintiff Attorney. Also, in the Plaintiffs program in the website, the Plaintiff will be shown the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge and will be advised to submit his/her recommended type formatted jury selection questions to the Plaintiff Attorney's Program at least one week before the Plaintiff Attorney's said deadline.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">If the Plaintiff Attorney hired a Professional Jury Consultant through the website for the purpose of obtaining recommended jury selection questions, the Plaintiff Attorney's selected Professional Jury Consultant may log into his/her respective program in the website and review the Judge's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions if the Judge submitted any, and type jury selection questions through the website and submit them to the Plaintiff Attorney's respective program in the website to be used as recommendations by the Plaintiff Attorney. Also, in the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's program in the website, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant will be shown the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge and will be advised to submit his/her recommended type formatted jury selection questions to the Plaintiff Attorney's Program at least one week before the Plaintiff Attorney's deadline.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program through the website and prints the Judge's typed jury selection questions if the judge submitted any; prints the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge; and prints all email messages sent to all of the parties and is instructed by the website to place the Judge's printed jury selection questions if any; the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge; and all email messages sent to all of the parties in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes. Also, only if the judge submitted any video recordings through the website, the Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program through the website and transcribes every word in each of the Judge's video recordings into a typed format and prints such transcriptions and places them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, as previously stated, the invention provides an optional feature where instead of having the Court Reporter log into the website to transcribe every word the invention has the capability of transcribing and converting all audible words of each captured audible and video recording of the Judge into a tangible typed format automatically using the code sequence in communication with the server. Thus, if the feature is used, the invention transcribes all audible words of each captured audible and video recording of the Judge into a tangible typed format by the code sequence having voice recognition capability which parses the audio data to identify recognizable wave forms and sounds that correspond to words and makes the corresponding words appear in a typed format. If such feature is used, the Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program through the website, reviews each transcription produced by the code sequence in his/her respective program, reviews each corresponding video recording of the Judge, makes any typographical corrections to the transcriptions, prints such transcriptions, and places them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes only if the judge submitted any video recordings and typed jury selection questions.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">If the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant submit typed jury selection questions through the website to the Plaintiff Attorney's respective program in the website, the Plaintiff Attorney, through the website, views the Plaintiffs and his/her Professional Jury Consultant's recommended typed jury selection questions and may delete, edit, and keep any of such questions and type any of his/her own additional jury selection questions. The website instructs the Plaintiff Attorney to review the Judge's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions if the judge submitted any, before submitting his/her own jury selection questions to prevent duplication of questions on the questionnaire. Also, in the Plaintiff Attorney's program in the website, the Plaintiff Attorney will be shown the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge and will be advised to submit his/her typed and video recorded jury selection questions on or before the Plaintiff Attorney's deadline.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">After the Plaintiff Attorney types and/or edits his/her jury selection questions into his/her respective program in the website, the Plaintiff Attorney then orally reads each of his/her typed jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the website on a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone making an individual video recording of each of his/her respective jury selection questions. Thus, when the Plaintiff Attorney orally reads each of his/her own typed jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the website, only one typed question will appear on the screen at a time for the Plaintiff Attorney to orally read in front of a webcam. For example, when the Plaintiff Attorney begins to orally read his/her typed jury selection questions into the website, only the first question on his/her list of typed jury selection questions will appear on the screen. The Plaintiff Attorney then orally reads the typed question in front of a webcam and into the website making an individual video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney reading the first typed question.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">After the Plaintiff Attorney finishes orally reading the first question on his/her list of jury selection questions, the Plaintiff Attorney selects Orally Read Next Question in the website, and only the second typed question on his/her list of jury selection questions appears on the screen. The Plaintiff Attorney then orally reads the second typed question in front of a webcam and into the website making an individual video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney orally reading his/her second jury selection question. The Plaintiff Attorney continues this pattern until he/she has produced an individual video recording of each of his/her jury selection questions. Ultimately, the Plaintiff Attorney makes an individual recording for each typed question the Plaintiff Attorney orally reads in front of a webcam. When the Plaintiff Attorney orally reads each typed question in front of a webcam, the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording will appear and play on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen on the website at the same time the Plaintiff Attorney orally reads each typed question so the Plaintiff Attorney can monitor the quality of each of his/her video recordings. Ultimately, the invention's code sequence automatically pairs each video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney with its respective type formatted question. If the Plaintiff Attorney is not satisfied with a video recording he/she made for any particular type formatted question, the invention allows him/her to delete it and make a new video recording.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, if the case is civil, the Plaintiff Attorney, in his/her respective program, makes a video recording of the Plaintiff through the invention's website by having the Plaintiff sit in a silent and stationary state in front of a webcam on a personal computer or a cellular phone. If the Plaintiff Attorney is not satisfied with the video recording of the Plaintiff sitting in a silent and stationary state, the invention allows the Plaintiff Attorney to delete it and make a new video recording of the Plaintiff sitting in a silent and stationary state. After the video recording of the Plaintiff is captured into the invention's website, the invention's code sequence automatically deletes only the audio recorded portion of the Plaintiffs video recording to where no sound from the Plaintiffs video recording can be heard through the invention's website while the visual video footage of the Plaintiff's video recording still remains to be viewable and playable. In the alternative, after the video recording of the Plaintiff is captured into the invention's website, the invention's code sequence automatically mutes the video recording of the Plaintiff to where the audio recorded portion of the Plaintiff's video recording cannot be heard through the invention's website. Also, after the video recording of the Plaintiff is captured into the invention's website, the invention's code sequence automatically changes the presentable state of each video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney paired with its respective type formatted question that is included in the second half of the overall total number of the Plaintiff Attorney's type formatted questions. Thus, for each video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney that is paired with its respective type formatted question that is included in the second half of the overall total number of the Plaintiff Attorney's type formatted questions, the code sequence automatically calculates the total number of questions making up the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's type formatted questions. For example, if the Plaintiff Attorney had a total of 20 type formatted questions, the code sequence would automatically calculate that there are 10 type formatted questions making up the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's type formatted questions. After making such a calculation, the code sequence then automatically copies the video recording of the Plaintiff sitting in a silent and stationary state 10 times. After making such copies, the code sequence then automatically removes only the video recording portion of each of the Plaintiff Attorney's video and audio recordings that are paired with a type formatted question that is included in the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's type formatted questions and replaces the removed portion in each video recording with a copy of the video recording depicting the Plaintiff in a stationary and silent state while the audio recording portion of the Plaintiff Attorney still remains to be playable at the same time with the video recording of the Plaintiff and the paired type formatted question still remains to be viewable. To clarify, for each of the video and audio recordings of the Plaintiff Attorney that is paired with a type formatted question that is included in the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's type formatted questions, the code sequence automatically removes only the video recording portion that depicts the Plaintiff Attorney in each of such video recordings and replaces it with a copy of the video recording depicting the Plaintiff in a stationary and silent state while the respective audio recording portion of the Plaintiff Attorney still remains to be playable at the same time with the video recording of the Plaintiff and the respective paired type formatted question still remains to be viewable.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">After the code sequence automatically changes the presentable state of each video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney paired with its respective type formatted question that is included in the second half of the overall total number of the Plaintiff Attorney's type formatted questions as described above, the first half of the Plaintiff Attorney's video and audio recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions will not be altered or changed at all. For example, if the Plaintiff Attorney made a separate video recording for each of his/her type formatted questions for a total of 20 type formatted questions, the type formatted questions numbered 1 through 10 will appear paired with its respective video and audio recording of the Plaintiff Attorney, and each video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney remains to be playable while its respective type formatted question still remains to be viewable. After the code sequence automatically changes the presentable state of each video and audio recording of the Plaintiff Attorney paired with its type formatted question for each respective question numbered 11 through 20 as described above, the copy of the video recording depicting the Plaintiff in a stationary and silent state appears paired with its respective type formatted question while the respective audio recording portion of the Plaintiff Attorney still remains to be playable at the same time with the copy of the video recording of the Plaintiff and the respective paired type formatted question still remains to be viewable for each respective question numbered 11 through 20.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, if the Plaintiff Attorney's total number of type formatted questions that are each paired with a respective video recording is an odd number like 21, for example, the code sequence will deem the second half of the 21 questions to be 12 through 21. In such a scenario, the code sequence would only change the presentable state of each video and audio recording of the Plaintiff Attorney paired with its respective type formatted question as described above for questions 12 through 21. Thus, the code sequence deems the second half of an odd total number of type formatted questions paired with its respective video recording to be the smaller half of such odd total number.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the Plaintiff Attorney is satisfied with all of his/her video recordings, the Plaintiffs video recording, and type formatted questions, the website instructs the Plaintiff Attorney to select a &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; option. Upon selecting the &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; option, the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of any portion of any video recording that the Plaintiff Attorney deleted in his/her respective program, and the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of any typed formatted letter that became deleted when the Plaintiff Attorney word processed his/her type formatted questions. After the invention automatically deletes all of such metadata, the invention makes the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings and type formatted questions viewable through the website to the programs of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, the Court Reporter, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">After the Judge completes his/her above said tasks, the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff may log into their respective programs in the website and view the Judge's video recordings, and the Judge's typed jury selection questions only if the Judge submitted any video recordings and typed jury selection questions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">After the Judge submits through the website the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors that he/she set and entered, the Court Administrator assigned to the particular judge logs into his/her Court Administrator's program in the invention's website and views the total number of potential jurors making up the jury pool that was set and submitted by the Judge, and enters the name and address of each potential juror making up the total number potential jurors in the jury pool, and assigns a confidential code for each of such potential jurors. Once the court administrator enters such information for each potential juror and assigns a confidential code to each potential juror, each potential juror making up the jury pool will then be allowed to access the invention's website. However, no potential juror will be able to access the invention's website until they receive their respective summons and confidential code in the mail.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Upon the Plaintiff Attorney completing his/her said tasks, the invention automatically sends email messages to the personal email accounts of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff that they may view the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted jury selection questions and if the case is civil, view the copies of the Plaintiff's video recording of the Plaintiff sitting in a silent and stationary state with the audio recordings of the Plaintiff Attorney paired with their respective type formatted questions through the website in their respective programs, and they are instructed that the Defense Attorney must now log onto the website and review the Judge's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions, review the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions, review the copies of the Plaintiff's video recording of the Plaintiff sitting in a silent and stationary state with the audio recordings of the Plaintiff Attorney paired with their respective type formatted questions, type his/her own jury selection questions into the website, and produce video recordings of him/her orally reading each of his/her jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the website on a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone before the defense attorney's deadline. The email message further instructs the Defense Attorney to make a video recording of the Defendant through the website by having the Defendant sit in a silent and stationary state in front of a webcam on a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone which will be viewed by the potential jurors through the website when they respond to the second half of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions. The email message further instructs them that the Defendant may now submit perspective jury selection questions to the Defense Attorney's respective program through the website to be used as recommendations before the Defense Attorney submits his/her jury selection questions through the website.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Also, upon the Plaintiff Attorney completing the above said tasks, the invention automatically sends the Court Reporter an email message to his/her personal email account instructing him/her to print through the website the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions and all email messages sent to all of the parties and place the printed copies in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes. Such email message further instructs the Court Reporter to log onto the website to transcribe every word in each of the Plaintiff Attorney's video and audio recordings into a typed format and print such transcriptions and place them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">However, as described previously, the invention provides an optional feature where instead of having the Court Reporter log into the website to transcribe every word the invention has the capability of transcribing and converting all audible words of each captured audible and video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney into a tangible typed format automatically using the code sequence in communication with the server. Thus, the invention transcribes all audible words of each captured audible and video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney into a tangible typed format by the code sequence having voice recognition capability which parses the audio data to identify recognizable wave forms and sounds that correspond to words and makes the corresponding words appear in a typed format. If such feature is used, the email message will instruct the Court Reporter to review each transcription in his/her respective program and review each corresponding video and audio recording of the Plaintiff Attorney and make any typographical corrections to the transcriptions and print such transcriptions and place them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes. Additionally, upon the Plaintiff Attorney completing the above said tasks, the invention sends text messages to the personal cellular phones of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, the Court Reporter, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff advising them that their participation is now required through the website, and they must now check their personal email accounts for instructive email messages and complete their respective tasks through the website.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the Defense Attorney hired a Professional Jury Consultant through the website to provide jury selection questions to him/her through the website, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Defense Attorney's selected Professional Jury Consultant instructing him/her to provide the Defense Attorney with jury selection questions through the website upon the Plaintiff Attorney completing his/her above said tasks. Additionally, if the Defense Attorney hired a Professional Jury Consultant through the website to provide jury selection questions to the Defense Attorney through the website, the invention sends a text message to the personal cellular phone of the Defense Attorney's selected Professional Jury Consultant advising him/her that his/her participation is now required through the website, and he/she must now check his/her personal email account for instructive email messages and complete his/her respective tasks through the website.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Upon the Plaintiff Attorney completing his/her above said tasks, the Defendant may log into his/her respective program in the website, review the Judge's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions, review the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions, review the copies of the Plaintiff's video recording of the Plaintiff sitting in a silent and stationary state with the audio recordings of the Plaintiff Attorney paired with their respective type formatted questions, type his/her own jury selection questions into the website, and submit them to the Defense Attorney's respective program in the website to be used as recommendations by the Defense Attorney. Also, in the Defendant's program in the website, the Defendant will be shown the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge and will be advised to submit his/her recommended type formatted jury selection questions to the Defense Attorney's Program at least one week before the Defense Attorney's said deadline.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">If the Defense Attorney hired a Professional Jury Consultant through the website for the purpose of obtaining recommended jury selection questions, the Defense Attorney's selected Professional Jury Consultant may log into his/her respective program in the website, review the Judge's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions, review the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions, review the copies of the Plaintiff's video recording of the Plaintiff sitting in a silent and stationary state with the audio recordings of the Plaintiff Attorney paired with their respective type formatted questions, type his/her own jury selection questions into the website, and submit them to the Defense Attorney's respective program in the website to be used as recommendations by the Defense Attorney. Also, in the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's program in the website, the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant will be shown the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge and will be advised to submit his/her recommended type formatted jury selection questions to the Defense Attorney's Program at least one week before the Defense Attorney's deadline.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">If the Defendant and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant submit typed jury selection questions through the website to the Defense Attorney's respective program in the website, the Defense Attorney, through the website, views such typed jury selection questions and may delete, edit, and keep any of such questions and type any of his/her own additional jury selection questions. The invention instructs the Defense Attorney to review the Judge's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions, review the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions, and review the copies of the Plaintiffs video recording of the Plaintiff sitting in a silent and stationary state with the audio recordings of the Plaintiff Attorney paired with their respective type formatted questions before submitting his/her own jury selection questions to prevent duplication of questions on the questionnaire. Also, in the Defense Attorney's program in the website, the Defense Attorney will be shown the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge and will be advised to submit his/her typed and video recorded jury selection questions on or before the Defense Attorney's deadline.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">After the Defense Attorney types and/or edits his/her jury selection questions into his/her respective program in the website, the Defense Attorney then orally reads each of his/her typed jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the website on a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone making an individual video recording of each of his/her respective jury selection questions. Thus, when the Defense Attorney orally reads each of his/her own typed jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the website, only one typed question will appear on the screen at a time for the Defense Attorney to orally read in front of a webcam. For example, when the Defense Attorney begins to orally read his/her typed jury selection questions into the website, only the first question on his/her list of typed jury selection questions will appear on the screen. The Defense Attorney then orally reads the typed question in front of a webcam and into the website making an individual video recording of the Defense Attorney reading the first question. After the Defense Attorney finishes orally reading the first question on his/her list of typed jury selection questions, the Defense Attorney selects Orally Read Next Question in the website, and only the second typed question on his/her list of jury selection questions appears on the screen. The Defense Attorney then orally reads the second typed question in front of a webcam and into the website making an individual video recording of the Defense Attorney orally reading his/her second jury selection question. The Defense Attorney continues this pattern until he/she has produced an individual video recording of each of his/her jury selection questions. Ultimately, the Defense Attorney makes an individual video recording for each typed question the Defense Attorney orally reads in front of a webcam. When the Defense Attorney orally reads each typed question in front of a webcam, the Defense Attorney's video recording will appear and play on the Defense Attorney's screen on the website at the same time the Defense Attorney orally reads each typed question so the Defense Attorney can monitor the quality of each of his/her video recordings.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Ultimately, the invention's code sequence automatically pairs each video recording of the Defense Attorney with its respective type formatted question. If the Defense Attorney is not satisfied with a video recording he/she made for any particular type formatted question, the invention allows him/her to delete it and make a new video recording.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, the Defense Attorney, in his/her respective program, makes a video recording of the Defendant through the invention's website by having the Defendant sit in a silent and stationary state in front of a webcam on a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone. If the Defense Attorney is not satisfied with the video recording of the Defendant sitting in a silent and stationary state, the invention allows the Defense Attorney to delete it and make a new video recording of the Defendant sitting in a silent and stationary state.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">After the video recording of the Defendant is captured into the invention's website, the invention's code sequence automatically deletes only the audio recorded portion of the Defendant's video recording to where no sound from the Defendant's video recording can be heard through the invention's website while the visual video footage of the Defendant's video recording still remains to be viewable and playable. In the alternative, after the video recording of the Defendant is captured into the invention's website, the invention's code sequence automatically mutes the video recording of the Defendant to where the audio recorded portion of the Defendant's video recording cannot be heard through the invention's website. Also, after the video recording of the Defendant is captured into the invention's website, the invention's code sequence automatically changes the presentable state of each video recording of the Defense Attorney paired with its respective type formatted question that is included in the second half of the overall total number of the Defense Attorney's type formatted questions. Thus, for each video recording of the Defense Attorney that is paired with its respective type formatted question that is included in the second half of the overall total number of the Defense Attorney's type formatted questions, the code sequence automatically calculates the total number of questions making up the second half of the Defense Attorney's type formatted questions. For example, if the Defense Attorney had a total of 20 type formatted questions, the code sequence would automatically calculate that there are 10 type formatted questions making up the second half of the Defense Attorney's type formatted questions. After making such a calculation, the code sequence then automatically copies the video recording of the Defendant sitting in a silent and stationary state 10 times. After making such copies, the code sequence then automatically removes only the video recording portion of each of the Defense Attorney's video and audio recordings that are paired with a type formatted question that is included in the second half of the Defense Attorney's type formatted questions and replaces the removed portion in each video recording with a copy of the video recording depicting the Defendant in a stationary and silent state while the audio recording portion of the Defense Attorney still remains to be playable at the same time with the video recording of the Defendant and the paired type formatted question still remains to be viewable. To clarify, for each of the video and audio recordings of the Defense Attorney that is paired with a type formatted question that is included in the second half of the Defense Attorney's type formatted questions, the code sequence automatically removes only the video recording portion that depicts the Defense Attorney in each of such video recordings and replaces it with a copy of the video recording depicting the Defendant in a stationary and silent state while the respective audio recording portion of the Defense Attorney still remains to be playable at the same time with the video recording of the Defendant and the respective paired type formatted question still remains to be viewable.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">After the code sequence automatically changes the presentable state of each video recording of the Defense Attorney paired with its respective type formatted question that is included in the second half of the overall total number of the Defense Attorney's type formatted questions as described above, the first half of the Defense Attorney's video and audio recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions will not be altered or changed at all. For example, if the Defense Attorney made a separate video recording for each of his/her type formatted questions for a total of 20 type formatted questions, the type formatted questions numbered 1 through 10 will appear paired with its respective video and audio recording of the Defense Attorney, and each video recording of the Defense Attorney remains to be playable while its respective type formatted question still remains to be viewable. After the code sequence automatically changes the presentable state of each video and audio recording of the Defense Attorney paired with its type formatted question for each respective question numbered 11 through 20 as described above, the copy of the video recording depicting the Defendant in a stationary and silent state appears paired with its respective type formatted question while the respective audio recording portion of the Defense Attorney still remains to be playable at the same time with the copy of the video recording of the Defendant and the respective paired type formatted question still remains to be viewable for each respective question numbered 11 through 20.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, if the Defense Attorney's total number of type formatted questions that are each paired with a respective video recording is an odd number like 21, for example, the code sequence will deem the second half of the 21 questions to be 12 through 21. In such a scenario, the code sequence would only change the presentable state of each video and audio recording of the Defense Attorney paired with its respective type formatted question as described above for questions 12 through 21. Thus, the code sequence deems the second half of an odd total number of type formatted questions paired with its respective video recording to be the smaller half of such odd total number.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the Defense Attorney is satisfied with all of his/her video recordings, the Defendant's video recording, and type formatted questions, the website instructs the Defense Attorney to select a &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; option. Upon selecting the &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; option, the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of any portion of any video recording that the Defense Attorney deleted in his/her respective program, and the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of any typed formatted letter that became deleted when the Defense Attorney word processed his/her type formatted questions. After the invention automatically deletes all of such metadata, the invention makes the Defense Attorney's video recordings and type formatted questions viewable through the website to the programs of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, the Court Reporter, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Upon the Plaintiff Attorney completing his/her above said tasks, the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff may review the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions, and review the copies of the Plaintiffs video recording of the Plaintiff sitting in a silent and stationary state with the audio recordings of the Plaintiff Attorney paired with their respective type formatted question through the website in their respective programs. The Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program through the website and prints the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions and all email messages sent to all of the parties and is instructed by the website to place the Plaintiff Attorney's printed jury selection questions and all email messages sent to all of the parties in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes. Also, upon the Plaintiff Attorney completing his/her above said tasks, the Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program through the website and transcribes every word in each of the Plaintiff Attorney's video and audio recordings into a typed format and prints such transcriptions and places them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">However, as previously stated, the invention provides an optional feature where instead of having the Court Reporter log into the website to transcribe every word the invention has the capability of transcribing and converting all audible words of each captured audible and video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney into a tangible typed format automatically using the code sequence in communication with the server.

If such feature is used, the Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program through the website, reviews each transcription produced by the code sequence in his/her respective program, reviews each corresponding video and audio recording of the Plaintiff Attorney, makes any typographical corrections to the transcriptions, prints such transcriptions, and places them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Upon the Defense Attorney completing his/her above said tasks, the invention automatically sends email messages to the personal email accounts of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff that they may review the Defense Attorney's video recordings paired with their respective type formatted questions, and review the copies of the Defendant's video recording of the Defendant sitting in a silent and stationary state with the audio recordings of the Defense Attorney paired with their respective type formatted question through the website in their respective programs. The email messages also remind them of the date and time of the in-court hearing for the parties to object to any of the video recordings and typed jury selection questions that were submitted through the website. The email messages also instruct them that, after the in-court hearing for the parties to object to any of the video recordings and typed jury selection questions that were submitted through the website, the Judge may log onto the website and delete any of the video recordings and typed jury selection questions that were objected to by a party and the judge sustained on the record or the judge ordered to be stricken on the record sua sponte which means on the judge's own motion.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The email messages also instruct them that, after the in-court hearing for the parties to object to any of the video recordings and typed jury selection questions that were submitted through the website and after the Judge has had an opportunity to delete any of the video recordings paired with its respective type formatted question, the Judge may link an optional function to any of the remaining video recordings paired with its respective type formatted question that allows each potential juror, upon activating the function, to privatize his/her respective video recorded oral response and respective transcribed type formatted response to where such video recorded oral response and transcribed typed formatted response to the respective question can only be viewed in the Judge's Program in the website, and, as a result, the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff would only be able to view them through the Judge's program, but if a potential juror does not activate the function and video records his/her oral response to the respective question and if the code sequence automatically transcribes the potential juror's oral response in the video recording, the respective potential juror's video recorded oral response and its respective transcribed typed formatted response will be able to be viewed in the programs of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Court Reporter, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff. The email messages further instruct them that the reason for the Judge being allowed to link such a function to any of the remaining video recordings paired with its respective type formatted question is to protect the privacy interest of each potential juror. The email messages also instruct that if the Judge believes that a remaining video recording paired with its respective type formatted question could solicit a sensitive response from a potential juror and/or believes that a potential juror may want increased protection to keep his/her response to a particular question protected from public view, the Judge is encouraged to link the privatization function to such remaining video recording paired with its respective type formatted question. The email messages further instruct that if a potential juror activates the said privatization function to a particular video recording paired with its respective type formatted question, the potential juror's video recorded oral response to the question and its respective transcribed type formatted response will only be able to be viewed in the Judge's program with the Judge present. Additionally, the email messages instruct that the website automatically prevents anyone who views through the Judge's program a potential juror's video recorded oral response and respective type formatted response that the potential juror has privatized from copying, transferring, exporting, and/or printing the potential juror's video recorded oral response and respective type formatted response. Also, the email messages instruct that anyone who is authorized to view through the Judge's program in the website a potential juror's video recorded oral response and respective type formatted response that the potential juror has privatized is not allowed to show anyone else from the public the video recording and/or its respective transcribed type formatted response. Furthermore, the email message instructs that if a potential juror activates the said privatization function to a particular video recording paired with its respective type formatted question, the website automatically performs a multitude of functions to prevent a hacker from viewing the potential juror's video recorded oral response to the question and its respective transcribed type formatted response in the website.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The email messages also instruct them that after the in-court hearing for the parties to object to any of the video recordings and typed jury selection questions that were submitted through the website and after the Judge has deleted the video recordings and typed jury selection questions that were objected to by a party and the Judge sustained on the record or the judge ordered to be stricken on the record sua sponte and after the Judge has had an opportunity to link the said optional privatization function to any of the remaining video recordings paired with its respective type formatted question, the Judge may make all of the remaining video recordings paired with their respective type formatted question that were submitted through the website and any said privatization function the Judge linked to any of the remaining video recordings paired with its respective type formatted question available to all of the potential jurors in the jury pool for responding to the remaining video recordings and typed jury selection questions in front of a webcam through the website.

Additionally, the code sequence automatically prevents anyone who views the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and its respective transcribed type formatted response through the Judge's program from copying, transferring, exporting, and/or printing the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and/or respective transcribed type formatted response.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As a result, when the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff view the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and respective transcribed type formatted response through the Judge's program, they will not be allowed to copy, transfer, export, and/or print the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and/or the respective transcribed type formatted response. Also, the website instructs the Judge to not allow the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff from viewing the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and respective transcribed type formatted response without the Judge being present. The website also instructs the Judge to prevent the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff from showing the privatized video recorded response and respective transcribed type formatted response to anyone else from the public or discussing the video recorded response with anyone else from the public. Additionally, after the code sequence completes all of the privatization functions that are explained in great detail below, a computer hacker will not be able to view the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and/or the respective transcribed type formatted response in the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The reason the code sequence allows the Judge's program to link such a privatize function to any of the remaining video recordings paired with its respective type formatted question is to protect the privacy interest of each potential juror. When a traditional conventional paper form supplemental juror questionnaire is mailed to potential jurors, the potential jurors are commonly instructed that if a question on the questionnaire solicits a sensitive or private response from the potential juror and he/she does not wish to disclose it on the questionnaire he/she does not have to disclose it on the questionnaire and can answer the question in the judge's chambers with the judge and attorneys present. By not writing the response on the questionnaire, there is no permanent record made for anyone to view. For example, if a question asks if a potential juror has ever been sexually assaulted, please describe the encounter, he/she can answer the question in private in the judge's chambers with only the Judge and attorneys present. By the Judge being allowed to link the optional privatize function to any of the remaining video recordings with its paired type formatted question, the potential juror's video recorded oral response and respective type formatted response will only be allowed to be viewed in the Judge's program in the invention's website upon the potential juror activating the optional privatize function which is consistent with the process of the traditional conventional paper form supplemental juror questionnaire where the Judge and the attorneys meet in the judge's chambers with a potential juror to hear and view such potential juror's response to a question that would solicit a sensitive or private response.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, by comparison, the invention's above described optional privatize function process that requires the Judge, attorney's, plaintiff, and defendant to ultimately meet in the Judge's chambers to view a potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and respective type formatted response provides an advantage over the process of the traditional conventional paper form supplemental juror questionnaire where the Judge and the attorneys meet in the judge's chambers with a potential juror to hear and view such potential juror's response to a question that would solicit a sensitive or private response. Such advantage is that it prevents the potential juror from having to personally show up in an intimidating environment such as a judge's chambers where the judge and the attorneys can personally confront the potential juror and ask him/her about his/her sensitive or private response.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Ultimately, after the code sequence completes all of the privatize functions that are explained in great detail below, the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and respective type formatted response to the question will only be able to be viewed in the Judge's program. Additionally, the code sequence prevents anyone who views the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and respective type formatted response through the Judge's program from copying, transferring, exporting, and/or printing the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and respective type formatted response. As a result, when the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff view the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and respective type formatted response through the Judge's program, they will not be allowed to copy, transfer, export, and/or print the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and/or respective type formatted response. Also, the website instructs the Judge to not allow the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff from viewing the potential juror's privatized video recorded oral response and respective type formatted response without the Judge being present. The website also instructs the Judge to prevent the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff from showing the privatized video recorded response and/or respective type formatted response to anyone else from the public or discussing the privatized video recorded response and/or respective type formatted response with anyone else from the public. Additionally, after the code sequence completes all of the functions that are explained in great detail below, a computer hacker will not be able to view the potential juror's privatized video recorded response and/or respective type formatted response in the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For the Judge to link an optional privatize function to any of the remaining video recordings paired with its respective type formatted question, the Judge's program displays each remaining video recording of the Judge in numerical order on the left side of the Judge's screen. To the left of each of the Judge's video recordings is each video recording's respective number in numerical order. To the right of each of the Judge's video recordings is the video recording's respective type formatted question. Directly below the last Judge's video recording and its respective type formatted question in numerical order, each remaining video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney appears in numerical order on the left side of the Judge's screen. To the left of each of the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings is each video recording's respective number in numerical order. To the right of each of the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings is the video recording's respective type formatted question. Directly below the last Plaintiff Attorney's video recording and its respective type formatted question in numerical order, each remaining video recording of the Plaintiff combined with its respective audio recording of the Plaintiff Attorney appears in numerical order on the left side of the Judge's screen. To the left of each of the Plaintiff's video recordings combined their respective audio recording of the Plaintiff Attorney is each video and audio recording's respective number in numerical order. To the right of each of the Plaintiff's video recordings combined with their respective audio recording of the Plaintiff Attorney is the video and audio recording's respective type formatted question. Directly below the last Plaintiff's video recording combined with its respective Plaintiff Attorney's audio recording and its respective type formatted question in numerical order, each remaining video recording of the Defense Attorney appears in numerical order on the left side of the Judge's screen. To the left of each of the Defense Attorney's video recordings is each video recording's respective number in numerical order. To the right of each of the Defense Attorney's video recordings is the video recording's respective type formatted question. Directly below the last Defense Attorney's video recording and its respective type formatted question in numerical order, each remaining video recording of the Defendant combined with its respective audio recording of the Defense Attorney appears in numerical order on the left side of the Judge's screen. To the left of each of the Defendant's video recordings combined with their respective audio recording of the Defense Attorney is each video and audio recording's respective number in numerical order. To the right of each of the Defendant's video recordings combined with their respective audio recording of the Defense Attorney is the video and audio recording's respective type formatted question.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Directly below each remaining type formatted question appearing on the Judge's screen, a small square box labeled &#x201c;Privatize&#x201d; appears. If the Judge click's or taps on a square box, the invention's code sequence automatically makes a check mark appear in the box, and the invention's code sequence automatically makes an interactive option, function, or button labeled &#x201c;Privatize&#x201d; appear to the right of the check marked square box. If the Judge clicks or taps on a square box that already contains a check mark with an interactive option, function, or button labeled &#x201c;Privatize&#x201d; appearing to the right of the check marked square box, the invention's code sequence automatically makes the check mark appearing inside of the square box disappear, and it automatically makes the interactive option, function, or button labeled &#x201c;Privatize&#x201d; appearing to the right of the check marked square box disappear. Thus, for the Judge to link an optional privatize function to any of the remaining video recordings paired with its respective type formatted question, the Judge simply clicks or taps on the small square box labeled &#x201c;Privatize&#x201d; under the remaining type formatted question or questions the Judge desires to link with an optional privatize function.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Ultimately, the invention's code sequence allows the Judge to link every remaining video recording paired with its respective type formatted question with a privatize function in the Judge's program. However, the Judge's program will advise the Judge to only link a privatize function to the remaining questions that the Judge believes could solicit a sensitive response from a potential juror and/or believes could make a potential juror want increased protection to keep his/her response to a particular question protected from public view. Thus, the invention's website will advise the Judge that the more questions he/she links with a privatize function the more video recorded oral responses the attorneys and their clients would have to view through the Judge's program with the Judge present. For example, if the Judge links a privatize function to every remaining question, potential jurors possibly could activate the privatize function for every one of their video recorded oral responses which would require the attorneys and their clients to view every oral response of every potential juror who activates the privatize function for every question through the Judge's program with the Judge present which would be quite burdensome.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">After the judge deletes all of the video recordings and typed jury selection questions through the invention's website that were ordered to be stricken on the record in the said in-court hearing and after the judge has had an opportunity to link an optional privatize function to any of the remaining video recordings paired with its respective type formatted question, the invention's website instructs the Judge that he/she must make all of the remaining video recordings paired with their respective typed formatted question available to all of the potential jurors in the jury pool through the website for responding to the remaining video recordings paired with their respective typed formatted question in front of a webcam and through the invention's website by activating an interactive function labeled &#x201c;Make Questionnaire Available to Potential Jurors.&#x201d; Thus, the invention's code sequence provides the Judge's program with an interactive function labeled &#x201c;Make Questionnaire Available to Potential Jurors.&#x201d; Upon the Judge clicking or tapping on the interactive function labeled &#x201c;Make Questionnaire Available to Potential Jurors&#x201d; every potential juror summoned for jury duty for the particular case will be able to view every remaining video recording paired with its respective type formatted question and will be able to respond to each remaining video recording paired with its respective typed formatted question in front of a webcam.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">After the Defense Attorney completes his/her above said tasks, the Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program through the website and prints the Defense Attorney's typed jury selection questions and all email messages sent to all of the parties and is instructed by the website to place the Defense Attorney's printed jury selection questions and all printed email messages to all of the parties in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes. Also, upon the Defense Attorney completing his/her above said tasks, the Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program through the website and transcribes every word in each of the Defense Attorney's video and audio recordings into a typed format and prints such transcriptions and places them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">However, as previously stated, the invention provides an optional feature where instead of having the Court Reporter log into the website to transcribe every word the invention has the capability of transcribing and converting all audible words of each captured audible and video recording of the Defense Attorney into a tangible typed format automatically using the code sequence in communication with the server. Thus, if the feature is used, the invention transcribes all audible words of each captured audible and video recording of the Defense Attorney into a tangible typed format by the code sequence having voice recognition capability which parses the audio data to identify recognizable wave forms and sounds that correspond to words and makes the corresponding words appear in a typed format. If such feature is used, the Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program through the website, reviews each transcription produced by the code sequence in his/her respective program, reviews each corresponding video and audio recording of the Defense Attorney, makes any typographical corrections to the transcriptions, prints such transcriptions, and places them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">After the Judge activates the interactive function of &#x201c;Make Questionnaire Available to Potential Jurors,&#x201d; the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of any video recording that the Judge deleted in his/her respective program, and the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of any typed formatted question that the Judge deleted in his/her respective program.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Additionally, after the Judge activates the interactive function of &#x201c;Make Questionnaire Available to Potential Jurors,&#x201d; the invention automatically sends email messages to the personal email accounts of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff that instruct them that they may view the final jury selection questionnaire in their respective programs through the website. Also, after the Judge makes the jury selection questionnaire available to the potential jurors through the website for responding, the invention automatically sends an email message to the personal email account of the Court Administrator instructing the Court Administrator to make a summons for each potential juror in the jury pool through the website and mail each summons to its respective potential juror's residence. Also, after the Judge makes the jury selection questionnaire available to the potential jurors through the website for responding, the invention automatically sends an email message to the personal email account of the Court Reporter instructing the Court Reporter to print through the website the final jury selection questionnaire that was made available to the potential jurors through the website after the Judge was given an opportunity to delete any of the questions on the jury selection questionnaire, print a list of the typed jury selection questions and the respective transcriptions of the video recordings paired with their respective typed jury selection questions that were deleted by judge, and print all email messages sent to all of the parties and is instructed to place such prints in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes. Additionally, after the Judge makes the jury selection questionnaire available to the potential jurors through the website for responding, the invention sends text messages to the personal cellular phones of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, the Court Reporter, the Court Administrator, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff advising them that their participation is now required through the website, and they must now check their personal email accounts for instructive email messages and complete their respective tasks through the website.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">After the Judge makes the jury selection questionnaire available to the potential jurors through the website for responding, the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff may view the final jury selection questionnaire in their respective programs through the website, view any privatize function or functions linked to any of the questions on the final jury selection questionnaire, and view a list of the typed jury selection questions and the respective transcriptions of the video recordings paired with their respective typed jury selection questions that were deleted by the Judge.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">After the Judge makes the jury selection questionnaire available to the potential jurors through the website for responding, the Court Administrator makes a summons for each potential juror in the jury pool through his/her respective program in the website. The invention automatically produces a summons for each potential juror. Thus, after the judge submits the deadlines, dates, times, and number of potential jurors set and entered by the judge and after the Court Administrator enters the name and address of each potential juror in the jury pool and assigns a confidential code or password to each potential juror, the invention automatically produces a summons for each potential juror by placing each potential juror's name, address, and confidential code on a separate summons, and it automatically places the deadline for the potential jurors to have finished responding to the video recorded and typed jury selection questions and the date and time the in-court jury selection process has been scheduled to begin by the Judge. The Court Administrator is simply advised to merely add alternative places and addresses where potential jurors can receive assistance in responding to the video recorded and typed jury selection questions through the invention's website. Once the Court Administrator adds such alternative places and addresses to one summons, the invention automatically adds them to each summons. Each summons also contains standard language of a traditional summons and also includes additional instructions pertaining to the invention's website. After the Court Administrator adds such alternative places and addresses, the Court Administrator's program in the website instructs the Court Administrator to print each summons and mail each summons to its respective potential juror's residence.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">After the Judge makes the jury selection questionnaire available to the potential jurors through the website for responding, the Court Reporter prints through the website the final jury selection questionnaire that was made available to the potential jurors through the website after the Judge had an opportunity to delete any of the questions on the jury selection questionnaire, prints a list of the typed jury selection questions and the respective transcriptions of the video recordings paired with their respective typed jury selection questions that were deleted by the Judge, and prints all email messages sent to all of the parties, and the Court Reporter's program in the website instructs the Court Reporter to place such prints in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Once each potential juror receives their respective summons, they log into the website on a personal computer equipped with a webcam, a tablet equipped with a webcam, or a cellular phone equipped with a webcam, and they orally respond to each video recording paired with its respective typed formatted question on the jury selection questionnaire in front of their respective webcam. Ultimately, each potential juror makes a video recording of him/her orally responding to each question on the jury selection questionnaire into the website.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As eluded to above, if a potential juror does not have access to a computer, tablet, or cellular phone equipped with a webcam and internet access and/or merely needs assistance in responding to the typed and video recorded questions through the invention's website, the potential juror can use a computer equipped with a webcam and internet access and/or obtain assistance with the invention's website at one of the alternative places and addresses listed in the potential juror's summons which is where potential jurors can receive assistance in responding to the video recorded and typed jury selection questions through the invention's website. Thus, each courthouse will need to designate a room in the courthouse with computers equipped with a webcam and internet access to accommodate some of the potential jurors, and each courthouse may also contract with public libraries to designate a room with computers equipped with a webcam and internet access to accommodate some of the potential jurors.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">When each potential juror logs into the invention's website to orally respond to the questionnaire in front of a webcam on a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone, the potential juror first makes a picture of his/her state issued driver's license or photo identification card with the webcam and into the website. After the potential juror makes a picture of his/her driver's license or photo identification card, the invention's website, for the purpose of protecting the privacy interests of the potential juror, automatically black's out the driver's license number or identification number and blacks out the residence number and street of the potential juror's address to where only the potential juror's name, city, and state still appears in the picture of the potential juror's state issued driver's license or photo identification card. The potential juror's state issued driver's license or photo identification card with the driver's license number or identification number blacked out and the residence number and street of the potential juror's address blacked out to where only the potential juror's name, city, and state appears eventually will only be viewed by the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Juror Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Juror Consultant, Court Administrator, Court Reporter, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff to authenticate the identification of the potential juror.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">After each potential juror makes a picture of his/her state issued driver's license or photo identification card with the webcam and into the website and the invention's website automatically blacks out the driver's license number or identification number and the potential juror's residential number and street, each potential juror then orally responds to each question with its respective paired video recording on the jury selection questionnaire one question at a time in front of a webcam on a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone in their own respective program making a video recording of each one of their responses. Thus, in the website, only the one typed question that the potential juror attempts to answer will appear on the right side of the screen with its respective paired video recording appearing on the left side of the screen. No other questions with their respective paired video recording on the questionnaire will appear on the screen to the potential juror. Once the potential juror finishes orally responding to such question with its respective paired video recording on the questionnaire in front of a webcam and video records his/her oral response, the potential juror then activates or selects the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; on the screen of the website, and the next typed question on the questionnaire paired with its respective video recording appears on the potential juror's screen for the potential juror's oral response, and the previous question paired with its respective video recording disappears. The potential juror repeats this process until he/she has made a video recorded oral response for each typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording on the questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">However, if a potential juror selects or activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; on the screen of the website, the invention will not present the next typed formatted question on the questionnaire paired with its respective video recording if the potential juror did not orally respond to the typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording that appears on the potential juror's screen before selecting or activating the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question.&#x201d; Thus, the invention's code sequence has voice recognition capability that determines whether the next typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording should be presented on the potential juror's screen. When a potential juror successfully video records his/her oral response to a typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording appearing on the potential juror's screen into the invention's website, the invention's code sequence automatically parses the audio data provided by the potential juror to identify recognizable wave forms and sounds that correspond to words. If the invention's code sequence recognizes the potential juror's audio data in his/her video recording as corresponding to at least one word while a typed formatted question with its paired respective video recording appears on the potential juror's screen, the invention will present the next typed question on the questionnaire paired with its respective video recording on the potential juror's screen for the potential juror's oral response, and the previous question paired with its respective video recording will disappear if the potential juror activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; on the potential juror's screen. If the invention's code sequence does not recognize a potential juror's audio data in his/her video recording as corresponding to at least one word while a typed formatted question with its paired respective video recording appears on the potential juror's screen, the invention will not present the next typed question on the questionnaire paired with its respective video recording on the potential juror's screen, and the current typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording will remain on the potential juror's screen if the potential juror activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; on the potential juror's screen. Thus, the current typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording will remain on a potential juror's screen until the potential juror provides audio data in his/her video recording that the invention's code sequence recognizes as corresponding to at least one word and until the potential juror activates or selects the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; only after providing such recognizable audio data in his/her video recording. Ultimately, a potential juror must video record at least one word that the invention's code sequence recognizes for each typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording that appears through the invention's website. If a potential juror does not video record at least one word that the invention's code sequence recognizes, the invention will not present the next typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording on the potential juror's screen and the current typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording will remain on the potential juror's screen.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the alternative, if a potential juror selects or activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; on the screen of the website, the invention will not present the next typed formatted question on the questionnaire paired with its respective video recording if the potential juror did not appear in the view of the webcam while orally responding to the typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording that appears on the potential juror's screen before selecting or activating the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question.&#x201d; Thus, the invention's code sequence also has image recognition capability that determines whether the next typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording should be presented on the potential juror's screen. In this alternative, the invention uses its above described voice recognition capability with its image recognition capability simultaneously or at the same time. Thus, if the invention's code sequence recognizes the potential juror's audio data in his/her video recording as corresponding to at least one word while a typed formatted question with its paired respective video recording appears on the potential juror's screen but the potential juror did not appear in the view of the webcam while orally responding to the typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording, the invention will not present the next typed question on the questionnaire paired with its respective video recording on the potential juror's screen after the potential juror selects or activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question.&#x201d; Similarly, if the invention's code sequence recognizes the potential juror's audio data in his/her video recording as not corresponding to at least one word while a typed formatted question with its paired respective video recording appears on the potential juror's screen but the potential juror did appear in the view of the webcam while orally responding to the typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording, the invention will not present the next typed question on the questionnaire paired with its respective video recording on the potential juror's screen after the potential juror selects or activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; on his/her screen. However, if the invention's code sequence recognizes the potential juror's audio data in his/her video recording as corresponding to at least one word while a typed formatted question with its paired respective video recording appears on the potential juror's screen and the potential juror did appear in the view of the webcam while orally responding to the typed formatted question paired with its respective video recording, the invention will present the next typed question on the questionnaire paired with its respective video recording on the potential juror's screen for the potential juror's oral response, and the previous question paired with its respective video recording will disappear if the potential juror activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; on the potential juror's screen.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Ultimately, the invention's code sequence stores data of basic characteristics to identify a human being. The invention requires each potential juror to orally respond to each question on the questionnaire while being video recorded and by an unobstructed and operable webcam. During the entire time each potential juror orally responds to each question on the questionnaire through the invention's website in front of an unobstructed and operable webcam, the invention continuously monitors the participant through his/her webcam. While monitoring a potential juror through the website, the invention's code sequence has image recognition capability which simultaneously parses the imagery captured by the invention through the webcam to identify one recognizable image of a human being that corresponds to the data of the basic characteristics of a human being which is stored in the code sequence. If the invention identifies one recognizable image of a human being in the imagery captured by the invention through the webcam and the one identified recognizable image of a human being corresponds to the data of basic characteristics to identify a human being which is stored in the code sequence and if the invention's code sequence recognizes the potential juror's audio data in his/her video recording as corresponding to at least one word while a typed formatted question with its paired respective video recording appears on the potential juror's screen, the invention will present the next typed question on the questionnaire paired with its respective video recording on the potential juror's screen for the potential juror's oral response, and the previous question paired with its respective video recording will disappear if the potential juror activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; on the potential juror's screen. However, if the invention does not identify one recognizable image of a human being in the imagery captured by the invention through the webcam and no image captured by the invention through the webcam corresponds to the data of basic characteristics to identify a human being which is stored in the code sequence, the invention will not present the next typed question on the questionnaire paired with its respective video recording on the potential juror's screen after the potential juror selects or activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Furthermore, before each potential juror is shown a question with its respective paired video recording on the jury selection questionnaire on the screen that presents each question with its respective paired video recording to the potential juror after he/she logs into the invention's website, the invention will immediately cover the entire screen with a privacy screen to prevent each potential juror from viewing and listening to any typed formatted question with its respective paired video recording, and the invention will immediately scan the computer, cellular phone, tablet, or other electronic device for an unobstructed and operable webcam. If the invention detects an unobstructed and operable webcam on the potential juror's device, the privacy screen will be removed and the potential juror will be allowed to proceed to orally responding to the typed formatted question with its respective paired video recording that appears on the potential juror's screen.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">However, if the invention does not detect an unobstructed and operable webcam while initially scanning the potential juror's computer, cellular phone, tablet, or other electronic device for an unobstructed and operable webcam while the privacy screen still remains on the potential juror's screen, the invention's website will make the privacy screen remain on the screen, and the invention's website will make the privacy screen say that the potential juror must be video recorded by an unobstructed and operable webcam when orally responding to each question on the jury selection questionnaire. The invention's website also will make the privacy screen say that the webcam on the device of the potential juror is either obstructed or inoperable, and the potential juror will need to either remove the obstruction from the webcam on his/her device, fix or replace the webcam on his/her device, or use a different device with an unobstructed and operable webcam to orally respond to each question on the questionnaire. The invention's website also will make the privacy screen say that if the potential juror's webcam is merely blocked or obstructed the participant simply needs to remove the obstruction to remove the privacy screen and begin orally responding to questions. Additionally, the invention's website will make the privacy screen say that if the participant's webcam is inoperable, he/she should log out of the website and fix or replace the webcam or use a different device to log back into the invention's website to orally respond to the questions.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">During the entire time the privacy screen appears on the potential juror's entire screen, the invention will not video record the potential juror if the potential juror's webcam is obstructed but is operable. Also, during the entire time the privacy screen appears on the potential juror's entire screen, the invention will continuously scan the computer, cellular phone, tablet, or other electronic device for an unobstructed and operable webcam. Once the invention identifies an unobstructed and operable webcam, the invention will immediately remove the said privacy screen and immediately begin video recording the potential juror. Additionally, after the privacy screen has been removed and a potential juror begins to orally respond to the questions on the questionnaire in front of the webcam, the invention will automatically log out the potential juror from the invention's website if at any time the potential juror's webcam becomes obstructed or inoperable. Additionally, if a potential juror logs back into the invention's website after the invention logged the potential juror out of the website for having an obstructed or inoperable webcam, the invention will not present the same typed formatted question with its respective video recording that appeared to the potential juror when the invention logged the potential juror out of the website. Instead, the invention will present the next typed formatted question with its respective video recording in numerical order on the jury selection questionnaire. Finally, if the invention does not detect at least one word spoken by a potential juror using its voice recognition capability for 4 consecutive minutes after the invention presented a typed formatted question with its respective video recording through the website and to the potential juror, the invention will automatically log out the potential juror from the invention's website. Additionally, if a potential juror logs back into the invention's website after the invention logged the potential juror out of the website for not detecting one word spoken by a potential juror, the invention will not present the same typed formatted question with its respective video recording that appeared to the potential juror when the invention logged the potential juror out of the website. Instead, the invention will present the next typed formatted question with its respective video recording in numerical order on the jury selection questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the alternative, the invention's image recognition capability can be set to prevent a potential juror from using technology to assist him/her when orally responding to questions through the invention's website. For example, the invention can prevent a potential juror from wearing a Blue Tooth device connected to a cellular phone where the person on the cellular phone can listen through the Blue Tooth device while the potential juror sits in front of the webcam and then tell the potential juror how to respond. Thus, the invention's code sequence stores thousands of different images of technological devices in all different angles and positions that are capable of accessing the internet and/or making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating. As stated above, the invention requires each potential juror to be video recorded by an unobstructed and operable webcam. During the entire time each potential juror orally responds to questions through the invention's website in front of an unobstructed and operable webcam, the invention continuously monitors the potential juror through his/her webcam. While monitoring the potential juror through the website, the invention's code sequence has image recognition capability which simultaneously parses the imagery captured through the webcam to identify recognizable images that correspond to any of the thousands of different images of technological devices that are capable of accessing the internet and/or making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating which are stored in the code sequence. If the invention identifies a recognizable image that corresponds to any of the thousands of different images of technological devices that are capable of accessing the internet and/or making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating which are stored in the code sequence, the invention's website will immediately cover the entire screen on the potential juror's personal computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet with a privacy screen. Such privacy screen will prevent anyone who is using the technological device from viewing and listening to the questions through the invention's website. In addition, the privacy screen will advise the potential juror that a technological device capable of accessing the internet and/or making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating was detected, and the potential juror will not be allowed to orally respond to any of the questions through the invention's website while such device is detected. The privacy screen also will advise the potential juror that no potential juror is allowed to receive technological assistance when responding to questions. The privacy screen further instructs the potential juror to turn off the device and remove the device from detection, and upon turning off the device and removing the device from detection, the privacy screen will be removed.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">While such privacy screen is presented to the potential juror, the invention continues to monitor the potential juror with its image recognition device, and the invention continues to video record the potential juror. When the invention no longer detects the device, the invention removes the privacy screen, and the potential juror can continue to orally respond to questions.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Also, at the bottom of each potential juror's screen where the potential juror video records his/her oral response to each typed formatted question paired with its video recording in the invention's website, the potential juror's video recording of him/her orally responding to the questionnaire in front of a webcam will appear so the potential juror can monitor that the website is making a valid video recording of the potential juror. Also, at the bottom of the screen will appear the picture of the potential juror's respective driver's license or photo identification card with the potential juror's respective driver's license number or identification number, residential number and street blacked out.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Ultimately, when each potential juror orally responds to each video recording paired with its respective typed formatted question, each potential juror makes one continuous video recording and is continually recorded by his/her webcam. Thus, even when a video recording paired with its respective typed formatted question disappears and a new video recording paired with its respective typed formatted question appears on the potential juror's screen, the potential juror is continuously video recorded by his/her webcam. Furthermore, the invention's code sequence prevents every potential juror's webcam or video recording device that becomes paired with the potential juror's program in the invention's website and that is recording audio and video footage from pausing or stopping audio and video recordation until the presented audio and video recording paired with its typed formatted question is no longer presented through the potential juror's program in the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Additionally, as previously stated, the invention provides an optional feature where instead of having the Court Reporter log into the website to transcribe every word the invention has the capability of transcribing and converting all audible words of each oral response of each captured audible and video recording of each potential juror into a tangible typed format directly below each oral response's respective typed formatted question on each potential juror's respective questionnaire automatically using the code sequence in communication with the server. Thus, if the feature is used, the invention transcribes each oral response of each captured audible and video recording of each potential juror into a tangible typed format directly below each oral response's respective typed formatted question by the code sequence having voice recognition capability which parses the audio data of each oral response to identify recognizable wave forms and sounds that correspond to words and makes the corresponding words appear in a typed format directly below its respective typed formatted question. If such feature is used, the invention begins automatically transcribing each potential juror's video recorded responses into a tangible typed format immediately after the invention captures a potential juror's oral response into a video recording.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">With regard to the privatize function, the invention has a video recording stored in its code sequence. The video recording is long and simply says that the potential juror's video recorded oral response to this question and its respective transcribed typed formatted response have been removed and can only be viewed in the Judge's Program in the website with the Judge present.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">If the Judge linked a privatize function to a remaining video recording paired with its respective type formatted question, the interactive option, function, or button labeled privatize will appear on each potential juror's screen directly below its respective type formatted question only when such respective type formatted question appears on the potential juror's screen. When a video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function appears on a potential juror's screen, the invention's code sequence automatically immediately pairs the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function first appeared on the potential juror's screen with the privatize function.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The privatize function may be activated by a potential juror during anytime its linked respective type formatted question remains on the potential juror's screen. Thus, a potential juror may activate the privatize function before he/she orally responds to the linked question or after he/she orally responds to the linked question. However, if a potential juror video records his/her oral response to a question that has been linked with a privatize function, does not activate the privatize function, but activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question,&#x201d; the video recording paired with its respective type formatted question that has been linked with the privatize function will disappear from the potential juror's screen, and the linked privatize function also disappears from the potential juror's screen which will prevent the potential juror from activating the privatize function. Thus, if a potential juror video records his/her oral response to a question that has been linked with a privatize function, does not activate the privatize function, but activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; and if the code sequence automatically transcribes the potential juror's oral response in the video recording, the respective potential juror's video recorded oral response and its respective transcribed typed formatted response will be able to be viewed in the programs of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Court Reporter, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">If a potential juror activates the privatize button by clicking or tapping on the button and the potential juror video records his/her oral response to the question that is linked to the privatize function and if the potential juror activates the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function after he/she has activated the privatize button, the invention automatically transcribes all audible words of the potential juror's video recorded oral response into a tangible typed format by the code sequence having voice recognition capability which parses the audio data to identify recognizable wave forms and sounds that correspond to words and makes the corresponding words appear in a typed format. Additionally, the invention's code sequence automatically immediately pairs the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function with the privatize function. After pairing the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function with the privatize function, the code sequence automatically completes the following functions:</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">1. From the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function first appeared on the potential juror's screen that was previously paired with the privatize function to the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function that was previously paired with the privatize function, the code sequence removes each digitalized picture in each frame of such portion of the potential juror's video recording. Upon removing each digitalized picture in each frame, the code sequence divides each digitalized picture frame into a grid of small quadrants containing pixels from the digitalized picture. The code sequence then automatically rearranges each quadrant containing pixels from its respective frame according to a pattern within the code sequence. The code sequence then replaces each rearranged grid of small quadrants of pixels back onto its respective frame to where the original presentable state of the imagery and sound of each frame of such portion of the potential juror's video recording is unintelligible and unrecognizable.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">2. From the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function first appeared on the potential juror's screen that was previously paired with the privatize function to the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function that was previously paired with the privatize function, the code sequence digitally colors each frame to where the imagery of each frame of such portion of the potential juror's video recording cannot be seen and mutes the sound and audio of such portion of the potential juror's video recording to where such sound and audio cannot be heard. Additionally, the code sequence automatically digitally colors the potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response to where the imagery of the transcribed typed formatted response cannot be seen.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">3. From the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function first appeared on the potential juror's screen that was previously paired with the privatize function to the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function that was previously paired with the privatize function, the code sequence scrambles each frame to where the original presentable state of the imagery and sound of each frame of such portion of the potential juror's video recording is unintelligible and unrecognizable. Additionally, the code sequence automatically scrambles the potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response to where the original presentable state of the transcribed typed formatted response is unintelligible and unrecognizable.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">4. From the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function first appeared on the potential juror's screen that was previously paired with the privatize function to the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function that was previously paired with the privatize function, the code sequence automatically encrypts such portion of the potential juror's video recording by encoding it using an encryption algorithm, a cipher, generating ciphertext making such portion of the potential juror's video recording hidden and unintelligible. Additionally, the code sequence automatically encrypts the potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response by encoding it using an encryption algorithm, a cipher, generating ciphertext making the potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response unintelligible and unrecognizable.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">5. The code sequence measures and records the length or distance of the potential juror's video recording from the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function first appeared on the potential juror's screen that was previously paired with the privatize function to the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function that was previously paired with the privatize function.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">6. The code sequence automatically removes the portion of the potential juror's video recording from the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function first appeared on the potential juror's screen that was previously paired with the privatize function to the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function that was previously paired with the privatize function. Additionally, the code sequence automatically removes the potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">7. The code sequence pairs such removed portion of the potential juror's video recording with the removed respective transcribed typed formatted response of the potential juror.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">8. The code sequence transfers the removed portion of the potential juror's video recording paired with the removed respective transcribed typed formatted response of the potential juror into a storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">9. The code sequence copies the respective audio recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, or Defense Attorney and its respective video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, or Defendant and its paired respective typed formatted question, and the code sequence copies the potential juror's type formatted name respective to the removed portion of the potential juror's video recording paired with the removed respective transcribed typed formatted response.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">10. The code sequence transfers the copies of the respective audio recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, or Defense Attorney and its respective video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, or Defendant and its paired respective typed formatted question and the copy of the potential juror's type formatted name respective to the removed portion of the potential juror's video recording paired with the removed respective transcribed typed formatted response into a storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">11. The code sequence groups the removed portion of the potential juror's video recording paired with the removed respective transcribed typed formatted response of the potential juror with its respective potential juror's typed formatted name and its respective audio recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, or Defense Attorney and its respective video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, or Defendant and its paired respective typed formatted question in the storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">12.

The code sequence reduces the length of the copy of the video recording stored in the invention's code sequence that says that the potential juror's video recorded oral response to this question and its respective transcribed typed formatted response have been removed and can only be viewed in the Judge's Program in the website with the Judge present to the exact length of the length or distance that the code sequence previously measured and recorded which was the length or distance from the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function first appeared on the potential juror's screen that was previously paired with the privatize function to the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function that was previously paired with the privatize function.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">14. The code sequence splices the reduced copy of the video recording stored in the invention's code sequence that says that the potential juror's video recorded oral response to this question and its respective transcribed typed formatted response have been removed and can only be viewed in the Judge's Program in the website with the Judge present into the potential juror's entire video and audio recording in the exact location where the previously described portion of the potential juror's video and audio recorded response was removed.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">15. The code sequence automatically deletes or removes all metadata left behind in the potential juror's entire remaining video recording from the portion of the potential juror's video recording that was removed in the invention's website and was transferred to the storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program in the invention's website. The code sequence automatically deletes or removes all metadata left behind in the invention's website from the respective transcribed typed formatted response portion that was removed in the invention's website and was transferred to the storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program in the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the alternative, the invention's code sequence can be set to only automatically perform one of any of the functions listed above that are numbered 1 through 4 combined with all of the functions numbered 5 through 15. Additionally, in the alternative, the invention's code sequence can be set to only automatically perform one of any of the functions numbered 1 through 4 and not perform any other of the above numbered functions. Also, in the alternative, the invention's code sequence can be set to only automatically perform two or three of any of the functions numbered 1 through 4 and not perform any other of the above numbered functions. Additionally, in the alternative, the invention's code sequence can be set to only automatically perform all four of the functions numbered 1 through 4 and not perform any other of the above numbered functions. Also, in the alternative, the invention's code sequence can be set to only automatically perform one of any of the functions listed above that are numbered 1 through 4 combined with one or more of any of the other functions that are numbered from 5 through 15.

As previously stated, the invention does not allow a potential juror to view all of the questions with their respective paired video recording on the questionnaire before responding to any one particular question. The invention only shows one typed question to a potential juror on the screen at a time with its respective paired video recording. The invention will not show another question paired with its respective video recording to the potential juror until the potential juror has finished responding to the question paired with its respective video recording that appears on the potential juror's screen. This prevents a potential juror from memorizing any of the remaining questions and then logging out of the website to consult with another person or use technology to formulate a response and then logging back into the invention's website to answer the question. Also, as previously stated, the invention's code sequence does not allow a potential juror to pause the webcam from recording or log out of the website before the potential juror has finished responding to the question on the screen which prevents a potential juror from stopping the webcam from recording to consult with another person before orally responding to the question. Thus, once a potential juror logs out of the website when a typed question with its respective paired video recording appears on the screen, such typed question with its respective paired video recording will never again appear on the potential juror's screen when the potential juror logs back into the website. Additionally, the invention's website advises each potential juror before they respond to any questions with their respective paired video recording on the questionnaire that they are not allowed to consult with any other person or use anything that would help them formulate a response before answering any question.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Furthermore, when each potential juror orally responds to each question with its respective paired video recording on the questionnaire in the invention's website and the webcam continuously makes a video recording of the potential juror, the potential juror is continuously monitored which would deter other people from assisting the potential juror with his/her responses. For example, if a potential juror was responding to questions in front of a webcam and a person whispers a suggestive response in the potential juror's ear, such person would show up on the video recording and the judge, attorneys, defendant, and, if the case is civil, the plaintiff all would see that the potential juror received help from another person when responding to the particular question. Another example would be a potential juror responding to questions in front of a webcam and a person from behind the potential juror's webcam and out of the view of the webcam writes the answer on a piece of paper and holds it up so the potential juror can see. In such a scenario, the webcam would record the potential juror's eyes looking up and focusing in on something before responding which would indicate to the judge, attorneys, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff that the potential juror likely received help from another person when responding to the particular question. Another example would be a potential juror wearing a Blue Tooth device or some other similar technology in his/her ear where a person could listen to questions through the device and provide the potential juror with answers through the device. In such a scenario, the ear piece device would show up in the potential juror's video recording which would indicate to the judge, attorneys, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff that the potential juror likely received help from another person through the device when responding to the questions.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">If the judge submitted typed questions paired with their respective video recording through the website, each potential juror would be shown each question paired with its respective video recording separately. Thus, when each potential juror orally responds to the Judge's questions on the questionnaire in front of a webcam on a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone in the website, only the Judge's video recording for the particular typed question that appears on the screen that the potential juror attempts to answer will appear on the left side of the potential juror's screen in his/her respective program in the website, and the single typed question of the Judge's jury selection questions that the potential juror is attempting to answer will appear on the right side of the screen. When each typed question of the Judge's jury selection questions first appears on the right side of the screen, the Judge's respective video recording of the Judge orally reading the particular question appearing on the screen immediately begins to play depicting the Judge orally reading the question to the potential juror, and the potential juror can view the Judge orally asking the respective question in the Judge's video recording.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">When each potential juror begins to orally respond to the first half of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions on the questionnaire through the website in front of a webcam on a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone, the Judge's video recording will disappear, and only the Plaintiff Attorney's respective video recording for the first question of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear on the left side of the potential juror's screen in the potential juror's respective program in the website. Only the first typed question of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear on the right side of the potential juror's screen. The potential juror will only be allowed to answer one question of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions at a time through the website. Thus, when the potential juror attempts to answer any of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions through the website, only the one typed question of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions that the potential juror attempts to answer will appear on the right side of the screen on the website. When each of the first half of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions first appear on the right side of the screen, only the Plaintiff Attorney's respective video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney orally reading the particular typed question appearing on the screen appears on the left side of the potential juror's screen and immediately begins to play depicting the Plaintiff Attorney orally reading the typed question to the potential juror, and the potential juror can view and hear the Plaintiff Attorney orally reading the respective typed question in the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">When each of the second half of the typed jury selection questions of the Plaintiff Attorney first appear on the right side of each potential juror's screen on the website and the case is civil, the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording does not appear as explained previously, and a copy of the Plaintiffs video recording of the Plaintiff sitting in a silent and stationary state only appears on the left side of each potential juror's screen only if such video recording of the Plaintiff was made into the Plaintiff Attorney's program. Thus, each potential juror can view a copy of the Plaintiffs video recording while each potential juror orally responds to each of the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions. However, as previously explained, even though the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings have been removed and do not appear on each potential juror's screen when each potential juror orally responds to each of the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions and a copy of the Plaintiff's video recording does appear when each of the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions appear on each potential juror's screen, the sound or audio recordings of the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings for their respective typed jury selection questions still play along with the copies of the Plaintiff's video recordings on each potential juror's screen, and they orally read their respective questions making up the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions to each potential juror. Thus, when each potential juror responds to the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions through the website, they see the copy of the Plaintiffs video recording on the screen, but they hear the sound of the Plaintiff Attorney's audio recording orally read the typed question appearing on the potential juror's screen.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">When each potential juror begins to orally respond to the first half of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions on the questionnaire on the website in front of a webcam on a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone, the Plaintiff's video recording will disappear, and only the Defense Attorney's respective video recording for the first question of the Defense Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear on the left side of the potential juror's screen in the potential juror's respective program in the website. Only the first typed question of the Defense Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear on the right side of the potential juror's screen. The potential juror will only be allowed to answer one question of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions at a time through the website. Thus, when the potential juror attempts to answer any of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions through the website, only the one typed question of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions that the potential juror attempts to answer will appear on the right side of the screen on the website. When each of the first half of the Defense Attorney's typed jury selection questions first appear on the right side of the screen, the Defense Attorney's respective video recording of the Defense Attorney orally reading the particular typed question appearing on the screen appears on the left side of the potential juror's screen and immediately begins to play depicting the Defense Attorney orally reading the typed question to the potential juror, and the potential juror can view and hear the Defense Attorney orally reading the respective typed question in the Defense Attorney's video recording.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">When each of the second half of the typed jury selection questions of the Defense Attorney first appear on the right side of each potential juror's screen on the website, the Defense Attorney's video recording does not appear as previously explained, and a copy of the Defendant's video recording of the Defendant sitting in a silent and stationary state only appears on the left side of each potential juror's screen only if such video recording of the Defendant was made into the Defense Attorney's program. Thus, each potential juror can view a copy of the Defendant's video recording while each potential juror orally responds to each of the second half of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions. However, as previously explained, even though the Defense Attorney's video recordings have been removed and do not appear on each potential juror's screen when each potential juror orally responds to each of the second half of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions and a copy of the Defendant's video recording does appear when each of the second half of the Defense Attorney's typed jury selection questions appear on each potential juror's screen, the sound or audio recordings of the Defense Attorney's video recordings for their respective typed jury selection questions still play along with the copies of the Defendant's video recordings on each potential juror's screen, and they orally read their respective questions making up the second half of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions to each potential juror. Thus, when each potential juror responds to the second half of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions through the website, they see the copy of the Defendant's video recording on the screen, but they hear the sound of the Defense Attorney's audio recording orally read the typed question appearing on the potential juror's screen.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">A potential juror is not required to answer all of the questions on the questionnaire in the invention's website in one sitting. A potential juror may log out of the website after orally responding to any question on the questionnaire in the invention's website. Thus, a potential juror can orally respond to one question before logging out of the website, or orally respond to a few questions before logging out of the website. The potential juror is simply required to have orally responded to all questions on the questionnaire before the deadline for all of the potential jurors to respond to the jury selection questionnaire through the invention's website expires. Every time a potential juror logs into the invention's website to answer one or more questions, the invention presents through the invention's website to the potential juror the first question on the questionnaire in chronological order of which the potential juror has not provided an oral response in front of a webcam. For example, if a potential juror immediately logged out of the invention's website after orally responding to question 22 on the questionnaire, the invention will present the typed formatted question 23 paired with its respective video recording when the same potential juror logs back into the invention's website to respond to one or more questions.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">For the purpose of securing each potential juror's privacy, the invention contains an alternative and optional encryption setting where it automatically encrypts each potential juror's video recording and all respective transcribed typed formatted responses in the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium to where the presentable state of each potential juror's video recording is muted, hidden, and unintelligible and each potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response is hidden and unintelligible after each potential juror's video recorded responses and all respective transcribed typed formatted responses have become uploaded in the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium. Every time each potential juror logs out of the invention's website after orally responding to one or more questions in front of a webcam on his/her personal computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet and after the invention has automatically transcribed the potential juror's audio recording contained in the potential juror's video recording into a typed format as thoroughly described above, the invention's code sequence automatically encrypts all the video and audio footage of the video recording of the potential juror that was captured into the invention's website from the time the potential juror logged into the invention's website to the time the potential juror logged out of the website by encoding it using an encryption algorithm, a cipher, generating ciphertext making such portion of the potential juror's video recording hidden and unintelligible only if the invention is set to encrypt each potential juror's video recording. Additionally, only if the invention is set to encrypt each potential juror's video recording, the invention's code sequence automatically encrypts the potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response or responses by encoding them using an encryption algorithm, a cipher, generating ciphertext making the potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response or responses unintelligible and unrecognizable.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">To clarify, the invention's website does not allow a potential juror to review any of his/her video recorded and/or transcribed typed formatted responses. Therefore, when the potential juror logs back into the invention's website to orally respond to one or more questions, the invention's website does not decrypt the potential juror's video recording of his/her prior oral responses or decrypt the potential juror's prior transcribed typed formatted responses. The potential juror simply adds new video and audio footage to his/her continuous video recording, and every time the potential juror logs out of the invention's website and after the invention automatically transcribes the potential juror's new oral responses into a tangible typed format, the newly added video and audio footage and newly added transcribed typed formatted responses become encrypted by the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Furthermore, if the invention is set to automatically encrypt each potential juror's video recording to where the presentable state of each potential juror's video recording and transcribed response is muted, hidden, and unintelligible, the invention automatically generates a first pseudo random decryption key which will only allow each authorized participant in his/her respective program to decrypt each potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses and view each potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in their original presentable state. Thus, after the first potential juror to log out of the invention's website after logging into the invention's website and making a video recording into the invention's website and after the invention's code sequence automatically transcribes the potential juror's video recording into a tangible typed format and after the invention encrypts the potential juror's video recording as described above, the invention's code sequence automatically uses an algorithm and generates a first pseudo-random decryption key to decrypt each potential juror's encrypted video recorded response and each respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized which is explained in detail below. Ultimately, the first pseudo-random decryption key will decrypt each potential juror's encrypted video recorded response and each respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized in each authorized participant's program and on each authorized participant's screen when it becomes activated as explained in detail below. After generating the first pseudo-random decryption key, the invention's code sequence links the key to the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;View Potential Jurors' Video Recorded and Transcribed Responses to Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; that appears in the Main Menu of Functions in the respective programs of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff. Additionally, after generating the first pseudo-random decryption key, the invention's code sequence links the same key to the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Transcribe and Print Juror Video Responses to Final Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; that appears in the Main Menu of Functions in the respective program of the Court Reporter. To clarify, the invention ultimately generates only one first pseudo-random decryption key that decrypts each potential juror's encrypted video recorded response that has not been privatized and its respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Each time the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Plaintiff logs into his/her respective program and clicks, taps, or activates the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;View Potential Jurors' Video Recorded and Transcribed Responses to Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; from his/her respective Main Menu of Functions, the invention's code sequence ultimately changes the imagery and sound of each potential juror's encrypted video recorded response that has not been privatized and its respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized back to its original presentable state by the code sequence making the first pseudo-random decryption key decrypt each frame of the potential juror's video recorded response that has not been privatized and decrypt the respective transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized. Thus, the invention presents each potential juror's video recorded response that has not been privatized and each respective transcribed response that has not been privatized in its original presentable state through its website and on the screen of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, or the Plaintiff each time he/she activates the function labeled &#x201c;View Potential Jurors' Video Recorded and Transcribed Responses to Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; from his/her respective Main Menu of Functions in his/her respective program. However, during the entire time each frame of each potential juror's video recorded response that has not been privatized appears decrypted and in its original presentable state and each respective transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized appears decrypted and in its original presentable state on the screen of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, or the Plaintiff after each time he/she activates the function labeled &#x201c;View Potential Jurors' Video Recorded and Transcribed Responses to Jury Selection Questionnaire,&#x201d; each potential juror's entire video recording and all transcribed typed formatted responses always remain encrypted on the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium. As a result, when each of such authorized participants close the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;View Potential Jurors' Video Recorded and Transcribed Responses to Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; or log out of the invention's website, each potential juror's entire video recording and all transcribed typed formatted responses disappear from the authorized participant's screen, and they remain encrypted on the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium. Therefore, the invention does not re-encrypt any potential juror's video recording or transcribed responses when each of such authorized participants close the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;View Potential Jurors' Video Recorded and Transcribed Responses to Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; or log out of the invention's website as they have always remained encrypted on the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Likewise, each time the Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program and clicks, taps, or activates the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Transcribe and Print Potential Juror Video Responses to Final Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; from the Court Reporter's Main Menu of Functions to review and revise the transcribed responses of each potential juror, the invention's code sequence ultimately changes the imagery and sound of each potential juror's encrypted video recorded response that has not been privatized and its respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized back to its original presentable state by the code sequence making the first pseudo-random decryption key decrypt each frame of the potential juror's video recorded response that has not been privatized and decrypt the respective transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized. Thus, the invention presents each potential juror's video recorded response that has not been privatized and each respective transcribed response that has not been privatized in its original presentable state through its website and on the screen of the Court Reporter each time he/she activates the function labeled &#x201c;Transcribe and Print Potential Juror Video Responses to Final Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; from the Court Reporter's Main Menu of Functions in the Court Reporter's Program. However, during the entire time each frame of each potential juror's video recorded response that has not been privatized appears decrypted and in its original presentable state and each respective transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized appears decrypted and in its original presentable state on the screen of the Court Reporter after each time he/she activates the function labeled &#x201c;Transcribe and Print Potential Juror Video Responses to Final Jury Selection Questionnaire,&#x201d; each potential juror's entire video recording and all transcribed typed formatted responses always remain encrypted on the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium. As a result, when the Court Reporter closes the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Transcribe and Print Potential Juror Video Responses to Final Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; or logs out of the invention's website, each potential juror's entire video recording and all respective transcribed typed formatted responses disappear from the Court Reporter's screen, and they remain encrypted on the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium. Therefore, the invention does not re-encrypt any potential juror's video recording or transcribed responses when the Court Reporter closes the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Transcribe and Print Potential Juror Video Responses to Final Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; or logs out of the invention's website as they have always remained encrypted on the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The function of privatizing responses of potential jurors which is detailed above also is used if the invention is set to automatically encrypt each potential juror's video recording and transcribed response. Thus, if the invention is set to automatically encrypt each potential juror's video recording and transcribed response, the interactive option, function, or button labeled privatize will appear on each potential juror's screen directly below its respective type formatted question only when such respective type formatted question appears on the potential juror's screen if the Judge linked a privatize function to a remaining video recording paired with its respective type formatted question. When a video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function appears on a potential juror's screen, the invention's code sequence automatically immediately pairs the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function first appeared on the potential juror's screen with the privatize function.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The privatize function may be activated by a potential juror during anytime its linked respective type formatted question remains on the potential juror's screen. Thus, a potential juror may activate the privatize function before he/she orally responds to the linked question or after he/she orally responds to the linked question. However, if a potential juror video records his/her oral response to a question that has been linked with a privatize function, does not activate the privatize function, but activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question,&#x201d; the video recording paired with its respective type formatted question that has been linked with the privatize function will disappear from the potential juror's screen, and the linked privatize function also disappears from the potential juror's screen which will prevent the potential juror from activating the privatize function. Thus, if a potential juror video records his/her oral response to a question that has been linked with a privatize function, does not activate the privatize function, but activates the function labeled &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; and if the code sequence automatically transcribes the potential juror's oral response in the video recording, the invention encrypts the respective potential juror's video recorded oral response and its respective transcribed typed formatted response in the same manner as detailed above, and they will be able to be viewed in their original presentable states in the programs of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff each time the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Plaintiff logs into his/her respective program and clicks, taps, or activates the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;View Potential Jurors' Video Recorded and Transcribed Responses to Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; from his/her respective Main Menu of Functions. Also, they will be able to be viewed in their original presentable states in the Court Reporter's program each time the Court Reporter logs into the Court Reporter's Program and clicks, taps, or activates the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Transcribe and Print Potential Juror Video Responses to Final Jury Selection Questionnaire.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">If a potential juror activates the privatize button by clicking or tapping on the button and the potential juror video records his/her oral response to the question that is linked to the privatize function and if the potential juror activates the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function after he/she has activated the privatize button, the invention automatically transcribes all audible words of the potential juror's video recorded oral response into a tangible typed format by the code sequence having voice recognition capability which parses the audio data to identify recognizable wave forms and sounds that correspond to words and makes the corresponding words appear in a typed format. Additionally, the invention's code sequence automatically immediately pairs the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function with the privatize function. After pairing the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function with the privatize function, the code sequence automatically completes the following functions:</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">1. From the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant paired with its respective type formatted question linked with a privatize function first appeared on the potential juror's screen that was previously paired with the privatize function to the exact digital location in the potential juror's video recording when the potential juror activated the &#x201c;Next Question&#x201d; function that was previously paired with the privatize function, the code sequence automatically encrypts such portion of the potential juror's video recording by encoding it using an encryption algorithm, a cipher, generating ciphertext making such portion of the potential juror's video recording muted, hidden, and unintelligible. Additionally, the code sequence automatically encrypts the potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response by encoding it using an encryption algorithm, a cipher, generating ciphertext making the potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response hidden, unintelligible, and unrecognizable.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">2. Only in the Judge's Main Menu of Functions in the Judge's program, a function appears labeled &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors.&#x201d; Upon activating the &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; function, the invention's website presents on a screen through the Judge's Program only the typed formatted name of each potential juror who activated a privatized function when responding to a question in alphabetical order. Directly below each potential juror's typed formatted name, the invention makes each typed formatted question of which the potential juror activated the privatize function appear. To the left of each of such typed formatted question, the invention makes the respective video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant that is paired with the typed formatted question appear. Directly below each typed formatted question with its paired respective video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant, the invention makes the encrypted transcribed typed formatted response of the potential juror to the respective question appear unintelligible, hidden, and unrecognizable as it appears in an encrypted form. To the left of each encrypted transcribed typed formatted response of the potential juror, the invention makes the encrypted video recorded response of the potential juror appear unintelligible, hidden, and unrecognizable as it appears in an encrypted form. To the left of each encrypted privatized video recorded response, an interactive function, option or button appears labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">3. The invention's code sequence automatically uses an algorithm and generates a second pseudo-random decryption key to decrypt the potential juror's encrypted video recorded response that has been privatized and respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response that has been privatized. Ultimately, the second pseudo-random decryption key decrypts each potential juror's encrypted video recorded response that has been privatized and respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response that has been privatized on the said screen that is linked to the function labeled &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; when it becomes activated as explained below. To clarify, the second pseudo-random decryption key is different from the first pseudo-random decryption key that decrypts each frame of each potential juror's video recorded response that has not been privatized and decrypts each potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized. Thus, the second pseudo-random decryption key can only decrypt the encrypted portions of a potential juror's video recording that the potential juror privatized and the respective transcribed typed formatted responses that have been privatized. The second pseudo-random decryption key cannot decrypt each frame of each potential juror's video recorded response that has not been privatized and cannot decrypt each potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response that has not been privatized. Also, the first pseudo-random decryption key cannot decrypt the encrypted portions of a potential juror's video recording that the potential juror privatized and the respective transcribed typed formatted responses that have been privatized.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">4. After generating the second pseudo-random decryption key, the invention's code sequence links the key to each interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response&#x201d; that appears to the left of each respective encrypted privatized video recorded response. When the Judge clicks, taps, or activates the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response&#x201d; to the left of a potential juror's encrypted privatized video recorded response, the invention's code sequence ultimately changes the imagery and sound of the potential juror's encrypted privatized video recorded response and its respective encrypted privatized transcribed typed formatted response back to its original presentable state on the screen by the code sequence making the second pseudo-random decryption key decrypt each frame of the potential juror's privatized video recorded response and decrypt the respective transcribed typed formatted response.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">With regard to the privatized video recorded responses and privatized transcribed responses of all of the potential jurors, they will always appear encrypted, muted, hidden, and unintelligible on the screens in the programs of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Plaintiff each time they log into their respective programs and click, tap, or activate the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;View Potential Jurors' Video Recorded and Transcribed Responses to Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; from their respective Main Menu of Functions. Likewise, with regard to the privatized video recorded responses and privatized transcribed responses of all of the potential jurors, they will always appear encrypted, muted, hidden, and unintelligible on the screen in the Court Reporter's Program each time he/she logs into the Court Reporter's Program and clicks, taps, or activates the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Transcribe and Print Potential Juror Video Responses to Final Jury Selection Questionnaire&#x201d; from the Court Reporter's Main Menu of Functions.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">As stated below, the day before the date the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff is scheduled to view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present, the invention sends a reminder email message to the email accounts of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff. The email message informs the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff of the date, time, and location that was previously set and entered by the Judge in the Judge's program and that on such date and at such location and time the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff can view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Also, as stated below, the Judge's program in the invention's website advises the Judge to log into the Judge's program on the date and at the location and time that was previously set and entered by the Judge in the Judge's program and allow the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff to view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present. On the date and at the location and time that was previously set and entered by the Judge in the Judge's program to allow the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff to view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present, the Judge logs into the Judge's program, and in the Judge's Main Menu of Functions, the he/she activates the function labeled &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors.&#x201d; Upon activating the &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; function, the invention's website presents the said screen that is linked with the &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; function which is thoroughly explained above.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">When the Judge clicks, taps, or activates the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response&#x201d; to the left of a potential juror's encrypted privatized video recorded response, the invention's code sequence ultimately changes the imagery and sound of the potential juror's encrypted privatized video recorded response and its respective encrypted privatized transcribed typed formatted response back to its original presentable state on the screen by the code sequence making the second pseudo-random decryption key decrypt each frame of the potential juror's privatized video recorded response and decrypt the respective transcribed typed formatted response.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">However, during the entire time each frame of a potential juror's video recorded response that has been privatized appears decrypted and in its original presentable state and the respective transcribed typed formatted response that has been privatized appears decrypted and in its original presentable state on the said screen through the Judge's Program after the Judge activates the function labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response,&#x201d; each frame of the potential juror's video recorded response and the respective transcribed typed formatted response appearing on the said screen always remain encrypted on the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium. As a result, when the Judge closes the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; or logs out of the invention's website, all of each potential juror's privatized video recorded response and its respective transcribed typed formatted response that appeared on the said screen disappear from the Judge's screen, and they remain encrypted on the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium. Therefore, the invention does not re-encrypt any potential juror's privatized video recorded responses or privatized transcribed responses when the Judge closes the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; or logs out of the invention's website as they have always remained encrypted on the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Once the deadline for all of the potential jurors to respond to the jury selection questionnaire through the website expires, the invention automatically sends email messages to the personal email accounts of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, the Court Reporter, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff that informs them that the deadline for the potential jurors to respond to the questionnaire through the website has expired, and the Court Reporter must now log onto the website, view and listen to each potential juror's oral response to each question on the questionnaire from the potential juror's respective video recording, transcribe each potential juror's response into a typed format under each question on each potential juror's respective jury selection questionnaire into the website, and print such transcriptions and place them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">However, as described previously, the invention provides an optional feature where instead of having the Court Reporter log into the website to transcribe every word the invention has the capability of transcribing and converting all audible words of each captured audible and video recording of each potential juror into a tangible typed format automatically using the code sequence in communication with the server. Thus, the invention transcribes all audible words of the captured audible and video recording of each potential juror into a tangible typed format by the code sequence having voice recognition capability which parses the audio data to identify recognizable wave forms and sounds that correspond to words and makes the corresponding words appear in a typed format. If such feature is used, the email message will instruct the Court Reporter to review each transcription in his/her respective program and review each corresponding video and audio recording of each potential juror and make any typographical corrections to the transcriptions and print such transcriptions and place them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes. Additionally, once the deadline for all of the potential jurors to respond to the jury selection questionnaire through the website expires, the invention sends text messages to the personal cellular phones of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, the Court Reporter, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff advising them that their participation is now required through the website, and they must now check their personal email accounts for instructive email messages and complete their respective tasks through the website.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Once the deadline for all of the potential jurors to respond to the jury selection questionnaire through the website expires, the Court Reporter logs onto the website, and the judge's order prohibiting disclosure of potential juror questionnaires appears in a large window on the Court Reporter's screen, and it takes up most of the screen. Such order essentially states that potential jurors have a substantial privacy interest in their responses to the questionnaire and none of the participants in the invention's process are allowed to show or disclose any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone and are not allowed to play any video and audio recorded response of any potential juror to anyone. It also will state that a participant shall be held in contempt of court if he/she shows or discloses any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone or plays any video and audio recorded response of any potential juror to anyone, and the punishment for being held in contempt of court could be jail time and/or a fine. Also, at the very bottom of the window will be an interactive button that says &#x201c;Accept.&#x201d; If the Court Reporter clicks on the &#x201c;Accept&#x201d; button, the order will disappear from the screen. Once the order disappears, the Court Reporter views and listens to each potential juror's oral response to each question on the questionnaire from the potential juror's respective video recording, transcribes each potential juror's response into a typed format under each question on each potential juror's respective jury selection questionnaire into the website, and prints such transcriptions and places them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">However, as previously stated, the invention provides an optional feature where instead of having the Court Reporter log into the website to transcribe every word the invention has the capability of transcribing and converting all audible words of each oral response of each captured audible and video recording of each potential juror into a tangible typed format directly below each oral response's respective typed formatted question on each potential juror's respective questionnaire automatically using the code sequence in communication with the server. Thus, if the feature is used, the invention transcribes each oral response of each captured audible and video recording of each potential juror into a tangible typed format directly below each oral response's respective typed formatted question by the code sequence having voice recognition capability which parses the audio data of each oral response to identify recognizable wave forms and sounds that correspond to words and makes the corresponding words appear in a typed format directly below its respective typed formatted question. If such feature is used, the Court Reporter logs into his/her respective program through the website, reviews each transcription produced by the code sequence in his/her respective program, reviews each corresponding video and audio recording of each potential juror, makes any typographical corrections to the transcriptions, prints such transcriptions with their respective typed formatted questions, and places them in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Once the Court Reporter or the invention's code sequence transcribes each potential juror's response into a typed format under each question on each potential juror's respective jury selection questionnaire through the invention's website, the invention automatically sends email messages to the personal email accounts of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff that they may view, through their respective programs in the website, each potential juror's video recording of each potential juror's responses to each respective question on the questionnaire and view each potential juror's transcribed typed response to each respective question on each potential juror's respective jury selection questionnaire and may make typed notes and analyze each potential juror's video recording and typed responses through their respective programs in the website. The email message further informs the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff of the date, time, and location that was previously set and entered by the Judge in the Judge's program and that on such date and at such location and time the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff can view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present. The email message further instructs them that the Plaintiff may now submit a confidential typed analysis of each potential juror's video recording and typed responses to the Plaintiff Attorney's respective program through the website to be used as recommendations by the Plaintiff Attorney when the Plaintiff Attorney determines which potential jurors to strike with a challenge for cause or a peremptory challenge. The email message further instructs them that the Defendant may now submit a confidential typed analysis of each potential juror's video recording and typed responses to the Defense Attorney's respective program through the website to be used as recommendations by the Defense Attorney when the Defense Attorney determines which potential jurors to strike with a challenge for cause or a peremptory challenge. The invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Court Reporter to print through the website each potential juror's transcribed typed responses under their respective typed questions on each potential juror's respective jury selection questionnaire and print all email messages sent to all of the parties, and the Court Reporter is instructed to place each potential juror's printed jury selection questionnaire and each printed email message sent to each party in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes. Additionally, once the Court Reporter or the invention's codes sequence transcribes each potential juror's response into a typed format under each question on each potential juror's respective jury selection questionnaire through the website, the invention sends text messages to the personal cellular phones of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Court Reporter, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff advising them that their participation is now required through the website, and they must now check their personal email accounts for instructive email messages and complete their respective tasks through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Once the Court Reporter or the invention's code sequence transcribes each potential juror's response into a typed format under each question on each potential juror's respective jury selection questionnaire through the website, the Court Reporter, in his/her respective program, prints through the website each potential juror's transcribed typed responses under their respective typed questions on each potential juror's respective jury selection questionnaire and prints all email messages sent to all of the parties, and the website instructs the Court Reporter to place each potential juror's transcribed and printed jury selection questionnaire and each printed email message sent to each party in the Court's sealed file for transcript purposes.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The invention allows the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney to hire their own respective Professional Jury Consultant through the website to provide them with a confidential typed analysis of each potential juror's video recording of the potential juror's oral responses to the jury selection questionnaire and each potential juror's transcribed responses to the potential juror's respective jury selection questionnaire through the website. Thus, the invention provides the Plaintiff Attorney's program and the Defense Attorney's program with a list of every participating professional jury consultant and professional jury consultant firm. If the Plaintiff Attorney selects and retains a professional jury consultant through the invention's website, such retained professional jury consultant will no longer appear on the list of professional jury consultants in the Defense Attorney's program and vice versa.

Additionally, if the Plaintiff Attorney hired a Professional Jury Consultant through the website to provide a confidential analysis of each potential juror's video recording and transcribed responses to the Plaintiff Attorney's respective program in the website, the invention sends a text message to the personal cellular phone of the Plaintiff Attorney's selected Professional Jury Consultant advising him/her that his/her participation is now required through the website, and he/she must now check his/her personal email account for an instructive email message and complete his/her respective tasks through the website.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">If the Defense Attorney hired a Professional Jury Consultant through the website to provide a confidential typed analysis of each potential juror's video recording and transcribed responses to the Defense Attorney's respective program in the website, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Defense Attorney's selected Professional Jury Consultant instructing him/her to provide the Defense Attorney with a confidential typed analysis of each potential juror's video recording of the potential juror's oral responses to the jury selection questionnaire and each potential juror's transcribed responses to the potential juror's respective jury selection questionnaire through the website and into the Defense Attorney's respective program. Additionally, if the Defense Attorney hired a Professional Jury Consultant through the website to provide a confidential analysis of each potential juror's video recording and transcribed responses to the Defense Attorney's respective program in the website, the invention sends a text message to the personal cellular phone of the Defense Attorney's selected Professional Jury Consultant advising him/her that his/her participation is now required through the website, and he/she must now check his/her personal email account for an instructive email message and complete his/her respective tasks through the website.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Once the Court Reporter or the invention's code sequence transcribes each potential juror's responses into the website, the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, any selected Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, any selected Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff then log into their respective programs in the website to view and listen to each potential juror's video recording and view each potential juror's transcribed responses. Upon entering their respective program in the website, they are each shown the judge's order prohibiting disclosure of potential juror questionnaires which appears in a large window on each of their respective screens, and it takes up most of the screen. Such order essentially states that potential jurors have a substantial privacy interest in their responses to the questionnaire and none of the participants in the invention's process are allowed to show or disclose any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone and are not allowed to play any video and audio recorded response of any potential juror to anyone. It also will state that a participant shall be held in contempt of court if he/she shows or discloses any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone or plays any video and audio recorded response of any potential juror to anyone, and the punishment for being held in contempt of court could be jail time and/or a fine. Also, at the very bottom of the window will be an interactive button that says &#x201c;Accept.&#x201d; By clicking on the &#x201c;Accept&#x201d; button, the order will disappear from the screen, and they are allowed to view and listen to each potential juror's video recorded responses through the website on the left half of their respective screens. Directly below each potential juror's video recorded responses on the screens of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant appears the respective potential juror's picture of his/her driver's license or photo identification card with the driver's license number or identification number and the residential number and street blocked out. On the right half of the screen, they also view the respective transcribed responses of the potential juror's video recording under each typed question on the jury selection questionnaire. Also, to the left of each typed question on each potential juror's transcribed jury selection questionnaire that appears on the right side of the screen on the website will appear the photo of the person whose video recording was appearing on the potential juror's screen when the potential juror responded to the particular question. For example, if the Judge submitted 20 typed and video recorded jury selection questions through the website and if the Judge's video recordings appeared on each potential juror's screen for questions 1 through 20 on the jury selection questionnaire, a photo of the Judge derived from the Judge's video recording that appeared to the potential jurors will appear to the left of its respective typed question. As a result, a photo of the Judge will appear to the left of each of the typed questions numbered 1 through 20 on each potential juror's transcribed questionnaire that is viewed by the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Likewise, if the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings appeared on each potential juror's screen for questions 21 through 30 on the jury selection questionnaire, a photo of the Plaintiff Attorney derived from the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording that appeared to the potential jurors will appear to the left of its respective typed question. As a result, a photo of the Plaintiff Attorney will appear to the left of each of the typed questions numbered 21 through 30 on each potential juror's transcribed questionnaire that is viewed by the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Also, if copies of the Plaintiff's video recording appeared on each potential juror's screen for questions 31 through 40 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Plaintiff's photo derived from the respective copy of the Plaintiff's video recording that appeared to the potential jurors will appear to the left of each of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed questions numbered 31 through 40 on each potential juror's transcribed questionnaire that is viewed by the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Additionally, if the Defense Attorney's video recordings appeared on each potential juror's screen for questions 41 through 50 on the jury selection questionnaire, a photo of the Defense Attorney derived from the Defense Attorney's video recording that appeared to the potential jurors will appear to the left of its respective typed question. As a result, a photo of the Defense Attorney will appear to the left of each of the typed questions numbered 41 through 50 on each potential juror's transcribed questionnaire that is viewed by the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Also, if copies of the Defendant's video recording appeared on each potential juror's screen for questions 51 through 60 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Defendant's photo derived from the respective copy of the Defendant's video recording that appeared to the potential jurors will appear to the left of each of the Defense Attorney's typed questions numbered 51 through 60 on each potential juror's transcribed questionnaire that is viewed by the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The photos next to their respective typed questions on the transcribed jury selection questionnaire for each potential juror which symbolizes which person's video recording was appearing on each potential juror's screen when each potential juror responded to the questionnaire provides the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant with an opportunity to see how each potential juror responds to the individual video profiles of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, and Defendant. For example, if the Defense Attorney wanted to know how each potential juror will respond to the Defendant's physical appearance, and if the Defendant's video recording appeared to the potential juror's on questions 51 through 60, the Defense Attorney could watch each potential juror's video recorded responses for questions 51 through 60 through the website, and the Defense Attorney can see how each potential juror reacts to seeing the Defendant's video recording. Thus, by knowing whose specific video recording was playing on the potential jurors' screens when the potential jurors responded to the jury selection questions, the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant can see nonverbal clues as to how each potential juror responds to the video recordings of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, and Defendant.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Directly below the window containing the potential juror's transcribed jury selection questionnaire with all of its above described features appears a narrow window containing the applicable jurisdiction's statute stating the grounds to exclude a potential juror with a challenge for cause. Directly below such window will appear another window with a flashing cursor for the participant to type a confidential analysis of the potential juror's video recording and/or transcribed responses.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In the Plaintiff Attorney's program and the Defense Attorney's program only, the window containing the flashing cursor for the participant to type a confidential analysis also will contain a small rectangular interactive button labeled &#x201c;Challenge for Cause&#x201d; in the upper right-hand corner. Upon an attorney clicking or tapping on the button, the potential juror's name will become highlighted. If the attorney clicks or taps on the button after the potential juror's name has been highlighted, the highlight will disappear. The purpose of such button is to make exercising challenges for cause in the in-court jury selection process easier for both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney. The explanation for highlighting potential jurors' names making exercising challenges for cause easier in the in-court jury selection process is thoroughly detailed below.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the respective programs of the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, a small square window will appear directly below the window designated for a typed confidential analysis where the participant is instructed to type a confidential number from 1 through 10 based on the strength of his/her desire to exclude the potential juror with a peremptory challenge. The invention's website instructs them that a confidential number of 10 represents the strongest desire to exclude a potential juror, and a confidential number of 1 represents the least desire to exclude a potential juror.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Ultimately, in the invention's website, the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant are instructed to type a confidential analysis of each potential juror's video recorded responses and respective transcribed responses to the jury selection questionnaire into their own respective programs in the designated window on the same screen they view each potential juror's respective video recorded responses and respective transcribed responses. In particular, they are advised to view the jurisdiction's applicable statute to exclude a potential juror with a challenge for cause and make a typed confidential analysis in the designated window for each potential juror they desire to have excluded with a challenge for cause by including the reason(s) why they believe the potential juror should be excluded with a challenge for cause pursuant to the applicable statute. They are also advised to type a confidential analysis for each potential juror as to the reasons why they desire to exclude the potential juror with a peremptory challenge in the designated window, and/or type a confidential analysis as to the reasons why they desire to keep the potential juror in the jury box.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Additionally, the website instructs the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney to click or tap the button labeled &#x201c;Challenge for Cause&#x201d; in the designated window for each potential juror they desire to exclude with a challenge for cause in the in-court jury selection process. Upon the Plaintiff Attorney clicking or tapping on the button for each potential juror he/she desires to exclude with a challenge for cause, such potential jurors' names will become highlighted in his/her respective program only. Likewise, upon the Defense Attorney clicking or tapping on the button for each potential juror he/she desires to exclude with a challenge for cause, such potential jurors' names will become highlighted in his/her respective program only.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Upon typing a confidential analysis of each potential juror and upon only the attorneys highlighting each potential juror's name they respectively desire to exclude with challenges for cause, the website instructs the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, in their respective programs, to type a confidential number from 1 through 10 based on the strength of their desire to exclude the potential juror with a peremptory challenge in the designated space provided underneath their confidential analysis of each potential juror's video recording. Once again, the website instructs them that a confidential number of 10 represents the strongest desire to exclude a potential juror, and a confidential number of 1 represents the least desire to exclude a potential juror.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Also, to further prevent the plaintiff and the defendant from intentionally or inadvertently disclosing any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone, the invention's code sequence and website does not allow the plaintiff's program or the defendant's program to print any completed potential juror questionnaire or to copy and paste any of the transcribed responses of any of the potential jurors. Such inability to print will prevent the plaintiff and the defendant from printing a completed potential juror's questionnaire and carelessly leaving it exposed in a location where someone from the public could view it. Ultimately, the invention's code sequence prevents the plaintiff's program and the defendant's program from copying, transferring, exporting, and/or printing any portion of any video recorded oral response of any potential juror, and the invention's code sequence prevents the plaintiff's program and the defendant's program from copying, transferring, exporting, and/or printing any portion of any transcribed type formatted response of any potential juror.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Alternatively, to prevent the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant from intentionally or inadvertently disclosing any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone, the invention's code sequence and website does not allow the programs of the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant to print any completed potential juror questionnaire or to copy and paste any of the transcribed responses of any of the potential jurors. Such inability to print will prevent the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant from printing a completed potential juror's questionnaire and carelessly leaving it exposed in a location where someone from the public could view it. Ultimately, the invention's code sequence prevents the programs of the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant from copying, transferring, exporting, and/or printing any portion of any video recorded oral response of any potential juror, and the invention's code sequence prevents the programs of the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant from copying, transferring, exporting, and/or printing any portion of any transcribed type formatted response of any potential juror.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Additionally, in the plaintiff attorney's program and in the defense attorney's program, the attorneys are instructed to warn their respective clients that they are not to disclose any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone and warn them that the judge will hold them in contempt of court and may punish them with jail time and/or a fine if they disclose any potential juror's questionnaire to anyone. The plaintiff and the defendant viewing the order prohibiting disclosure of potential juror questionnaires combined with their respective attorney warning them of the penalty of disclosing any of the completed questionnaires to anyone will have a substantial effect on the plaintiff and the defendant that will help deter them from disclosing any completed potential juror questionnaire to anyone.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Furthermore, the invention's website allows the Court Reporter program to print the completed potential juror questionnaires. As explained previously, the court reporter is required to print the completed questionnaires and place them in a sealed file to preserve any issues with the questionnaires for appeal. Therefore, printing the completed questionnaires from the Court Reporter Program is necessary.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">In the alternative, the invention's code sequence can be set to allow the Judge's program, Plaintiff Attorney's program, Defense Attorney's program, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's program, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's program to print the completed potential juror questionnaires as they are all professionals who completely understand the importance of potential juror privacy and the severity of the consequences for violating such privacy. Thus, some judges, attorneys, and consultants may desire to print the completed questionnaires if they find comparing printed paper form questionnaires easier than comparing them through the website.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Once the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant have viewed each potential juror's respective video recorded responses and respective transcribed responses and typed a confidential analysis of each potential juror and typed a confidential number from 1 through 10 for each potential juror in their respective programs in the website and once only the attorneys have highlighted each potential juror's name they respectively desire to exclude with a challenge for cause, they may then view each of their own respective analysis and number from 1 through 10 for each potential juror on the same screen in their respective programs. When either the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, or Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant view his/her own respective analysis and assigned number for each potential juror on the same screen in his/her respective program in the website, each potential juror's typed name in the jury pool will appear on the screen. To the left of each potential juror's respective typed name will appear the respective picture of the potential juror derived from the potential juror's respective video recording. To the left of each potential juror's respective picture will appear his/her respective confidential typed number from 1 through 10. Below the potential juror's respective name, picture, and confidential number will appear his/her respective typed analysis of the respective potential juror appearing directly below the potential juror's name. On the screen, the potential jurors will be placed in order based on their respective confidential number. The potential jurors' names will appear in order from the highest confidential numbers to the lowest confidential numbers. For example, all potential jurors assigned a confidential number of 10 will appear in alphabetical order at the top of the screen. All potential jurors assigned a confidential number of 9 will appear in alphabetical order below the last potential juror assigned a number 10 on the screen etc.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In the Plaintiff Attorney's program and the Defense Attorney's program only, the same small rectangular interactive button labeled &#x201c;Challenge for Cause,&#x201d; as previously described, will appear directly above each potential juror's name appearing on the screen. Additionally, on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen only, all of the potential juror names that were previously highlighted by the Plaintiff Attorney will appear highlighted on the screen. Upon the Plaintiff Attorney clicking or tapping on the button above a potential juror's name that was not previously highlighted by the Plaintiff Attorney, the potential juror's name will become highlighted. Upon the Plaintiff Attorney clicking or tapping on the button above a potential juror's name that was previously highlighted by the Plaintiff Attorney, the highlight will disappear.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Likewise, on the Defense Attorney's screen only, all of the potential juror names that were previously highlighted by the Defense Attorney will appear highlighted on the screen. Upon the Defense Attorney clicking or tapping on the button above a potential juror's name that was not previously highlighted by the Defense Attorney, the potential juror's name will become highlighted. Upon the Defense Attorney clicking or tapping on the button above a potential juror's name that was previously highlighted by the Defense Attorney, the highlight will disappear.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">As stated previously, the purpose of an attorney highlighting each potential juror's name he/she desires to exclude with a challenge for cause is to make exercising challenges for cause in the in-court jury selection process easier. As stated previously, on the screen where each attorney views each potential juror's video recording and transcribed responses, the website instructs each attorney to view the jurisdiction's applicable statute to exclude a potential juror with a challenge for cause and make a typed confidential analysis in the designated window for each potential juror they desire to have excluded with a challenge for cause by including the reason(s) why they believe the potential juror should be excluded with a challenge for cause pursuant to the applicable statute. By highlighting each potential juror's name an attorney desires to exclude with a challenge for cause, an attorney easily can locate the highlighted names among the non-highlighted names all appearing on the same screen and quickly begin reviewing his/her analysis of each highlighted name of a potential juror he/she desires to exclude with a challenge for cause which saves time in preparing to argue his/her reasons for excluding such potential jurors with challenges for cause in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In the Plaintiff Attorney's program and the Defense Attorney's program only, two small square boxes will appear to the left of each potential juror's confidential typed number from 1 through 10. The small square box on the left is for the purpose of marking the Plaintiff Attorney's peremptory challenge exercises, and the small square box on the right is for the purpose of marking the Defense Attorney's peremptory challenge exercises. Ultimately, the purpose of the two boxes is to help each attorney keep track of his/her peremptory challenge exercises and the opposing attorney's peremptory challenge exercises in the in-court jury selection process. After the Plaintiff Attorney exercises a peremptory challenge on a potential juror in the in-court jury selection process, both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney, on their respective screens, are instructed to click or tap on the square box on the left designated for the potential juror's name. Upon clicking or tapping on the square box, a check mark appears in the box. By clicking or tapping on the check mark in the box, the check mark will disappear. The check mark in the square box on the left indicates to both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney that the Plaintiff Attorney has exercised a peremptory challenge on the potential juror which helps both attorneys keep track of the Plaintiff Attorney's peremptory challenge exercises.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Likewise, after the Defense Attorney exercises a peremptory challenge on a potential juror in the in-court jury selection process, both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney, on their respective screens, are instructed to click or tap on the square box on the right designated for the potential juror's name. Upon clicking or tapping on the square box, a check mark appears in the box. By clicking or tapping on the check mark in the box, the check mark will disappear. The check mark in the square box on the right indicates to both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney that the Defense Attorney has exercised a peremptory challenge on the potential juror which helps both attorneys keep track of the Defense Attorney's peremptory challenge exercises.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Additionally, the invention's website instructs the Plaintiff and the Defendant to send their confidential analysis and confidential number of each potential juror to their respective attorney's program through the invention's website. Also, the invention's website instructs the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant to send their confidential analysis and confidential number of each potential juror to their respective attorney's program through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">If the Plaintiff sends his/her confidential analysis and confidential number of each potential juror to the Plaintiff Attorney's respective program in the invention's website, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Plaintiff Attorney advising that the Plaintiff has submitted his/her confidential analysis and confidential number of each potential juror to the Plaintiff Attorney's program in the invention's website, and the Plaintiff Attorney may now log into his/her respective program in the invention's website and view the Plaintiffs analysis and number of each potential juror. Additionally, if the Plaintiff sends his/her confidential analysis and confidential number of each potential juror to the Plaintiff Attorney's respective program in the invention's website, the invention sends a text message to the personal cellular phone of the Plaintiff Attorney advising him/her that his/her participation is now required through the invention's website, and he/she must now check his/her personal email account for an instructive email message and complete his/her respective tasks through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Likewise, if the Defendant sends his/her confidential analysis and confidential number of each potential juror to the Defense Attorney's respective program in the invention's website, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Defense Attorney advising that the Defendant has submitted his/her confidential analysis and confidential number of each potential juror to the Defense Attorney's program in the invention's website, and the Defense Attorney may now log into his/her respective program in the invention's website and view the Defendant's analysis and number of each potential juror. Additionally, if the Defendant sends his/her confidential analysis and confidential number of each potential juror to the Defense Attorney's respective program in the invention's website, the invention sends a text message to the personal cellular phone of the Defense Attorney advising him/her that his/her participation is now required through the invention's website, and he/she must now check his/her personal email account for an instructive email message and complete his/her respective tasks through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">Additionally, if the Plaintiff Attorney retained a Professional Jury Consultant to provide an analysis and number for each potential juror to the Plaintiff Attorney, and the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant sends his/her confidential professional analysis and number of each potential juror to the Plaintiff Attorney's respective program in the invention's website, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Plaintiff Attorney advising that the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant has submitted his/her confidential analysis and number of each potential juror to the Plaintiff Attorney's respective program in the invention's website, and the Plaintiff Attorney may now log into his/her respective program in the invention's website and view the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's analysis and number of each potential juror. Additionally, if the Plaintiff Attorney retained a Professional Jury Consultant to provide an analysis and number for each potential juror to the Plaintiff Attorney, the invention sends a text message to the personal cellular phone of the Plaintiff Attorney advising him/her that his/her participation is now required through the invention's website, and he/she must now check his/her personal email account for an instructive email message and complete his/her respective tasks through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Likewise, if the Defense Attorney retained a Professional Jury Consultant to provide an analysis and number for each potential juror to the Defense Attorney, and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant sends his/her confidential professional analysis and number of each potential juror to the Defense Attorney's respective program in the invention's website, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Defense Attorney advising that the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant has submitted his/her confidential analysis of each potential juror to the Defense Attorney's respective program in the invention's website, and the Defense Attorney may now log into his/her respective program in the invention's website and view the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's analysis and number of each potential juror. Additionally, if the Defense Attorney retained a Professional Jury Consultant to provide an analysis and number for each potential juror to the Defense Attorney's respective program in the invention's website, the invention sends a text message to the personal cellular phone of the Defense Attorney advising him/her that his/her participation is now required through the invention's website, and he/she must now check his/her personal email account for an instructive email message and complete his/her respective tasks through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">If the Plaintiff and the Defendant send their confidential analysis and number of each potential juror to their respective attorney's program through the invention's website, the attorneys may then view their respective client's analysis and number for each potential juror along with each of their own respective analysis and number for each potential juror on the same screen. When the Plaintiff Attorney views each of his/her own analysis and number of each potential juror and the Plaintiffs analysis and number of each potential juror on the same screen in the invention's website, the Plaintiff Attorney is shown each potential juror's name in the jury pool, and, to the left of each potential juror's name, the respective picture of the potential juror derived from the potential juror's video recording appears. To the left of each potential juror's respective picture will appear the Plaintiff Attorney's respective confidential typed number from 1 through 10. Below the potential juror's respective name, picture, and confidential number will appear the Plaintiff Attorney's respective typed analysis of the respective potential juror appearing directly below the potential juror's name. Directly below the Plaintiff Attorney's individual analysis of the respective potential juror, the Plaintiff's respective analysis of the respective potential juror appears with the Plaintiffs assigned number for the respective potential juror appearing to the left off the Plaintiff's analysis. On the screen, the potential juror names will be placed in the order based on the Plaintiff Attorney's confidential numbers. As previously stated, the higher the assigned number the higher the desire to strike the potential juror. The potential juror names will appear in order from the highest Plaintiff Attorney assigned number to the lowest Plaintiff Attorney assigned number. The Plaintiff Attorney will be advised to strike the potential jurors with the highest assigned numbers in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">However, the Plaintiff Attorney will have an option in his/her respective program to place the potential juror names in an order based on the combined assigned numbers of both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Plaintiff. If the Plaintiff Attorney selects this option, the invention automatically adds the assigned number of the Plaintiff Attorney and the assigned number of the Plaintiff together for each potential juror and places the resulting number for each potential juror to the left of the potential juror's picture and automatically places the Plaintiff Attorney's assigned number to the left of the Plaintiff Attorney's analysis under the potential juror's name.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">For example, if the Plaintiff Attorney assigned the number 10 to a potential juror and the Plaintiff assigned a number 9 to the same potential juror and if the Plaintiff Attorney selects the combine option, the invention automatically adds the 10 and the 9 together and places the number 19 to the left of the potential juror's picture. The invention simultaneously adds each Plaintiff Attorney assigned number with each Plaintiff assigned number for each potential juror and arranges the potential juror names from the highest combined number to the lowest combined number immediately upon the Plaintiff Attorney selecting the combine option. For example, all potential jurors with a combined number of 20 would be placed in alphabetical order and all potential jurors with a combined number of 19 would be placed in alphabetical order below the last potential juror name with a combined number of 20 etc. The higher the combined number the higher the collective desire to strike the potential juror. Ultimately, the potential juror names will appear in order from the highest combined number to the lowest combined number. The Plaintiff Attorney will be advised to strike the potential jurors with the highest combined numbers in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Likewise, when the Defense Attorney views each of his/her own analysis and number of each potential juror and the Defendant's analysis and number of each potential juror on the same screen in the invention's website, the Defense Attorney is shown each potential juror's name in the jury pool, and, to the left of each potential juror's name, the respective picture of the potential juror derived from the potential juror's video recording appears. To the left of each potential juror's respective picture will appear the Defense Attorney's respective confidential typed number from 1 through 10. Below the potential juror's respective name, picture, and confidential number will appear the Defense Attorney's respective typed analysis of the respective potential juror appearing directly below the potential juror's name. Directly below the Defense Attorney's individual analysis of the respective potential juror, the Defendant's respective analysis of the respective potential juror appears with the Defendant's assigned number for the respective potential juror appearing to the left off the Defendant's analysis. On the screen, the potential juror names will be placed in the order based on the Defense Attorney's confidential numbers. As previously stated, the higher the assigned number the higher the desire to strike the potential juror. The potential juror names will appear in order from the highest Defense Attorney assigned number to the lowest Defense Attorney assigned number. The Defense Attorney will be advised to strike the potential jurors with the highest assigned numbers in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">However, the Defense Attorney will have an option in his/her respective program to place the potential juror names in an order based on the combined assigned numbers of both the Defense Attorney and the Defendant. If the Defense Attorney selects this option, the invention automatically adds the assigned number of the Defense Attorney and the assigned number of the Defendant together for each potential juror and places the resulting number for each potential juror to the left of the potential juror's picture and automatically places the Defense Attorney's assigned number to the left of the Defense Attorney's analysis under the potential juror's name. For example, if the Defense Attorney assigned the number 10 to a potential juror and the Defendant assigned a number 9 to the same potential juror and if the Defense Attorney selects the combine option, the invention automatically adds the 10 and the 9 together and places the number 19 to the left of the potential juror's picture. The invention simultaneously adds each Defense Attorney assigned number with each Defendant assigned number for each potential juror and arranges the potential juror names from the highest combined number to the lowest combined number immediately upon the Defense Attorney selecting the combine option. For example, all potential jurors with a combined number of 20 would be placed in alphabetical order and all potential jurors with a combined number of 19 would be placed in alphabetical order below the last potential juror name with a combined number of 20 etc. The higher the combined number the higher the collective desire to strike the potential juror. Ultimately, the potential juror names will appear in order from the highest combined number to the lowest combined number. The Defense Attorney will be advised to strike the potential jurors with the highest combined numbers in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">If the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant sent his/her confidential professional analysis and number of each potential juror to the Plaintiff Attorney's respective program through the invention's website, the Plaintiff Attorney may then view each of his/her own respective analysis and number for each potential juror on the same screen with his/her professional jury consultant's analysis and number of each potential juror and with the Plaintiffs analysis and number of each potential juror. When the Plaintiff Attorney views each of his/her own analysis and number of each potential juror and views the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's analysis and number of each potential juror and views the Plaintiff's analysis and number of each potential juror all on the same screen in the website, the Plaintiff Attorney is shown each potential juror's name in the jury pool, and, to the left of each potential juror's name, the respective picture of the potential juror derived from the potential juror's video recording appears. To the left of each potential juror's respective picture will appear the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's confidential typed number from 1 through 10. Below the potential juror's respective name, picture, and Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's confidential number will appear the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's respective typed analysis of the respective potential juror appearing directly below the potential juror's name. Directly below the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's individual analysis of the respective potential juror, the Plaintiff Attorney's respective analysis of the respective potential juror appears with the Plaintiff Attorney's respective assigned number appearing to the left of his/her respective analysis. Directly below the Plaintiff Attorney's respective analysis and number of the respective potential juror, the Plaintiff's respective analysis of the respective potential juror appears with the Plaintiff's respective assigned number appearing to the left of his/her respective analysis. On the screen, the potential juror names will be placed in order based on the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's confidential numbers. As previously stated, the higher the assigned number the higher the desire to strike the potential juror. The potential juror names will appear in order from the highest Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's assigned number to the lowest Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's assigned number. The Plaintiff Attorney will be advised to strike the potential jurors with the highest assigned numbers in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">However, the Plaintiff Attorney will have an option in his/her respective program to place the potential juror names in an order based on the combined assigned numbers of the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Plaintiff Attorney, and Plaintiff. If the Plaintiff Attorney selects this option, the invention automatically adds the assigned number of the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant with the assigned number of the Plaintiff Attorney and with the assigned number of the Plaintiff together for each potential juror and places the resulting number for each potential juror to the left of the potential juror's picture and automatically places the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's assigned number to the left of the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's analysis under the potential juror's name. For example, if the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant assigned the number 8 to a potential juror, the Plaintiff Attorney assigned the number 10 to the same potential juror, and the Plaintiff assigned a number 9 to the same potential juror and if the Plaintiff Attorney selects the combine option, the invention automatically adds the 8, 10, and 9 together and places the number 27 to the left of the potential juror's picture. The invention simultaneously adds each Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's assigned number with each Plaintiff Attorney's assigned number, and with each Plaintiff's assigned number for each potential juror and arranges the potential juror names from the highest combined number to the lowest combined number immediately upon the Plaintiff Attorney selecting the combine option. For example, all potential jurors with a combined number of 30 would be placed in alphabetical order and all potential jurors with a combined number of 29 would be placed in alphabetical order below the last potential juror name with a combined number of 30 etc. As previously stated, the higher the combined number the higher the collective desire to strike the potential juror. The potential juror names will appear in order from the highest combined number to the lowest combined number. The Plaintiff Attorney will be advised to strike the potential jurors with the highest combined numbers in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Likewise, if the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant sent his/her confidential professional analysis and number of each potential juror to the Defense Attorney's respective program through the invention's website, the Defense Attorney may then view each of his/her own respective analysis and number for each potential juror on the same screen with his/her Professional Jury Consultant's analysis and number of each potential juror and with the Defendant's analysis and number of each potential juror. When the Defense Attorney views each of his/her own analysis and number of each potential juror and views the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's analysis and number of each potential juror and views the Defendant's analysis and number of each potential juror all on the same screen in the invention's website, the Defense Attorney is shown each potential juror's name in the jury pool, and, to the left of each potential juror's name, the respective picture of the potential juror derived from the potential juror's video recording appears. To the left of each potential juror's respective picture will appear the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's confidential typed number from 1 through 10. Below the potential juror's respective name, picture, and Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's confidential number will appear the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's respective typed analysis of the respective potential juror appearing directly below the potential juror's name. Directly below the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's individual analysis of the respective potential juror, the Defense Attorney's respective analysis of the respective potential juror appears with the Defense Attorney's respective assigned number appearing to the left of his/her respective analysis. Directly below the Defense Attorney's individual analysis of the respective potential juror, the Defendant's respective analysis of the respective potential juror appears with the Defendant's respective assigned number appearing to the left of his/her respective analysis. On the screen, the potential juror names will be placed in order based on the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's confidential numbers. As previously stated, the higher the assigned number the higher the desire to strike the potential juror. The potential juror names will appear in order from the highest Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's assigned number to the lowest Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's assigned number. The Defense Attorney will be advised to strike the potential jurors with the highest assigned numbers in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">However, the Defense Attorney will have an option in his/her respective program to place the potential juror names in an order based on the combined assigned numbers of the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney, and Defendant. If the Defense Attorney selects this option, the invention automatically adds the assigned number of the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant with the assigned number of the Defense Attorney and with the assigned number of the Defendant together for each potential juror and places the resulting number for each potential juror to the left of the potential juror's picture and automatically places the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's assigned number to the left of the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's analysis under the potential juror's name. For example, if the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant assigned the number 8 to a potential juror, the Defense Attorney assigned the number 10 to the same potential juror, and the Defendant assigned a number 9 to the same potential juror and if the Defense Attorney selects the combine option, the invention automatically adds the 8, 10, and 9 together and places the number 27 to the left of the potential juror's picture. The invention simultaneously adds each Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's assigned number with each Defense Attorney's assigned number, and with each Defendant's assigned number for each potential juror and arranges the potential juror names from the highest combined number to the lowest combined number immediately upon the Defense Attorney selecting the combine option. For example, all potential jurors with a combined number of 30 would be placed in alphabetical order and all potential jurors with a combined number of 29 would be placed in alphabetical order below the last potential juror name with a combined number of 30 etc. As previously stated, the higher the combined number the higher the collective desire to strike the potential juror. The potential juror names will appear in order from the highest combined number to the lowest combined number. The Defense Attorney will be advised to strike the potential jurors with the highest combined numbers in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">The day before the date the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff is scheduled to view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present, the invention sends a reminder email message to the email accounts of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff. The email message informs the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff of the date, time, and location that was previously set and entered by the Judge in the Judge's program and that on such date and at such location and time the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff can view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">The following explanation of the invention's functions to view privatized video recorded and transcribed responses of potential jurors is only used by the invention if the invention is not set to automatically encrypt every potential juror's entire video recording and all respective transcribed typed formatted responses to where the presentable state of each potential juror's video recording and transcribed responses is muted, hidden, and unintelligible. Thus, the Judge's program in the invention's website advises the Judge to log into the Judge's program on the date and at the location and time that was previously set and entered by the Judge in the Judge's program and allow the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff to view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present. On the date and at the location and time that was previously set and entered by the Judge in the Judge's program to allow the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff to view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors through the Judge's program with the Judge present, the Judge logs into the Judge's program, and in the Judge's Main Menu of Functions, an option appears labeled &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors.&#x201d; Upon activating the &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; option, the invention's website presents on the Judge's screen the typed formatted name of each potential juror who activated a privatized function when responding to a question in alphabetical order. Directly below each potential juror's typed formatted name will appear each typed formatted question of which the potential juror activated the privatize function. To the left of each of such typed formatted question, the respective video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant that is paired with the typed formatted question will appear. Directly below each typed formatted question with its paired respective video recording of either the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Plaintiff, Defense Attorney, or Defendant, the digitally colored, scrambled, and encrypted transcribed typed formatted response of the potential juror to the respective question appears unintelligible, hidden, and unrecognizable as it appears in a digitally colored form. To the left of each digitally colored, scrambled, and encrypted transcribed typed formatted response of the potential juror, the paired respective pixel quadrant relocated, digitally colored, scrambled, and encrypted video recorded response of the potential juror appears unintelligible, hidden, and unrecognizable as it appears in an encrypted form. To the left of each pixel quadrant relocated, digitally colored, scrambled, and encrypted video recorded response, an interactive function, option or button appears labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">As previously explained above, the invention's code sequence automatically encrypts a potential juror's video recorded response by encoding it using an encryption algorithm, a cipher, generating ciphertext making such response of the potential juror's video recording hidden and unintelligible immediately after the potential juror activates the privatize function. Additionally, as previously explained above, the invention's code sequence automatically encrypts a potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response by encoding it using an encryption algorithm, a cipher, generating ciphertext making the potential juror's respective transcribed typed formatted response hidden and unintelligible immediately after the potential juror activates the privatize function. Also, as previously explained, the invention's code sequence ultimately transfers the potential juror's encrypted video recorded response and respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response into a storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">After the invention's code sequence transfers each potential juror's encrypted video recorded response and respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response into a storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program, the invention's code sequence automatically uses an algorithm and generates a pseudo-random decryption key to decrypt the potential juror's encrypted video recorded response and respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response. Ultimately, the pseudo-random decryption key decrypts the potential juror's encrypted video recorded response and respective encrypted transcribed typed formatted response in the Judge's program and on the Judge's screen when it becomes activated. After generating the pseudo-random decryption key, the invention's code sequence links the key to the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response&#x201d; that appears to the left of the respective pixel quadrant relocated, digitally colored, scrambled, and encrypted video recorded response.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">When the Judge clicks, taps, or activates the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response&#x201d; to the left of a potential juror's pixel quadrant relocated, digitally colored, scrambled, and encrypted video recorded response, the invention's code sequence ultimately changes the imagery and sound of the potential juror's pixel quadrant relocated, digitally colored, scrambled, and encrypted video recorded response and its respective digitally colored, scrambled, and encrypted transcribed typed formatted response back to its original presentable state on the screen in the Judge's program only and not on the server by completing the following functions:</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">1. The code sequence makes the pseudo-random decryption key decrypt each frame of the potential juror's video recorded response and decrypt the respective transcribed typed formatted response.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">2.

Upon removing each pixel quadrant relocated digitalized picture in each frame, the code sequence divides each digitalized picture frame into a grid of small quadrants containing pixels from the digitalized picture. The code sequence then automatically rearranges each quadrant containing pixels from its respective frame back to its original location. The code sequence then replaces each rearranged grid of small quadrants of pixels back onto its respective frame to where the imagery and sound of each frame of the potential juror's video recorded response is returned to its original presentable state.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">In the alternative, if the invention's code sequence was only set to encrypt the potential juror's video recorded response and the respective transcribed typed formatted response, the invention's code sequence will only complete the function listed as numbered 1 above upon the Judge activating the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response.&#x201d; In the alternative, if the invention's code sequence was only set to scramble the potential juror's video recorded response and the respective transcribed typed formatted response, the invention's code sequence will only complete the functions listed as number 2 and 3 above upon the Judge activating the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response.&#x201d; In the alternative, if the invention's code sequence was only set to digitally color and mute the potential juror's video recorded response and digitally color the respective transcribed typed formatted response, the invention's code sequence will only complete the functions listed as number 4 and 5 above upon the Judge activating the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response.&#x201d; In the alternative, if the invention's code sequence was only set to relocate pixel quadrants in each frame of a potential juror's video recorded response, the invention's code sequence will only complete the function listed as number 6 upon the Judge activating the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response.&#x201d; In the alternative, if the invention's code sequence was set to perform a combination of only two or three of the four possible functions of relocating pixel quadrants, digital coloring, scrambling, or encrypting, the invention's code sequence completes only the functions that are listed from 1 through 6 above that are related to, reciprocal with, or correspond with the two or three functions that were set to be performed upon the Judge activating the interactive function, option, or button labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">Upon the code sequence completing one, some, or all of such functions depending on the invention's settings, the imagery and sound of the potential juror's video recorded response appears on the Judge's screen in its original presentable state and becomes playable on the Judge's screen. Thus, the invention's code sequence returns the potential juror's video recorded response to its original intelligible form. Also, the imagery of the respective transcribed typed formatted response appears on the Judge's screen in its original presentable state and becomes readable on the Judge's screen. Thus, the invention's code sequence returns the respective transcribed typed formatted response to its original intelligible form on the Judge's screen. The Judge then can play the potential juror's video recorded response, and the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff can all watch the potential juror's video recorded response. Also, the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff can all read the respective transcribed typed formatted response.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">To clarify, during the entire time each frame of a potential juror's video recorded response that has been privatized appears in its original presentable state and the respective transcribed typed formatted response that has been privatized appears in its original presentable state on the Judge's screen through the Judge's Program after the Judge activates the function labeled &#x201c;Reveal Response,&#x201d; each frame of the potential juror's video recorded response and the respective transcribed typed formatted response appearing on the Judge's screen always remain pixel quadrant relocated, digitally colored, scrambled, and encrypted on the invention's server or non-transitory computer readable storage medium.

After making such deletions, the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of the deleted video recorded response, and the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of the deleted respective transcribed typed formatted response.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">With regard to the in-court jury selection process, the invention provides the Plaintiff Attorney's program and the Defense Attorney's program with a function to help make exercising challenges for cause and peremptory challenges easy for both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney in the in-court jury selection process. Thus, on the screens of both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney where they will be able to view the typed names and their respective analyses, pictures, numbers, and features, as previously described, for all of the potential jurors who made video recorded oral responses into the website will appear an optional function labeled &#x201c;Select and View Jury Box.&#x201d; Upon selecting such option, the attorney will be able to only show on his/her screen the typed names and their respective analyses, pictures, numbers, and features, as previously described, of only the respective potential jurors who become selected to sit in the jury box in the in-court jury selection process which will make exercising challenges for cause and peremptory challenges in the in-court jury selection process easier. In the conventional in-court jury selection process, all potential jurors who have been summoned to court for a jury trial and who actually appear in court to participate in the in-court jury selection process make up the jury pool. The in-court jury selection process typically begins with the court randomly selecting potential juror names out of the jury pool to sit in the jury box. The total number of potential jurors making up the jury pool is larger than the total number of potential jurors making up the jury box. Typically, the total number of potential jurors randomly selected to sit in the jury box is equal to the sum of the following: 1) the number of jurors to be impaneled, 2) the number of alternate jurors that are to be included, 3) the number of peremptory challenges the plaintiff attorney is required to exercise, and 4) the number of peremptory challenges the defense attorney is required to exercise. To illustrate, if 12 jurors are to be impaneled with 2 alternate jurors and if the plaintiff attorney is required to exercise 6 peremptory challenges and if the defense attorney is required to exercise 6 peremptory challenges, the total number of potential jurors to be randomly selected to sit in the jury box would be 26. Once such sum of potential jurors is randomly selected and seated in the jury box, the judge and/or attorneys then ask such potential jurors questions. All other potential jurors in the jury pool who were not selected to sit in the box do not participate in the jury selection process as they are not eligible to sit on the jury unless they are randomly called to sit in the jury box. The Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney may then excuse from jury duty certain potential jurors in the jury box by exercising challenges for cause upon pre-approval by the court. If potential jurors in the jury box become excused with challenges for cause, the court will replace each excused potential juror with a new randomly selected potential juror from the jury pool to sit in the jury box. After the judge and/or attorneys are finished questioning the potential jurors and after the attorneys are finished exercising challenges for cause, the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney then exercise each of their allotted peremptory challenges on the potential jurors of their choice sitting in the jury box which excuses them from jury service. Once the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney exercise all of their peremptory challenges on potential jurors of their choice sitting in the jury box, the remaining juror candidates who have not been excused become the impaneled jury. As a result, the only potential jurors whom attorneys may select from are the potential jurors who become randomly selected to sit in the jury box. By utilizing &#x201c;Select and View Jury Box,&#x201d; an attorney will be able to limit the potential juror names and their respective analyses, pictures, numbers, and features, as previously described, on his/her screen to just the potential jurors who are randomly selected to sit in the jury box for the judge and/or attorneys to question and for the attorneys to make juror selections.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">To properly utilize the &#x201c;Select and View Jury Box&#x201d; feature, each attorney brings with him/her a laptop, tablet, or cellular phone equipped with internet access to court for the in-court jury selection process and logs into the invention's website. Before the court randomly selects the potential jurors to sit in the jury box, each attorney selects the button labeled &#x201c;Select and View Jury Box&#x201d; in the bottom margin of the screen. Upon selecting &#x201c;Select and View Jury Box,&#x201d; a window will appear on each attorney's screen, and it will contain a list of every potential juror who was issued a summons for jury duty in the above captioned case. Every potential juror's name on the said list will appear in alphabetical order. To the left of each potential juror's typed name will appear a small square box. In the bottom margin of such window will appear a button labeled &#x201c;Submit.&#x201d; When the Court randomly calls out potential jurors' names to sit in the jury box, each attorney clicks or taps on the square box to the left of each potential juror's name that is called by the Court. When an attorney clicks or taps on a square next to a potential juror's name, a check mark will appear in the square. After an attorney has made a check mark in the square next to each potential juror that was called, the attorney clicks or taps the &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; button in the window. Upon selecting &#x201c;Submit,&#x201d; the window containing each name in the jury pool will disappear.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">After the window containing each name in the jury pool disappears, the attorney then only will be shown the typed names and their respective analyses, pictures, numbers, and features, as previously described, of each potential juror of whom the attorney checked as being included in the jury box on the attorney's screen. Thus, no other potential juror names and their respective analyses, pictures, numbers, and features will appear on the attorney's screen except for the typed names and their respective analyses, pictures, numbers, and features of each potential juror of whom the attorney checked as being included in the jury box. If any of the remaining potential juror names on the screen were previously highlighted before the window containing each name in the jury pool disappears, such names will still appear highlighted. Also, directly above each remaining potential juror name appearing on the screen, the small rectangular interactive button labeled &#x201c;Challenge for Cause,&#x201d; as previously described, will appear. Additionally, for each potential juror's name that remains on the screen, two small square boxes will appear to the left of each remaining potential juror's confidential typed number from 1 through 10 or combined number. Also, after the window containing each name in the jury pool disappears, the typed name and its respective analyses, picture, numbers, and features, as previously described, of each potential juror of whom the attorney checked as being included in the jury box will be placed in order by the invention based on the respective professional jury consultant's assigned numbers from 1-10, the attorney's assigned numbers from 1-10, or the respective combined numbers from 1-20 or 1-30 depending on the respective attorney's choice as detailed above. Ultimately, the advantage to utilizing the &#x201c;Select and View Jury Box&#x201d; feature is to make viewing the typed names and their respective analyses, pictures, numbers, and features, as previously described, of only the respective potential jurors who were randomly called to sit in the jury box during the in-court jury selection process easier for the attorney by removing all other potential jurors from the attorney's screen which, in turn, will make exercising challenges for cause and peremptory challenges on the potential jurors who were randomly called to sit in the jury box much easier.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">If a potential juror in the jury box becomes replaced by another potential juror from the jury pool in the in-court jury selection process due to either the Plaintiff Attorney's or the Defense Attorney's challenge for cause, the attorney may include the new potential juror on the attorney's screen and remove the replaced potential juror from the attorney's screen by selecting &#x201c;Select and View Jury Box.&#x201d; For an attorney to remove a potential juror that he/she has previously selected, the attorney simply clicks or taps the box containing the check mark next to the potential juror's name, and the check mark will disappear. To add a new potential juror, the attorney simply clicks or taps the box next to the potential juror's name, and a check mark will appear in the box next to his/her name. By clicking or tapping on the &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; button in the bottom margin of the window, the window containing all of the potential jurors' names and boxes next to their names will disappear. Once the window disappears, none of the information of the potential juror of whom the attorney unselected will appear on the attorney's screen, and the typed name of the new potential juror will appear on the attorney's screen. Also, if such new potential juror appearing on the attorney's screen made video recorded oral responses into the website, his/her respective analyses, picture, numbers, and features also will appear on the attorney's screen as previously described. In the window on the screen, the newly selected potential juror's typed name along with any respective analyses, picture, numbers, and features, as previously described, automatically will be placed in whatever order of which all of the other potential juror names are arranged on the attorney's screen.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">To properly utilize the invention's website in the in-court jury selection process, each attorney brings with him/her a laptop, tablet, or cellular phone equipped with internet access to court for the in-court jury selection process and logs into the website. Before the court randomly selects the potential jurors to sit in the jury box, each attorney selects the button labeled &#x201c;Select and View Jury Box&#x201d; in the bottom margin of the screen. When the Court randomly calls out potential jurors' names to sit in the jury box, each attorney clicks or taps on the square box to the left of each potential juror's name that is called by the Court. When an attorney clicks or taps on a square next to a potential juror's name, a check mark will appear in the square. After an attorney has made a check mark in the square next to each potential juror that was called, the attorney clicks or taps the &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; button in the window. Upon selecting &#x201c;Submit,&#x201d; the window containing each name in the jury pool will disappear.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">After the window containing each name in the jury pool disappears, each attorney then only will be shown the typed names and their respective analyses, pictures, numbers, and features, as previously described, of each potential juror of whom the respective attorney checked as being included in the jury box on the respective attorney's screen. Thus, no other potential juror names and their respective analyses, pictures, numbers, and features will appear on the respective attorney's screen except for the typed names and their respective analyses, pictures, numbers, and features of each potential juror of whom the attorney checked as being included in the jury box. If any of the remaining potential juror names on the screen were previously highlighted before the window containing each name in the jury pool disappears, such names will still appear highlighted. Also, directly above each remaining potential juror name appearing on the screen, the small rectangular interactive button labeled &#x201c;Challenge for Cause,&#x201d; as previously described, will appear. Additionally, for each potential juror's name that remains on the screen, two small square boxes will appear to the left of each remaining potential juror's confidential typed number from 1 through 10 or combined number. Also, after the window containing each name in the jury pool disappears, the typed name and its respective analyses, picture, numbers, and features, as previously described, of each potential juror of whom the attorney checked as being included in the jury box will be placed in order based on the respective professional jury consultant's assigned numbers from 1-10, the attorney's assigned numbers from 1-10, or the respective combined numbers from 1-20 or 1-30 depending on the respective attorney's choice as detailed above.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">As discussed previously, each attorney is instructed to highlight each potential juror's name he/she desires to exclude with a challenge for cause before the in-court jury selection process begins. In the in-court jury selection process and after the window containing each name in the jury pool disappears on the screen, each attorney then reviews his/her grounds to exclude each potential juror under each highlighted potential juror's name that remains on the screen. The judge and/or attorneys then may question the potential jurors in the jury box and ask follow up questions that were not asked of the potential jurors in the invention's website. Each attorney then exercises his/her challenges for cause on each potential juror whose name appears highlighted on the attorney's screen by arguing to the Court the ground(s) to exclude each potential juror that appear on the attorney's screen underneath each potential juror's highlighted name. Every time a challenge for cause is approved by the court and a potential juror is excused with a challenge for cause and the court randomly selects a new potential juror from the jury pool to replace the excused potential juror, each attorney replaces the excused potential juror from the jury box with the new potential juror from the jury pool on his/her screen in the website by using the &#x201c;Select and View Jury Box&#x201d; feature as previously described.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">After the judge and/or attorneys have finished questioning the potential jurors in the jury box and after the attorneys have finished exercising challenges for cause, each attorney exercises their allotted number of peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion. Each attorney simply exercises their peremptory challenges on the potential jurors with the highest numbers on his/her screen. For example, if an attorney placed each potential juror's name in order based on its respective professional jury consultant's assigned number from 1-10, the typed name and its respective analyses, picture, numbers, and features, as previously described, of each potential juror of whom the attorney checked as being included in the jury box will be placed in order on the attorney's screen based on the respective professional jury consultant's assigned number from 1-10. Each potential juror's name assigned a confidential number of 10 will appear in alphabetical order at the top of the screen. Each potential juror's name assigned a confidential number of 9 will appear in alphabetical order below the last potential juror's name assigned a number of 10 on the screen etc. Once again, the confidential number of 10 represents the strongest desire to exclude a potential juror, and a confidential number of 1 represents the least desire to exclude a potential juror. If each attorney is allotted 6 peremptory challenges, each attorney would exercise a peremptory challenge on the 6 potential jurors with the highest numbers from 1 to 10 on his/her screen in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">As previously described, to help each attorney keep track of his/her peremptory challenge exercises and the opposing attorney's peremptory challenge exercises in the in-court jury selection process, two small square boxes will appear to the left of each potential juror's combined number or confidential typed number from 1 through 10 which places the potential juror's name in order with all other potential juror names. The small square box on the left is for the purpose of marking the Plaintiff Attorney's peremptory challenge exercise, and the small square box on the right is for the purpose of marking the Defense Attorney's peremptory challenge exercise. After the Plaintiff Attorney exercises a peremptory challenge on a potential juror in the in-court jury selection process, both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney, on their respective screens, are instructed to click or tap on the square box on the left designated for the potential juror's name. Upon clicking or tapping on the square box, a check mark appears in the box. By clicking or tapping on the check mark in the box, the check mark will disappear. The check mark in the square box on the left indicates to both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney that the Plaintiff Attorney has exercised a peremptory challenge on the potential juror which helps both attorneys keep track of the Plaintiff Attorney's peremptory challenge exercises.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">Likewise, after the Defense Attorney exercises a peremptory challenge on a potential juror in the in-court jury selection process, both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney, on their respective screens, are instructed to click or tap on the square box on the right designated for the potential juror's name. Upon clicking or tapping on the square box, a check mark appears in the box. By clicking or tapping on the check mark in the box, the check mark will disappear. The check mark in the square box on the right indicates to both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney that the Defense Attorney has exercised a peremptory challenge on the potential juror which helps both attorneys keep track of the Defense Attorney's peremptory challenge exercises.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Furthermore, the invention's website is equipped with security features that prevent any participant from accessing a program of another participant and prevent any nonparticipant from the public from accessing any program in the invention's website. As explained previously, the invention's process sends an email message containing a different confidential code consisting of letters and numbers to each of the following participants in the same particular case: Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Court Reporter, Court Administrator, and if the case is civil, the Plaintiff. Each different confidential code can only access its respective designated program in the invention's website. Additionally, each potential juror who is summoned for jury duty in the same particular case is mailed a summons for jury duty. Enclosed with each summons is a different confidential code for the respective potential juror to access his/her designated program in the invention's website. Each different confidential code mailed to a potential juror can only access its respective designated program for the respective potential juror and no other program designated for any other potential juror or program designated for any other participant in the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">As previously explained, each time a participant which includes each potential juror logs into his/her respective program, he/she is required to enter his/her respective confidential code. Upon successful entry of a confidential code, the participant is shown a new screen where he/she is required to enter his/her own 6-digit numerical code that is different from his/her issued confidential code. The 6-digit numerical code is made by the participant. The purpose of requiring a participant to enter a 6-digit numerical code is to provide a participant with a second layer of protection against someone else entering the participant's program. For example, if someone stole a participant's confidential code, he/she likely would not know the 6-digit numerical code that was made up by the participant which would deter him/her from entering the participant's program.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">Once the participant successfully enters his/her 6-digit numerical code, the participant then is required to take a picture of him/herself into the invention's website using a webcam. The invention's website captures the picture. Additionally, the invention's code sequence has facial recognition capability. The invention requires the participant to face the webcam on his/her device, look straight into the webcam for a few seconds, and move his/her head from side to side and up and down in front of the webcam. While the participant faces the webcam on his/her device, looks straight into the webcam for a few seconds, moves his/her head from side to side and up and down in front of the webcam, the invention's code sequence automatically calculates the geometry of his/her face by calculating and recording the distance between his/her eyes and the distance from his/her forehead to chin. Also, the invention's code sequence identifies, calculates, and records facial landmarks that are critical to distinguishing his/her face, and stores such data.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">Ultimately, each time a participant logs into the invention's website, he/she must first enter his/her confidential code. Then, he/she enters his/her six-digit numerical code, and then he/she takes a picture of his/herself into the invention's website using a webcam. Each time the participant takes a picture of his/herself after the invention's website captured the participant's initial first picture that the participant took using a webcam, the invention's code sequence immediately automatically calculates the geometry of his/her face by calculating and recording the distance between his/her eyes and the distance from his/her forehead to chin. Also, the invention's code sequence identifies, calculates, and records facial landmarks that are critical to distinguishing his/her face. The invention's code sequence then compares such calculations with the data the invention's code sequence previously stored. If such calculations match the data the invention's code sequence previously stored, the invention's code sequence advances the participant to his/her respective main menu of functions. If such calculations do not match the data the invention's code sequence previously stored, the invention's code sequence does not allow the participant to advance to his/her respective main menu of functions.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Additionally, each time a participant takes his/her picture with a webcam and the invention's website captures the picture, the invention reduces the picture to thumbnail size and places it at the bottom of the screen in a window. The date and time the picture was taken is then automatically placed above the picture by the invention's code sequence. Also, each time the participant logs into the invention's website and takes a picture of him/herself into the website and is reduced to thumbnail size, it is placed next to the previous picture of the participant in the window. The purpose of the pictures is to prove to the participant that no one else entered his/her program which will make the participant supremely confident that his/her work product and/or communications are secure. Thus, the participant can review each picture in the window. If someone else somehow hacked the confidential code and the numerical code of a participant and entered the participant's program, the hacker would have had to have made a picture of him/herself or someone else into the website before being allowed to advance to the main menu of functions. Therefore, a picture of the hacker or someone else would show up on a thumbnail picture next to the participant's pictures. If the participant sees a picture of the hacker or someone else in the window, the participant will know for sure that his/her program was hacked, and he/she will be instructed to notify the court and the parties of the hack.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">Additionally, the invention's code sequence prevents a participant or a hacker to copy and paste a previous picture of the participant into the window designated for the participant's pictures. Thus, a hacker would not be able to copy and paste a picture into the designated window containing thumbnail pictures of the participant and place it next to the other pictures in the designated window because the only way a picture can be made in the window is if a picture is taken through a webcam and into the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">Also, to make the participant more confident that his/her pictures will not be copied and pasted by a hacker, the participant is instructed by the invention's website to wear different clothes or items that will show up in the picture so every picture of the participant is easily distinguishable from all others. Thus, if every picture is clearly and easily distinguishable from every other picture, the participant will definitely know that none of his/her pictures were copied and pasted. If a participant somehow discovered that two or more of his/her pictures are identical, he/she can assume his/her program has been hacked and will be instructed by the invention's website to report the hack to the court and the parties. Ultimately, if the participant only sees different pictures of him/herself in the window and if the participant does not see any blank pictures or pictures of someone else, the participant will know with supreme confidence that no one else hacked into his/her respective program.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">Furthermore, such a picture security feature of the invention's process might have the effect of deterring a hacker from making a picture and entering a participant's program. Thus, if a hacker somehow made it past the two different layers of security codes in a participant's program and realizes that he/she can only enter a participant's program after making a picture, he/she will discover that if he/she makes a picture of him/herself or someone else into the window he/she will leave clear visible evidence behind that the participant's program has been hacked. Leaving such evidence might deter some hackers from making such a picture and entering the program.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">Additionally, if a participant successfully enters his/her program and then leaves his/her computer, tablet, or cell phone unattended, the invention's process has a security feature that prevents an unauthorized user from viewing the participant's work product and communications and potential jurors' responses. Thus, after a participant makes a picture of him/herself into the website and accesses his/her respective program, the invention's website will cover his/her screen with a privacy screen that will contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code if the participant does not scroll or use any features within 5 minutes from previously scrolling or using a feature. The privacy screen will completely block the participant's entire screen. Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical screen, the privacy screen disappears.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">Furthermore, the invention has an additional feature to protect the privacy of each potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses. Thus, the invention has a feature to prevent an unauthorized person from viewing any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website, and the invention prevents an authorized or unauthorized person from video recording and/or making an audio recording and/or electronically communicating any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses while viewing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website. In summary, the invention monitors each participant through the webcam on the participant's personal computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet when the participant views a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website. If the invention detects more than one person in the view of the webcam, the invention's website will immediately cover the entire screen on the personal computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet with a privacy screen that will contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code. Such privacy screen will prevent the participant and any unauthorized person from viewing and listening to the video recorded and transcribed responses of any potential juror through the invention's website. Such a feature will prevent an authorized participant from showing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses to an unauthorized person through the invention's website. Additionally, if the invention detects a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording and/or capable of communicating such as a camcorder, tape recorder, two way radios, cellular phone, or blue tooth device, the invention's website will immediately cover the entire screen on the personal computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet with a privacy screen that will contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code. Such privacy screen will prevent anyone who is using the technological device from viewing and listening to the video recorded and transcribed responses of any potential juror through the invention's website which ultimately will prevent anyone who is using the technological device from electronically communicating and/or making a video and/or audio recording of any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses that becomes presented through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">In more particular detail, the invention's code sequence stores thousands of different images of technological devices in all different angles and positions that are capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating. The invention's code sequence also stores data of basic characteristics to identify a human being. The invention requires the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Court Reporter, and Plaintiff to view each potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website while being monitored and video recorded by an unobstructed and operable webcam. During the entire time each of such participants views the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses presented through the invention's website in front of an unobstructed and operable webcam, the invention makes a continuous video recording of the participant. While making a video recording of the participant, the invention's code sequence has image recognition capability which simultaneously parses each frame of the video footage to identify recognizable images that correspond to any of the thousands of different images of technological devices that are capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating which are stored in the code sequence. If the invention identifies a recognizable image that corresponds to any of the thousands of different images of technological devices that are capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating which are stored in the code sequence, the invention's website will immediately cover the entire screen on the personal computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet with a privacy screen that will contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code. Such privacy screen will prevent anyone who is using the technological device from viewing and listening to the video recorded and transcribed responses of any potential juror through the invention's website. In addition, the privacy screen will advise the participant that a technological device capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating was detected, and the participant will not be allowed to view and/or listen to any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website while such device is detected. The privacy screen also will advise the participant that no participant is allowed to make a video recording and/or an audio recording or electronically communicate any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses that are presented through the invention's website. The privacy screen further instructs the participant to turn off the device and remove the device from detection, and upon turning off the device and removing the device from detection, the participant needs to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen and view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses. Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately begins video recording and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Additionally, while making a video recording of the participant, the invention's code sequence has image recognition capability which simultaneously parses each frame of the video footage to identify more than one recognizable image of a human being that corresponds to the data of the basic characteristics of a human being which is stored in the code sequence. If the invention identifies more than one recognizable image of a human being in the same frame of the video footage and each identified recognizable image of a human being corresponds to the data of basic characteristics to identify a human being which is stored in the code sequence, the invention's website will immediately cover the entire screen on the personal computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet with a privacy screen that will contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code. Such privacy screen will prevent the participant and any unauthorized person from viewing and listening to the video recorded and transcribed responses of any potential juror through the invention's website. Such a feature will prevent an authorized participant from showing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses to an unauthorized person through the invention's website. In addition, the privacy screen will advise the participant that at least one other person was detected while viewing the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses, and the participant will not be allowed to view any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website while another person is detected. The privacy screen further will explain that only the participant is allowed to view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in his/her respective program in the invention's website, and the participant is not allowed to be accompanied by anyone else when viewing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website to protect the potential jurors' privacy. The privacy screen further instructs the participant to remove all other people from the room, and upon removal of all other people from the room, the participant needs to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen and view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses. Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately begins video recording and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above. Ultimately, if the invention does not detect a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording or capable of communicating and does not detect more than one person viewing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses during the entire time the participant views potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses in his/her respective program in the invention's website, the invention will not make the privacy screen appear on the participant's screen.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">Furthermore, after the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Court Reporter, or Plaintiff successfully enters his/her respective program and selects the function to view the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses from his/her respective main menu of functions, the invention will immediately cover the entire screen with the above mentioned privacy screen to prevent the participant from viewing and listening to any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses, and the invention will immediately scan the computer, cellular phone, tablet, or other electronic device for an unobstructed and operable webcam. If the invention detects an unobstructed and operable webcam on the participant's device, the privacy screen will still remain on the screen, and the invention immediately begins video recording and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above while the privacy screen still remains on the screen. If the invention does not detect a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating and if the invention does not detect more than one human being, the invention removes the privacy screen from the participant's screen and presents the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in the manner as detailed above through the participant's respective program in the invention's website, and the invention continues to video record and simultaneously uses its image recognition capability as described above.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">However, if the invention does not detect an unobstructed and operable webcam while initially scanning the participant's computer, cellular phone, tablet, or other electronic device for an unobstructed and operable webcam while the privacy screen still remains on the participant's screen, the invention's website will make the privacy screen remain on the screen, and the invention's website will make the privacy screen say that the participant must be monitored by an unobstructed and operable webcam when viewing any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses. The invention's website also will make the privacy screen say that the webcam on the device the participant is using to view the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses is either obstructed or inoperable, and the participant will need to either remove the obstruction from the webcam on his/her device, fix or replace the webcam on his/her device, or use a different device with an unobstructed and operable webcam to view the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses. The invention also will make the privacy screen contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code. The invention's website also will make the privacy screen say that if the participant's webcam is merely blocked or obstructed the participant simply needs to remove the obstruction and then needs to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen and view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website. Additionally, the invention's website will make the privacy screen say that if the participant's webcam is inoperable he/she should log out of the website and fix or replace the webcam or use a different device to log back into the invention's website to view the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately scans the participant's computer, cellular phone, tablet, or other electronic device for an unobstructed and operable webcam. If the invention detects an obstructed or inoperable webcam on the participant's device, the privacy screen with all of the above said advisements and the window for the participant to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code will still remain on the participant's screen.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">If the invention detects an unobstructed and operable webcam on the participant's device, all of the above said advisements on the privacy screen and the window for the participant to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code will immediately disappear, but the privacy screen will still remain on the screen. Also, the invention immediately begins video recording and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above while the privacy screen still remains on the screen. If the invention does not detect a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating and if the invention does not detect more than one human being, the invention removes the privacy screen from the participant's screen and presents the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in the manner as detailed above, and the invention continues to video record and simultaneously uses its image recognition capability as described above.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">However, if the invention identifies a recognizable image that corresponds to any of the thousands of different images of technological devices that are capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating which are stored in the code sequence, the invention will make the privacy screen remain on the participant's screen and will make it say that a technological device capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating was detected, and the participant will not be allowed to view and/or listen to any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website while such device is detected. The invention also will make the privacy screen say that no participant is allowed to make a video recording and/or an audio recording or electronically communicate any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses that are presented through the invention's website. The invention also will make the privacy screen contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code. The invention also will make the privacy screen instruct the participant to turn off the device and remove the device from detection, and upon turning off the device and removing the device from detection, the participant needs to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen and view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">Additionally or in the alternative, if the invention identifies more than one recognizable image of a human being in the same frame of the video footage and each identified recognizable image of a human being corresponds to the data of basic characteristics to identify a human being which is stored in the code sequence, the invention will make the privacy screen remain on the participant's screen and will make it say that more than one person was detected, and the participant will not be allowed to view any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website while another person is detected. The invention also will make the privacy screen say that only the participant is allowed to view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in his/her respective program in the invention's website, and the participant is not allowed to be accompanied by anyone else when viewing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website to protect the potential jurors' privacy. If the invention had not already made the window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code appear on the privacy screen, the invention will make the privacy screen contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code. The invention will further make the privacy screen say that the participant will need to remove all other people from the room, and upon removal of all other people from the room, the participant needs to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen and view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately begins video recording and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above while the privacy screen still remains on the screen. If the invention does not detect a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating but the invention does detect more than one human being, the invention removes all advisements pertaining to the detected technological device from the privacy screen if such advisements were on the privacy screen but does not remove the advisements pertaining to more than one person on the privacy screen and does not remove the window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">Conversely, once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately begins video recording and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above while the privacy screen still remains on the screen. If the invention does detect a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating but the invention does not detect more than one human being, the invention removes all advisements pertaining to more than one human being from the privacy screen if such advisements were on the privacy screen but does not remove the advisements pertaining to detecting a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating on the privacy screen and does not remove the window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately begins video recording and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above while the privacy screen still remains on the screen. If the invention does not detect a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating and if the invention does not detect more than one human being, the invention removes the privacy screen from the participant's screen and presents the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in the manner as detailed above, and the invention continues to video record and simultaneously uses its image recognition capability as described above.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">However, each time the Judge logs into the Judge's program and selects the option labeled &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; from the Judge's Main Menu of Functions which is thoroughly described above, the invention uses its image recognition capability in the exact same way and manner as detailed above but only to detect a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording and/or capable of communicating, and the invention does not use its image recognition capability to detect more than one human being. As a result, if the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors presented through the Judge's program in the invention's website with the Judge present in front of an unobstructed and operable webcam, the invention's website will not cover the Judge's screen with a privacy screen for the reason of more than one human being viewing the privatized potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses. However, if the invention detects a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording and/or capable of communicating, the invention's website will cover the Judge's entire screen with a privacy screen in the exact way and manner as described above. The reason the invention does not use its image recognition capability to detect more than one human being each time the Judge selects the option labeled &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; is because the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff are not allowed to view such privatized potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses in his/her respective program, and they are only allowed to view such privatized potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses in the Judge's program with the Judge present as described above.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">As stated above, during the entire time each participant views the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses presented through the invention's website in front of an unobstructed and operable webcam, the invention makes a continuous video recording of the participant. To ensure the privacy interests of each participant, the invention automatically deletes each video recording of a participant viewing the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses immediately after the participant closes out the function of viewing the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses in his/her respective program, and the invention automatically deletes all metadata of each deleted video recording of a participant. Additionally, to ensure the privacy interests of each participant, the invention's website prevents the participant and any other human being from viewing the video recording of the participant viewing the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses in the invention's website before the invention automatically deletes the video recording of the participant viewing the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses. Thus, the invention's website does not allow anyone to access the video recording of any participant viewing the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">In the alternative, the invention's website can be set to allow the Judge to view the portion of any participant's video recording where the participant is shown with at least one other person and/or is shown using a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording and/or capable of communicating while viewing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses. Thus, if the invention's website is set to allow the Judge to view the portion of any participant's video recording where the participant is shown with at least one other person and/or is shown using a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording and/or capable of communicating, the Judge's Main Menu of Functions in the invention's website will include a function labeled &#x201c;View Possible Violations in Participant's Video Recordings.&#x201d; If the invention's website detects more than one human being in a participant's video recording and/or detects a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording and/or capable of communicating, the invention's website makes a copy of only the frames in the video recording of the participant that contain more than one human being or a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording and/or capable of communicating, and places the copy in a storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program. The invention then links the copy to the function labeled &#x201c;View Possible Violations in Participant's Video Recordings.&#x201d; The invention then groups the copy of the video recording with the name of the participant and the name of the participant's program from where the copy was made. When the Judge selects the function labeled &#x201c;View Possible Violations in Participant's Video Recordings&#x201d; from the Judge's Main menu of Functions, the name of the participant appears at the top of the Judge's screen. Directly below the name of the participant, the label of the participant's program appears. Directly below the label of the participant's program, the copy of the portion of the video recording from the participant's respective program that is in a storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program appears in a playable state. When the Judge activates the copy of the video recording by clicking or tapping on it, it plays on the Judge's screen through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">For example, if the plaintiff's name was John Doe, and the invention detected more than one human being in a video recording while the invention was presenting a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the Plaintiff's Program, the invention would make a copy of each frame containing more than one human being and transfer the copy to a storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program. The invention then links the copy to the function labeled &#x201c;View Possible Violations in Participant's Video Recordings.&#x201d; The invention then groups the name John Doe and Plaintiff's Program with the copy. When the Judge selects the function labeled &#x201c;View Possible Violations in Participant's Video Recordings&#x201d; from the Judge's Main menu of Functions, the name &#x201c;John Doe&#x201d; appears at the top of the Judge's screen. Directly below the name &#x201c;John Doe,&#x201d; the label &#x201c;Plaintiff s Program&#x201d; appears. Directly below the label &#x201c;Plaintiff's Program,&#x201d; the copy of the portion of the video recording from the Plaintiff's Program that is in a storage that can only be accessed by the Judge's program appears in a playable state. When the Judge activates the copy of the video recording by clicking or tapping on it, it plays on the Judge's screen through the invention's website. Upon reviewing the copy of the video recording, the Judge can decide whether or not the Plaintiff should be admonished.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">In the alternative, the invention can be set to use its image recognition capability in the exact same manner as detailed above except without video recording each authorized participant who views the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses. The reason for such a setting is to protect the privacy interests of each participant. Thus, if the invention's image recognition capability is set monitoring the participant through his/her webcam without video recording him/her, the invention monitors each participant through the webcam on the participant's device while he/she views the video recorded and transcribed responses without the invention making a video recording of the participant. In more particular detail, the invention's code sequence stores thousands of different images of technological devices in all different angles and positions that are capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating. The invention's code sequence also stores data of basic characteristics to identify a human being. The invention requires the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Court Reporter, and Plaintiff to view each potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website while being monitored by an unobstructed and operable webcam. During the entire time each of such participants views the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses presented through the invention's website in front of an unobstructed and operable webcam, the invention continuously monitors the participant through his/her webcam. While monitoring the participant through the website, the invention's code sequence has image recognition capability which simultaneously parses the imagery captured through the webcam to identify recognizable images that correspond to any of the thousands of different images of technological devices that are capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating which are stored in the code sequence. If the invention identifies a recognizable image that corresponds to any of the thousands of different images of technological devices that are capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating which are stored in the code sequence, the invention's website will immediately cover the entire screen on the personal computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet with a privacy screen that will contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code. Such privacy screen will prevent anyone who is using the technological device from viewing and listening to the video recorded and transcribed responses of any potential juror through the invention's website. In addition, the privacy screen will advise the participant that a technological device capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating was detected, and the participant will not be allowed to view and/or listen to any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website while such device is detected. The privacy screen also will advise the participant that no participant is allowed to make a video recording and/or an audio recording or electronically communicate any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses that are presented through the invention's website. The privacy screen further instructs the participant to turn off the device and remove the device from detection, and upon turning off the device and removing the device from detection, the participant needs to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen and view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses. Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately begins video recording and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">Additionally, while the invention continuously monitors the participant while he/she views the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses, the invention's code sequence has image recognition capability which simultaneously parses the imagery captured by the invention through the webcam to identify more than one recognizable image of a human being that corresponds to the data of the basic characteristics of a human being which is stored in the code sequence. If the invention identifies more than one recognizable image of a human being in the imagery captured by the invention through the webcam and each identified recognizable image of a human being corresponds to the data of basic characteristics to identify a human being which is stored in the code sequence, the invention's website will immediately cover the entire screen on the personal computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet with a privacy screen that will contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code. Such privacy screen will prevent the participant and any unauthorized person from viewing and listening to the video recorded and transcribed responses of any potential juror through the invention's website. Such a feature will prevent an authorized participant from showing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses to an unauthorized person through the invention's website. In addition, the privacy screen will advise the participant that at least one other person was detected while viewing the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses, and the participant will not be allowed to view any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website while another person is detected. The privacy screen further will explain that only the participant is allowed to view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in his/her respective program in the invention's website, and the participant is not allowed to be accompanied by anyone else when viewing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website to protect the potential jurors' privacy. The privacy screen further instructs the participant to remove all other people from the room, and upon removal of all other people from the room, the participant needs to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen and view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses. Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately begins monitoring and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above. Ultimately, if the invention does not detect a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording or capable of communicating and does not detect more than one person viewing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses during the entire time the participant views potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses in his/her respective program in the invention's website, the invention will not make the privacy screen appear on the participant's screen.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">Furthermore, after the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, Court Reporter, or Plaintiff successfully enters his/her respective program and selects the function to view the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses from his/her respective main menu of functions, the invention will immediately cover the entire screen with the above mentioned privacy screen to prevent the participant from viewing and listening to any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses, and the invention will immediately scan the computer, cellular phone, tablet, or other electronic device for an unobstructed and operable webcam. If the invention detects an unobstructed and operable webcam on the participant's device, the privacy screen will still remain on the screen, and the invention immediately begins monitoring through the webcam and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above while the privacy screen still remains on the screen. If the invention does not detect a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating and if the invention does not detect more than one human being, the invention removes the privacy screen from the participant's screen and presents the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in the manner as detailed above through the participant's respective program in the invention's website, and the invention continues to monitor and simultaneously use its image recognition capability as described above.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">However, if the invention does not detect an unobstructed and operable webcam while initially scanning the participant's computer, cellular phone, tablet, or other electronic device for an unobstructed and operable webcam while the privacy screen still remains on the participant's screen, the invention's website will make the privacy screen remain on the screen, and the invention's website will make the privacy screen say that the participant must be monitored by an unobstructed and operable webcam when viewing any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses. The invention's website also will make the privacy screen say that the webcam on the device the participant is using to view the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses is either obstructed or inoperable, and the participant will need to either remove the obstruction from the webcam on his/her device, fix or replace the webcam on his/her device, or use a different device with an unobstructed and operable webcam to view the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses. The invention also will make the privacy screen contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code. The invention's website also will make the privacy screen say that if the participant's webcam is merely blocked or obstructed the participant simply needs to remove the obstruction and then needs to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen and view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website. Additionally, the invention's website will make the privacy screen say that if the participant's webcam is inoperable he/she should log out of the website and fix or replace the webcam or use a different device to log back into the invention's website to view the potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately scans the participant's computer, cellular phone, tablet, or other electronic device for an unobstructed and operable webcam. If the invention detects an obstructed or inoperable webcam on the participant's device, the privacy screen with all of the above said advisements and the window for the participant to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code will still remain on the participant's screen.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">If the invention detects an unobstructed and operable webcam on the participant's device, all of the above said advisements on the privacy screen and the window for the participant to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code will immediately disappear, but the privacy screen will still remain on the screen. Also, the invention immediately begins monitoring and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above while the privacy screen still remains on the screen. If the invention does not detect a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating and if the invention does not detect more than one human being, the invention removes the privacy screen from the participant's screen and presents the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in the manner as detailed above, and the invention continues to monitor and simultaneously use its image recognition capability as described above.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">However, if the invention identifies a recognizable image that corresponds to any of the thousands of different images of technological devices that are capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating which are stored in the code sequence, the invention will make the privacy screen remain on the participant's screen and will make it say that a technological device capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating was detected, and the participant will not be allowed to view and/or listen to any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website while such device is detected. The invention also will make the privacy screen say that no participant is allowed to make a video recording and/or an audio recording or electronically communicate any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses that are presented through the invention's website. The invention also will make the privacy screen contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code. The invention also will make the privacy screen instruct the participant to turn off the device and remove the device from detection, and upon turning off the device and removing the device from detection, the participant needs to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen and view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">Additionally or in the alternative, if the invention identifies more than one recognizable image of a human being in the imagery captured by the invention through the webcam and each identified recognizable image of a human being corresponds to the data of basic characteristics to identify a human being which is stored in the code sequence, the invention will make the privacy screen remain on the participant's screen and will make it say that more than one person was detected, and the participant will not be allowed to view any potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website while another person is detected. The invention also will make the privacy screen say that only the participant is allowed to view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in his/her respective program in the invention's website, and the participant is not allowed to be accompanied by anyone else when viewing a potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses through the invention's website to protect the potential jurors' privacy. If the invention had not already made the window for the participant to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code appear on the privacy screen, the invention will make the privacy screen contain a window for the participant to enter his/her 6-digit numerical code. The invention will further make the privacy screen say that the participant will need to remove all other people from the room, and upon removal of all other people from the room, the participant needs to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen and view the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately begins monitoring and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above while the privacy screen still remains on the screen. If the invention does not detect a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating but the invention does detect more than one human being, the invention removes all advisements pertaining to the detected technological device from the privacy screen if such advisements were on the privacy screen but does not remove the advisements pertaining to more than one person on the privacy screen and does not remove the window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">Conversely, once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately begins monitoring and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above while the privacy screen still remains on the screen. If the invention does detect a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating but the invention does not detect more than one human being, the invention removes all advisements pertaining to more than one human being from the privacy screen if such advisements were on the privacy screen but does not remove the advisements pertaining to detecting a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating on the privacy screen and does not remove the window for the participant to enter his/her 6 digit numerical code.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">Once the participant enters his/her 6-digit numerical code to remove the privacy screen, the invention immediately begins monitoring and simultaneously using its image recognition capability as described above while the privacy screen still remains on the screen. If the invention does not detect a technological device that is capable of making a video recording and/or audio recording or capable of communicating and if the invention does not detect more than one human being, the invention removes the privacy screen from the participant's screen and presents the potential juror's video recorded and transcribed responses in the manner as detailed above, and the invention continues to monitor and simultaneously use its image recognition capability as described above.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">However, each time the Judge logs into the Judge's program and selects the option labeled &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; from the Judge's Main Menu of Functions which is thoroughly described above, the invention uses its image recognition capability in the exact same way and manner as detailed above but only to detect a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording and/or capable of communicating, and the invention does not use its image recognition capability to detect more than one human being. As a result, if the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff view the privatized video recorded responses of potential jurors presented through the Judge's program in the invention's website with the Judge present in front of an unobstructed and operable webcam, the invention's website will not cover the Judge's screen with a privacy screen for the reason of more than one human being viewing the privatized potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses. However, if the invention detects a technological device that is capable of making a video and/or audio recording and/or capable of communicating, the invention's website will cover the Judge's entire screen with a privacy screen in the exact way and manner as described above. The reason the invention does not use its image recognition capability to detect more than one human being each time the Judge selects the option labeled &#x201c;View Privatized Video Recorded Responses of Potential Jurors&#x201d; is because the plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, defendant, and if the case is civil, the plaintiff are not allowed to view such privatized potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses in his/her respective program, and they are only allowed to view such privatized potential jurors' video recorded and transcribed responses in the Judge's program with the Judge present as described above.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">Also, in the main menu of functions in the Judge's program only, a function will appear where the Judge will have the discretion to prevent both the Plaintiff and the Defendant from being allowed to access their respective programs thereby preventing them from completing the previously described tasks designated for the Plaintiff and the Defendant respectively through the invention's website. Due to a potential juror's right to privacy, some Judges in a state jurisdiction and/or the federal jurisdiction may worry that Plaintiffs and Defendants may not abide by the judge's order prohibiting the disclosure of the potential jurors' responses if they are allowed to access their respective programs in the invention's website. To relieve a Judge of such worry, he/she can use such function to prevent both the Plaintiff and the Defendant from being allowed to access their respective programs. The Plaintiff Attorney's program will advise the Plaintiff Attorney that he/she may allow the Plaintiff, if the case is civil, to view the potential jurors' video recorded responses and transcribed responses through the Plaintiff Attorney's program if the Judge prevents the Plaintiff from accessing the Plaintiff s program in the invention's website. However, the Plaintiff Attorney's program will advise the Plaintiff Attorney not to reveal any of the Plaintiff Attorney's confidential codes to the Plaintiff. Likewise, the Defense Attorney's program will advise the Defense Attorney that he/she may allow the Defendant to view the potential jurors' video recorded responses and transcribed responses through the Defense Attorney's program if the Judge prevents the Defendant from accessing the Defendant's program in the invention's website. However, the Defense Attorney's program will advise the Defense Attorney not to reveal any of the Defense Attorney's confidential codes to the Defendant.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">Additionally, a Judge may initially allow both the Plaintiff and the Defendant to access their respective programs and complete their respective functions as previously explained, but if either the Plaintiff or the Defendant violates the Judge's order prohibiting the disclosure of any of the potential jurors' responses, the Judge can use the function preventing both the Plaintiff and the Defendant from accessing their respective programs and deny them further access to the invention's website to ensure that none of the potential jurors' responses will be revealed to any unauthorized user. Once again, if the Judge prevents the Plaintiff and the Defendant from accessing their respective programs, the Plaintiff and the Defendant will be allowed to view the potential jurors' video recorded responses and transcribed responses in their respective attorney's program as described above.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">Finally, the invention's website also comes with a delete function in the Court Administrator's main menu of functions for a particular case. The delete function deletes all information entered into the invention's website for a particular case which includes each potential juror's video recording and transcribed responses. The delete function is very important for potential juror privacy. The quicker each potential juror's video recording and transcribed responses for a particular case are deleted in the invention's website the less opportunity for an unauthorized user to view such video recorded and transcribed responses. In the invention's website, all information entered into it for a particular case can be deleted at anytime; however, the Court Administrator cannot use the delete function for a particular case without the consent of both the Judge and the Court Reporter in the particular case. Thus, the Court Reporter is required to print the email messages described above and all transcriptions in the invention's website as described above and file them in the court's sealed file for the respective case to preserve any issues for appeal purposes. As a result, the Court Administrator is not allowed to delete each potential juror's video recording and transcribed responses in the website for a particular case until the Court Reporter completes such tasks and ultimately consents to deleting all information in the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">Additionally, the Court Administrator is not allowed to use the delete function for a particular case without the consent of the Judge in the particular case. To ensure potential juror privacy, some Judges may desire to have all information that was entered into the invention's website for a particular case deleted immediately after the in-court jury selection process has been completed and after the Court Reporter has printed the email messages described above and all transcriptions in the invention's website as described above and filed them in the court's sealed file for the respective case. Conversely, to ensure each potential juror's video recording for a particular case in the invention's website is preserved for appeal and can be reviewed by the appellate courts, some Judges may not want the potential juror video recordings for a particular case deleted until after the appeal process has been completed. Ultimately, the invention's website accommodates the Judge's preference as to when he/she desires to delete all information entered into the website for a particular case by requiring the Court Administrator to obtain the consent of both the Judge and the Court Reporter before he/she deletes all information entered into the website for a particular case.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">Furthermore, after the Court Administrator activates the delete all case information function in the invention's website, the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all information in every participant's program and potential juror's program. After making such deletions, the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of deleted video recordings, and the invention's code sequence automatically deletes all metadata of any typed formatted letters and words that become deleted.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">The following is an alternative way of explaining and describing the invention's above described process. However, this alternative way of explaining and describing the invention's above described process does not include every feature of the invention's process that is described above or in the rest of this patent specification. Therefore, this alternative way of explaining and describing the invention's above described process does not in any way limit the invention's above described process. Thus, the above described process alternatively can be explained and described as follows:</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">A process comprising steps embodied in an executable computer program consisting of a code sequence stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium for capturing video and audio recordings depicting interviewees responding to questions and providing to an interviewer

The Judge selects &#x201c;Setup of Custom Jury Selection Process&#x201d; from the main menu. The Setup of Custom Jury Selection Process is divided into two sections: 1) Required Information for Setup of Custom Process, and 2) Optional Features. The Judge must complete the required information. Under the required information, the Judge first selects the jurisdiction of his/her Court which will be either federal or a particular state. The Judge then selects whether the case is civil or criminal. The Judge then enters the number of jurors to be impaneled. The Judge then enters the number of alternate jurors to be selected. The Judge then enters the number of Jurors that are to be included in the jury pool. The Judge then sets a deadline for the Plaintiff Attorney to submit jury selection questions. To prevent the unnecessary duplication of questions on the questionnaire, the Judge is instructed to set the Defense Attorney's deadline at a later date than that of the Plaintiff Attorney to allow the Defense Attorney to review the Judge's questions and the Plaintiff Attorney's questions before submitting his/her own questions. The Judge further is advised that the attorneys are allowed to have professional jury consultants and their clients send them recommended jury selection questions through the internet to their respective programs in the invention's website before they submit their jury selection questions. The Judge, therefore, is advised to give each attorney ample time to submit their jury selection questions through the invention's website so they may have adequate time to obtain recommended jury selection questions from a professional jury consultant and their clients through the invention's website. The Judge then sets the deadline for the Jurors to respond to the questionnaire through the invention's website in front of a webcam.</p><p id="p-0411" num="0410">Under the Optional Features section, the Judge can pick and choose which features he/she would like to incorporate in his/her custom jury selection process. The features under this section are not required. The Judge can choose to allow the attorneys to object to their counterpart's jury selection questions through the invention's website. If the Judge selects this feature, the Judge would set a deadline that would be the same for the attorneys to submit their objections to their counterpart's jury selection questions through the invention's website. Also, if the Judge allows attorneys to submit such objections to their counterpart's jury selection questions through the invention's website, the Judge would be advised to set the deadline for such objections to be before the deadline for jurors to respond to the questionnaire through the invention's website in front of a webcam.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0411">If the Judge allows attorney's to object to each other's questions through the invention's website, the Judge also has the option of allowing the attorneys to submit rebuttals to their counterpart's objections through the invention's website. If the Judge allows attorneys to submit such rebuttals through the invention's website, the Judge would then set a deadline that would be the same for both attorneys to submit rebuttals to their counterpart's objections through the invention's website. Thus, the Judge would be advised to set the deadline to submit rebuttals through the invention's website to be later than the deadline to submit objections through the invention's website and before the deadline for jurors to respond to the questionnaire through the website in front of a webcam.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0412">Also, under &#x201c;Optional Features,&#x201d; the Judge can choose to have both attorneys exercise their challenges for cause through the invention's website. If the Judge selects this feature, he would then set a deadline for both attorneys to submit their challenges for cause through the invention's website by the same deadline. Additionally, if the Judge chooses to allow attorneys to submit their challenges for cause through the invention's website, the Judge may also allow the attorneys to submit rebuttals to their counterpart's challenges for cause through the invention's website. If the Judge chooses to allow attorneys to submit rebuttals to challenges for cause through the invention's website, the Judge would then set a deadline for both attorneys to submit such rebuttals by the same deadline. The Judge would be advised to set the deadline for challenges for cause through the invention's website to be sometime after the deadline for the jurors to respond to the questionnaire through the invention's website to adequately allow the attorneys to review all of the juror video answered questionnaires and make informed challenges for cause through the invention's website. Also, if the Judge allows attorneys to submit rebuttals to their counterpart's challenges for cause through the invention's website, the Judge will be advised to set the deadline for rebuttals through the invention's website to be sometime after the attorneys exercise their challenges for cause through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0413">Furthermore, under &#x201c;Optional Features,&#x201d; the Judge may choose to allow attorneys to &#x201c;Exercise Peremptory Challenges in an Alternating Fashion through the Website.&#x201d; If the Judge selects this feature, both attorneys log onto the website at the same specific date and time, and they exercise their peremptory challenges through the invention's website in an alternating fashion with the Plaintiff Attorney exercising one peremptory challenge first followed by the Defense Attorney exercising one peremptory challenge. Both attorneys alternate exercising peremptory challenges back and forth until both attorneys have exercised all of their allotted peremptory challenges through the invention's website. Additionally, if the Judge selects this feature, the Plaintiff, the Defendant, and the Judge will be allowed to log onto the website at the same date and time that the attorneys are to exercise their peremptory challenges through the invention's website and view each peremptory challenge exercise of each attorney as the attorneys exercise their peremptory challenges through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0414">Thus, if the Judge selects this feature, the Judge would enter the number of peremptory challenges each attorney is allowed to exercise. The Judge would then set a specific date and time that both attorneys are to log onto the website and alternate back and forth exercising their peremptory challenges. Additionally, the Judge is advised to set the specific date and time the attorneys are to log onto the invention's website and alternate back and forth exercising their peremptory challenges at a later date than the deadline for attorneys to exercise challenges for cause through the invention's website if the Judge does not allow attorneys to submit rebuttals to challenges for cause. If the Judge allows attorneys to submit rebuttals to their counterpart's challenges for cause through the invention's website, the Judge is advised to set the specific date and time the attorneys are to log onto the invention's website and alternate back and forth exercising their peremptory challenges to be later than the deadline for attorneys to submit rebuttals to challenges for cause. The Judge would then set the amount of time each attorney will be allotted to exercise each peremptory challenge as they alternate back and forth exercising their peremptory challenges through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0415">If the Judge chooses to allow attorneys to exercise their peremptory challenges through the invention's website, the Judge may also allow the attorneys to make a prima facie case of discrimination based on race and/or gender against their counterpart's peremptory challenge exercises. If the Judge selects this option, the Judge is advised to set the same deadline for both attorneys to submit such a prima facie case through the invention's website at a date sometime after the specific date and time both attorneys are to log onto the invention's website and exercise their peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0416">Once the Judge enters all required information and selects and enters any of the optional features or does not select any optional features, the setup of the custom jury selection process is complete, and the Judge selects submit to finish the process.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0417">Immediately after the Judge completes the set up of the custom jury selection process through the invention's website, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Court administrator instructing him/her that he/she must now log onto the invention's website and enter the first names, last names, and addresses of each juror who is to be in the jury pool. The Court Administrator also is instructed to assign a confidential code for each juror in the jury pool.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0418">Also, immediately after the Judge completes the set up of the custom jury selection process through the invention's website, the invention sends a text message to the cellular phone of the Court Administrator that states as follows: &#x201c;Your participation is now required through [the invention's website address appears here]. Please check your email for an instructive message of the task you are to complete and log onto [the invention's website address appears here] to complete your task.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0420" num="0419">When the Court Administrator logs onto the invention's website to enter the first names, last names, and addresses of each juror who is to be in the jury pool and to assign each juror in the jury pool a confidential code, the Court Administrator is shown a screen that contains individual spaces for the first name, last name, and address for each juror who makes up the total number of jurors the Judge ordered to be included in the jury pool in the Set up of the Custom Jury Selection Process. Below the space for the address of each juror appears a space for a confidential code. To the left of the space for a confidential code appears a button that states &#x201c;Assign Confidential Code.&#x201d; The Court Administrator is instructed to click the &#x201c;Assign Confidential Code&#x201d; button with his/her mouse. Once the &#x201c;Assign Confidential Code&#x201d; button is clicked a confidential code appears in the space designated for a confidential code. Each confidential code that is assigned to a juror is different from all other jurors' confidential codes.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0420">In the top margin of the screen is the number of jurors that the Judge ordered to be included in the jury pool in the Set up of the Custom Jury Selection Process. Thus, the Court Administrator is instructed to enter the first name, last name, and address and assign a confidential code for the number of jurors the Judge ordered to be included in the jury pool. In the bottom margin of the screen is a submit button. Once the Court Administrator enters the necessary information for a number of jurors that equals the total number of jurors that are to be included in the jury pool the Court Administrator selects the submit button. Once the Court Administrator selects the submit button, letter templates for each juror are automatically produced by the invention's website as described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0421">Also, once the Judge selects submit to finish the custom setup of the jury selection process through the invention's website, the inventions sends an email message to the personal email account of the Judge. The email message instructs the Judge to log onto the invention's designated website and produce a video message for the Jurors to view and listen to before they respond to the questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0422">Also, upon finishing the custom setup of the jury selection process through the invention's website, the invention sends a text message to the Judge's cellular phone alerting him/her that his/her participation is required through the invention's website and that he/she is advised to check his/her email for an instructive message of the task he/she is to complete. Such text message is the same as the quoted text message stated above.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0423">The Judge then logs onto the invention's website and produces a video message for the Jurors to view and listen to before they respond to the questionnaire through the invention's website. Since the potential jurors will respond to the questionnaire outside of the presence of the Court, some may not take the process seriously or may say anything so as to be excused from service. Therefore, producing a video message may be desirable to establish the presence of the Court and impress a tone upon the potential jurors that not taking the process seriously or not answering the questionnaire truthfully will not be tolerated, and/or may subject potential jurors to criminal penalty under the law. Thus, before producing the video recording, the Judge will be advised to convey a message that impresses a tone upon the potential jurors of the seriousness of the online juror questioning process and to answer each question truthfully.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0424">To produce a video message, the Judge logs onto the invention's website and selects Video Record Message to Jurors from the Judge's Main Menu of Functions. The Judge then will be shown a space designated for his/her image with a record button and a stop button directly below. The Judge simply sits in front of the webcam and clicks the &#x201c;Record&#x201d; button, and then begins speaking his/her message. When the Judge is finished recording his/her message, he/she then selects the &#x201c;Stop&#x201d; button. The Judge will be given the options of replaying his/her video message to the right of the designated space for his image. Thus, he/she will be presented with the standard options of &#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; &#x201c;Pause,&#x201d; &#x201c;Rewind,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Fast Forward.&#x201d; The Judge will also be presented with an &#x201c;Erase&#x201d; option. By selecting the &#x201c;Erase&#x201d; option, the video message of the Judge will be erased. Once it is erased, the Judge may make a new video message.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0425">After the Judge sets up the custom jury selection process through the invention's website and makes a video message for the jurors, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Judge instructing him/her to log onto the invention's website and type his/her own jury selection questions into the invention's website and produce video recordings of him/her orally reading each of the juror qualification questions of the Court's respective jurisdiction and each of his/her own jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the invention's internet website on a personal computer or a cellular phone. The email message further instructs the Judge that the video recordings that he/she produces of his/her typed jury selection questions will be viewed by the jurors when the juror's respond to the jury selection questionnaire. The Defense Attorney, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney, and Plaintiff will also be sent this same email message that was sent to the Judge.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0426">Also, after making the video footage of himself/herself for the jurors through the website, the invention sends a text message to the Judge's cellular phone alerting him/her that his/her participation is required through the invention's website and that he/she is advised to check his/her email for an instructive message of the task he/she is to complete. Such text message is the same as the quoted text message stated above.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0427">Thus, after the Judge sets up the custom jury selection process through the invention's website and makes a video message for the jurors, the Judge then types his/her own jury selection questions through the invention's website, and the Judge then orally reads each of the typed juror qualification questions for the Court's respective jurisdiction and orally reads each of his/her typed jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the invention's internet website on a personal computer or a cellular phone making an individual video recording of each of his/her respective jury selection questions. Thus, the Judge logs onto the invention's website and selects &#x201c;Submit Typed and Video Recorded Jury Selection Questions&#x201d; from the Judge's Main Menu of Functions. Upon making such a selection, the Judge first types his/her jury selection questions in the invention's website. Toward the top of the screen, the Judge is shown the oath the jurors are to respond to before answering jury selection questions through the invention's website. Below the oath appear the juror qualification questions of the Court's specific jurisdiction.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0428">In almost every federal and state jurisdiction, there are designated juror qualification questions that typically ask the following questions:</p><p id="p-0430" num="0429">&#x201c;Are you at least 18 years of age?</p><p id="p-0431" num="0430">Are you a citizen of the United States?</p><p id="p-0432" num="0431">Are you a resident of [particular state name appears here]?</p><p id="p-0433" num="0432">Are you able to read, write and understand the English language?</p><p id="p-0434" num="0433">Are you presently under an adjudication of incompetency?</p><p id="p-0435" num="0434">Have you been convicted of a felony within the past 10 years?</p><p id="p-0436" num="0435">Do you believe you should be excused from serving as a juror? If yes, please give reason.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0436">Have you ever served as a juror? If yes, state whether the case was civil or criminal?</p><p id="p-0438" num="0437">Have you or any members of your immediate family been a party to any civil or criminal lawsuit? If so, what type of lawsuit was it?&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0439" num="0438">Not all jurisdictions have the exact same juror qualification questions mentioned above. When the Judge selects the jurisdiction of his/her Court in the setup of the custom jury selection process, the exact juror qualification questions of the particular jurisdiction he/she selected will appear directly above the designated space the Judge is to type his/her jury selection questions. Only the Judge will be allowed to edit any of the Juror Qualification Questions as he/she desires.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0439">Directly below the Juror Qualification Questions is stated &#x201c;Judge's Jury Selection Questions.&#x201d; Directly below is the first consecutive number after the last numbered juror qualification question with a flashing cursor next to the number. The Judge then reviews and/or edit's the juror qualification questions, and then types his/her own jury selection questions. After each time the Judge finishes typing a question and presses enter, a new consecutive number automatically appears for the next question. The Judge may type as many questions as he/she sees fit. A scroll bar appears to the far right on the screen. In the bottom margin of the screen appears a spell check button and a save button. Also, in the bottom margin of the screen, a button labeled &#x201c;Make Video Recordings of Jury Selection Questions&#x201d; appears. The invention's website instructs the Judge that after the Judge corrects any typographical and/or spelling errors and is finished typing questions, the Judge must then select &#x201c;Make Video Recordings of Jury Selection Questions&#x201d; and then orally read the oath and each of the juror qualification questions for the Court's respective jurisdiction and orally read each of his/her own typed jury selection questions in front of a webcam and into the invention's website on a personal computer or a cellular phone making an individual video recording of each of his/her respective jury selection questions.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0440">Thus, upon selecting &#x201c;Make Video Recordings of Jury Selection Questions&#x201d; in the bottom margin of the screen, the Judge is shown a new screen with a window on the right side of the screen. Inside the window will appear only the typed oath. Directly below the window containing the typed oath will appear a button labeled &#x201c;Record.&#x201d; To the left of the &#x201c;Record&#x201d; button will appear a button labeled &#x201c;Stop Recording.&#x201d; To the left of the button labeled &#x201c;Stop Recording&#x201d; will appear a button labeled &#x201c;Orally Read Next Question.&#x201d; To the left of the window containing the typed oath will appear a window which will show the Judge's video recording as he/she records him/her orally reading the typed oath in the window in front of a webcam so the Judge can monitor the quality of each of his/her video recordings. Directly below the window that allows the Judge to monitor each of his/her video recordings will appear the options of &#x201c;Pause,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play Next Question,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Play Previous Question.&#x201d; Directly below such options will appear volume control buttons to allow the Judge to raise or lower the volume of his/her recording.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0441">The invention's website instructs the Judge that he/she must make a separate individual video recording for the oath and each of the typed juror qualification questions for the Court's respective jurisdiction and for each of his/her own typed jury selection questions with a webcam and into the invention's website. Thus, the invention's website instructs the Judge that he/she must orally read the oath and each question in front of a webcam on a personal computer or on a cellular phone into the invention's website and make a separate video recording for each question. The invention's website instructs the Judge that the judge's video recordings will read their respective questions to the jurors when the jurors respond to the juror qualification questions and the Judge's jury selection questions through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0442">The invention's website instructs the Judge that to make a valid video recording for the typed oath and each typed question the Judge must sit in front of a webcam on a personal computer or a cellular phone and select the &#x201c;Record&#x201d; option under the window containing the typed oath. Once the Judge selects the &#x201c;Record&#x201d; option, the Judge's live video recording will immediately appear in the window on the left side of the screen. The Judge then orally reads only the typed oath in the window on the right side of the screen in front of the webcam. When the Judge finishes orally reading the typed oath in the window, the Judge selects the &#x201c;Stop Recording&#x201d; option. When the Judge selects &#x201c;Stop recording,&#x201d; the webcam stops producing a video recording of the Judge. When the Judge selects &#x201c;Orally Read Next Question,&#x201d; the typed oath appearing in the window on the right side of the screen that the Judge just orally read in front of a webcam disappears, and the first typed juror qualification question appears in the window. In the window containing the Judge's video recording for the typed oath, the Judge's video recording for the typed oath disappears, and the window becomes blank. Once the Judge selects the &#x201c;Record&#x201d; button again sitting in front of a webcam, the Judge's live video recording appears in the window on the left side of the screen. The Judge then orally reads the first typed juror qualification question in the window on the right side of the screen in front of a webcam producing a video recording of him/her orally reading the first typed juror qualification question. When the Judge finishes orally reading the first typed juror qualification question appearing in the window on the right side of the screen, the Judge selects &#x201c;Orally Read Next Question&#x201d; and repeats the process for the next typed question appearing in the window. The invention's website instructs the Judge to continue this pattern until he/she has produced an individual video recording for each of the typed juror qualification questions and his/her own typed jury selection questions. The invention's website captures each video recording produced by the Judge.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0443">When the Judge finishes producing a video recording of him/her orally reading the typed oath and each typed juror qualification question and each of his/her typed jury selection questions, the invention's website instructs the Judge to check the quality of each video recording for sound and video imagery. Thus, the invention's website instructs the Judge to ensure that each of his/her video recordings clearly show him/her orally reading their respective questions, and the invention's website instructs the Judge to ensure that his/her voice can easily be heard in each video recording. The invention's website instructs the Judge that to monitor the quality of his/her video recordings he/she can play each video recording with the options appearing directly below the window that allows the Judge to monitor each of his/her video recordings which include &#x201c;Pause,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play Next Question,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play Previous Question.&#x201d; Directly below such options will appear volume control buttons to allow the Judge to raise or lower the volume of his/her recording. When the Judge selects &#x201c;Play,&#x201d; only the Judge's video recording appearing in the window will play with its respective typed question appearing in the window on the right side of the screen. When the Judge selects &#x201c;Play Next Question,&#x201d; the video recording of the Judge orally reading the next typed question in numerical order appears in the window on the left side of the screen, and its respective typed question appears in the window on the right side of the screen. When the Judge selects &#x201c;Play Previous Question,&#x201d; the video recording of the Judge orally reading the previous typed question in numerical order appears in the window on the left side of the screen, and its respective typed question appears in the window on the right side of the screen. The invention's website instructs the Judge that if the Judge desires to replace any of his/her video recordings for any of the typed juror qualification questions or his/her typed jury selection questions the Judge may re-record any question. To re-record a video recording for a typed question, the invention's website instructs the Judge to use the options of &#x201c;Pause,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play Next Question,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play Previous Question&#x201d; to call up the respective video recording the Judge would like to re-record in the window appearing on the left side of the screen. Once the respective video recording starts to play, the invention's website instructs the Judge to select &#x201c;Pause.&#x201d; Upon selecting &#x201c;Pause,&#x201d; the video recording pauses. Once the video recording pauses, the Judge selects the &#x201c;Record&#x201d; option under the window containing the respective typed question the Judge would like to produce a new video recording for. Once the Judge selects the &#x201c;Record&#x201d; option, the old video recording appearing in the window on the left side of the screen disappears, and the Judge's live video recording appears in the window on the left side of the screen. The Judge then orally reads the typed question appearing in the window on the right side of the screen.

The judge's video message will establish the presence of the Court and impress a tone upon the potential jurors that not taking the process seriously or not answering the questionnaire truthfully will not be tolerated, and/or may subject potential jurors to criminal penalty under the law. Additionally, the message will instruct the juror on how to take a picture of his/her driver's license or photo identification card with his/her webcam and how to respond to the questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0618" num="0617">Only after the judge's message is done playing will the juror be presented with an option to proceed to the next screen to take a picture of his/her driver's license or photo identification card with his/her webcam and into the invention's website. Thus, each juror must make a picture of his/her driver's license or photo identification card with a webcam and into the invention's website which will be made viewable to the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Juror Consultant, Defense Attorney's Professional Juror Consultant, Court Administrator, and Court Reporter in their respective programs in the invention's website to authenticate the identification of the juror.</p><p id="p-0619" num="0618">Thus, after the juror finishes viewing and listening to the judge's video recording and proceeds to the next screen, the invention's website instructs the juror at the top of the screen that he/she must take a picture of the front of his/her driver's license or photo identification card with his/her webcam on a personal computer or a cellular phone.

With the other hand, the juror will be instructed to click on the &#x201c;Take Picture&#x201d; button appearing below the rectangular space outlined with red dashed boundary lines. The juror further will be instructed that no driver's license picture or photo identification picture will be accepted if any of the outer edges of the four sides of his/her driver's license card or photo identification card does not abut a red dashed boundary line or exceeds any of the red dashed boundary lines. Only after the juror takes an acceptable picture of the front of his/her driver's license card or photo identification card with his/her webcam will the juror be presented with an option to proceed to the next screen to begin responding to the questionnaire in front of his/her webcam. The Juror will be instructed that his/her driver's license number or identification number will be blocked and will not be viewable to the judge, the attorneys, the plaintiff, or the defendant or any other party through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0621" num="0620">When the juror proceeds to the next screen to begin responding to the questionnaire, each juror then orally responds to each question on the jury selection questionnaire one question at a time in front of a webcam on a personal computer or a webcam on a cellular phone in their own respective program making a video recording of each one of their responses into the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0622" num="0621">Before the juror is presented with the first juror qualification question on the questionnaire, the typed oath of the juror appears in a window on the right side of the screen. When the typed oath appears on the right side of the screen, the Judge's respective video recording of the Judge orally reading the oath appears in a window on the left side of the screen, and it immediately begins to play depicting the Judge orally reading the oath. Below the window containing the typed oath will appear a button labeled &#x201c;Repeat Question&#x201d; and to the right of such button will appear a button labeled &#x201c;Play Next Question.&#x201d; While the Judge's video recording reads the oath to the juror, the webcam makes a continuous video recording of the juror into the invention's website. When the video recording finishes reading the question, the video recording pauses, and the Juror then orally responds to the oath in front of a webcam making a video recording of his/her response into the invention's website. When the Judge's video recording pauses upon reading the oath to the juror, it will not play again on the invention's website unless the Juror selects &#x201c;Repeat Question.&#x201d; If the Juror selects &#x201c;Repeat Question,&#x201d; the Judge's video recording for the oath will play again.</p><p id="p-0623" num="0622">When the Juror finishes responding to the oath, he/she selects &#x201c;Play Next Question&#x201d; to have the first question on the questionnaire read to him/her by the Judge's respective video recording. In the window on the right side of the screen, the typed oath disappears, and the first question on the questionnaire will appear in a typed format when the Juror selects &#x201c;Play Next Question.&#x201d; The Judge's respective video recording for the particular typed question appearing on the right side of the screen will appear in the window on the left side of the screen, and it will immediately begin to play depicting the Judge orally reading the question to the juror when the Juror selects &#x201c;Play Next Question.&#x201d; While the Judge's video recording reads the question to the juror, the webcam makes a continuous video recording of the juror into the invention's website. When the video recording finishes reading the question, the video recording pauses, and the Juror then orally responds to the question in front of a webcam making a video recording of his/her response into the invention's website. When the Judge's video recording pauses upon reading the question to the juror, it will not play again on the invention's website unless the Juror selects &#x201c;Repeat Question.&#x201d; If the Juror selects &#x201c;Repeat Question,&#x201d; the Judge's video recording for the particular question appearing on the right side of the screen will play again. The Juror repeats this process of orally responding to each video recording of each typed question and selecting &#x201c;Play Next Question&#x201d; until the Juror has orally responded to each question in front of a webcam and has made a valid video recording for all of his/her responses into the invention's website. When the juror sits in front of a webcam while each question is asked of the juror, the invention's website makes one continuous recording of the juror until the juror logs out of the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0624" num="0623">Below the window containing the typed question the juror attempts to answer will appear a window that will display the juror's live video recording of himself/herself as he/she views each video recording and orally responds to each question so the juror can monitor that the invention's website is making a valid video recording of the juror. Directly below the juror's live video recording will appear the picture of the juror's driver's license card or photo identification card with the driver's license number or identification number blocked out. To the immediate right of the Juror's live video recording and picture of driver's license or photo identification will appear the standard options of &#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; &#x201c;Pause,&#x201d; &#x201c;Rewind,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Fast Forward.&#x201d; The juror may use such options if he/she desires to replay all or any portion of his/her responses to the jury selection questionnaire after he/she has responded to the questionnaire. Directly below such options will appear volume control buttons to allow the Juror to raise or lower the volume of his/her recording. In the top margin of the screen, the current date and the deadline for jurors to have finished responding to the questionnaire through the invention's website will appear.</p><p id="p-0625" num="0624">Ultimately, when each juror orally responds to the juror qualification questions and the Judge's questions on the questionnaire in front of a webcam on a personal computer or a webcam on a cellular phone in the invention's website, only the Judge's video recording for the particular typed question that appears on the screen that the juror attempts to answer will appear on the left side of the juror's screen in his/her respective program in the invention's website, and the single typed question of the juror qualification questions or of the Judge's jury selection questions that the juror is attempting to answer will appear on the right side of the screen. As stated above, when each typed question of the juror qualification questions or of the Judge's jury selection questions first appears on the right side of the screen, the Judge's respective video recording of the Judge orally reading the particular question appearing on the screen immediately begins to play depicting the Judge orally reading the question to the juror, and the juror can view the Judge orally asking the respective question in the Judge's video recording.</p><p id="p-0626" num="0625">When each juror begins to orally respond to the first of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions on the questionnaire through the invention's website in front of a webcam on a personal computer or in front of a webcam on a cellular phone, the Judge's video recording will disappear, and only the Plaintiff Attorney's respective video recording for the first of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear on the left side of the juror's screen in the juror's respective program in the invention's website. Only the first typed question of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear on the right side of the Juror's screen. The Juror will only be allowed to answer one question of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions at a time through the invention's website. Thus, when the Juror attempts to answer any of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions through the invention's website, only the one typed question of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions that the juror attempts to answer will appear on the right side of the screen on the invention's website. When each of the first half of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions first appear on the right side of the screen, only the Plaintiff Attorney's respective video recording of the Plaintiff Attorney orally reading the particular typed question appearing on the screen appears on the left side of the juror's screen and immediately begins to play depicting the Plaintiff Attorney orally reading the typed question to the juror, and the juror can view and hear the Plaintiff Attorney orally reading the respective typed question in the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording.</p><p id="p-0627" num="0626">When each of the second half of the typed jury selection questions of the Plaintiff Attorney first appear on the right side of each juror's screen on the invention's website, the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording does not appear, and the Plaintiffs video recording of the Plaintiff sitting and blinking his/her eyes only appears on the left side of each juror's screen. Thus, each juror can view the Plaintiffs video recording while each juror orally responds to each of the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions. However, even though the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording does not appear on each juror's screen when each juror orally responds to each of the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions and the Plaintiff's video recording does appear when each of the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions appear on each juror's screen, the sound recordings of the Plaintiff Attorney's video recordings for their respective typed jury selection questions still play on each juror's screen, and they orally read their respective questions making up the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions to each juror. Thus, when each juror responds to the second half of the Plaintiff Attorney's jury selection questions through the invention's website, they see the Plaintiff's video recording on the screen, but they hear the sound of the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording orally read the typed question appearing on the juror's screen.</p><p id="p-0628" num="0627">When each juror begins to orally respond to the first of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions on the questionnaire on the invention's website in front of a webcam on a personal computer or in front of a webcam on a cellular phone, the Plaintiffs video recording will disappear, and only the Defense Attorney's respective video recording for the first of the Defense Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear on the left side of the juror's screen in the juror's respective program in the invention's website. Only the first typed question of the Defense Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear on the right side of the juror's screen. The Juror will only be allowed to answer one question of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions at a time through the invention's designated website. Thus, when the juror attempts to answer any of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions through the invention's website, only the one typed question of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions that the juror attempts to answer will appear on the right side of the screen on the invention's website. When each of the first half of the Defense Attorney's typed jury selection questions first appear on the right side of the screen, the Defense Attorney's respective video recording of the Defense Attorney orally reading the particular typed question appearing on the screen appears on the left side of the juror's screen and immediately begins to play depicting the Defense Attorney orally reading the typed question to the juror, and the juror can view and hear the Defense Attorney orally reading the respective typed question in the Defense Attorney's video recording.</p><p id="p-0629" num="0628">When each of the second half of the typed jury selection questions of the Defense website, the Defense Attorney's video recording does not appear, and the Defendant's video recording of the Defendant sitting and blinking his/her eyes only appears on the left side of each juror's screen. Thus, each juror can view the Defendant's video recording while each juror orally responds to each of the second half of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions. However, even though the Defense Attorney's video recording does not appear on each juror's screen when each juror orally responds to each of the second half of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions and the Defendant's video recording does appear when each of the second half of the Defense Attorney's typed jury selection questions appear on each juror's screen, the sound recordings of the Defense Attorney's video recordings for their respective typed jury selection questions still play on each juror's screen, and they orally read their respective questions making up the second half of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions to each juror. Thus, when each juror responds to the second half of the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions through the designated website, they see the Defendant's video recording on the screen, but they hear the sound of the Defense Attorney's video recording orally read the typed question appearing on the juror's screen.</p><p id="p-0630" num="0629">The video recordings of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant will impress upon the Jurors that the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant are watching and listening to the Jurors respond which will assist in helping Jurors provide sincere responses and will assist the attorneys and their clients in how the Jurors will react to their appearances.</p><p id="p-0631" num="0630">Also, directly above the space where the typed oath or a typed question appears, the Juror will be shown the total number of questions on the questionnaire and the number of questions the Juror has answered. Directly below the window where the Judge's or an attorney's video recording appears to read its respective typed question are volume control buttons to allow the Juror to raise or lower the volume of the Judge's or attorney's video recording. In the bottom margin of the Juror's screen in the invention's website is a button labeled &#x201c;Log out.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0632" num="0631">The Juror is not required to answer all of the questions in one sitting. The juror can simply select &#x201c;Log out&#x201d; after answering a question and log out of the invention's website. The Juror then can log in to the invention's website as many times as needed to finish responding to each question on the questionnaire at any time day or night, 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. If a Juror chooses not to answer the entire questionnaire in one sitting and decides to log off after answering a portion of the questionnaire, the next question that will be read to the Juror by either a Judge's or attorney's video recording when the Juror logs back into the website will be the next consecutive question following the last question answered by the Juror.</p><p id="p-0633" num="0632">The Juror must respond to all of the questions on the questionnaire in front of a webcam. If the Juror's live video recording does not appear in the designated window at the bottom of the screen while the Juror responds in front of a webcam, the Juror will not be allowed to proceed to the next question, and a message will appear on the screen that states that the webcam is not working properly or the juror is not responding to the questions in front of the webcam. The message will further advise that to finish responding to the questionnaire the juror will need to respond in front of the webcam, or if the webcam is not working, the Juror should use a different webcam or a different computer equipped with a webcam.</p><p id="p-0634" num="0633">The invention's website further instructs the Jurors to not answer their questions within the presence of other jurors, or attorneys. One objective of the invention is to prevent jurors from conforming their responses with other jurors or having their responses influenced by the Attorneys involved in the case. Ultimately, such a way of responding will provide attorneys with more credible juror responses. Thus, a main advantage of the invention is that it prevents conformity of answers.</p><p id="p-0635" num="0634">When Jurors orally respond to the questions that are read to them by video recordings in front of a webcam, the invention's website records their oral responses in audio format and the invention's website video records the Jurors responding to all of the questions.</p><p id="p-0636" num="0635">When the juror finishes orally responding to the last question on the questionnaire in front of a webcam through the invention's website, a message will appear on the screen. The message informs the juror that the juror has successfully answered all of the questions on the questionnaire. The message then thanks the juror for his/her participation.</p><p id="p-0637" num="0636">After the deadline for jurors to have finished responding to the questionnaire in front of a webcam through the invention's website expires, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Court Reporter instructing the Court Reporter to transcribe the video recorded juror responses into a typed format onto their respective questionnaires through the invention's website. The invention sends this same email that was sent to the Court Reporter to the personal email accounts of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant.</p><p id="p-0638" num="0637">Additionally, after the deadline for jurors to have finished responding to the questionnaire in front of a webcam through the invention's website expires, the invention sends text messages to the cellular phones of the Court Reporter, the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant alerting them that their participation is required through the invention's website and that they are advised to check their email for an instructive message of the tasks they are to complete. Such text message is the same as the quoted text message stated above.</p><p id="p-0639" num="0638">After the deadline for jurors to have finished responding to the questionnaire in front of a webcam through the invention's website expires, the Court Reporter transcribes the video recorded juror responses into a typed format onto their respective questionnaires through the invention's website. To transcribe the video recorded juror responses, the Court Reporter logs into the Court Reporter program in the invention's website and selects &#x201c;Type and Transcribe Video Recorded Juror Responses on Questionnaires&#x201d; from the Court Reporter's Main Menu of Functions. Upon making such a selection, the Court Reporter is shown a list of the names of each juror in the jury pool. The names on the list are interactive. When the Court Reporter selects a name, the video recording of the juror appears on the left half of the screen and the questionnaire appears on the right half of the screen. Directly below the juror's video recording are a play button, stop button, fast-forward button, and rewind button for the Court Reporter to view and listen to the juror respond to the questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0640" num="0639">On the right half of the screen with the questionnaire will appear the typed juror qualification questions. Below the typed juror qualification questions will appear the Judge's typed jury selection questions. Below the Judge's typed jury selection questions will appear the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions. Below the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions. To the left of each typed question on each juror's transcribed jury selection questionnaire that appears on the right side of the screen on the invention's website will appear the photo of the person whose video recording was appearing on the juror's screen when the juror responded to the particular question. For example, if the Judge's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 1 through 20 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Judge's photo derived from the Judge's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the typed juror qualification questions and the Judge's typed questions numbered 1 through 20 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0641" num="0640">Likewise, if the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 21 through 30 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Plaintiff Attorney's photo derived from the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed questions numbered 21 through 30 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0642" num="0641">Also, if the Plaintiff's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 31 through 40 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Plaintiffs photo derived from the Plaintiff's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed questions numbered 31 through 40 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0643" num="0642">Additionally, if the Defense Attorney's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 41 through 50 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Defense Attorney's photo derived from the Defense Attorney's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Defense Attorney's typed questions numbered 41 through 50 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0644" num="0643">Also, if the Defendant's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 51 through 60 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Defendant's photo derived from the Defendant's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Defense Attorney's typed questions numbered 51 through 60 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0645" num="0644">Directly below each typed question on the jury selection questionnaire of each juror will appear the words &#x201c;Transcription of Video Recording.&#x201d; To the right of the words &#x201c;Transcription of Video Recording&#x201d; under each typed question will appear the transcription of the typed question's respective video recording.</p><p id="p-0646" num="0645">Directly below each typed questions' respective video recording transcription will appear a prompt labeled &#x201c;Juror's Response.&#x201d; The Court Reporter is instructed to play the juror's video recording and type each response next to the prompt labeled &#x201c;Juror's Response&#x201d; below its respective question. The invention may also utilize voice recognition software to assist the Court Reporter in the task of transcribing the juror's responses. If the invention utilizes voice recognition software, the software automatically transcribes each juror's video recorded response into a typed format next to the prompt labeled &#x201c;Juror's Response&#x201d; below its respective question. If the invention utilizes such voice recognition software to assist the Court Reporter in the task of typing each Juror's response to each respective question, the Court Reporter is instructed to play each juror's video recording and check the voice recognition software's transcriptions for accuracy and edit any of such transcriptions of each Juror's responses. At the bottom of the screen, there is a button labeled &#x201c;Next Juror.&#x201d; When the Court Reporter finishes typing and/or editing the responses for a juror, the Court Reporter selects &#x201c;Next Juror&#x201d; and is then shown a new screen with the video recording of the next juror listed in alphabetical order. The Court Reporter repeats this process until he/she has typed all of the responses for all of the jurors. Once the Court Reporter has finished typing all of the responses for all of the jurors, the Court Reporter selects the &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit&#x201d; button which will appear at the bottom right hand corner of the screen. When the Court Reporter selects &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit,&#x201d; the Court Reporter authenticates the transcriptions in the same manner as detailed above, and each juror's transcribed questionnaire becomes viewable to the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant in their respective programs through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0647" num="0646">Immediately after the jurors' video recorded oral responses are transcribed into a typed format, and the Court Reporter authenticates them and submits them through the invention's website, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of the Court Reporter instructing him/her that he/she must now print each juror's transcribed questionnaire, and the date each juror finished responding to the questionnaire through the invention's website and place each transcribed questionnaire in the Court's file for transcript purposes. Also, the Court Reporter is sent an email message instructing him/her to log into the invention's website and print all email messages to the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, the Defendant, and the Plaintiff, if the case is civil, and the dates such emails were submitted through the invention's website and place them in the Court's file for transcript purposes. The email messages contain an interactive link to the invention's website so the Court Reporter can instantaneously log onto the website.</p><p id="p-0648" num="0647">Immediately after the jurors' video recorded oral responses are transcribed into a typed format, and the Court Reporter authenticates them and submits them through the invention's website, and if the Judge did not elect to allow attorneys to exercise challenges for cause or peremptory challenges through the invention's website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process, and if the Judge elected to use the invention's website as a means of questioning jurors before the in-court jury selection process begins, the invention sends email messages to the personal email accounts of both attorneys instructing them that they may now log into their respective programs in the invention's website and view all of the juror video recordings and typed questionnaires, take confidential notes of the jurors, and print the juror questionnaires. Additionally, the email messages to the attorneys advises them to first view the video recordings of the jurors and take notes on the jurors and rank the jurors on a scale of 1-10 based on the strength of their desire to exclude the juror with a challenge for cause or a peremptory challenge before the in-court jury selection process begins. Additionally, the email messages to both attorneys advises them that if they sought the assistance of a professional jury consultant their consultants have been notified that they must log onto the invention's website and provide their respective attorneys a professional analysis of each juror through the invention's website. Furthermore, the email messages to both attorneys advises them that their respective professional jury consultants have been advised of the date the in-court jury selection process begins and have been advised to submit their analysis of each juror to their respective attorney's program in the invention's website at least one week before the in-court jury selection process begins. Additionally, both attorneys are advised that their clients have also been advised to submit an analysis of each juror and submit them to their respective attorney's program through the invention's website. The email messages to both attorneys also advise them that their clients have been advised of the date the in-court jury selection process begins and have been advised to submit their analysis of each juror to their respective attorney's program in the invention's website at least one week before the in-court jury selection process begins. Both attorneys will also be advised that they will be able to compare their analysis of each juror with their respective professional jury consultant's analysis of each juror and their respective client's analysis of each juror in their respective programs in the invention's website before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins. Also, the email messages advise both attorneys to wait for their respective professional jury consultant and their respective client to submit their analysis of each juror through the invention's website so the attorneys can compare their analysis with their professional jury consultant's analysis and their client's analysis so they will have more confidence in their in-court juror selections. Such email message sent to the Plaintiff Attorney is also sent to the Judge, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, and the Plaintiff. Likewise, such email message sent to the Defense Attorney is also sent to the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant.</p><p id="p-0649" num="0648">Immediately after the jurors' video recorded oral responses are transcribed into a typed format, and the Court Reporter authenticates them and submits them through the invention's website, and if the Judge did not elect to allow attorneys to exercise challenges for cause or peremptory challenges through the invention's website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process, and if the Judge elected to use the invention's website as a means of questioning jurors before the in-court jury selection process begins, the invention sends email messages to the personal email accounts of the plaintiff and the defendant that instruct them that they may now log onto the invention's website and view all of the juror video recordings, take confidential notes of the jurors, and print the juror questionnaires. The email messages sent to the plaintiff and the defendant advise them that they may log into the invention's website and submit, to their respective attorney's program in the invention's website, an analysis of each juror and rank of each juror on a scale of 1-10 based on the strength of their desire to exclude the juror from the jury pool through the invention's website.

Additionally, the Judge may now log into his/her respective program in the invention's website and view all of the juror video recordings, take confidential notes of the jurors. Likely, the Judge's confidential notes will pertain to whether or not a juror should be excused from jury duty.</p><p id="p-0653" num="0652">If the judge did not elect to allow attorneys to submit Challenges for Cause and/or Peremptory Challenges through the invention's website and limited the invention's website's use to merely obtaining video recordings of jurors and transcription of their responses before the in-court jury selection process begins, the judge would not be given the option of excusing jurors before they appear in court for in-court jury selection through the invention's website as the judge would excuse any jurors when they appear in court for the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0654" num="0653">When the judge, attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants enter their respective programs in the invention's website to complete the above said tasks, they select &#x201c;View Video Recordings of Jurors Responding to Questionnaire.&#x201d; They are then shown a list of the names of each juror in the jury pool. The names on the list are interactive. When the judge, attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants select a name, the video recording of the juror appears on the left half of the screen and the typed questionnaire appears on the right half of the screen. For Professional Jury Consultants, they will have an additional option on the left side of the screen that allows them to either view the Juror's typed questionnaire or view their client's information. Directly below the juror's video recording appears the picture of the juror's driver's license or picture identification card with the juror's driver's license number or identification number appearing blocked out. The juror's driver's license or picture identification card is interactive. By clicking anywhere on such driver's license or picture identification card, the license or card enlarges so the picture on the license or card can be compared more easily with the Juror's video recording. Directly below the juror's driver's license or picture identification card are a play button, stop button, fast-forward button, and rewind button for the attorneys, judge, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants to view and listen to the juror respond to the questionnaire in their respective programs through the invention's website. Directly below these buttons are the words &#x201c;Play particular question(s):&#x201d; followed by space designated for the numbers of the questions on the questionnaire. Thus, the judge, attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants can play any single question and answer or any group of questions and answers on the questionnaire by typing the number or number range in this space.</p><p id="p-0655" num="0654">On the right half of the screen with the questionnaire will appear the typed juror qualification questions. Below the typed juror qualification questions will appear the Judge's typed jury selection questions. Below the Judge's typed jury selection questions will appear the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions. Below the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions. Thus, each question on the questionnaire appears in a typed format. To the left of each typed question on each juror's transcribed jury selection questionnaire that appears on the right side of the screen on the invention's website will appear the photo of the person whose video recording was appearing on the juror's screen when the juror responded to the particular question. For example, if the Judge's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 1 through 20 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Judge's photo derived from the Judge's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the typed juror qualification questions and the Judge's typed questions numbered 1 through 20 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0656" num="0655">Likewise, if the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 21 through 30 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Plaintiff Attorney's photo derived from the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed questions numbered 21 through 30 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0657" num="0656">Also, if the Plaintiff's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 31 through 40 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Plaintiff's photo derived from the Plaintiff's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed questions numbered 31 through 40 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0658" num="0657">Additionally, if the Defense Attorney's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 41 through 50 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Defense Attorney's photo derived from the Defense Attorney's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Defense Attorney's typed questions numbered 41 through 50 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0659" num="0658">Also, if the Defendant's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 51 through 60 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Defendant's photo derived from the Defendant's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Defense Attorney's typed questions numbered 51 through 60 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0660" num="0659">The photos next to their respective typed questions on the transcribed jury selection questionnaires for each juror which symbolizes which person's video recording was appearing on each juror's screen when each juror responded to the questionnaire provides the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant with an opportunity to see how each juror responds to the individual video profiles of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant. For example, if the Defense Attorney wanted to know how each juror will respond to the Defendant's physical appearance, and if the Defendant's video recording appeared to the juror's on questions 51 through 60, the Defense Attorney could watch each juror's video recorded responses for questions 51 through 60 through the invention's designated website, and the Defense Attorney can see how each juror reacts to seeing the Defendant's video recording. Thus, by knowing whose specific video recording was playing on the jurors' screens when the jurors responded to the jury selection questions, the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant can see nonverbal clues as to how each juror responds to the video recordings of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant.</p><p id="p-0661" num="0660">Directly below each typed question on the jury selection questionnaire of each juror will appear the words &#x201c;Transcription of Video Recording.&#x201d; To the right of the words &#x201c;Transcription of Video Recording&#x201d; under each typed question will appear the transcription of the typed question's respective video recording.</p><p id="p-0662" num="0661">Directly below each typed questions' respective video recording transcription will appear the words &#x201c;Juror's Response.&#x201d; To the right of the words &#x201c;Juror's Response&#x201d; will appear the typed transcription of the Juror's video recorded response to the respective typed question on the questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0663" num="0662">The typed questionnaire and typed corresponding answers of each juror appears in a window equipped with a scroll bar on the right side so the attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants may view the entire questionnaire on the screen. At the top of the screen will appear the date that the in-court jury selection process begins.</p><p id="p-0664" num="0663">In the respective programs of each attorney, the plaintiff, the defendant, and the judge a window will appear at the bottom of the screen as space for the attorneys, the plaintiff, the defendant, and the judge to type confidential notes on the juror to help them remember the juror. Thus, in this space, the heading &#x201c;Confidential Notes on [the juror's name will appear here]&#x201d; will appear. The attorneys, plaintiff, and defendant are advised by the invention's website to type notes that will help them make a decision as to whether to keep or exclude the juror with a peremptory challenge in the in-court jury selection process and type notes that meet any ground for excluding a juror with a challenge for cause in the in-court jury selection process. The judge is advised by the invention's website to type notes about whether or not to excuse a jury from jury duty in the in-court jury selection process. In the programs of the Professional Jury Consultants, this space will also appear except the heading will say: &#x201c;Professional Analysis of [the Juror's name will appear here].&#x201d; Thus, the Professional Jury Consultant will type his/her analysis of each juror. Below the space for the attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and judge to type confidential notes in their respective programs and below the space for professional jury consultants to type a professional analysis of the juror in their respective programs is space for the attorneys, plaintiff, defendant and professional jury consultants to type a number between 1 and 10 based on the strength of their desire to exclude the juror from the jury pool in the in-court jury selection process. Such number will help them make decisions on which jurors to keep and which jurors to exclude in light of viewing a list of all the jurors before the in-court jury selection begins. Thus, the attorneys, plaintiff, and defendant are instructed by the invention's website to type confidential notes on each juror they view and/or listen to respond to the questionnaire and assign a number between 1 and 10 based on the strength of their desire to exclude the juror from the jury pool. Thus, the invention's website instructs them that a number 10 represents the strongest desire to exclude a juror with the number 1 representing the least desire to exclude a juror. Likewise, the professional jury consultants are instructed by the invention's website to type a professional analysis of each juror they view and/or listen to respond to the questionnaire and assign a number between 1 and 10 based on the strength of their desire to exclude the juror from the jury pool. Thus, the invention's website instructs them that a number 10 represents the strongest desire to exclude a juror with the number 1 representing the least desire to exclude a juror. In this note making and number assigning phase, the notes that the attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, judge, and professional jury consultants type are confidential and cannot be viewed by anyone in the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0665" num="0664">When a Professional Jury Consultant for either the Plaintiff Attorney or the Defense Attorney has finished typing a professional analysis of each juror and assigns a number between 1 and 10 to each juror through the invention's website in his/her respective program, he/she is instructed to select a button labeled &#x201c;View Professional Analysis of All Jurors.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0666" num="0665">Upon selecting this button, the Professional Jury Consultant will be shown a list of every juror's name in the jury pool placed in order from the highest assigned numbers to the lowest assigned numbers based on the strength of the Professional Jury Consultant's desire to exclude the jurors from the jury pool in the in-court jury selection process. For example, any jurors with an assigned number of 10 will appear at the top of the list and any jurors with an assigned number of 9 will appear directly below the group of jurors with the assigned number of 10. The reason for this order is to make the in-court jury selection for the attorney easier. Thus, they can easily view the jurors they desire to exclude the most by being grouped in the same numbered category. Thus, in the in-court jury selection process, the attorneys will naturally exclude all jurors assigned a number 10 first with a peremptory challenge and then proceed to exclude all jurors assigned a number 9 with a peremptory challenges, etc.</p><p id="p-0667" num="0666">Thus, the assigned number of the juror from 1 to 10 based on the professional jury consultant's strength of desire to exclude the juror appears to the far left of the juror's name.

Such text message is the same as the quoted text message stated above.</p><p id="p-0701" num="0700">If the Judge did elect to allow attorneys to exercise challenges for cause and peremptory challenges through the invention's website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process in the Judge's program in the invention's website, and if the jurors' video recorded oral responses are transcribed into a typed format, and if the Court Reporter authenticates them and submits them through the invention's website, the Judge may log onto the invention's website and excuse any of the jurors from jury duty through the invention's website before the attorneys exercise any challenges for cause and peremptory challenges through the invention's website. Thus, if the judge did not elect to allow attorneys to submit Challenges for Cause and/or Peremptory Challenges through the invention's website and limited the invention's website's use to merely obtaining video recordings of jurors and transcription of their responses before the in-court jury selection process begins, the judge would not be given the option of excusing jurors before they appear in court for in-court jury selection as the judge would excuse any jurors when they appear in court for the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-0702" num="0701">To excuse any of the jurors for jury duty through the invention's website, the Judge may log onto the invention's website and select &#x201c;Rule upon which Jurors may be Excused from Jury Duty&#x201d; from the Judge's Main Menu of Functions only if the Judge elected to allow attorneys to submit Challenges for Cause and/or Peremptory Challenges through the invention's website. Upon selecting such option, he/she is first shown a screen that allows him/her to easily detect which jurors did not completely answer the questionnaire. He/she is shown an interactive list of all the juror names who were ordered to respond to the questionnaire. Small red cautionary flags will appear next to the names of any jurors who did not complete the questionnaire to its entirety. Upon examining the red flags next to juror names, the Judge may contact the Court Administrator with the names of the jurors who did not complete the questionnaire and have the Court Administrator issue such jurors new summons to appear at the Courthouse to answer the questionnaire through the invention's website with a webcam under supervision. In the alternative, the Judge may contact the Court Administrator with the names of the jurors who did not complete the questionnaire and have the Court Administrator enforce some type of sanction against such jurors for a failure to comply with jury duty.</p><p id="p-0703" num="0702">After the Judge addresses the issue of certain jurors not responding to the questionnaire, the Judge proceeds to the next screen by selecting &#x201c;Rule upon which Jurors may be Excused from Jury Duty&#x201d; option in the bottom margin of the screen. Upon selecting such option, the Judge will be shown a screen that shows two-inch squares of the video recordings of each juror in the jury pool in alphabetical order from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen. The two-inch video recording squares are interactive. When the Judge clicks his/her mouse on a two-inch square video recording, the Juror's video recording enlarges and starts to play. When the video recording enlarges, a &#x201c;stop&#x201d; button, &#x201c;play&#x201d; button, &#x201c;fast forward&#x201d; button, and &#x201c;rewind&#x201d; button will appear. To the right of each juror's two-inch video recording will appear the Juror's respective name which is interactive. Thus, when the Judge clicks on the Juror's name, the Juror's transcribed questionnaire, with all of the features detailed above, will appear on the right side of the screen and the Juror's video recording enlarges with the above said buttons and occupies the left side of the screen. To the left of each juror's two-inch video recording will appear a small square box with the word &#x201c;Keep&#x201d; directly above it. To the immediate left of the small square box with the word &#x201c;Keep&#x201d; will appear another equally portioned size box with the word &#x201c;Excuse&#x201d; directly above it. Directly below the &#x201c;Excuse&#x201d; box, the &#x201c;Keep&#x201d; box, the two-inch video recording, and the jurors name, will appear a two inch window equipped with a scroll bar on the right side. In the two-inch window will appear the Juror's transcribed typed answers to the Juror Statutory Qualification Questions of his/her respective questionnaire. To the far right of the entire screen will appear a scroll bar for the Judge to issue rulings on all of the jurors and view all of the jurors' names, video recordings, and juror qualification questions.</p><p id="p-0704" num="0703">To excuse or keep the jurors, the Judge must review the transcribed typed juror responses to the Juror Qualification Questions and examine the juror's reason for requesting to be excused from jury duty. The Judge may then review the juror's video recording of the juror answering the particular question as to why the juror is requesting to be excused and determine if the request is sincere or valid. Upon viewing and listening to a juror's video recording and determining the juror is not sincere, the Judge is instructed to click the &#x201c;Keep&#x201d; box, and a check mark will appear in the box. A check mark in the &#x201c;Keep&#x201d; box will require the juror to participate in the jury selection process. Upon viewing and listening to a juror's video recording and determining the juror is sincere and the juror's request to be excused is valid, the Judge may select the &#x201c;Excuse&#x201d; box, and a check mark will appear in the box. The Judge is instructed to place a check mark in either the &#x201c;Keep&#x201d; box or the &#x201c;Excuse&#x201d; box for each juror and then select submit in the bottom margin of the screen. Upon selecting &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit,&#x201d; the excused juror questionnaires and video recordings will not be presented to the attorneys or their professional jury consultants or the plaintiff or the defendant when they log onto the invention's website to view the juror video recordings and questionnaires. Such excused names will be placed on a separate list, and the Court Reporter will be instructed to print such a list and place it in the Court's file. Thus, upon the Judge selecting &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit,&#x201d; the video recordings and questionnaires and juror names of the jurors the Judge kept will be made available and will be presented to the attorneys and their professional jury consultants and the plaintiff and the defendant when they log onto the invention's website to view the jurors.</p><p id="p-0705" num="0704">The Court Reporter logs into his/her program in the invention's website and prints all of the jurors' answered questionnaires and the date each juror finished responding to the questionnaire.

The names on the list are interactive. When the attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants select a name, the video recording of the juror appears on the left half of the screen and the typed questionnaire appears on the right half of the screen. For Professional Jury Consultants, they will have an additional option on the left side of the screen that allows them to either view the Juror's typed questionnaire or view their client's information. Directly below the juror's video recording appears the picture of the juror's driver's license or picture identification card. The juror's driver's license or picture identification card is interactive. By clicking anywhere on such driver's license or picture identification card, the license or card enlarges so the picture on the license or card can be compared more easily with the Juror's video footage. Directly below the juror's driver's license or picture identification card are a play button, stop button, fast-forward button, and rewind button for the attorneys, judge, and professional jury consultants to view and listen to the juror respond to the questionnaire. Directly below these buttons are the words &#x201c;Play particular question(s):&#x201d; followed by space designated for the numbers of the questions on the questionnaire. Thus, the attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants can play any single question and answer or any group of questions and answers on the questionnaire by typing the number or number range in this space.</p><p id="p-0715" num="0714">On the right half of the screen with the questionnaire will appear the typed juror qualification questions. Below the typed juror qualification questions will appear the Judge's typed jury selection questions. Below the Judge's typed jury selection questions will appear the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions. Below the Plaintiff Attorney's typed jury selection questions will appear the Defense Attorney's jury selection questions. Thus, each question on the questionnaire appears in a typed format. To the left of each typed question on each juror's transcribed jury selection questionnaire that appears on the right side of the screen on the invention's website will appear the photo of the person whose video recording was appearing on the juror's screen when the juror responded to the particular question. For example, if the Judge's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 1 through 20 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Judge's photo derived from the Judge's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the typed juror qualification questions and the Judge's typed questions numbered 1 through 20 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0716" num="0715">Likewise, if the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 21 through 30 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Plaintiff Attorney's photo derived from the Plaintiff Attorney's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed questions numbered 21 through 30 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0717" num="0716">Also, if the Plaintiff's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 31 through 40 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Plaintiff's photo derived from the Plaintiff's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Plaintiff Attorney's typed questions numbered 31 through 40 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0718" num="0717">Additionally, if the Defense Attorney's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 41 through 50 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Defense Attorney's photo derived from the Defense Attorney's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Defense Attorney's typed questions numbered 41 through 50 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0719" num="0718">Also, if the Defendant's video recording appeared on each juror's screen for questions 51 through 60 on the jury selection questionnaire, the Defendant's photo derived from the Defendant's video recording that appeared to the jurors will appear to the left of each of the Defense Attorney's typed questions numbered 51 through 60 on each juror's transcribed questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0720" num="0719">The photos next to their respective typed questions on the transcribed jury selection questionnaires for each juror which symbolizes which person's video recording was appearing on each juror's screen when each juror responded to the questionnaire provides the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant with an opportunity to see how each juror responds to the individual video profiles of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant. For example, if the Defense Attorney wanted to know how each juror will respond to the Defendant's physical appearance, and if the Defendant's video recording appeared to the juror's on questions 51 through 60, the Defense Attorney could watch each juror's video recorded responses for questions 51 through 60 through the invention's designated website, and the Defense Attorney can see how each juror reacts to seeing the Defendant's video recording. Thus, by knowing whose specific video recording was playing on the jurors' screens when the jurors responded to the jury selection questions, the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant can see nonverbal clues as to how each juror responds to the video recordings of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant.</p><p id="p-0721" num="0720">Directly below each typed question on the jury selection questionnaire of each juror will appear the words &#x201c;Transcription of Video Recording.&#x201d; To the right of the words &#x201c;Transcription of Video Recording&#x201d; under each typed question will appear the transcription of the typed question's respective video recording.</p><p id="p-0722" num="0721">Directly below each typed questions' respective video recording transcription will appear the words &#x201c;Juror's Response.&#x201d; To the right of the words &#x201c;Juror's Response&#x201d; will appear the typed transcription of the Juror's video recorded response to the respective typed question on the questionnaire.</p><p id="p-0723" num="0722">The typed questionnaire and typed corresponding answers of each juror appears in a window equipped with a scroll bar on the right side so the attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants may view the entire questionnaire on the screen. In the top margin of the screen will appear the attorneys' deadline for exercising challenges for cause.</p><p id="p-0724" num="0723">Only if the Judge elected to allow attorneys to submit challenges for cause in the custom set up of the jury selection process, below the juror's video recording and questionnaire will appear designated space for the respective jurisdiction's statute that states the grounds for excusing a juror with a challenge for cause. Within such space containing the said statute, attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants may view the entire statute within the designated space as a scroll bar appears on the far right side of the space.</p><p id="p-0725" num="0724">At the bottom of the screen appears space for the attorneys, plaintiff, and defendant to type confidential notes on the juror to help them remember the juror. Thus, in this space, the heading &#x201c;Confidential Notes on [the juror's name will appear here]&#x201d; will appear. The attorneys, plaintiff, and defendant are advised to type notes that will help them make a decision as to whether to keep or exclude the juror with a peremptory challenge and type notes that meet any ground for excluding a juror with a challenge for cause as stated in the statute. For Professional Jury Consultants, this space will also appear except the heading will say: &#x201c;Professional Analysis of [the Juror's name will appear here].&#x201d; Thus, the Professional Jury Consultant will type his/her analysis of each juror. They all are also advised to review their jurisdiction's statutory grounds for challenges for cause featured on the screen and type confidential notes on jurors who should be excluded with a challenge for cause. Below the space for the attorneys, plaintiff, and defendant to type confidential notes and below the space for professional jury consultants to type a professional analysis of the juror is space for the attorneys, plaintiff, defendant and professional jury consultants to type a number between 1 and 10 based on the strength of their desire to exclude the juror from the jury pool. Such number will help them make decisions on which jurors to keep and which jurors to exclude in light of viewing a list of all the jurors. Thus, the attorneys, plaintiff, and defendant are instructed to type confidential notes on each juror they view and/or listen to respond to the questionnaire and assign a number between 1 and 10 based on the strength of their desire to exclude the juror from the jury pool. They are advised that the number 10 represents the strongest desire to exclude a juror while the number 1 represents the least desire to exclude a juror. Likewise, the professional jury consultants are instructed to type a professional analysis of each juror they view and/or listen to respond to the questionnaire and assign a number between 1 and 10 based on the strength of their desire to exclude the juror from the jury pool. They are advised that the number 10 represents the strongest desire to exclude a juror while the number 1 represents the least desire to exclude a juror. In this note making and number assigning phase, the notes that the attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants type are confidential and cannot be viewed by anyone.</p><p id="p-0726" num="0725">When the Professional Jury Consultant has finished typing a professional analysis of each juror and assigns a number between 1 and 10 to each juror in his/her respective program through the website, he/she is instructed to select a button labeled &#x201c;View Professional Analysis of All Jurors.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0727" num="0726">Upon selecting this button, the Professional Jury Consultant will be shown a list of every juror's name in the jury pool placed in order from the highest assigned numbers to the lowest assigned numbers based on the strength of the Professional Jury Consultant's desire to exclude the jurors from the jury pool. For example, any jurors with an assigned number of 10 will appear at the top of the list and any jurors with an assigned number of 9 will appear directly below the group of jurors with the assigned number of 10. The reason for this order is to make the online jury selection for the attorney easier. Thus, they can easily view the jurors they desire to exclude the most by being grouped in the same numbered category.</p><p id="p-0728" num="0727">Thus, the assigned number of the juror from 1 to 10 based on the professional jury consultant's strength of desire to exclude the juror appears to the far left of the juror's name. The juror's name is interactive. By clicking on the juror's name, the professional jury consultant can view and listen to the juror's video recording and view the juror's typed questionnaire or view their client's information. To the immediate right of the juror's assigned number and to the left of the juror's interactive name is a 1&#xbd; inch picture of the juror to help the consultant remember the juror. Directly below the juror's assigned number, picture, and interactive name is the professional analysis of the particular juror. On this screen, the professional jury consultant may edit his/her analysis of any juror and may edit his/her assigned numbers from 1 through 10 for any juror. In the top margin of the screen will appear the attorneys' deadline for exercising challenges for cause through the invention's website. The professional jury consultants are advised to submit their analysis of each juror to their respective attorney through the website at least one week before the attorneys' deadline for exercising challenges for cause through the website expires unless told otherwise by their respective attorney. Directly below the deadline will appear designated space for the respective jurisdiction's statute that states the grounds for excusing a juror with a challenge for cause. When the professional jury consultant has reviewed and/or edited an analysis and assigned a number from 1 through 10 for each juror, the consultant, at the bottom of the list of jurors, may type a summary or include any other information the consultant wishes to convey to his/her client to help his/her client make sound jury selections. After the consultant has finished typing an analysis for each juror and has assigned a number from 1 to 10 for each juror, the consultant is instructed to select the &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit&#x201d; option that appears in the bottom margin of the screen.</p><p id="p-0729" num="0728">Upon the Professional Jury Consultant selecting &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit,&#x201d; a window appears on the consultant's screen. Below the window appears a button labeled &#x201c;Take Picture and Submit.&#x201d; When such window appears on the screen and the consultant sits in front of a webcam, the consultant's live video recording appears in the window. When the consultant clicks &#x201c;Take Picture and Submit,&#x201d; the invention's website captures a picture of the consultant on the consultant's screen. When the Professional Jury Consultant's picture is taken, the Professional Jury Consultant's professional analysis of each juror, the assigned number of each juror from 1-10, and any included summary are made viewable and accessible through his/her respective attorney's program through the invention's website. When the Professional Jury Consultant's respective attorney views the Professional Jury Consultant's analysis of each juror and assigned number of each juror from 1-10 in the attorney's respective program through the invention's website, the attorney's respective Professional Jury Consultant's picture appears at the top of the screen. The purpose of the Professional Jury Consultant taking his/her picture in front of a webcam before he/she submits his/her analysis of each juror and assigned number of each juror from 1-10 is to prove that the Professional Jury Consultant submitted them through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0730" num="0729">When the consultant authenticates and submits his/her professional analysis of each juror and assigned number of each juror from 1-10 and any included summary to his/her respective attorney, the invention sends an email message to the personal email account of consultant's respective attorney instructing the respective attorney that he/she may log into his/her respective program in the invention's website and view the professional analysis and assigned number of each juror and any summary.

When the Plaintiff Attorney selects &#x201c;Submit Peremptory Challenge Exercises in Alternating Fashion&#x201d; from his/her respective Main Menu of Functions at the specified date and time set by the Judge for attorneys to submit peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion, the Plaintiff Attorney is initially shown a large light green window on his/her screen that states as follows: The Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney exercise peremptory challenges through this website by alternating back and forth with the Plaintiff Attorney submitting one peremptory challenge and then the Defense Attorney submitting a peremptory challenge until both attorneys have submitted all of their allotted peremptory challenges.

Each attorney will be allowed (the number of minutes the Judge allotted each attorney to submit each peremptory challenge through the website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process appears here) minutes to submit each peremptory challenge. During this process of attorneys submitting their peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion, the Defense Attorney will not be allowed to submit a peremptory challenge through the website until the Plaintiff Attorney submits his/her first peremptory challenge through the website.

Thus, the website automatically excludes the juror names and videos of jurors who were excluded with a challenge for cause or excused by the Judge through the website from the &#x201c;Submit Peremptory Challenge Exercises in Alternating Fashion&#x201d; screen of the Plaintiff Attorney to make peremptory challenge exercises through the website easier for the Plaintiff Attorney.</p><p id="p-0819" num="0818">On the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, by clicking on any juror's interactive name or interactive picture, the juror's transcribed questionnaire and all of the features detailed above will appear on the right of the screen and the juror's video recording and all viewing and listening options will appear on the left side of the screen as detailed above.

To the immediate left of the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's analysis will appear the number between 1-10 that the consultant assigned to the respective juror to express the strength of the consultant's desire to exclude the juror. The higher the number the stronger the desire of the professional jury consultant to exclude the juror with a peremptory challenge.</p><p id="p-0821" num="0820">Also, on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, directly below the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's analysis will appear the Plaintiff Attorney's confidential notes of the respective juror. To the immediate left of the Plaintiff Attorney's confidential notes will appear the number between 1-10 that the Plaintiff Attorney assigned to the respective juror to express the strength of the desire to exclude the juror. The higher the number the stronger the desire of the Plaintiff Attorney to exclude the juror with a peremptory challenge. On the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, a flashing cursor will appear next to the Plaintiff Attorney's assigned number to the immediate left of the Plaintiff Attorney's analysis of the juror appearing at the top of the list of juror interactive names. Thus, the Plaintiff Attorney is allowed to add an assigned number or change his/her existing assigned number of any juror and is allowed to add an analysis of any juror or change and/or add to his/her existing analysis of any juror on the list on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen. The website will advise the Plaintiff Attorney that he/she may add an assigned number under the interactive name of each juror or may change his/her existing assigned number to the immediate left of the Plaintiff Attorney's analysis of any juror and may add an analysis under the interactive name of any juror or change or add to any existing analysis under the interactive name of any juror on the &#x201c;Submit Peremptory Challenge Exercises in Alternating Fashion&#x201d; screen before or during the specified date and time the attorneys are to log onto the website and submit their peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion through the website to prepare for the peremptory challenge process.</p><p id="p-0822" num="0821">Also, on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, directly below the Plaintiff Attorney's confidential notes will appear the Plaintiff's own personal analysis, if the case is civil, and if the Plaintiff chooses to submit an analysis of each juror through the website. To the immediate left of any Plaintiff's analysis will appear the number between 1-10 that the Plaintiff assigned to the respective juror to express the strength of the Plaintiff's desire to exclude the juror. The higher the number the stronger the desire of the Plaintiff to exclude the juror with a peremptory challenge.</p><p id="p-0823" num="0822">Also, on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, the interactive juror names and pictures are placed in order based on the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's assigned number between 1 and 10. If no professional jury consultant was hired or retained to provide an analysis of each juror through the website, the interactive juror names and pictures are placed in order based on the Plaintiff Attorney's assigned number between 1 and 10. The higher the assigned number for a juror the higher the juror will appear on the list. For example, all jurors assigned the number 10 will appear first on the list. If more than one juror is assigned the same number, all jurors with the same number are placed in alphabetical order. All jurors assigned the number 9 will appear after the last juror in alphabetical order assigned the number 10 etc.</p><p id="p-0824" num="0823">Also, on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, in the far right edge of the screen will appear a scroll bar which will allow the Plaintiff Attorney to view, on the same screen, each of the remaining juror interactive names and interactive pictures and their respective Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant's analysis and assigned number, their respective Plaintiff Attorney's analysis and assigned number, and their respective Plaintiff's analysis and assigned number.</p><p id="p-0825" num="0824">Also, on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, in the top margin of the screen will appear the current date and time. Directly below the current date and time will appear the specified date and time for both attorneys to submit their peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion through the website as set by the Judge in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process. On the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, directly below the specified date and time for both attorneys to submit their peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion will appear a window on the left side of the screen. In the top of this said window will appear the label &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges.&#x201d; Directly below this said label and within the said window will appear consecutive numbers from 1 to the total number of peremptory challenges the Judge allotted each attorney to submit through the website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process. For example, if the Judge allowed each attorney to exercise 12 peremptory challenges through the website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process, the inside of the window will contain consecutive numbers from 1 to 12. When the Plaintiff Attorney successfully submits his/her first peremptory challenge, the name of the juror the Plaintiff Attorney selected to exclude with a peremptory challenge will appear next to the number one in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges.&#x201d; When the Plaintiff Attorney successfully submits his/her second peremptory challenge, the name of the juror the Plaintiff Attorney selected to exclude with a peremptory challenge immediately will appear next to the number two in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges.&#x201d; Thus, the name of each juror excluded with a Plaintiff Attorney's peremptory challenge through the website will appear next to the number that corresponds with the order the juror was excluded with a peremptory challenge through the website by the Plaintiff Attorney in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges.&#x201d; Thus, the website instructs the Plaintiff Attorney to continue submitting peremptory challenges in alternating fashion with the Defense Attorney until there is a name next to every designated number in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges.&#x201d; To the right of each juror's name on the list in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges&#x201d; will appear the juror's respective picture, and to the right of the juror's respective picture will be the exact date and time the Plaintiff Attorney excluded the respective juror with a peremptory challenge and the total amount of time the Plaintiff Attorney took to exclude the juror with a peremptory challenge will appear next to the exact date and time the Plaintiff Attorney excluded the juror and to the right of the total amount of time the Plaintiff Attorney took to exclude the juror with a peremptory challenge will appear the authenticating picture of the Plaintiff Attorney that the Plaintiff Attorney made through a webcam and into the website upon selecting &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit&#x201d; just before the Plaintiff Attorney submitted the peremptory challenge through the website.</p><p id="p-0826" num="0825">Also, on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, directly below the specified date and time for both attorneys to submit their peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion and to the right of the window containing the &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges&#x201d; will appear a window on the right side of the screen. In the top of this said window will appear the label &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges.&#x201d; Directly below this said label and within the said window will appear consecutive numbers from 1 to the total number of peremptory challenges the Judge allotted each attorney to exercise in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process. For example, if the Judge allowed each attorney to exercise 12 peremptory challenges through the website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process, the inside of the window will contain consecutive numbers from 1 to 12.

Thus, the website instructs the Plaintiff Attorney that the Defense Attorney has been instructed through the website to continue submitting peremptory challenges in alternating fashion with the Plaintiff Attorney until there is a name next to every designated number in the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0828" num="0827">Also, on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, directly below the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges&#x201d; and the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges,&#x201d; and directly above the window containing the juror interactive names and pictures is the time remaining for the Plaintiff Attorney to submit a peremptory challenge through the website. Thus, the amount of time the Judge allotted for each attorney to submit a peremptory challenge through the website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process will appear in the said area. Once the Plaintiff Attorney clicks &#x201c;OK&#x201d; on the above described message in the light green window, and the light green window disappears, and the Plaintiff Attorney is shown the entire screen to submit a peremptory challenge through the website on the specified date and time for attorneys to submit their peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion, the time the Judge allotted for each attorney to submit a peremptory challenge immediately will begin to count down so the Plaintiff Attorney can monitor how much time he/she has to submit a peremptory challenge through the website.</p><p id="p-0829" num="0828">On the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, in the bottom margin on the far right side of the screen will appear a rectangular light green window that will state &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge.&#x201d; When the Plaintiff Attorney selects &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge,&#x201d; a window appears on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen. Below the window appears a button labeled &#x201c;Take Picture and Submit.&#x201d; When such window appears on the screen and the Plaintiff Attorney sits in front of a webcam, the Plaintiff Attorney's live video recording appears in the window. When the Plaintiff Attorney clicks &#x201c;Take Picture and Submit,&#x201d; the invention's website captures a picture of the Plaintiff Attorney on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen. When the Plaintiff Attorney's picture is taken, the Plaintiff Attorney's peremptory challenge exercise of a juror becomes viewable to the Defense Attorney, the Judge, the Defendant, and the Plaintiff as detailed below. When the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant view the Plaintiff Attorney's peremptory challenge exercise of a juror, in their respective programs, the Plaintiff Attorney's authenticating picture appears with the name of such juror through the website as detailed below. The purpose of the Plaintiff Attorney taking his/her picture in front of a webcam before he/she submits his/her peremptory challenge of a juror is to prove that the Plaintiff Attorney submitted such peremptory challenge of the particular juror through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0830" num="0829">In the bottom margin of the left side of the screen will appear a rectangular gray window that will state &#x201c;Previous.&#x201d; By selecting &#x201c;Previous,&#x201d; the Plaintiff Attorney is shown the previous screen where he/she may view the instructions to submit peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion with the Defense Attorney.</p><p id="p-0831" num="0830">To successfully submit a peremptory challenge, the Plaintiff Attorney is instructed on the preceding screen that he/she must click a check mark in one box next to the interactive name and picture of one particular juror and click &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge.&#x201d; The Plaintiff Attorney is further instructed that before clicking &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge&#x201d; the website will not allow the Plaintiff Attorney to click a check mark in more than one box when it is the Plaintiff Attorney's turn to submit a peremptory challenge. For example, if the Plaintiff Attorney clicks a check mark in the box next to John Doe's interactive name and picture and then the Plaintiff Attorney clicks a check mark in the box next to Jane Doe's interactive name and picture, the check mark in the box next to John Doe's interactive name and picture immediately will disappear upon clicking a check mark in the box next to Jane Doe's interactive name and picture.</p><p id="p-0832" num="0831">The Plaintiff Attorney is further advised that before clicking a check mark in one box next to the interactive name and picture, the Plaintiff Attorney should compare his/her professional consultant's analysis and assigned number as well as any Plaintiff's analysis and assigned number as well as his/her own confidential notes and assigned number and then decide which juror to keep or exclude with a peremptory challenge. The website advises the Plaintiff the Plaintiff Attorney is advised to exclude all jurors assigned a number 10, and if the Plaintiff Attorney has any peremptory challenge exercises remaining after excluding all jurors assigned a number 10, the Plaintiff Attorney is advised to exclude all jurors assigned a number 9 etc. The website advises that if the Plaintiff Attorney assigns each juror a number between 1 and 10 with 10 representing the strongest desire to exclude a juror, the Plaintiff Attorney will be able to submit his/her peremptory challenges fast and within the time limit to submit a peremptory challenge through the website as all he/she needs to do is exclude the jurors with the highest assigned numbers.</p><p id="p-0833" num="0832">If the Plaintiff Attorney does not submit one peremptory challenge within the number of minutes the Judge allotted each attorney to submit each peremptory challenge through the website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process, the Plaintiff Attorney is still allowed to submit one peremptory challenge in the same manner detailed above. Thus, there are no consequences for either the Plaintiff Attorney or the Defense Attorney submitting one peremptory challenge after the number of minutes the Judge allotted each attorney to submit each peremptory challenge through the website has expired.</p><p id="p-0834" num="0833">Every time the Plaintiff Attorney exercises a peremptory challenge by clicking the &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge&#x201d; button in his/her program after clicking a check mark in the box next to one particular juror's interactive name and picture, the selected juror's name, on the screen, will become highlighted in light red and a single strike through line will appear through the juror's name. Also, the Juror's name will appear next to the corresponding number the juror was excluded with the Plaintiff Attorney's peremptory challenge in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges&#x201d; at the top of the screen. The check mark the Plaintiff Attorney clicked in the box next to the Juror's interactive name and picture to exclude the Juror with a peremptory challenge will remain in the box. Also, every time the Plaintiff Attorney successfully submits a peremptory challenge through the website in the manner detailed above except for the final peremptory challenge the Plaintiff Attorney is required to submit, a light red window will then appear in the bottom right corner of the Plaintiff Attorney's screen that covers the &#x201c;Submit One Peremptory Challenge&#x201d; button. The light red window states as follows: Your peremptory challenge was successfully submitted. The Defense Attorney is now submitting a peremptory challenge.

Additionally, every time the Defense Attorney submits a peremptory challenge through the website, the name of the juror the Defense Attorney selected to exclude with a peremptory challenge will become highlighted in light red and a single strike through line will appear through the juror's name on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen. Also, every time the Defense Attorney submits a peremptory challenge through the website, a check mark will appear in the box next to the interactive picture and name of the juror the Defense Attorney selected to exclude with a peremptory challenge on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen.

Thus, the Plaintiff Attorney is advised to assign a number between 1 and 10 with 10 representing the strongest desire to exclude a juror. The website advises the Plaintiff Attorney to exclude the jurors with the highest assigned number between 1 and 10.

Thus, when the Defense Attorney begins the process of submitting his/her first peremptory challenge through the website which is after the Plaintiff Attorney submitted his/her first peremptory challenge through the website, the name of the juror the Plaintiff Attorney selected to exclude with a peremptory challenge will appear next to the number one in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges&#x201d; on the Defense Attorney's screen.</p><p id="p-0863" num="0862">Also, on the Defense Attorney's screen, directly below the specified date and time for both attorneys to submit their peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion and to the right of the window containing the &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges&#x201d; will appear a window on the right side of the screen.

Thus, the website instructs the Defense Attorney to continue submitting peremptory challenges in alternating fashion with the Plaintiff Attorney through the website until there is a name next to every designated number in the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0865" num="0864">Also, on the Defense Attorney's screen, directly below the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges&#x201d; and the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Submitted Peremptory Challenges,&#x201d; and directly above the window containing the juror interactive names and pictures is the time remaining for the Defense Attorney to submit a peremptory challenge through the website. Thus, the amount of time the Judge allotted for each attorney to submit a peremptory challenge through the website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process will appear in the said area. Once the Defense Attorney clicks &#x201c;OK&#x201d; on the above described message in the light green window, and the light green window disappears, and the Defense Attorney is shown the entire screen to submit a peremptory challenge through the website, the time the Judge allotted for each attorney to submit a peremptory challenge immediately will begin to count down so the Defense Attorney can monitor how much time he/she has to submit a peremptory challenge through the website.</p><p id="p-0866" num="0865">On the Defense Attorney's screen, in the bottom margin on the far right side of the screen will appear a rectangular light green window that will state &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge.&#x201d; When the Defense Attorney selects &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge,&#x201d; a window appears on the Defense Attorney's screen.

When the Defense Attorney clicks &#x201c;Take Picture and Submit,&#x201d; the invention's website captures a picture of the Defense Attorney on the Defense Attorney's screen. When the Defense Attorney's picture is taken, the Defense Attorney's peremptory challenge exercise of a juror becomes viewable to the Plaintiff Attorney, the Judge, the Defendant, and the Plaintiff in their respective programs as detailed below. When the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant view the Defense Attorney's peremptory challenge exercise of a juror, in their respective programs, the Defense Attorney's authenticating picture appears with the name of such juror through the website as detailed below. The purpose of the Defense Attorney taking his/her picture in front of a webcam before he/she submits his/her peremptory challenge of a juror is to prove that the Defense Attorney submitted such peremptory challenge of the particular juror through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-0867" num="0866">In the bottom margin of the left side of the screen will appear a rectangular gray window that will state &#x201c;Previous.&#x201d; By selecting &#x201c;Previous,&#x201d; the Defense Attorney is shown the previous screen where he/she may view the instructions to submit peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion with the Plaintiff Attorney.</p><p id="p-0868" num="0867">To successfully submit a peremptory challenge, the Defense Attorney is instructed on the preceding screen that he/she must click a check mark in one box next to the interactive name and picture of one particular juror and click &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge.&#x201d; The Defense Attorney is further instructed that before clicking &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge&#x201d; the website will not allow the Defense Attorney to click a check mark in more than one box when it is the Defense Attorney's turn to submit a peremptory challenge through the website. For example, if the Defense Attorney clicks a check mark in the box next to John Doe's interactive name and picture and then the Defense Attorney clicks a check mark in the box next to Jane Doe's interactive name and picture, the check mark in the box next to John Doe's interactive name and picture immediately will disappear upon clicking a check mark in the box next to Jane Doe's interactive name and picture.</p><p id="p-0869" num="0868">The Defense Attorney is further advised that before clicking a check mark in one box next to the interactive name and picture, the Defense Attorney should compare his/her professional consultant's analysis and assigned number as well as any Defendant's analysis and assigned number as well as his/her own confidential notes and assigned number and then decide which juror to keep or exclude with a peremptory challenge. The website advises the Defense Attorney to exclude the jurors with the highest assigned number between 1 and 10. For example, the Defense Attorney is advised to exclude all jurors assigned a number 10, and if the Defense Attorney has any peremptory challenge exercises remaining after excluding all jurors assigned a number 10, the Defense Attorney is advised to exclude all jurors assigned a number 9, etc. The website advises that if the Defense Attorney assigns each juror a number between 1 and 10 with 10 representing the strongest desire to exclude a juror, the Defense Attorney will be able to submit his/her peremptory challenges fast and within the time limit to submit a peremptory challenge through the website as all he/she needs to do is exclude the jurors with the highest assigned numbers.</p><p id="p-0870" num="0869">If the Defense Attorney does not submit one peremptory challenge within the number of minutes the Judge allotted each attorney to submit each peremptory challenge through the website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process, the Defense Attorney is still allowed to submit one peremptory challenge in the same manner detailed above.

You may minimize this message into the bottom margin of your screen to allow you to review your notes, questionnaires, and/or videos of the jurors at any time before the specified date and time both attorneys are to submit their peremptory challenges through the website in an alternating fashion.</p><p id="p-0889" num="0888">Below the above said message in the window will appear a button that says &#x201c;OK.&#x201d; When the Plaintiff clicks the &#x201c;OK&#x201d; button on or after the specified time on the specified date, the large light green window with the above said message disappears to allow the Plaintiff to view each peremptory challenge submitted by the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney through the website. Thus, the large light green window with the above said message will not disappear by clicking the &#x201c;OK&#x201d; button at any time before the specified time on the specified date.

Thus, the Plaintiff is instructed to review his/her notes, questionnaires, and/or videos of the jurors as much as he/she desires before the specified date and time both attorneys are to submit their peremptory challenges through the website in an alternating fashion. The above said light green message will always appear on the Plaintiff's screen each time he/she selects &#x201c;View All Peremptory Challenge Exercises&#x201d; from his/her respective Main Menu of Functions in the website.</p><p id="p-0890" num="0889">Once the above said message disappears or the Plaintiff minimizes the above said message into the bottom margin of his/her screen, the Plaintiff is shown, in the middle of the screen, the interactive names and interactive pictures of only the remaining jurors who were not excluded with a challenge for cause or excused by the Judge through the website. Thus, the website automatically excludes the juror names and videos of jurors who were excluded with a challenge for cause or excused by the Judge through the website from the &#x201c;View All Peremptory Challenge Exercises&#x201d; screen of the Plaintiff to make viewing peremptory challenge exercises through the website easier for the Plaintiff.</p><p id="p-0891" num="0890">On the Plaintiffs screen, by clicking on any juror's interactive name or interactive picture, the juror's transcribed questionnaire and all its features detailed above will appear on the right of the screen and the juror's video recording and all viewing and listening options will appear on the left side of the screen as detailed above. Also, on the Plaintiff's screen, directly below each juror's interactive name and interactive picture, will appear the Plaintiffs analysis of the particular juror if the Plaintiff submitted an analysis of each juror to the Plaintiff Attorney through the website. To the immediate left of the Plaintiff's analysis will appear the number between 1-10 that the Plaintiff assigned to the respective juror to express the strength of the Plaintiffs desire to exclude the juror.

During this process of attorneys submitting their peremptory challenges in an alternating fashion, the Defense Attorney will not be allowed to submit a peremptory challenge through the website until the Plaintiff Attorney submits his/her first peremptory challenge through the website. Once the Plaintiff Attorney submits his/her first peremptory challenge, the Plaintiff Attorney will not be allowed to submit a subsequent peremptory challenge until the Defense Attorney submits a peremptory challenge first. Likewise, after the Defense Attorney submits a peremptory challenge, the Defense Attorney will not be allowed to submit a subsequent peremptory challenge until the Plaintiff Attorney submits a peremptory challenge first. Thus, neither attorney will be allowed to submit more than one peremptory challenge through the website before his/her counterpart submits a peremptory challenge through the website. Each attorney will be allowed (the number of minutes the Judge allotted each attorney to submit each peremptory challenge through the website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process appears here) minutes to submit each peremptory challenge. If an attorney does not submit a peremptory challenge within the designated time limit, he/she still is required to submit a peremptory challenge through the website regardless if the time limit expires.

Likewise, you will be allowed to view the name of each juror the Defense Attorney excludes with a peremptory challenge on a list on your screen immediately after the Defense Attorney submits each peremptory challenge.

Thus, the large light green window with the above said message will not disappear by clicking the &#x201c;OK&#x201d; button at any time before the specified time on the specified date. However, the Judge will be allowed to minimize the above said light green message into the bottom margin of his/her screen to allow him/her to review the questionnaires, and/or videos of the jurors at any time before the specified date and time both attorneys are to submit their peremptory challenges through the website in an alternating fashion. Thus, the Judge is advised that he/she may review the questionnaires, and/or videos of the jurors as much as he/she desires before the specified date and time both attorneys are to submit their peremptory challenges through the website in an alternating fashion.

Thus, the website automatically excludes the juror names and videos of jurors who were excluded with a challenge for cause through the website from the &#x201c;View All Peremptory Challenge Exercises&#x201d; screen of the Judge to make viewing peremptory challenge exercises through the website easier for the Judge.

Thus, only the interactive names of the jurors that are not highlighted in red with a strike through line are the only interactive names that the Plaintiff Attorney may strike with an additional peremptory challenge through the website. Additionally, all of the interactive names struck by an attorney's peremptory challenges that were overruled by the Judge through the website are automatically included in the jury panel and are not eligible to be struck by an additional peremptory challenge.

For example, if the judge overruled 5 of the Plaintiff Attorney's original peremptory challenges through the website, the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; will appear consecutive numbers from 1-5. When the Plaintiff Attorney successfully submits his/her first additional peremptory challenge, the name of the juror the Plaintiff Attorney selected to exclude with a peremptory challenge will appear next to the number one in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions.&#x201d; When the Plaintiff Attorney successfully submits his/her second additional peremptory challenge, the name of the juror the Plaintiff Attorney selected to exclude with a peremptory challenge immediately will appear next to the number two in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions.&#x201d; Thus, the name of each juror excluded with a Plaintiff Attorney's additional peremptory challenge through the website will appear next to the number that corresponds with the order the juror was excluded with a peremptory challenge through the website by the Plaintiff Attorney in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions.&#x201d; To the right of each juror's name on the list in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; will appear the juror's respective picture, and to the right of the juror's respective picture will be the exact date and time the Plaintiff Attorney excluded the respective juror with an additional peremptory challenge and the total amount of time the Plaintiff Attorney took to exclude the juror with an additional peremptory challenge will appear next to the exact date and time the Plaintiff Attorney excluded the juror and to the right of the total amount of time the Plaintiff Attorney took to exclude the juror with a peremptory challenge will appear the authenticating picture of the Plaintiff Attorney that the Plaintiff Attorney made through a webcam and into the website upon selecting &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge&#x201d; just before the Plaintiff Attorney submitted the peremptory challenge through the website.</p><p id="p-1077" num="1076">Also, with regard to the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen, directly below the label &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; and within the said window will appear consecutive numbers from 1 to the total number of additional peremptory challenges the Defense Attorney is required to submit. For example, if the judge overruled 3 of the Defense Attorney's original peremptory challenges through the website, the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; will appear consecutive numbers from 1-3. When the Defense Attorney successfully submits his/her first additional peremptory challenge, the name of the juror the Defense Attorney selected to exclude with an additional peremptory challenge will appear next to the number one in the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen so the Plaintiff Attorney can monitor the Defense Attorney's additional peremptory challenge submissions through the website as detailed above. When the Defense Attorney successfully submits his/her second additional peremptory challenge, the name of the juror the Defense Attorney selected to exclude with a peremptory challenge immediately will appear next to the number two in the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen. Thus, the name of each juror excluded with a Defense Attorney's additional peremptory challenge through the website will appear next to the number that corresponds with the order the juror was excluded with an additional peremptory challenge through the website by the Defense Attorney in the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen. To the right of each juror's name on the list in the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen will appear the juror's respective picture, and to the right of the juror's respective picture will be the exact date and time the Defense Attorney excluded the respective juror with an additional peremptory challenge and the total amount of time the Defense Attorney took to exclude the juror with an additional peremptory challenge will appear next to the exact date and time the Defense Attorney excluded the juror and to the right of the total amount of time the Defense Attorney took to exclude the juror with a peremptory challenge will appear the authenticating picture of the Defense Attorney that the Defense Attorney made through a webcam and into the website upon selecting &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge&#x201d; just before the Defense Attorney submitted the peremptory challenge through the website so the Plaintiff Attorney can monitor each of the Defense Attorney's additional peremptory challenges.</p><p id="p-1078" num="1077">When the Plaintiff Attorney clicks the &#x201c;OK&#x201d; button on the message in the above said light green window, and the window disappears, the time the Judge allotted for each attorney to submit a peremptory challenge immediately will begin to count down so the Plaintiff Attorney can monitor how much time he/she has to submit a peremptory challenge through the website.</p><p id="p-1079" num="1078">Ultimately, the Plaintiff Attorney submits all of his/her additional peremptory challenges in the exact same manner through the website as he/she submitted his/her original peremptory challenges through the website.

Thus, only the interactive names of the jurors that are not highlighted in red with a strike through line are the only interactive names that the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney may strike with an additional peremptory challenge through the website.</p><p id="p-1124" num="1123">Additionally, all of the interactive names struck by an attorney's peremptory challenges that were overruled by the Judge through the website are automatically included in the jury panel and are not eligible to be struck by an additional peremptory challenge.

Thus, the name of each juror excluded with a Plaintiff Attorney's additional peremptory challenge through the website will appear next to the number that corresponds with the order the juror was excluded with a peremptory challenge through the website by the Plaintiff Attorney in the window labeled &#x201c;Plaintiff Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; on the Defendant's screen.

For example, if the judge overruled 3 of the Defense Attorney's original peremptory challenges through the website, the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; will appear consecutive numbers from 1-3. When the Defense Attorney successfully submits his/her first additional peremptory challenge, the name of the juror the Defense Attorney selected to exclude with an additional peremptory challenge will appear next to the number one in the window labeled &#x201c;Defense Attorney's Additional Peremptory Challenge Submissions&#x201d; on the Defendant's screen so the Defendant can monitor the Defense Attorney's additional peremptory challenge submissions through the website as detailed above.

The attorney who is required to exercise the most additional peremptory challenges is required to exercise the first additional peremptory challenge through the website to begin the alternating peremptory challenge process on the specific date and time designated by the Judge. However, if both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney are each required to submit the same number of additional peremptory challenges through the website, the Plaintiff Attorney is required to exercise the first additional peremptory challenge through the website to begin the alternating peremptory challenge process on the specific date and time designated by the Judge. During the alternating process of attorneys submitting their additional peremptory challenges through the website in an alternating fashion, the attorney who is not required to submit the first additional peremptory challenge to begin the alternating peremptory challenge process will not be allowed to submit an additional peremptory challenge through the website until the attorney who is required to submit the first additional peremptory challenge submits his/her first additional peremptory challenge through the website. Once the attorney who is required to submit the first additional peremptory challenge to begin the alternating peremptory challenge process submits the first additional peremptory challenge to begin the alternating peremptory challenge process through the website, he/she will not be allowed to submit a subsequent additional peremptory challenge until the opposing attorney submits an additional peremptory challenge through the website first.

The total number of additional peremptory challenges the Plaintiff Attorney is required to submit through the website is equal to the total number of original peremptory challenges submitted by the Plaintiff Attorney that the Judge overruled through the website. The Plaintiff Attorney is required to submit (the number of additional peremptory challenges the Plaintiff Attorney is required to submit appears here) additional peremptory challenges. The Judge did not overrule any of the Defense Attorney's original peremptory challenges through the website. Therefore, the Defense Attorney's original peremptory challenge exercises are preserved, and the Defense Attorney is not allowed to submit any additional peremptory challenges through the website. The Plaintiff Attorney will be allowed to submit all of his/her additional peremptory challenges through the website by submitting one additional peremptory challenge at a time without the Defense Attorney submitting any additional peremptory challenges through the website. To successfully submit an additional peremptory challenge, you must click a check mark in one box next to the interactive name and picture of one particular juror and click &#x201c;Authenticate and Submit One Peremptory Challenge&#x201d; in the bottom margin of the screen. If you have more than one additional peremptory challenge to submit through the website, you will only be allowed to submit one additional peremptory challenge at a time through the website in the said manner until you have submitted all of your additional peremptory challenges through the website.

The Judge, the Defense Attorney, the Defendant, and the Plaintiff, if this case is civil, may log into their respective programs through the website on the specified date and time you are required to submit your additional peremptory challenges and view your additional peremptory challenge submissions immediately after you submit them. You may minimize this message into the bottom margin of your screen to allow you to review your professional jury consultant's notes, your notes, the Plaintiffs notes, questionnaires, and/or videos of the jurors at any time before the specified date and time you are to submit your additional peremptory challenges through the website. Thus, you are encouraged to review your professional jury consultant's notes, your notes, the Plaintiffs notes, questionnaires, and/or videos of the jurors as much as you desire to prepare yourself for the additional peremptory challenge submission process before the specified date and time you are required to submit your additional peremptory challenges through the website.</p><p id="p-1147" num="1146">Below the above said message in the window will appear a button that says &#x201c;OK.&#x201d; When the Plaintiff Attorney clicks the &#x201c;OK&#x201d; button on or after the specified date and time he/she is required to submit his/her additional peremptory challenges, the above said message disappears.

Thus, only the interactive names of the jurors that are not highlighted in red with a strike through line are the only interactive names that the Plaintiff Attorney may strike with an additional peremptory challenge through the website. Additionally, all of the interactive names struck by the Plaintiff Attorney's peremptory challenges that were overruled by the Judge through the website are automatically included in the jury panel and are not eligible to be struck by an additional peremptory challenge of the Plaintiff Attorney. Thus, directly above the bottom margin of the Plaintiff Attorney's screen will be a narrow rectangular window with a label that states &#x201c;Jury Panel and Alternate Jurors.&#x201d; The interactive names of jurors who were struck by the Plaintiff Attorney's peremptory challenges which were subsequently overruled by the Judge will appear in alphabetical order under the label &#x201c;Jury Panel and Alternate Jurors&#x201d; in the narrow rectangular window, and they will not appear on the Plaintiff Attorney's screen as possible interactive names the Plaintiff Attorney may strike with an additional peremptory challenge.

Thus, only the interactive names of the jurors that are not highlighted in red with a strike through line are the only interactive names that the Plaintiff Attorney may strike with an additional peremptory challenge through the website. Additionally, all of the interactive names struck by the Plaintiff Attorney's original peremptory challenges that were overruled by the Judge through the website are automatically included in the jury panel and are not eligible to be struck by an additional peremptory challenge.

Upon making such a selection, a template of the summons to be sent to the jurors appears. The summons template advises the juror that he/she has been selected to either sit on the jury panel or sit as an alternate juror. The summons template will also advise the juror of the case caption and case number of the case they are to sit as a juror or alternate juror. The summons template will also advise the juror of the address of the courthouse where the jurors are to report for jury duty. The summons template will include blanks for the date and time the juror is to appear in Court. The summons template also will contain an instruction for jurors to report to the given courthouse address on the given date and time for jury duty. The summons template will also advise the jurors to bring a photo identification with them when they appear in court.</p><p id="p-1224" num="1223">The summons template is also addressed to the name and address of the juror who is first in alphabetical order among all jurors making up the jury panel and alternate juror positions. In the bottom margin of the screen will appear a &#x201c;Next Juror&#x201d; option. When the Court Administrator selects &#x201c;Next Juror,&#x201d; the summons template then shows the name and address of the juror who is second in alphabetical order among all jurors making up the jury panel and alternate juror positions. Thus, each time the Court Administrator selects &#x201c;Next Juror&#x201d; the name and address of the next juror in alphabetical order among all jurors making up the jury panel and alternate juror positions appears on the summons template. Thus, the invention automatically generates a summons template for the name and address for each juror in the jury panel and each alternate juror once the jury panel and alternate jurors are selected. The Court Administrator is instructed to fill in the blanks on the summons template for the date and time the jurors are to appear for the jury trial. The Court Administrator is also instructed to make any additional edits to the summons template. Any information typed into the blanks and/or any edits made by the Court Administrator on any given juror's summons template will appear on every juror's summons template to prevent the Court Administrator from having to reproduce the same summons for each juror.</p><p id="p-1225" num="1224">In the bottom margin of the screen will appear a spell check option, save option, back option, next juror option, and print option. If the Court Administrator selects the back option, the letter of the juror previously shown on the screen will reappear. When the Court Administrator is satisfied with the letters to each juror, the Court Administrator is instructed to print all of the letters and mail them to their respective jurors.</p><p id="p-1226" num="1225">If the Judge elected to allow attorneys to exercise challenges for cause through the website and elected to allow attorneys to exercise peremptory challenges through the website in an alternating fashion on a specified date and time and elected to allow attorneys to contest their counterpart's peremptory challenges through the website in the Custom Setup of the Jury Selection Process, and if the judge overruled the Plaintiff Attorney's rebuttal of non-discriminatory reasons through the website, and if the Plaintiff Attorney submits additional peremptory challenges through the website, the Court Reporter is then notified with an email message that he/she must print through the website the Plaintiff Attorney's additional peremptory challenge submissions and place the copy in the Court's file for transcript purposes.

The claimed process also eliminates problems for the attorneys caused by the conventional in-court jury selection process which also will contribute to making lawyers supremely confident in their juror selections. Such advantages provided by the claimed process and the ways the claimed process eliminates problems for attorneys caused by the conventional in-court jury selection process are as follows:</p><p id="p-1241" num="1240">1. The claimed process provides to attorneys advantages which is an opportunity to obtain feasible professional jury consultation before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins with its consultant program. Every experienced trial attorney undoubtedly believes and claims time and time again that jury trials are won and lost based on juror selections. Nothing can possibly make a trial attorney more confident in making juror selections than obtaining an analysis of each potential juror from a professional jury consultant before the in-court jury selection process takes place. If a trial attorney is supremely confident in his/her juror selections, he/she will have confidence in a jury's verdict. Confidence in a jury's verdict is critically important because it makes a trial lawyer feel like he/she put his/her client in the best possible position to obtain a favorable verdict which is the ultimate goal of any trial lawyer in the conventional in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1242" num="1241">In the claimed process, both the Plaintiff Attorney and the Defense Attorney can obtain a typed analysis of each potential juror's video recorded responses through the claimed process. Ultimately, the claimed process makes obtaining the services of a professional jury consultant feasible for common low budget cases which is quite desirable. Without utilizing the claimed process, obtaining a professional jury consultant for the conventional in-court jury selection process is not feasible for common low budget cases because a professional jury consultant has to personally attend the conventional in-court jury selection process personally and typically stay in the county of where the jury trial is to take place and investigate the potential jurors before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins. A party who hires a professional jury consultant has to pay the travel expenses, lodging, meals, and hourly work rate of the professional jury consultant which can be incredibly expensive. Therefore, almost all lawyers in common low budget cases do not hire professional jury consultants. In fact, almost all lawyers in common low budget cases do not even consider the possibility of hiring professional jury consultants due to their historically high costs.</p><p id="p-1243" num="1242">The claimed process substantially reduces the costs of obtaining the services of a professional jury consultant. With the claimed process, the professional jury consultant does not have to travel to and stay in the county of the jury trial and does not have to attend the jury trial which substantially reduces the costs. With the claimed process, the professional jury consultant reviews each potential juror's video recording, types an analysis of each potential juror, and submits each analysis to his/her respective attorney through the process. Such work can be completed by the professional jury consultant from the comfort of his/her own office or home using a personal computer, cellular phone, or electronic tablet. Additionally, because the potential jurors answer every question of the judge, plaintiff attorney, and defense attorney outside of the presence of the judge, attorneys, and other potential jurors, the professional jury consultant's likely will receive enough accurate verbal and nonverbal feedback on each potential juror to make an accurate analysis of each potential juror. As a result, the claimed process makes obtaining a professional jury consultant more feasible and affordable for common low budget cases.</p><p id="p-1244" num="1243">Additionally, the claimed process provides an opportunity for a higher quality and more reliable professional analysis of each potential juror to attorneys than can be obtained without the use of the claimed process. Without the claimed process, the traditional services provided by professional jury consultants are primitive and substandard in comparison to the professional jury consultant analyses that can be obtained through the claimed process. Thus, as eluded to previously, without the claimed process, the professional jury consultants typically would study the potential jurors such as where they work, research them online, interview people in the community about them. Such information is useless when determining how a potential juror will view certain evidence or how a potential juror will decipher certain issues. Such information can only be said to support mere suspicions about how a potential juror will react to certain evidence and issues. Furthermore, without using the claimed process, the professional jury consultants have to &#x201c;make decisions on the fly.&#x201d; Thus, sometimes the first time the consultants actually see the potential jurors is when they appear in court for the in-court jury selection process, and it's the first time they see the potential jurors nonverbal communications. They have virtually no time to study the potential jurors and they have to advise their respective attorneys quickly in-court without much discussion or time for reflection. Also, as stated previously, the attorneys typically do not asked each potential juror every question, potential jurors often conform their responses with other potential juror, and potential jurors often mask their nonverbal and verbal responses which ultimately makes analyzing potential jurors difficult for professional jury consultants.</p><p id="p-1245" num="1244">Conversely, the claimed process creates a new standard in professional jury consulting, and a professional jury consultant's analysis of each potential juror through the claimed process is far superior to traditional professional jury consulting. Thus, with the claimed process, the attorneys' respective video recordings most likely will literally ask each potential juror individually and outside of the presence of other potential jurors about how they will perceive certain evidence and issues, and the claimed process captures their video recorded responses to each jury selection question long before the in-court jury selection process takes place so the professional jury consultants can easily repeatedly review the verbal and nonverbal communications of each potential juror to develop accurate perceptions of the potential jurors. Also, the professional jury consultants can draft and send to their respective attorney a thorough analysis of each potential juror through the website of in the claimed process, and such attorney can compare his/her own analysis of each potential juror and compare it with each of the professional jury consultant's analysis with each potential juror and ultimately make more confident juror selections than can be made within the limitations of the conventional in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1246" num="1245">2. Additionally, the audiovisual technology of the claimed process creates an environment for a potential juror that produces a substantially higher probability of obtaining accurate verbal and nonverbal responses from a potential juror to questions from the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney and accurate nonverbal reactions to the presences of the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney than the environment of the conventional in-court jury selection process by itself. As stated previously, the conventional in-court jury selection process does not always produce accurate verbal and non-verbal responses from potential jurors to questions from the attorneys and to the presences of the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney as communication research reveals that often potential jurors will create a mask and will take a submissive role because of the perception of power distance from the attorneys. This mask and submissive behavior of potential jurors often leads to inaccurate verbal responses and uncharacteristic nonverbal responses such as acting shy, using a low tone of voice, avoiding eye contact, and giving short answers because people who feel they are of a lesser status are expected to be humble when they are around people of a higher status (Ting-Toomy, 1999). Ultimately, as stated previously, obtaining inaccurate responses from potential jurors can cause plaintiff attorneys and defense attorneys to make juror selections that are against their respective interests which can ultimately cause them to lose their respective cases.</p><p id="p-1247" num="1246">The claimed process creates a more relaxed environment that removes all back channel cues when each potential juror responds to the judge's, plaintiff attorney's, and defense attorney's video and audio recorded questions. As stated previously, in the in-court jury selection process, attorneys sometimes can provide what are known as back-channel cues to potential jurors when asking potential jurors questions and when listening to potential jurors respond to such questions. Such back-channel cues may include but not be limited to tone of voice, nodding, and negative feedback like looking away, acting distracted, or looking bored (McCornack, 2010). For example, a lawyer may use a sharp tone of voice when asking a potential juror a question while looking away, and then frown at the potential juror when he/she responds to the question. Such back-channel cues including tone of voice, nodding, and negative feedback like looking away, acting distracted, or looking bored from a lawyer or anyone else in the courtroom can affect the verbal and nonverbal responses of a potential juror. Thus, the feedback provided by a questioner can have a dramatic effect on the respondent's responses in a communication (Wolvin and Coakley, 1996).</p><p id="p-1248" num="1247">The claimed process removes all back channel cues because it plays to each potential juror through a website, non-live, non-real time video recordings of the judge, plaintiff attorney, and defense attorney orally asking their respective jury selection questions. The potential jurors view and listen to the judge's, plaintiff attorney's, and defense attorney's video and audio recordings and orally respond to each of them through a webcam on their personal computer or cellular phone in the comfort of their own homes or anywhere they choose and out of the physical presence of the judge, plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, plaintiff, defendant and other potential jurors.</p><p id="p-1249" num="1248">The claimed process reduces the dominant/submissive problem that occurs in the conventional in-court jury selection process because the potential juror is not in the physical presence of the judge or attorneys asking the questions when the potential juror responds to their questions; therefore, the perception of power distance and dominance is reduced. Instead every potential juror is shown a non-live non-real time video of the lawyer or judge asking the question. This generic format removes the issue of dominance because there is no power distance. Also, the potential juror does not answer the questions of the attorneys and judge in the courtroom. Instead, he/she answers the questions on his/her own time and wherever he/she chooses. The potential juror is in a fixed environment where there is no expectation of submissive behavior. Additionally, there are no back-channel cues from a lawyer or judge to influence the potential juror's behavior or response as the lawyers' and judge's questions are presented to the potential juror in non-live non-real time videos.</p><p id="p-1250" num="1249">Additionally, in general, people are liberated from the constraints and expectations of face-to-face communication through technology not only verbally but nonverbally (McCornack 2010). People determine the appropriateness of communication in terms of situations, relationships, and cultural expectation, making decisions about what to say and not say (McCornack, 2010). Specifically, people who are high self monitors are sensitive to their communication adapting it whenever they perceive that they are not acting according to situational expectations (McCornack, 2010). If potential jurors fall into this category, they are likely to change verbal and nonverbal behaviors based on feedback from the questioner and other people in the courtroom, telling the lawyer what is expected or behaving as expected instead of providing an accurate picture of their opinions and backgrounds. However, people respond more openly on social media because they are removed from the constraints of live face-to-face interaction (McCornack, 2010). People responding openly on social media is called online disinhibition. Research shows when people are online they are more open and direct than in face-to-face communication (Suler, 2004).</p><p id="p-1251" num="1250">The claimed process provides a benign environment that facilitates online disinhibition for all potential jurors including high self-monitors. As previously stated, the questions are provided by non-live and non-real time videos with no feedback, so potential jurors will not try to match the appropriateness of responses with anticipated expectations from the judge and the lawyers. The encounter is devoid of nonverbal or verbal signals from the judge or a lawyer, so the response from the potential juror will not be modified. The online format is more informal (McCormack, 2010), so the answers will be more accurate especially for high self-monitors because they exhibit behavior in terms of situational expectations which are removed by the claimed process. The conventional in-court jury selection process cannot remove the nonverbal feedback from the judge and lawyers. Thus, as stated previously, in the conventional in-court jury selection process, the judge or lawyers will provide back-channel cues when questioning the potential jurors which can include a change in the tone of voice, a lack of eye contact, and facial expressions just to name a few. These cues inevitably will change the potential juror's response as suggested previously.</p><p id="p-1252" num="1251">Ultimately, the answers from the potential jurors in the claimed process would benefit from online disinhibition provided by the claimed process. As stated previously, research shows when people are online they are more open and direct than in face-to-face communication (Suler, 2004), and the lack of feedback and lack of exposure to verbal and nonverbal back channel cues fuels this openness. For this reason people will disclose personal, detailed information more quickly (Tidwell and Walther, 2002). Therefore, the potential jurors' responses to questions will likely be more personal and detailed when using the claimed process because the presences of the judge, attorneys, defendant, and/or plaintiff are through non-live non-real time video recordings.</p><p id="p-1253" num="1252">Furthermore, by the claimed process exclusively playing to a potential non-real time and non-live video recordings of the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney asking their respective jury selection questions while the potential juror responds in the comfort of his/her own home and out of the physical presence of the judge, plaintiff attorney, plaintiff, defense attorney, defendant, and other potential jurors, the potential juror is in an environment where he/she will be more confident and less conscientious, and therefore, substantially more likely to show non-verbal facial expressions in reaction to the plaintiff attorney's video recorded presence and the defense attorney's video recorded presence because the potential juror knows the plaintiff attorney's video recordings and the defense attorney's video recordings are not in real time or live, and therefore, knows he/she will not offend the plaintiff attorney or the defense attorney.</p><p id="p-1254" num="1253">3. Additionally, for the first time in history, the claimed process provides attorneys with an advantage of seeing how each potential juror in the entire jury pool responds to the individual presences of the plaintiff attorney and defense attorney which will provide attorneys with incredibly valuable information that will make them more confident in their juror selections. The claimed process creates an environment that practically forces each potential juror to view the presences of the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney. In the claimed process, only the video recording of the plaintiff attorney providing an introduction or orally asking a jury selection question will appear on the screen to each potential juror for the first half of the plaintiff attorney's questions when the potential juror responds to the plaintiff attorney's introduction or the first half of the plaintiff attorney's questions. When each potential juror responds to the second half of the plaintiff attorney's questions, the claimed process plays a non-live, non-real time video recording depicting the plaintiff in a stationary and silent state to each potential juror while at the same time playing non-live, non-real time audio recordings of the plaintiff attorney orally asking jury selection questions. Therefore, the claimed process practically forces each potential juror who responds through the website to view the plaintiff attorney's non-live video recordings which, in turn, creates a substantially higher probability for both attorneys to obtain nonverbal reactions from a potential juror to the presence of the plaintiff attorney than the environment of the conventional in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1255" num="1254">Similarly, in the claimed process, only the video recording of the defense attorney providing an introduction or orally asking a jury selection question will appear on the screen to each potential juror for the first half of the defense attorney's questions when the potential juror responds to the defense attorney's introduction or the first half of the defense attorney's questions. When each potential juror responds to the second half of the defense attorney's questions, the claimed process plays a non-live, non-real time video recording depicting the defendant in a stationary and silent state to each potential juror while at the same time playing non-live, non-real time audio recordings of the defense attorney orally asking jury selection questions. Therefore, the claimed process practically forces each potential juror who responds through the website to view the defense attorney's non-live video recordings which, in turn, creates a substantially higher probability for both attorneys to obtain nonverbal reactions from a potential juror to the presence of the defense attorney than the environment of the conventional in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1256" num="1255">4. Similarly, for the first time in history, the claimed process provides attorneys with an advantage of seeing how each potential juror in the entire jury pool responds to the individual presences of the plaintiff and defendant which will make the attorneys more confident in their juror selections. Thus, the audiovisual technology of the claimed process creates an environment for a potential juror that produces a substantially higher probability for attorneys to obtain nonverbal reactions from a potential juror to the presences of the plaintiff and defendant than the environment of the conventional in-court jury selection process. As previously explained, the conventional in-court jury selection process provides a very poor environment for a plaintiff attorney and a defense attorney to discern how potential jurors seated in the jury box react to the plaintiff's and defendant's presence.</p><p id="p-1257" num="1256">First, the claimed process creates a more relaxed environment that removes all back channel cues when each potential juror views the client's presence. The claimed process allows an attorney to produce and submit into the claimed process a video recording of his/her client in a stationary and silent state. If the attorney submits such a video recording of his/her client into the website, the claimed process exclusively plays to the potential jurors such non-live, non-real time video recording depicting the client in a stationary and silent state while at the same time playing non-live, non-real time audio recordings of the attorney orally stating jury selection questions for the second half of the attorney jury selection questions when the potential jurors respond to the second half of the attorney's jury selection questions. In the claimed process, the potential jurors view the client's video recorded presence and respond to the attorney's audio recorded questions from the comfort of their own homes or anywhere they choose and out of the physical presence of the judge, plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, plaintiff, defendant and other potential jurors since the claimed process plays the non-live non-real time video recording of the client and the non-live non-real time audio recordings of the attorney through a website and captures video recordings of the potential jurors through a website.</p><p id="p-1258" num="1257">By the claimed process exclusively playing a non-real time and non-live video recording of the client in a stationary and silent state to a potential juror while the potential juror responds in the comfort of his/her own home and out of the physical presence of the judge, plaintiff attorney, defense attorney, plaintiff, defendant, and other potential jurors, the potential juror is in an environment where he/she will be more confident and less conscientious, and therefore, substantially more likely to show a non-verbal facial expression in reaction to the client's video recorded presence because the potential juror knows the client's video recording is not in real time or live, and therefore, knows he/she will not offend the client.</p><p id="p-1259" num="1258">As mentioned above, since the potential jurors respond to the jury selection questions in the comforts of their own homes or anywhere else they choose, the potential juror also will be less likely to self monitor behavior because the video recording of the potential juror responding to the jury selection questions will be made in a relaxed environment. This reaction could be likened to the way people respond more openly on social media because they are removed from the constraints of live face-to-face interaction (McCornack, 2010). As mentioned above this response is called online disinhibition. Research shows when people are online they are more open and direct than in face-to-face communication (Suler, 2004). As previously discussed the lack of feedback and lack of exposure to verbal and nonverbal cues fuels this openness. For this reason, people disclose personal, detailed information more quickly (Tidwell and Walther, 2002). Therefore, the potential jurors' responses to questions likely will be more personal and detailed when they respond through the website of the claimed process because the presences of the attorney and client are through non-live non-real time videos.</p><p id="p-1260" num="1259">Second, the claimed process creates an environment that practically forces each potential juror to view the client's presence. As explained above, in the claimed process, the only video that appears and plays through the website to each potential juror when he/she responds to the second half of the attorney's jury selection questions is the non-live, non-real time video recording depicting the client in a stationary and silent state. Therefore, the claimed process practically forces each potential juror who responds through the website to view the client's non-live video recording which, in turn, creates a substantially higher probability for attorneys to obtain nonverbal reactions from a potential juror to the presence of the client than the environment of the conventional in-court jury selection process. When the attorney and consultant view each potential juror's video recording responding to all of the jury selection questions in their respective programs, they will see how each potential juror reacts to the client's presence.</p><p id="p-1261" num="1260">5. Additionally, for the first time in history, the claimed process provides an advantage of eliminating any probability of potential jurors conforming their responses which will make the attorneys more confident in their juror selections. Thus, the claimed process completely eliminates any probability of potential jurors conforming their responses with other potential juror's to the same questions. As previously explained, another problem with the conventional in-court jury selection process is that the potential jurors have a tendency to conform their responses to certain questions with the responses of other potential jurors who were previously asked the same questions which prevents lawyers from obtaining a potential juror's true beliefs and responses to certain particular questions. In the claimed process, each potential juror is allowed to respond to the questions in his/her own home on his/her own cellular phone, computer, or electronic tablet which prevents potential jurors from conforming their responses with other potential jurors.</p><p id="p-1262" num="1261">Additionally, when a potential juror responds to a question, the claimed process does not allow the potential juror to pause or stop the claimed process from video recording them until after they have finished responding to the question. Therefore, the claimed process prevents the potential juror from listening to the question, selecting pause, and then consulting with someone else before responding to the particular question. As a result, the claimed process completely eliminates any probability of potential jurors conforming their responses or views with other potential juror's and/or anyone.</p><p id="p-1263" num="1262">6. Additionally, for the first time in history, the claimed process provides an advantage of allowing lawyers to obtain maximum information on each potential juror which will make the attorneys more confident in their juror selections. Thus, the claimed process allows lawyers to ask each potential juror every question and obtain a response from each potential juror to every question. As explained previously, due to the limited time constraints of the conventional jury selection process, lawyers cannot ask each potential juror each question. Additionally, since potential jurors often conform their responses with other potential jurors, lawyers typically do not ask each potential juror each question in the conventional jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1264" num="1263">When the claimed process is utilized before the conventional in-court jury selection process, the potential jurors respond to the non-live, non-real time questions of the judge and the attorneys outside of court and before the in-court jury selection process begins. Typically, the potential jurors will have several weeks to an entire month to respond to all of the questions in the claimed process. Each potential juror answers each question of the judge, plaintiff attorney, and the defense attorney. Ultimately, the limited time constraints of the conventional in-court jury selection process do not apply to the claimed process. As a result, each potential juror responds to every question of the judge, plaintiff attorney, and defense attorney, and the claimed process captures a video recording of each potential juror responding to each potential question which allows the judge and the attorneys to view each potential juror's verbal and nonverbal communication of each response to every question of the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney. Thus, the claimed process allows the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney to examine thoroughly all of the potential jurors in the jury box before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins which allows the attorneys to develop true perceptions of the potential jurors and ultimately make better juror selections in the conventional in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1265" num="1264">7. Additionally, for the first time in history, the claimed process provides an advantage of allowing lawyers to obtain valuable video footage of the background scenery of each potential juror and to examine the potential jurors in a more relaxed, natural setting which will make the attorneys more confident in their juror selections. As previously stated, in the claimed process, the potential jurors can respond to each jury selection question through a webcam from their own home or any other location they choose. Where a potential juror decides to respond to the questions through a webcam in the website of the claimed process can provide valuable background scenery information to the attorneys. Thus, when a potential juror responds to the questions in front of a webcam, the webcam picks up the background scenery of the potential juror which can provide attorneys with information that they can use to make their juror selections. For example, the defendant in a particular case set for jury trial is African-American. Upon using the website of the claimed process, a potential juror responds to the non-live non-real time video recorded questions through a webcam on his smart phone in his own room of his house. The potential juror is shown a video recording showing the defendant is African-American while he responds to the second half of the defense attorney's questions. In the second half of the defense attorney's questions, the potential juror is asked whether he can be fair and impartial as a potential juror. After seeing the video recording of the African-American defendant, he responds by saying &#x201c;yes.&#x201d; However, in the background of the potential juror, a Nazi flag depicting a swastika appears pinned up on the wall of his room. Upon seeing the Nazi flag in the potential juror's video recording, the defense attorney is convinced the potential juror cannot be fair and impartial towards his/her African-American client and will seek to exclude such potential juror in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1266" num="1265">Additionally, the background of a potential juror's video recording obtained by the website of the claimed process can provide attorneys with other types of invaluable information such as the socio-economic status of potential jurors and the interests of potential jurors. For example, if the background scenery of a potential juror is a room that is quite elaborate, new, and filled with expensive art, a defense attorney who is representing a very poor client who lives in an inner city project apartment would believe that such a potential juror is quite wealthy and would not understand his/her client's situation or circumstances and would seek to exclude such potential juror based on such background information. Another example is a defendant could be charged with unlawful possession of marijuana, and the case is set for a jury trial. When a particular potential juror, sitting in his own room, responds through a webcam to the video recorded questions in the website of the claimed process, a shot glass with a marijuana leaf image appears on a dresser in the background of the potential juror. Upon seeing the shot glass in the potential juror's video recording, the prosecutor will seek to exclude the potential juror in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1267" num="1266">Furthermore, in the claimed process, the potential jurors are going to feel more confident when they respond from the comfort of their own home or anywhere else they may choose. When they feel more confident, a lot of them will not think to dress up which provides more insight to the attorneys as to what they are really like in their personal lives. Conversely, if the claimed process was not utilized and the potential jurors merely appear for the in-court jury selection process, the potential jurors will be more self-conscious and dress up which has the effect of masking what they are really like in their personal lives. Ultimately, the claimed process allows the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney to examine thoroughly the background sceneries of all of the potential jurors and examine the potential jurors in a more relaxed, natural setting before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins which allows the attorneys to develop true perceptions of the potential jurors and ultimately make better juror selections in the conventional in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1268" num="1267">8. Additionally, for the first time in history, the claimed process provides an advantage of substantially enhancing an attorney's ability to remember, compare, distinguish, and form an accurate perception of each potential juror from every other potential juror in the jury pool which will make the attorneys more confident in their juror selections. Thus, the claimed process substantially enhances an attorney's ability to remember, compare, distinguish, and form an accurate perception of each potential juror from every other potential juror in the jury pool which is very difficult or if not impossible to do in the conventional in-court jury selection process. As previously explained, remembering, comparing, and distinguishing the potential jurors from each other is significant because in the conventional in-court jury selection process both the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney are required to strike a certain number of potential jurors with peremptory challenges. Naturally, the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney will desire to exclude the potential jurors with their peremptory challenges that are most unfavorable to their respective clients' interests. Therefore, when deciding which potential jurors to strike with peremptory challenges, the lawyers must compare and distinguish the potential jurors from each other.</p><p id="p-1269" num="1268">As explained previously, the limited time constraints of the conventional in-court jury selection process causes lawyers to develop misperceptions about potential jurors and forces them to make quick, hurried, and unprepared decisions about which potential jurors to keep or exclude with peremptory challenges. The claimed process eliminates these issues. First of all, potential jurors are asked the questions via non-live non-real time video recordings. The claimed process then captures a permanent video recording of each potential juror reacting verbally and nonverbally to the questions of the attorney and the presences of the attorney and client. Such video recordings of the potential jurors are then stored online for the lawyers allowing quick access to information provided. Each potential juror's video recording can then be played repeatedly on demand by the attorney which substantially enhances an attorney's ability to remember, compare, distinguish, and form an accurate perception of each potential juror from all other potential jurors in the entire jury pool which is incredibly difficult or if not impossible to do in the conventional in-court jury selection process as previously explained.</p><p id="p-1270" num="1269">Ultimately, instead of being forced to make a decision within the limited times constraints of the conventional in-court jury selection process, lawyers can review the videos at their own pace with the claimed process. In terms of accurate perceptions, this creates a huge advantage. Perception allows people to select and focus on information in an attempt to interpret and attribute meaning (McCornack, 2010). The claimed process will allow the lawyer to review the potential jurors' videos looking at verbal and nonverbal responses to create more accurate perceptions of potential jurors. As previously explained, this fact is especially true in terms of mixed messages, a situation where verbal and nonverbal messages do not match. In such cases, people tend to focus on the nonverbal to reach and understand the communion message, which can be an inaccurate perception (Burgoon and Hoobler, 2002). Being able to review the video of a potential juror's responses can allow the lawyer to look at the verbal more critically in the case of mixed messages. The same is true for nonverbal messages. As stated previously, by its nature nonverbal communication can pose difficulty for interpretation since it is more ambiguous (McCornack, 2010). With the video review capability of the claimed process, the lawyer will have more time to evaluate the messages and attribute meaning improving cultural and gender competence because the lawyer can evaluate the appropriateness of the response through reexamination of the videos of potential jurors. This reexamination allows the lawyer time to acknowledge attributional complexity, the fact that people's behaviors are often difficult to understand, (McCornack, 2010) in an attempt to better comprehend the potential jurors. The reason this is so significant is because the claimed process allows the wait and reread mode suggested by Kali Munro (2002) where a person is able to assess initial impressions by allowing time to pass and reevaluating the initial attribution to confirm whether the gestalts formed were accurate. Dr. Ken Broda-Bahm (2015) makes this point in his article &#x201c;Don't Be Too Sure About Face Reading Your Jury.&#x201d; He points out that &#x201c;the more you know the person and the more you know the situation the more accurately you are able to determine the meaning from a facial expression.&#x201d; As previously stated, Jeffrey Frederick in his article &#x201c;Understanding Jurors' Nonverbal Communication, Part 1&#x201d; also warns attorneys to &#x201c;not fall victim to simplistic one-cue/behavior interpretation of the nonverbal communication of potential jurors at any given time.&#x201d; He encourages lawyers to look for clusters or combinations of nonverbal cues to more accurately understand behavior. The claimed process allows the attorney to take these steps in a way never previously allowed because it provides the wait and re-watch mode, so lawyers can obtain more information about the potential jurors and look for combinations of cues, making sure peremptory challenges can be used judiciously rather than imprudently.</p><p id="p-1271" num="1270">Furthermore, the claimed process produces data sets that substantially enhance an attorney's ability to remember, compare, and distinguish each potential juror from every other potential juror in the jury pool. The claimed process makes comparing and distinguishing the potential jurors incredibly easy for attorneys. With regard to the attorney's program, the attorney's consultant logs into his/her program and reviews each potential juror's video recording and types an analysis of each potential juror and assigns a number to each potential juror. Such number represents the strength of the consultant's desire to exclude the potential juror from the jury box. When the consultant finishes typing an analysis of each potential juror and finishes assigning a number to each potential juror's name, he/she submits each analysis and assigned number to the attorney's program for the attorney to review and consider.</p><p id="p-1272" num="1271">In the attorney's program, the claimed process produces a data set for each potential juror in the jury pool where the interactive digital picture of a potential juror is grouped with the respective name of the potential juror along with the analysis and respective assigned number from the attorney's consultant</p><p id="p-1273" num="1272">More specifically, when the attorney views the consultant's analysis and assigned number of each potential juror all on the same screen in the invention's website, the attorney is shown each potential juror's name in the jury pool, and, to the left of each potential juror's name, the respective picture of the potential juror derived from the potential juror's video recording appears. Directly below each potential juror's respective name, the consultant's respective typed analysis of the respective potential juror will appear. The consultant's assigned number for the respective potential juror's name will appear to the left of the consultant's analysis for the respective potential juror.</p><p id="p-1274" num="1273">The claimed process then automatically arranges and prioritizes each data set of each potential juror in the entire jury pool in a list based on their assigned numbers from the highest total numbers to the lowest total numbers. Ultimately, such order suggests the order in which the potential jurors should be excluded from the venire by the attorney with his/her peremptory challenges in the in-court jury selection process. Each data set of each potential juror is made viewable all on the same screen for the attorney. Ultimately, such data sets are only made viewable to the attorney.</p><p id="p-1275" num="1274">By the claimed process automatically arranging and prioritizing the assigned numbers of the consultant and placing the potential jurors in order based on their number thereby suggesting the order the potential jurors should be excluded by the attorney in the in-court jury selection process, the claimed process automatically distinguishes and compares each potential juror from all other potential jurors for the attorney. Additionally, by the claimed process showing all of the interactive digital pictures of the potential jurors on the same screen combined with the capability of playing any potential juror's video recording by merely clicking on the potential juror's picture, the attorney's ability to remember and distinguish each potential juror from every other potential juror becomes substantially enhanced. Thus, by the claimed process making a digital picture of each potential juror and placing it next to each potential juror's name and placing all of such digital pictures on the same screen, the claimed process creates a bird's-eye view of all of the potential jurors in the jury pool which is absolutely necessary for the attorney to remember and compare the potential jurors from each other.</p><p id="p-1276" num="1275">Furthermore, the potential jurors' digital pictures being interactive and having the capability of playing its respective potential juror's video recording upon being activated is also absolutely necessary when comparing and distinguishing each potential juror from all other potential jurors. As stated above, being able to replay each potential juror's video recording is a necessity as it helps attorneys develop accurate perceptions of the potential juror's verbal and nonverbal communication. Inevitably, not every potential juror is going to produce easy to read verbal and nonverbal communication in their respective video recordings. As a result, a lawyer likely will have to view certain potential jurors' video recordings several times to obtain true perceptions of their verbal and nonverbal communication. By each potential juror's digital picture being interactive and having the ability to play its respective potential juror's video recording, a lawyer can easily identify the potential juror by his/her picture and play his/her video recording.</p><p id="p-1277" num="1276">Additionally, the analyses of the consultant in the respective data sets are absolutely necessary and significant to adequately remembering the contents of each potential juror's video recording which ultimately substantially assists in comparing and distinguishing the potential jurors from each other. Thus, each analysis grouped with a potential juror's name will help the attorney recall the potential juror and distinguish the potential juror from all other potential jurors. Thus, if a lawyer did not obtain an analysis of any of the potential jurors' video recordings from the consultant and if there was no analysis under the potential jurors' names and digital pictures, it would be very difficult for the lawyer to remember a potential juror's video recording in light of remembering all other potential juror's video recordings in the jury pool.</p><p id="p-1278" num="1277">The final critical aspect of the data sets is the assigned number that is grouped with each potential juror's name, interactive digital picture, and analysis. As stated above, the assigned numbers of each potential juror represents the strength of the consultant's desire to have the potential juror excluded with a peremptory challenge in the conventional in-court jury selection process. By the claimed process grouping the assigned number of each potential juror's video recording with each respective potential juror's name, digital picture, and analysis, the claimed process makes remembering whether to exclude a potential juror possible and ultimately substantially enhances the ability of an attorney to compare and distinguish each potential juror from all other potential jurors.</p><p id="p-1279" num="1278">9. Additionally, for the first time in history, the claimed process provides an advantage of completely eliminating the problem of having no information on replacement potential jurors which will make the attorneys more confident in their juror selections. Thus, the claimed process completely eliminates the problem of having no information on replacement potential jurors who replace other potential jurors who were excluded with challenges for cause in the in-court jury selection process. As stated previously, typically, in conventional in-court jury selection, a potential juror in the jury box commonly is stricken with a challenge for cause when the questioning of potential jurors is almost complete. When the stricken potential juror is replaced by a new potential juror, neither the plaintiff attorney or the defense attorney know anything about the new replacement potential juror, and, typically, the judge will not allow the plaintiff attorney or the defense attorney to ask the new potential juror all of the questions that were previously asked of all of the other potential jurors sitting in the jury box. The claimed process solves this problem because all of the potential jurors make a video recording of themselves responding to each question, and the plaintiff attorney and defense attorney can review the videos of all potential jurors in the entire jury pool before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins. When a potential juror is stricken, the attorneys will know the new potential juror just as well as they would know all of the other potential jurors in the jury box.</p><p id="p-1280" num="1279">10. Additionally, for the first time in history, the claimed process provides attorneys with an advantage of making objections to their respective opposing attorney's questions outside of the presence of the jury pool. In the conventional in-court jury selection process and without the use of the claimed process, attorneys will often object to their opposing attorney's questions in the presence of the entire jury pool. Often an argument between the attorneys and the judge ensues when an attorney objects to his/her opposing attorney's question which can cause the attorneys to unconsciously appear to be angry or hostile in front of the jury pool which can have the effect of causing potential jurors to have a negative perception of either or both attorneys. As a result, attorneys objecting to questions outside of the presence of the potential jurors is quite desirable.</p><p id="p-1281" num="1280">When the claimed process is implemented before the in-court jury selection process begins, the court likely will hold an in-court hearing for attorneys to object to their counterpart's questions after each attorney submits his/her video recorded and typed questions through the claimed process's website and before the potential jurors are issued a summons to respond to such questions through the website. Thus, in the claimed process, all of the potential jurors in the jury pool respond to the video recorded and typed questions only after the court has ruled on attorney objections to their counterpart's questions. If an attorney's objection to a question was sustained, the question will be deleted and will not be presented to the potential jurors when they respond to all of the video recorded and typed questions. Ultimately, through the claimed process, none of the potential jurors will see the attorneys arguing or what appears to be bickering or looking hostile when they respond to the video recorded and typed questions which prevents potential jurors from developing negative perceptions of the attorneys.</p><p id="p-1282" num="1281">Furthermore, by implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process begins, the claimed process likely will prevent the possibility of lawyers objecting to their counterpart's questions in the in-court jury selection process. Even if the claimed process is implemented before the conventional in-court jury selection process, the attorneys will still be allowed to question potential jurors in court and attorneys will still be allowed to object to their counterpart's questions in front of the presence of the entire jury pool. However, the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process takes place will be that lawyers will ask their most difficult and objectionable questions through the claimed process and will already have predetermined their juror selections. Thus, the attorneys likely will merely use the in-court jury selection process to present themselves and their clients in a positive light and be friendly to the potential jurors and attempt to solicit positive feedback from the potential jurors before making juror selections which will prevent attorneys from objecting to their counterparts' questions.</p><p id="p-1283" num="1282">11. Similarly, for the first time in history, the claimed process provides attorneys with an advantage of preventing hostility between attorneys and potential jurors in the jury selection process. As stated previously, in the conventional in-court jury selection process and without the use of the above claimed, attorneys will often give back channel cues to the potential jurors when the potential jurors respond to their questions. Such back channel cues can include a stern tone of voice, a lack of eye contact, and facial expressions that indicate frustration just to name a few. These cues inevitably can have the effect of making a potential juror hostile with an attorney. Thus, a lawyer looking away when a potential juror responds to his/her question or looking frustrated when a potential juror responds to his/her question can at times make a potential juror uncomfortable and angry with an attorney. Additionally, sometimes lawyers may not like a potential juror's response to their question and unconsciously appear to be upset with the potential juror which can create hostility between the lawyer and the potential juror. Also, if a potential juror does not understand a lawyer's question and answers such question incorrectly they can become embarrassed in front of the other potential jurors which can cause them to become upset with the lawyer.</p><p id="p-1284" num="1283">As previously stated, the claimed process plays to each potential juror through a website, non-live, non-real time video recordings of the attorney orally asking his/her respective jury selection questions. Therefore, when each potential juror responds to the attorney's video and audio recorded questions through the claimed process, all back channel cues of the attorneys are completely removed. As a result, none of the potential jurors will ever receive a frustrated look from the lawyers which invites hostility from the potential jurors. Additionally, when the attorneys make their video recordings asking questions, they will be outside of the presence of the potential jurors and will not have encountered the potential jurors. Therefore, in an effort to make a good impression on the potential jurors, they likely will speak in a friendly voice when they make video recordings of them asking questions which will further prevent hostility with the potential jurors.</p><p id="p-1285" num="1284">Furthermore, by implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process begins, the claimed process likely will prevent hostility between lawyers and potential jurors in the in-court jury selection process. Even if the claimed process is implemented before the conventional in-court jury selection process, the attorneys will still be allowed to question the potential jurors in court in the conventional jury selection process and the judge and lawyers could still provide back-channel cues and be stern when questioning the potential jurors which, as stated previously, could cause potential jurors to be hostile towards attorneys. However, the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process takes place will be that lawyers will ask their most difficult and challenging questions through the claimed process and will already have predetermined their juror selections before the in-court jury selection process begins. As a result of the attorneys predetermining their juror selections before the in-court jury selection process begins, the attorneys likely will merely use the in-court jury selection process to present themselves and their clients in a positive light and be friendly to the potential jurors and attempt to solicit positive feedback from the potential jurors before making juror selections which will prevent hostility between the lawyers and potential jurors.</p><p id="p-1286" num="1285">12. In addition, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will increase the average number of minority jurors on juries, and it will substantially reduce the problem for defense attorneys caused by prosecutors who exclude potential jurors who share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant. To better explain how the claimed process achieves these objectives, a summary and certain key points of the problem caused by prosecutors exercising peremptory challenges on potential jurors who share the same race and/or gender as the defendant that has already been thoroughly explained above needs to be articulated here first. Thus, as stated previously, in criminal cases, prosecutors often will exclude potential jurors who are of the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant with their peremptory challenges in the conventional in-court jury selection process as prosecutors often cannot examine thoroughly the potential jurors. Also, as thoroughly explained above, the United States Supreme Court in <i>Batson v. Kentucky </i>devised a test to detect and eliminate race-based peremptory challenges during the jury selection process of a case. 476 U.S. 79, 94 (1986). If a prosecutor excludes a potential juror who is of a racial minority, the test requires a defendant to demonstrate to the court the following factors to prevent the prosecutor from excluding the potential juror who is of a racial minority: 1) that the defendant is a part of a cognizable racial group, 2) that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge to exclude a juror who is of the same race as the defendant, and 3) that evidence supports the inference of racial discrimination when the prosecutor exercised the peremptory challenge. 476 U.S. 79, 94 (1986). Once the defendant establishes a prima facie case for all 3 parts of the test, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to show race-neutral reasons for the peremptory challenge that is under review. Id. The judge then considers the non-discriminatory reasons for the peremptory challenge and decides if the challenge will be upheld. Id. As previously stated, the scope of this test established in Batson was expanded beyond race to exclude gender-based peremptory challenges by the court in <i>J.E.B. v. State ex rel T.B., </i>114 S.Ct. 1419 (1994).</p><p id="p-1287" num="1286">However, as thoroughly explained and detailed above, the <i>Batson </i>test historically has failed to eliminate most race and gender based peremptory challenges of prosecutors. Thus, in the conventional in-court jury selection process, defense attorneys have lost the overwhelming majority of their <i>Batson </i>challenges which means they were unsuccessful in preventing prosecutors from excluding potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendants. As previously explained, the reason the <i>Batson </i>test has predominantly failed to prevent most discriminatory peremptory challenges of prosecutors is because it failed to give any kind of meaningful guidance to the trial courts as to what constitutes an acceptable reason to defeat a <i>Batson </i>challenge. See Patricia J. Griffin, <i>Jumping on the Ban Wagon: Mintos v. City University of New York and the Future of the Peremptory Challenge, </i>81 Minnesota Law Review 1237, 1261 (1997). Thus, as previously explained, the <i>Batson </i>Court's holding only states that mere denials of intent to discriminate in the exercise of a peremptory challenge are not acceptable explanations, but the reason behind the peremptory challenge need not rise to the level of a challenge for cause. Id. Therefore, deciding which non-discriminatory reasons proffered by prosecutors to uphold their peremptory challenges are legitimate or not can be quite difficult for judges.</p><p id="p-1288" num="1287">As stated previously, to illustrate some of these failed <i>Batson </i>challenges and the difficulty judges have had deciding which non-discriminatory reasons proffered by prosecutors to uphold their peremptory challenges are legitimate or not, in <i>United States v. Sandoval</i>, a prosecutor excluded one of two black jurors with a peremptory challenge. <i>Morehead, supra </i>note 2, at 634. To rebut the <i>Batson </i>challenge, the prosecutor stated that the black juror &#x201c;was a cosmetologist, very youthful, and probably did not have a high level of education.&#x201d; Id. The trial judge accepted this reason because he perceived the holding in <i>Batson </i>to allow peremptory challenges that are partially based on race but not wholly or predominantly based on race. Id. Another example is <i>Unites States v. Lorenzo, </i>995 F.2d 1448 (9<sup>th </sup>Cir. 1993) a case in Hawaii. Id. A prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge to exclude the last juror who was of native Polynesian descent. <i>Morehead, supra </i>note 2, at 634. When confronted with a <i>Batson </i>challenge, the prosecutor gave the reason that the Polynesian had &#x201c;long, unkept hair, a long beard, and an appearance otherwise associated with the counterculture beliefs of hippies.&#x201d; Id. at 635. The trial judge upheld this reason. Id. Finally, in <i>United States v. Uwaezhoke, </i>995 F.2d 388 (3d Cir. 1993) the court upheld the exercise of a peremptory challenge on a black female based on a reason that she was a postal worker and &#x201c;a single parent living in a rental property in the city of Newark . . . .&#x201d; Id. at 391. The Court concluded that there was no evidence of intentional discrimination shown. Id. at 402.</p><p id="p-1289" num="1288">Additionally, as stated previously, another illustration of judges having difficulty deciding which juror exclusions were based on race and gender is in the Kansas case of <i>State v. Pink, </i>20 P.3d 31, 31 (Kan. 2001). In the Pink case, the prosecutor sought to exercise a peremptory challenge to exclude a black juror &#x201c;because she was nodding and smiling broadly when the question of whether police officers can lie was raised.&#x201d; 20 P.3d 31, 31 (Kan. 2001). The defense counsel claimed that he did not see such nodding and smiling. Id. The prosecutor then noted that the nodding and smiling was evident from where he was sitting. Id. The judge said: &#x201c;Well, [the prosecutor] is an officer of this Court, and if he says that that's what he observed, that's what he observed; and I find that there is a non-racial reason as enumerated, although I will admit I'm very uncomfortable with it.&#x201d; Id. As thoroughly explained previously, when prosecutors exercise peremptory challenges on potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant and defense attorneys are unable to prevent such exercises, defense attorneys lose confidence in a jury's verdict if the jury finds the defendant guilty on any charge.</p><p id="p-1290" num="1289">The implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins increases the confidence in a jury's verdict of a defense attorney representing a racial minority defendant in three substantial ways: 1) It will equip defense attorneys with very strong evidence to help them make substantially stronger <i>Batson </i>challenges to the Court to prevent prosecutors from excluding some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant; 2) It will provide prosecutors with substantial clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial which will deter prosecutors from attempting to exclude such potential jurors; and 3) It will provide prosecutors with clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant cannot be impartial which will make an impression on defense attorney that such exclusion of such potential jurors was justified and will not cause the defense attorneys to lose confidence in a jury's verdict. First, the claimed process will equip defense attorneys with very strong evidence to help them make substantially stronger <i>Batson </i>challenges to the Court because the claimed process captures a video recording of each potential juror responding to every question of the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney. If a prosecutor attempts to exclude a potential juror of the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant, the defense attorney can make a <i>Batson </i>challenge to the Court, and, under the third part of the <i>Batson </i>test which is &#x201c;that evidence supports the inference of racial discrimination when the prosecutor exercised the peremptory challenge,&#x201d; the defense attorney can play the potential juror's video recording in its entirety to the Court. If the video recording reveals that such potential juror's nonverbal communication appears to be consistent with his/her verbal communication and reveals that none of the potential juror's verbal responses indicated that he/she could not be impartial, the defense attorney can make such argument to the Court. Based on such argument and clear video recorded evidence, the Court would be substantially more likely to sustain the defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge and prevent the prosecutor from exercising a peremptory challenge on the potential juror which will make a defense attorney be more confident in a jury's verdict. Ultimately, with the implementation of the claimed process, the defense lawyer will be provided with more of an opportunity to make a clearer and more compelling argument that no legitimate reason exists to exclude a potential juror who shares the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant which will substantially increase the probability of keeping such potential juror in the jury.</p><p id="p-1291" num="1290">Additionally, if a potential juror's video recording reveals that such potential juror's nonverbal communication appears to be consistent with his/her verbal communication and reveals that none of the potential juror's verbal responses indicated that he/she could not be impartial, a Court would be substantially less likely to accept lame non-discriminatory reasons of prosecutors when they respond to <i>Batson </i>challenges such as the black juror &#x201c;was a cosmetologist, very youthful, and probably did not have a high level of education,&#x201d; the Polynesian juror had &#x201c;long, unkept hair, a long beard, and an appearance otherwise associated with the counterculture beliefs of hippies,&#x201d; and the black female juror was a postal worker and &#x201c;a single parent living in a rental property in the city of Newark.&#x201d; Thus, as stated above, without the claimed process, one of the problems of the conventional in-court jury selection process is that none of the potential jurors are asked every question. As a result, the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney rarely hear any of the potential jurors talk at length to obtain a clear grasp on the intelligence, beliefs, and opinions of the potential jurors which makes judges more likely to accept such lame non-discriminatory reasons of prosecutors. When the claimed process is implemented before the in-court jury selection process and the potential jurors respond to every single question of the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney, the judge likely will obtain a clear grasp of the intelligence, beliefs, and opinions of the potential jurors who are the subject of <i>Batson </i>challenges which will make a judge substantially less likely to accept such lame non-discriminatory reasons of prosecutors.</p><p id="p-1292" num="1291">Furthermore, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will prevent a prosecutor from giving the appearance that he/she fabricated or made up a reason to exclude a potential juror who shares the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant which will make a defense attorney more confident in a jury's verdict. For example, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins would have prevented the problem that was presented in the Kansas case of <i>State v. Pink, </i>20 P.3d 31, 31 (Kan. 2001) which was explained above. As stated previously, in <i>State v. Pink</i>, the prosecutor sought to exercise a peremptory challenge to exclude a black juror &#x201c;because she was nodding and smiling broadly when the question of whether police officers can lie was raised.&#x201d; 20 P.3d 31, 31 (Kan. 2001). The defense counsel claimed that he did not see such nodding and smiling. Id. The prosecutor then noted that the nodding and smiling was evident from where he was sitting. Id. The judge said: &#x201c;Well, [the prosecutor] is an officer of this Court, and if he says that that's what he observed, that's what he observed; and I find that there is a non-racial reason as enumerated, although I will admit I'm very uncomfortable with it.&#x201d; Id. Since the claimed process captures a video recording of each potential juror responding to every question of the attorney, all of the potential jurors' facial expressions and gestures will be clearly recorded for the judge's review. Thus, the claimed process provides the judge with clear evidence as to whether or not a potential juror appears to be fair and impartial. Therefore, if the claimed process is implemented before the conventional in-court jury selection process, prosecutors will be completely unable to fabricate or make up a reason to exclude potential jurors who share the same minority races and/or gender as the defendants which will make defense attorneys more confident in a jury's verdict.</p><p id="p-1293" num="1292">Second, inevitably the video recordings of all of the potential jurors responding to every question provided by the claimed process will provide prosecutors with substantial clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial which will deter prosecutors from attempting to exclude such potential jurors with peremptory challenges. The claimed process provides prosecutors with substantial verbal evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial as such potential jurors are required to answer each question of the attorney which, as stated above, cannot be done in the conventional in-court jury selection process by itself. Thus, as previously stated, when the claimed process is implemented before the in-court jury selection process and the potential jurors respond to every single question of the attorney, prosecutors likely will obtain a clear grasp of the intelligence, beliefs, and opinions of the potential jurors who share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant. If the prosecutors obtain such a clear grasp and ultimately conclude that such potential jurors will be fair and impartial, they may choose not to exclude such potential jurors which will make a defense attorney be more confident in a jury's verdict.</p><p id="p-1294" num="1293">Additionally, the claimed process provides prosecutors with substantial clear non-verbal evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial. As stated previously, the audiovisual technology of the claimed process creates a benign environment for a potential juror that produces a substantially higher probability of obtaining nonverbal reactions from a potential juror to questions from the attorney than can be obtained in the environment of the conventional in-court jury selection process by itself. Such nonverbal reactions are extremely important in forming an impression of a potential juror as Dr. Albert Mehrabian, author of <i>Silent Messages</i>, concluded that 93 percent of a communication message is from nonverbal sources. With such substantial non-verbal reactions of potential jurors who share the same minority race and/or gender of the defendant, prosecutors can compare such non-verbal responses with their verbal responses. If such potential jurors' non-verbal responses are consistent with their verbal responses and the overall messages indicate that such potential jurors are impartial, prosecutors will be less likely to attempt to strike such potential jurors with peremptory challenges which will make a defense attorney be more confident in a jury's verdict.</p><p id="p-1295" num="1294">Furthermore, the environment created by the claimed process allows a prosecutor more time to develop accurate perceptions, which reduces the impulse to make decisions based on stereotypes such as race and/or gender. Thus, the environment created by the claimed process potentially reduces race and/or gender based peremptory challenges because the prosecutors can use the playback features to review verbal and nonverbal behaviors instead of creating quick gestalts that are often wrong (McCornack, 2010). In fact, a series of experiments by Princeton psychologists Janine Willis and Alexander Todorov reveal that all it takes is a tenth of a second to form an impression of strangers from their faces (Wargo, 2006). Dan Ariely argues that first impressions cannot be trusted because people use anchoring, a cognitive bias where too much focus is placed on the &#x201c;first piece of information we receive about something&#x201d; (qtd. in Hedges, 2014). Kristi Hedges (2014) says, &#x201c;First impressions, while not only deeply affecting, can be flat-out wrong. Consider that leaders are more likely to be hired if they're tall. And that job candidates with African-American sounding names on their resumes are less likely to get interviewed.&#x201d; On a positive note, she reports that the &#x201c;research shows that the more important the relationship is to us, the greater our openness to having our first impressions overturned . . . . Though a poor first impression can create a relational headwind, you can make a conscientious effort to change that impression with increased exposure.&#x201d; Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman's book, <i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i>, says a person can create more accurate impressions by &#x201c;taking both your intuition and your reason into account.&#x201d; The focus of the book is the dual process model of the brain, which says that people have two thought systems: system 1, which is fast, intuitive and emotional, and system 2, which is slow, contemplative and logical. &#x201c;While our instinctive, immediate judgments can be helpful, we need to make sure we check our emotional responses with thought and reason&#x201d; (qtd. in Hedges, 2014).</p><p id="p-1296" num="1295">Also, the audiovisual technology of the claimed process allows prosecutors to repeatedly review the responses of the potential jurors in the videos which allows them to take emotional first impressions of the potential jurors and convert them into contemplative and logical decisions. Together the verbal and nonverbal cues can be used to make clear decisions that are not based on race or gender instead they are based on the ability of the juror to listen to evidence and make a fair decision. Ultimately, the environment created by the claimed process allows prosecutors more time to develop accurate perceptions, which reduces the impulse to make decisions based on stereotypes including race and gender.</p><p id="p-1297" num="1296">Third and finally, the video recordings of all of the potential jurors responding to every question provided by the claimed process likely will provide prosecutors with clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant cannot be impartial which will make an impression on the defense attorneys that such exclusion of such potential jurors was justified and will not cause the defense attorneys to lose confidence in a jury's verdict. For example, if a video recording of a potential juror who shares the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant shows such potential juror making a verbal response to a question that indicates he/she cannot be fair and impartial, the prosecutor will have clear evidence to exclude the potential juror, and the defense attorney will believe that such exclusion of such potential juror was justified. Also, if a video recording of a potential juror who shares the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant reveals that such potential juror's nonverbal communication appears to be inconsistent with his/her verbal communication on some of the questions pertaining to his/her ability to weigh evidence fairly and impartially the prosecutor will have clear evidence to exclude the potential juror, and the defense attorney will believe that such exclusion of such potential juror was justified. Ultimately, when a prosecutor has clear evidence that indicates a potential juror who shares the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant cannot be fair and impartial, the defense attorney likely will not lose confidence in a jury's verdict by the prosecutor excluding such potential juror with a challenge for cause.</p><p id="p-1298" num="1297">The claimed process eliminates problems presented to defendants in criminal cases by the conventional in-court jury selection process, and provides advantages to defendants in criminal cases.</p><p id="p-1299" num="1298">The claimed process provides advantages to defendants in criminal cases, and it eliminates problems for the defendants in criminal cases caused by the conventional in-court jury selection process. Such advantages provided by the claimed process and the ways the claimed process eliminates problems for defendants in criminal cases caused by the conventional in-court jury selection process are as follows:</p><p id="p-1300" num="1299">1. The implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will increase the average number of minority jurors on juries, and it will substantially reduce the problem for a defendant in a criminal case caused by a prosecutor who excludes potential jurors who share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant. As stated previously, in criminal cases, prosecutors exercising their peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors who share the same race and/or gender as the defendants in the conventional in-court jury selection process causes the defendants to lose confidence in a jury's verdict for the same reason as it causes defense attorneys to lose confidence in a jury's verdict. The explanations of how the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will increase the average number of minority jurors on juries, and how such implementation will substantially reduce the problem for a defendant in a criminal case caused by a prosecutor who excludes potential jurors who share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant are exactly the same as the explanations provided herein</p><p id="p-1301" num="1300">2. In criminal cases, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially safeguard and protect a defendant's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. As stated previously, even if the defendant in a criminal case is not of a minority race, prosecutors violate defendants' equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution when they exercise peremptory challenges on potential jurors based on their race and/or gender. Thus, the defendant's equal protection rights are violated when jurors are discriminated against and excluded. See <i>Batson v. Kentucky, </i>476 U.S. 79, 86 (1986). The explanation of how the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially protect a defendant's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution is exactly the same as the explanation provided herein. Thus, the explanation of how the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will increase the average number of minority jurors on juries and make defense attorneys and defendants more confident in a jury's verdict is the same explanation of how such implementation will substantially safeguard and protect a defendant's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Therefore, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially safeguard and protect a defendant's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution in the exact same three substantial ways: 1) It will equip defense attorneys with very strong evidence to help them make substantially stronger <i>Batson </i>challenges to the Court to prevent prosecutors from excluding some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant; 2) It will provide prosecutors with substantial clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial which will deter prosecutors from attempting to exclude such potential jurors; and 3) It will provide prosecutors with clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant cannot be impartial which will make an impression on defense attorney that such exclusion of such potential jurors was justified and will not cause the defense attorneys to lose confidence in a jury's verdict.</p><p id="p-1302" num="1301">First, since the claimed process equips defense attorneys with very strong evidence to help them make substantially stronger <i>Batson </i>challenges to the Court to prevent prosecutors from excluding some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant as explained previously, the Court would be substantially more likely to sustain the defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge and prevent the prosecutor from exercising a peremptory challenge on the potential juror which will prevent potential jurors from being discriminated against which results in safeguarding the defendant's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Second, since the claimed process provides prosecutors with substantial clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial as explained previously, prosecutors will be less likely to attempt to exclude such potential jurors which results in safeguarding the defendant's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Third and finally, since the claimed process inevitably will provide prosecutors with clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant cannot be impartial as explained previously, such clear evidence will make an impression on the defendant, defense attorney, and the judge that such exclusion of such potential jurors would be justified. Since such exclusion of such potential jurors would be justified, such potential jurors would not be excluded based on their race and/or gender which results in safeguarding the defendant's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</p><p id="p-1303" num="1302">3. The implementation of the above claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will provide a defendant in a criminal case an opportunity to substantially increase and enhance his/her participation in the jury selection process in the following ways: 1) It provides the defendant with an opportunity to submit an analysis of each potential juror who responds to the questionnaire to the defense attorney by the defendant using the consultant program; 2) It completely eliminates the problem of hindering a defendant's ability to thoroughly communicate his/her opinions to the defense attorney by the defendant using the consultant program; 3) It completely eliminates the problem of the conventional in-court jury selection process being a public forum which forces a defendant to whisper or write short hand notes to the defense attorney with regard to the potential jurors by the defendant using the consultant program; and 4) It substantially enhances a defendant's ability to remember, compare, distinguish, and form an accurate perception of each potential juror from every other potential juror in the jury pool which will assist the defendant in submitting an accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney by the defendant using the consultant program. First, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will provide a defendant in a criminal case an opportunity to communicate his/her opinion of each potential juror to the defense attorney long before the in-court jury selection process begins which provides the defense attorney with an opportunity thoroughly review each opinion of the defendant by the defendant using the consultant program. As explained previously, defense attorneys typically consult with the defendants as to whether or not to exclude potential jurors before they exercise their peremptory challenges. However, as explained previously, the limited time constraints of the conventional in-court jury selection process prevent a defendant from communicating an opinion of every potential juror in the jury box to the defense attorney. Thus, given the limited time constraints of the conventional in-court jury selection process, a defendant simply is not afforded the time to communicate his/her opinion of each potential juror to the defense attorney. As a result, without the implementation of the claimed process, the conventional in-court jury selection process hinders the defendant's ability to fully participate by preventing the defendant from communicating an opinion of every potential juror to the defense attorney.</p><p id="p-1304" num="1303">In the claimed process, the defendant in a criminal case could use the consultant program. After the potential jurors respond to the jury selection questionnaire through a webcam and through the claimed process and after the claimed process automatically transcribes each potential juror's oral responses to the jury selection questionnaire through the claimed process, the defendant, through the consultant program, may view the video recorded and transcribed responses of each potential juror and may submit his/her own typed analysis of each potential juror to the attorney's program before the in-court jury selection process begins. In particular, the defendant may type a confidential analysis of each potential juror's video recorded responses and respective typed responses to the jury selection questionnaire into the consultant's program and on the same screen he/she views each juror's respective video recorded responses and respective typed responses. Also, the defendant in the consultant's program may assign a confidential number for each potential juror based on the strength of his/her desire to exclude the potential juror with a challenge for cause or a peremptory challenge in the designated space next to his/her analysis of each potential juror's video recording. The defendant can then send his/her confidential analysis and confidential number of each potential juror to the defense attorney's program through the website of the claimed process.</p><p id="p-1305" num="1304">If the defendant sends his/her confidential analysis and number of each potential juror to the defense attorney's program through the website of the claimed process, the defense attorney may then view the defendant's analysis and number for each potential juror. In particular, when the defense attorney views the defendant's analysis and number of each juror on the same screen in the website of the claimed process, the defense attorney is shown each potential juror's name who responded to the questionnaire through the website, and, to the left of each potential juror's name, the respective picture of the potential juror derived from the potential juror's video recording appears. Below the potential juror's respective name and picture will appear the defendant's respective typed analysis of the respective potential juror appearing directly below the potential juror's name. To the left of the defendant's respective typed analysis of the respective potential juror will appear the defendant's respective confidential typed number.</p><p id="p-1306" num="1305">Second, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins completely eliminates the problem of hindering a defendant's ability to thoroughly communicate his/her opinions to the defense attorney. As previously explained, even when the defendant attempts to communicate opinions on at least some potential jurors to the defense attorney, the limited time constraints of the conventional in-court jury selection process hinders a defendant's ability to thoroughly communicate his/her opinions to the defense attorney as they pressure the defendant to be very brief when communicating with the defense attorney. Due to such pressure, the defendant often struggles to articulate his/her opinions to the defense attorney which often causes a defense attorney to often disregard the defendant's opinions.</p><p id="p-1307" num="1306">The claimed process eliminates this problem by removing the limited time constraints to formulate and communicate opinions of the potential jurors to the defense attorney. In particular, when the claimed process is implemented before the in-court jury selection process, the defendant is not under the limited time constraints of the in-court jury selection process. As a result, the defendant would have a significant amount of time to review each potential juror's video recording and typed responses and to clearly articulate his/her analysis of each potential juror and assign a number and submit each analysis and assigned number to the defense attorney. After the defendant has submitted an analysis and an assigned number for each potential juror to the defense attorney before the in-court jury selection process begins, the defendant most likely will not feel the need to communicate very much with the defense attorney in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1308" num="1307">Furthermore, as previously explained, the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process takes place will be that lawyers will have already predetermined their juror selections before the in-court jury selection process begins which means that the defense attorney already will have considered the defendant's analysis and assigned number of each potential juror before the in-court jury selection process begins. As a result of the defense attorney predetermining his/her juror selections before the in-court jury selection process begins and the defense attorney already having considered the defendant's analysis and assigned number of each potential juror, the defense attorney likely will merely use the in-court jury selection process to present him/herself and the defendant in a positive light and be friendly to the potential jurors and attempt to solicit positive feedback from the potential jurors before making juror selections which will prevent hostility between the defense attorney and potential jurors. As a result of this practical effect, the defendant most likely will not feel the need to communicate much with the defense attorney during the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1309" num="1308">Third, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins completely eliminates the problem of the conventional in-court jury selection process being a public forum which forces a defendant to whisper or write short hand notes to the defense attorney with regard to the potential jurors. Also, as previously explained, the conventional in-court jury selection process is a public forum where the potential jurors, prosecutor, and judge, in pertinent part, can see and hear the defense attorney and the defendant. This public nature of the conventional in-court jury selection process forces the defendant to whisper his/her opinions to the defense attorney or to write short discreet and sometimes incoherent notes on paper to show the defense attorney. Sometimes the defense attorney cannot always understand the defendant's whispers or notes which often causes a defense attorney to often disregard the defendant's opinions.</p><p id="p-1310" num="1309">The claimed process eliminates this problem by removing the public forum element when a defendant formulates and communicates his/her opinions of the potential jurors to the defense attorney. In particular, when the claimed process is implemented before the in-court jury selection process, the defendant views the video recorded and transcribed responses of each potential juror, types an analysis of each potential juror, assigns a number for each potential juror, and submits each analysis and assigned number for each potential juror to the defense attorney long before the in-court jury selection process begins as explained above which means the defendant completes such tasks outside of the courtroom and outside of the presence of the judge, prosecutor, and potential jurors. Thus, the defendant completes such tasks from a personal computer, tablet, or cellular phone equipped with internet access which completely eliminates the defendant's need to whisper.</p><p id="p-1311" num="1310">Additionally, as a result of the defendant having such a significant amount of time to review each potential juror's video recording and typed responses as explained previously, the defendant will have a lot of time to clearly reflect on each potential juror's video recorded and typed responses and a significant amount of time to clearly articulate his/her analysis of each potential juror and assign a number and submit each analysis and assigned number to the defense attorney which completely eliminates the defendant's need to write short hand notes to the defense attorney. Furthermore, as a result of the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process takes place, the defendant most likely will not feel the need to communicate much with the defense attorney during the in-court jury selection process which was previously explained.</p><p id="p-1312" num="1311">Fourth and finally, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins substantially enhances a defendant's ability to remember, compare, distinguish, and form an accurate perception of each potential juror from every other potential juror in the jury pool which will assist the defendant in submitting an accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney. As previously explained, the limited time constraints of the conventional in-court jury selection process cause defendants to provide inaccurate opinions about potential jurors to the defense attorneys. Thus, the limited time constraints of the conventional in-court jury selection process causes defendants to develop misperceptions about potential jurors and forces them to make quick, hurried, and unprepared opinions about which potential jurors to keep or exclude with peremptory challenges for the same exact reasons attorneys develop misperceptions about potential jurors which are thoroughly explained previously. The explanation of how the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially enhance a defendant's ability to remember, compare, distinguish, and form an accurate perception of each potential juror from every other potential juror in the jury pool is exactly the same as the explanation provided herein</p><p id="p-1313" num="1312">4. The claimed process also provides to defendants in criminal cases the same advantages it provides to attorneys which involve enhancing the quality and amount of information received from each potential juror. Ultimately, such advantages will help a defendant in a criminal case send a more accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney through the website of the claimed process. Thus, the claimed process provides to defendants in criminal cases the following advantages which enhance the quality and amount of information received from each potential juror: 1) It creates an environment for a potential juror that produces a substantially higher probability of obtaining accurate verbal and nonverbal responses from a potential juror to questions from the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney and accurate nonverbal reactions to the presences of the plaintiff attorney and the defense attorney than the environment of the conventional in-court jury selection process by itself which will help a defendant send a more accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney; 2) It provides defendants with an opportunity to see how each potential juror in the entire jury pool responds to the individual presences of the judge, plaintiff attorney, and defense attorney which will help a defendant send a more accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney; 3) It provides defendants with an opportunity to see how each potential juror in the entire jury pool responds to the individual presences of the defendant which will help a defendant send a more accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney; 4) It eliminates any probability of potential jurors conforming their responses which will help a defendant send a more accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney; 5) It allows defendants to obtain maximum information on each potential juror which will help a defendant send a more accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney; 6) It allows defendants to obtain valuable video footage of the background scenery of each potential juror and to examine the potential jurors in a more relaxed, natural setting which will help a defendant send a more accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney; and 7) It eliminates the problem of having no information on replacement potential jurors which will help a defendant send a more accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney.</p><p id="p-1314" num="1313">The explanations of how these advantages which involve enhancing the quality and amount of information received from each potential juror will help a defendant send a more accurate analysis of each potential juror to the defense attorney are provided herein.</p><p id="p-1315" num="1314">The claimed process eliminates problems presented to judges by the conventional in-court jury selection process and provides advantages to judges.</p><p id="p-1316" num="1315">The claimed process provides advantages to judges, and it eliminates problems presented to judges caused by the conventional in-court jury selection process. Such advantages provided by the claimed process and the ways the claimed process eliminates problems for judges caused by the conventional in-court jury selection process are as follows:</p><p id="p-1317" num="1316">1. The implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will reduce the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges presented to the judge thereby reducing the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges a judge will have to decide. To better explain how the claimed process achieves this objective, a summary and certain key points of the problem judges have in ruling on <i>Batson </i>challenges that has already been thoroughly explained previously needs to be articulated here first. As previously stated, race-based peremptory challenges are prohibited by the United States Constitution. See <i>Strauder v. West Virginia, </i>100 U.S. 303, 308-09 (1879). Gender-based peremptory challenges also are prohibited in the United States. See <i>J.E.B. v. State ex rel T.B., </i>114 S.Ct. 1419 (1994). As stated previously, in criminal cases, prosecutors often will exclude potential jurors who are of the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant with their peremptory challenges in the conventional in-court jury selection process as prosecutors often cannot examine thoroughly the potential jurors. Also, as thoroughly explained above, the United States Supreme Court in <i>Batson v. Kentucky </i>devised a test to detect and eliminate race-based peremptory challenges during the jury selection process of a case. 476 U.S. 79, 94 (1986). If a prosecutor excludes a potential juror who is of a racial minority, the test requires a defendant to demonstrate to the court the following factors to prevent the prosecutor from excluding the potential juror who is of a racial minority: 1) that the defendant is a part of a cognizable racial group, 2) that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge to exclude a juror who is of the same race as the defendant, and 3) that evidence supports the inference of racial discrimination when the prosecutor exercised the peremptory challenge. 476 U.S. 79, 94 (1986). Once the defendant establishes a prima facie case for all 3 parts of the test, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to show race-neutral reasons for the peremptory challenge that is under review. Id. The judge then considers the non-discriminatory reasons for the peremptory challenge and decides if the challenge will be upheld. Id. As previously stated, the scope of this test established in Batson was expanded beyond race to exclude gender-based peremptory challenges by the court in <i>J.E.B. v. State ex rel T.B., </i>114 S.Ct. 1419 (1994).</p><p id="p-1318" num="1317">However, as thoroughly explained and detailed previously, the <i>Batson </i>test historically has failed to eliminate most race and gender based peremptory challenges of prosecutors. As previously explained, the reason the <i>Batson </i>test has predominantly failed to prevent most discriminatory peremptory challenges of prosecutors is because it failed to give any kind of meaningful guidance to the trial courts as to what constitutes an acceptable reason to defeat a <i>Batson </i>challenge. See Patricia J. Griffin, <i>Jumping on the Ban Wagon: Mintos v. City University of New York and the Future of the Peremptory Challenge, </i>81 Minnesota Law Review 1237, 1261 (1997). Thus, as previously explained, the <i>Batson </i>Court's holding only states that mere denials of intent to discriminate in the exercise of a peremptory challenge are not acceptable explanations, but the reason behind the peremptory challenge need not rise to the level of a challenge for cause. Id. Therefore, deciding which non-discriminatory reasons proffered by prosecutors to uphold their peremptory challenges are legitimate or not can be quite difficult for judges.</p><p id="p-1319" num="1318">As stated previously, to illustrate some of these failed <i>Batson </i>challenges and the difficulty judges have had deciding which non-discriminatory reasons proffered by prosecutors to uphold their peremptory challenges are legitimate or not, in <i>United States v. Sandoval</i>, a prosecutor excluded one of two black jurors with a peremptory challenge. <i>Morehead, supra</i>, note 2, at 634. To rebut the <i>Batson </i>challenge, the prosecutor stated that the black juror &#x201c;was a cosmetologist, very youthful, and probably did not have a high level of education.&#x201d; Id. The trial judge accepted this reason because he perceived the holding in <i>Batson </i>to allow peremptory challenges that are partially based on race but not wholly or predominantly based on race. Id. Another example is <i>Unites States v. Lorenzo, </i>995 F.2d 1448 (9<sup>th </sup>Cir. 1993) a case in Hawaii. Id. A prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge to exclude the last juror who was of native Polynesian descent. <i>Morehead, supra</i>, note 2, at 634. When confronted with a <i>Batson </i>challenge, the prosecutor gave the reason that the Polynesian had &#x201c;long, unkept hair, a long beard, and an appearance otherwise associated with the counterculture beliefs of hippies.&#x201d; Id. at 635. The trial judge upheld this reason. Id. Finally, in <i>United States v. Uwaezhoke, </i>995 F.2d 388 (3d Cir. 1993) the court upheld the exercise of a peremptory challenge on a black female based on a reason that she was a postal worker and &#x201c;a single parent living in a rental property in the city of Newark . . . .&#x201d; Id. at 391. The Court concluded that there was no evidence of intentional discrimination shown. Id. at 402.</p><p id="p-1320" num="1319">Additionally, as stated previously, another illustration of judges having difficulty deciding which juror exclusions were based on race and gender is in the Kansas case of <i>State v. Pink. </i>20 P.3d 31, 31 (Kan. 2001). In the <i>Pink </i>case, the prosecutor sought to exercise a peremptory challenge to exclude a black juror &#x201c;because she was nodding and smiling broadly when the question of whether police officers can lie was raised.&#x201d; 20 P.3d 31, 31 (Kan. 2001). The defense counsel claimed that he did not see such nodding and smiling. Id. The prosecutor then noted that the nodding and smiling was evident from where he was sitting. Id. The judge said: &#x201c;Well, [the prosecutor] is an officer of this Court, and if he says that that's what he observed, that's what he observed; and I find that there is a non-racial reason as enumerated, although I will admit I'm very uncomfortable with it.&#x201d; Id.</p><p id="p-1321" num="1320">The implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will reduce the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges presented to the judge thereby reducing the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges a judge will have to decide. It will reduce the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges presented to the judge as it will provide prosecutors with substantial clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial which will deter prosecutors from attempting to exclude such potential jurors. Inevitably the video recordings of all of the potential jurors responding to every question provided by the claimed process will provide prosecutors with substantial clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial. The claimed process provides prosecutors with substantial verbal evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial as such potential jurors are required to answer each question of the judge, plaintiff attorney, and defense attorney which, as stated previously, cannot be done in the conventional in-court jury selection process by itself. Thus, as previously stated, when the claimed process is implemented before the in-court jury selection process and the potential jurors respond to every single question of the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney, prosecutors likely will obtain a clear grasp of the intelligence, beliefs, and opinions of the potential jurors who share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant. If the prosecutors obtain such a clear grasp and ultimately conclude that such potential jurors will be fair and impartial, they may choose not to exclude such potential jurors which will reduce the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges made by the defense attorneys. As a result of the defense attorneys making less <i>Batson </i>challenges, the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges a judge will have to decide will be reduced.</p><p id="p-1322" num="1321">Additionally, the claimed process provides prosecutors with substantial clear non-verbal evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial. As stated previously, the audiovisual technology of the claimed process creates a benign environment for a potential juror that produces a substantially higher probability of obtaining nonverbal reactions from a potential juror to questions from the judge, plaintiff attorney, and defense attorney than can be obtained in the environment of the conventional in-court jury selection process by itself. Such nonverbal reactions are extremely important in forming an impression of a potential juror as Dr. Albert Mehrabian, author of <i>Silent Messages</i>, concluded that 93 percent of a communication message is from nonverbal sources. With such substantial non-verbal reactions of potential jurors who share the same minority race and/or gender of the defendant, prosecutors can compare such non-verbal responses with their verbal responses. If such potential jurors' non-verbal responses are consistent with their verbal responses and the overall messages indicate that such potential jurors are impartial, prosecutors will be less likely to attempt to strike such potential jurors with peremptory challenges which will reduce the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges made by the defense attorneys. As a result of the defense attorneys making less <i>Batson </i>challenges, the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges a judge will have to decide will be reduced.</p><p id="p-1323" num="1322">Furthermore, the environment created by the claimed process allows a prosecutor more time to develop accurate perceptions, which reduces the impulse to make decisions based on stereotypes such as race and/or gender. Thus, the environment created by the claimed process potentially reduces race and/or gender based peremptory challenges because the prosecutors can use the playback features to review verbal and nonverbal behaviors instead of creating quick gestalts that are often wrong (McCornack, 2010). In fact, a series of experiments by Princeton psychologists Janine Willis and Alexander Todorov reveal that all it takes is a tenth of a second to form an impression of strangers from their faces (Wargo, 2006). Dan Ariely argues that first impressions cannot be trusted because people use anchoring, a cognitive bias where too much focus is placed on the &#x201c;first piece of information we receive about something&#x201d; (qtd. in Hedges, 2014). Kristi Hedges (2014) says, &#x201c;First impressions, while not only deeply affecting, can be flat-out wrong. Consider that leaders are more likely to be hired if they're tall. And that job candidates with African-American sounding names on their resumes are less likely to get interviewed.&#x201d; On a positive note, she reports that the &#x201c;research shows that the more important the relationship is to us, the greater our openness to having our first impressions overturned . . . . Though a poor first impression can create a relational headwind, you can make a conscientious effort to change that impression with increased exposure.&#x201d; Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman's book, <i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i>, says a person can create more accurate impressions by &#x201c;taking both your intuition and your reason into account.&#x201d; The focus of the book is the dual process model of the brain, which says that people have two thought systems: system 1, which is fast, intuitive and emotional, and system 2, which is slow, contemplative and logical. &#x201c;While our instinctive, immediate judgments can be helpful, we need to make sure we check our emotional responses with thought and reason&#x201d; (qtd. in Hedges, 2014).</p><p id="p-1324" num="1323">The audiovisual technology of the claimed process allows prosecutors to repeatedly review the responses of the potential jurors in the videos which allows them to take emotional first impressions of the potential jurors and convert them into contemplative and logical decisions. Together the verbal and nonverbal cues can be used to make clear decisions that are not based on race or gender instead they are based on the ability of the juror to listen to evidence and make a fair decision. Ultimately, the environment created by the claimed process allows prosecutors more time to develop accurate perceptions, which reduces the impulse to make decisions based on stereotypes including race and gender.</p><p id="p-1325" num="1324">As a result, prosecutors may choose not to exclude potential jurors who share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant which will reduce the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges made by the defense attorneys. As a result of the defense attorneys making less <i>Batson </i>challenges, the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges a judge will have to decide will be reduced.</p><p id="p-1326" num="1325">2. In the event prosecutors exclude with peremptory challenges potential jurors who share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendants and the defense attorneys present <i>Batson </i>challenge to the judges for rulings, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will make <i>Batson </i>challenge rulings significantly easier for judges in two substantial ways: 1) It will equip defense attorneys with very strong video recorded evidence to help them make substantially stronger <i>Batson </i>challenges to the judge which will make sustaining such <i>Batson </i>challenges easier for the judge; and 2) It will provide prosecutors with clear video recorded evidence to present to the judge to rebut a defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge which will show that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant cannot be impartial which will make overruling such <i>Batson </i>challenges easier for the judge.</p><p id="p-1327" num="1326">First, the claimed process will equip defense attorneys with very strong video recorded evidence to help them make substantially stronger <i>Batson </i>challenges to the judge which will make sustaining such <i>Batson </i>challenges easier for the judge. Thus, the claimed process captures a video recording of each potential juror responding to every question of the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney. If a prosecutor attempts to exclude a potential juror of the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant, the defense attorney can make a <i>Batson </i>challenge to the judge, and, under the third part of the <i>Batson </i>test which is &#x201c;that evidence supports the inference of racial discrimination when the prosecutor exercised the peremptory challenge,&#x201d; the defense attorney can play the potential juror's video recording in its entirety to the judge. If the video recording reveals that such potential juror's nonverbal communication appears to be consistent with his/her verbal communication and reveals that none of the potential juror's verbal responses indicated that he/she could not be impartial, the defense attorney can make such argument to the judge. Based on such argument and clear video recorded evidence, sustaining the defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge would be significantly easier for the judge. Ultimately, with the implementation of the claimed process, the defense lawyer will be provided with more of an opportunity to make a clearer and more compelling argument that no legitimate reason exists to exclude a potential juror who shares the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant which will make sustaining the defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge significantly easier for the judge.</p><p id="p-1328" num="1327">Additionally, if a potential juror's video recording reveals that such potential juror's nonverbal communication appears to be consistent with his/her verbal communication and reveals that none of the potential juror's verbal responses indicated that he/she could not be impartial, a judge would be substantially less likely to accept lame non-discriminatory reasons of prosecutors when they respond to <i>Batson </i>challenges such as the black juror &#x201c;was a cosmetologist, very youthful, and probably did not have a high level of education,&#x201d; the Polynesian juror had &#x201c;long, unkept hair, a long beard, and an appearance otherwise associated with the counterculture beliefs of hippies,&#x201d; and the black female juror was a postal worker and &#x201c;a single parent living in a rental property in the city of Newark.&#x201d; Thus, as stated above, without the claimed process, one of the problems of the conventional in-court jury selection process is that none of the potential jurors are asked every question. As a result, the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney rarely hear any of the potential jurors talk at length to obtain a clear grasp on the intelligence, beliefs, and opinions of the potential jurors which makes judges more likely to accept such lame non-discriminatory reasons of prosecutors. When the claimed process is implemented before the in-court jury selection process and the potential jurors respond to every single question of the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney, the judge likely will obtain a clear grasp of the intelligence, beliefs, and opinions of the potential jurors who are the subject of <i>Batson </i>challenges which will make a judge substantially less likely to accept such lame non-discriminatory reasons of prosecutors.</p><p id="p-1329" num="1328">Furthermore, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins likely will prevent the possibility of judges being exposed to in-court viewing issues such as the one presented in the Kansas case of <i>State v. Pink, </i>20 P.3d 31, 31 (Kan. 2001) which was explained previously. As stated previously, in <i>State v. Pink</i>, the prosecutor sought to exercise a peremptory challenge to exclude a black juror &#x201c;because she was nodding and smiling broadly when the question of whether police officers can lie was raised.&#x201d; 20 P.3d 31, 31 (Kan. 2001). The defense counsel claimed that he did not see such nodding and smiling. Id. The prosecutor then noted that the nodding and smiling was evident from where he was sitting. Id. The judge said: &#x201c;Well, [the prosecutor] is an officer of this Court, and if he says that that's what he observed, that's what he observed; and I find that there is a non-racial reason as enumerated, although I will admit I'm very uncomfortable with it.&#x201d; Id. Since the claimed process captures a video recording of each potential juror responding to every question of the judge, plaintiff attorney, and defense attorney, all of the potential jurors' facial expressions and gestures will be clearly recorded for the judge's review. Thus, the claimed process provides the judge with clear evidence as to whether or not a potential juror appears to be fair and impartial.</p><p id="p-1330" num="1329">Additionally, even if the claimed process is implemented before the conventional in-court jury selection process, the attorneys will still be allowed to question potential jurors in court and prosecutors will still be allowed to present to the judge non-discriminatory reasons that give rise to viewing issues such as the one in <i>State v. Pink, </i>20 P.3d 31, 31 (Kan. 2001). However, the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process takes place will be that lawyers will ask their most difficult and objectionable questions through the website of the claimed process and will already have predetermined their juror selections. Thus, the attorneys likely will merely use the in-court jury selection process to present themselves and their clients in a positive light and be friendly to the potential jurors and attempt to solicit positive feedback from the potential jurors before making juror selections which likely will prevent prosecutors from presenting to the judge non-discriminatory reasons that give rise to viewing issues. Therefore, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins likely will prevent the possibility of prosecutors presenting to the judge non-discriminatory reasons that give rise to viewing issues.</p><p id="p-1331" num="1330">Second, the claimed process will provide prosecutors with clear video recorded evidence to present to the judge to rebut a defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge which will show that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant cannot be impartial which will make overruling such <i>Batson </i>challenges easier for the judge. For example, if a video recording of a potential juror who shares the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant shows such potential juror making a verbal response to a question that indicates he/she cannot be fair and impartial, the prosecutor will have clear evidence to present to the judge to exclude the potential juror, and the judge clearly will believe that the prosecutor's exclusion of such potential juror with a peremptory challenge was justified upon reviewing such video recording. Therefore, if the defense attorney makes a <i>Batson </i>challenge against the prosecutor's peremptory challenge exercise on such potential juror, the prosecutor will have clear video recorded evidence to present to the judge to rebut such <i>Batson </i>challenge that such potential juror cannot be fair and impartial, and based on such video recorded evidence, the judge easily will be able to overrule the defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge on such potential juror.</p><p id="p-1332" num="1331">Also, if a video recording of a potential juror who shares the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant reveals that such potential juror's nonverbal communication appears to be inconsistent with his/her verbal communication on some of the questions pertaining to his/her ability to weigh evidence fairly and impartially, the prosecutor will have clear evidence to present to the judge to exclude the potential juror, and the judge will believe that the prosecutor's exclusion of such potential juror with a peremptory challenge was justified. Therefore, if the defense attorney makes a <i>Batson </i>challenge against the prosecutor's peremptory challenge exercise on such potential juror, the prosecutor will have clear video recorded evidence to present to the judge to rebut such <i>Batson </i>challenge that such potential juror cannot be fair and impartial, and based on such video recorded evidence, the judge easily will be able to overrule the defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge. Ultimately, when a prosecutor presents clear video recorded evidence to rebut a defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge that indicates a potential juror who shares the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant cannot be fair and impartial, the judge easily will be able to overrule the defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge.</p><p id="p-1333" num="1332">3. The implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially reduce the time to complete the in-court jury selection process which will free up judges' calendars and dockets. As stated previously, a problem the in-court jury selection process presents to judges is that it is time consuming to complete which causes jury trials to take longer to complete which has the effect of clogging judges' calendars and dockets. As stated previously, the conventional jury selection process can take anywhere from 1 day to several months to complete depending on the case. Most judges have calendars and dockets that are completely full which causes them to have to continue cases further into the future. Jury selection processes that take months to complete as explained above often cause administrative problems for judges. For example, if a judge has to preside over a jury selection process that takes months to complete, the judge has to re-assign or temporarily transfer all of his/her other cases on his/her calendar to other judges in the courthouse or the district which increases their work loads.</p><p id="p-1334" num="1333">The practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process will substantially reduce the time to complete the conventional in-court jury selection process. As previously stated, the judge and attorneys will still be allowed to question the potential jurors in the conventional in-court jury selection process even if the claimed process is implemented before the conventional in-court jury selection process. However, the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process takes place will be that lawyers will ask their most difficult and challenging questions through the website of the claimed process and will thoroughly question each potential juror through the website of the claimed process. Also, the judge typically will ask all of the questions he/she intends to ask the potential jurors through the claimed process. Additionally, before the in-court jury selection process takes place, the lawyers will have already thoroughly reviewed each potential juror's response to each question asked by the judge, plaintiff attorney, and defense attorney. As a result, the lawyers inevitably will predetermine their juror selections before the in-court jury selection process begins. As a result of the attorneys predetermining their juror selections before the in-court jury selection process begins, the attorneys likely will merely use the in-court jury selection process to present themselves and their clients in a positive light and be friendly to the potential jurors and will not thoroughly question any of the potential jurors which is quite time consuming. By the attorneys not thoroughly questioning any of the potential jurors, the time to complete the in-court jury selection process substantially will be reduced. Additionally, since the judge typically will ask all of the questions he/she intends to ask the potential jurors through the claimed process, he/she will not ask the potential jurors any questions in the in-court jury selection questions which will further reduce the time to complete the in-court jury selection process. Furthermore, since the attorneys likely will not be thoroughly questioning any of the potential jurors in the in-court jury selection process, the attorneys likely will not have any objections to any of their counter-parts questions during the in-court jury selection process which will further reduce the time to complete the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1335" num="1334">As a result of the claimed process substantially reducing the time to complete the in-court jury selection process, the judges' calendars and dockets will be freed up. For example, a judge schedules a jury trial on his/her calendar for 7 business days with the estimation of the in-court jury selection process lasting 2 days and the trial lasting 5 days. If the implementation of the claimed process reduces the time to fully complete the in-court jury selection process to a mere two hours and the trial lasts 5 days, the entire jury trial would be completed in 5 days and two hours which would free up 1 business day and 6 hours on the judge's calendar.</p><p id="p-1336" num="1335">4. The implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially reduce the judge's responsibilities in the in-court jury selection process. Thus, the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process takes place will substantially reduce the following judicial responsibilities: 1) Asking potential jurors questions in the in-court jury selection process; 2) Ruling on objections in the in-court jury selection process; 3) Monitoring the in-court jury selection process, and 4) Ruling on <i>Batson </i>challenges in the in-court jury selection process. As previously stated, the judge typically will ask all of the questions he/she intends to ask the potential jurors through the claimed process. Therefore, the judge likely will not ask the potential jurors any questions in the in-court jury selection process thereby reducing such responsibility of the judge.</p><p id="p-1337" num="1336">As previously stated, the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process takes place will be that lawyers will ask their most difficult and challenging questions through the website of the claimed process and will thoroughly question each potential juror through the website of the claimed process.

As a result, the lawyers inevitably will predetermine their juror selections before the in-court jury selection process begins. As a result of the attorneys predetermining their juror selections before the in-court jury selection process begins, the attorneys likely will merely use the in-court jury selection process to present themselves and their clients in a positive light and be friendly to the potential jurors and will not thoroughly question any of the potential jurors. Since the attorneys likely will not be thoroughly questioning any of the potential jurors in the in-court jury selection process, the attorneys likely will not have any objections to any of their counter-parts questions during the in-court jury selection process which will substantially reduce the probability of the judge having to rule on objections in the in-court jury selection process thereby reducing such responsibility of the judge.</p><p id="p-1338" num="1337">Since the implementation of the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process will substantially reduce the time to complete the in-court jury selection process as previously explained, such substantial reduction in time reduces the amount of time the judge has to monitor and preside over the jury selection process. Finally, as thoroughly explained above, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will reduce the number of <i>Batson </i>challenges presented to the judge thereby reducing the judge's responsibility of having to decide <i>Batson </i>challenges.</p><p id="p-1339" num="1338">The claimed process eliminates problems presented to jurors by the conventional in-court jury selection process and provides advantages to jurors.</p><p id="p-1340" num="1339">The claimed process provides advantages to jurors, and it eliminates problems presented to jurors caused by the conventional in-court jury selection process. Such advantages provided by the claimed process and the ways the claimed process eliminates problems for jurors caused by the conventional in-court jury selection process are as follows:</p><p id="p-1341" num="1340">1. The implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially reduce the time to complete the in-court jury selection process which will allow potential jurors who become excluded in the in-court jury selection process and the potential jurors who become impaneled as jurors in the in-court jury selection process to return to their families, jobs, and personal life much quicker. As stated previously, the conventional jury selection process is time consuming, and it can take anywhere from 1 day to several months to complete depending on the case. The potential jurors summoned for jury duty most commonly sacrifice their time away from their families, jobs, and personal life to participate in the jury selection process. The potential jurors typically have to sit through long jury selection examinations which keep them away from their jobs and their families for lengthy periods of time.</p><p id="p-1342" num="1341">The practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially reduce the time to complete the conventional in-court jury selection process. The explanations of how the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially reduce the time to complete the conventional in-court jury selection process are provided herein.</p><p id="p-1343" num="1342">As a result of the claimed process substantially reducing the time to complete the in-court jury selection process, the potential jurors who become excluded in the in-court jury selection process and the potential jurors who become impaneled as jurors in the in-court jury selection process will be able to return to their families, jobs, and personal life much quicker. For example, a judge schedules a jury trial on his/her calendar for 7 business days with the estimation of the in-court jury selection process lasting 2 days and the trial lasting 5 days. If the implementation of the claimed process reduces the time to fully complete the in-court jury selection process to a mere two hours and the trial lasts 5 days, the entire jury trial would be completed in 5 days and two hours. The potential jurors who become excluded in the in-court jury selection process would be able to return to their families, jobs, and personal life a mere two hours after the in-court jury selection process began and 1 business day and 6 hours sooner than they would have been able to return without the claimed process. Likewise, the potential jurors who become impaneled as jurors in the in-court jury selection process would be able to return to their families, jobs, and personal life 1 business day and 6 hours sooner than they would have been able to return without the claimed process.</p><p id="p-1344" num="1343">Furthermore, even though the potential jurors would have to take time to respond to every video recorded question of the attorney through the website of the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process begins, the time the potential jurors spend in responding to the questions in the website of the claimed process is not near as encroaching or burdensome on the potential jurors as the conventional in-court jury selection process. When the potential jurors respond to the questions in the website of the claimed process, they can completely avoid taking time away from their families, jobs, and events or activities in their personal lives. Thus, when the potential jurors respond to the questions in the website of the claimed process, they can respond to the questions at any time day or night. Additionally, when the potential jurors respond to the questions in the website of the claimed process, they do not have to respond to every question in one sitting. They can log into the website as many times as they desire before they finish responding to the questions. As a result of the tremendous flexibility of the claimed process, the potential jurors can choose not to respond to any questions in the website of the claimed process while they are working at their jobs. If the potential jurors have children, they can choose not to answer any questions through the website of the claimed process until after they put their children to bed or after they have attended their children's activities. Ultimately, the potential jurors can respond to questions in the website of the claimed process whenever the time is right for them.</p><p id="p-1345" num="1344">2. The implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially reduce the amount of lost income that some potential jurors incur by participating in the in-court jury selection process. As stated previously, 27% of full-time private industry workers and 68% of part-time private industry workers summoned for jury duty in the United States will not receive compensation from their employers for their time spent in jury duty. Since the conventional jury selection process is time consuming and can take anywhere from 1 day to several months to complete depending on the case, it can impose a tremendous financial burden on employed potential jurors who do not receive compensation for jury duty from their employers. As stated previously, the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially reduce the time to complete the conventional in-court jury selection process. As a result of the claimed process substantially reducing the time to complete the in-court jury selection process, the potential jurors who become excluded in the in-court jury selection process and the potential jurors who become impaneled as jurors in the in-court jury selection process will be able to return to their jobs much quicker. If employed potential jurors who do not receive compensation from their employers for jury duty return to work much quicker, they will lose much less income. Additionally, as stated previously, the potential jurors being required to respond to questions in the website of the claimed process will not interfere with their jobs as they can respond to such questions at any time day or night which gives them the option to completely avoid taking time away from their jobs and avoid losing income.</p><p id="p-1346" num="1345">3. The claimed process prevents the potential jurors from being scrutinized and embarrassed when they respond to the non-live, non-real time video recorded questions in the website of the claimed process. Additionally, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will prevent the potential jurors from being scrutinized and embarrassed in the in-court jury selection process. As previously stated, in the conventional in-court jury selection process, judges and/or attorneys can sometimes intensely question certain potential jurors if they are not satisfied with the potential jurors' answers to their questions. For example, if a potential juror responds to an attorney's question in the in-court jury selection process and the attorney is not satisfied with the response, the attorney will typically ask the potential juror certain follow up questions to clarify and understand the potential juror's response, or the attorney will ask the potential juror certain follow up questions to manipulate or change the potential juror's response to make it satisfactory with the attorney. For example, the potential juror will respond to an attorney's question, and the attorney will say the following: &#x201c;I'm sorry, I guess I am not following what you are trying to say. Can you give me an example?&#x201d; Such follow up questions by the attorney can make the potential juror feel embarrassed in front of the other potential jurors. Thus, the potential jurors who become subjected to such scrutiny can become embarrassed and self-conscience when they answer such follow up questions in front of the judge other potential jurors.</p><p id="p-1347" num="1346">When the claimed process is implemented before the in-court jury selection process begins, the potential jurors can respond from their own home or anywhere they choose. As a result, when the potential jurors respond to the attorney's non-live, non-real time video recorded questions through the website of the claimed process they are not in the presence of the judge, attorneys, or other potential jurors which protects them from being embarrassed or self-conscience when they respond. Furthermore, when the potential jurors respond to the attorney's video recorded questions, such video recorded questions that are presented to the potential jurors are non-live and non-real time; therefore, the attorney cannot scrutinize the potential jurors by asking them follow up questions to clarify and/or manipulate a potential juror's response.</p><p id="p-1348" num="1347">Additionally, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will prevent the potential jurors from being scrutinized and embarrassed in the in-court jury selection process. As previously stated, the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process takes place will be that lawyers will ask their most difficult and challenging questions through the website of the claimed process and will thoroughly question each potential juror through the website of the claimed process without scrutinizing the potential jurors. Also, before the in-court jury selection process takes place, the attorney will have already thoroughly reviewed each potential juror's response to each question asked by the attorney. As a result, the lawyers inevitably will predetermine their juror selections before the in-court jury selection process begins. As a result of the attorneys predetermining their juror selections before the in-court jury selection process begins, the attorneys likely will merely use the in-court jury selection process to present themselves and their clients in a positive light and be friendly to the potential jurors and will not thoroughly question or scrutinize any of the potential jurors. As a result, the potential jurors will not be scrutinized and/or embarrassed in front of the other potential jurors in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1349" num="1348">4. In criminal cases, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially safeguard and protect a potential juror's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. As stated previously, a problem the in-court jury selection process presents to potential jurors summoned for jury duty is attorneys excluding potential jurors based on their race and/or gender. As stated previously, the limited time constraints of the conventional in-court jury selection process often forces lawyers to exclude potential jurors with a peremptory challenge based on their race and/or gender. Race-based peremptory challenges are prohibited by the United States Constitution. See <i>Strauder v. West Virginia, </i>100 U.S. 303, 308-09 (1879). Gender-based peremptory challenges also are prohibited in the United States. See <i>J.E.B. v. State ex rel T.B., </i>114 S.Ct. 1419 (1994). The potential juror who is removed based on race suffers humiliation that may cause the excluded juror to lose confidence in the jury system. See Robert T Prior (1993) &#x201c;<i>The Peremptory Challenge: A Lost Cause</i>?,&#x201d; 44 Mercer Law Review, 587. One major function of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to prohibit the government from denying rights or benefits based on classifications such as race. See Cynthia Richers-Rowland (1987) &#x201c;<i>Batson v. Kentucky: The New and Improved Peremptory Challenge, </i>38 Hastings Law Journal, 1195, 1201. Therefore, the exclusion of jurors based on race is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. See Id. Even though the juror does not have a right to be on a jury, the juror does have the right not to be excluded from being on a jury due to race discrimination. See <i>Powers v. Ohio, </i>499 U.S. 400, 407 (1991). &#x201c;Indeed, with the exception of voting, for most citizens, the honor and privilege of jury duty is their most significant opportunity to participate in the democratic process and is considered a benefit.&#x201d; Id.</p><p id="p-1350" num="1349">The explanation of how the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially protect a potential juror's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution is provided herein. Thus, the explanation of how the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will increase the average number of minority jurors on juries and make defense attorneys and defendants more confident in a jury's verdict is the same explanation of how such implementation will substantially safeguard and protect a potential juror's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</p><p id="p-1351" num="1350">Therefore, the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially safeguard and protect a potential juror's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution in the exact same three substantial ways: 1) It will equip defense attorneys with very strong evidence to help them make substantially stronger <i>Batson </i>challenges to the Court to prevent prosecutors from excluding some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant; 2) It will provide prosecutors with substantial clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial which will deter prosecutors from attempting to exclude such potential jurors; and 3) It will provide prosecutors with clear evidence and clear non-discriminatory reasons that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant cannot be impartial which will make an impression on such potential jurors that their exclusion was justified based on clear non-discriminatory reasons which will spare them the humiliation of being excluded based on their race and will prevent them from losing confidence in the jury system.</p><p id="p-1352" num="1351">First, since the claimed process equips defense attorneys with very strong evidence to help them make substantially stronger <i>Batson </i>challenges to the Court to prevent prosecutors from excluding some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant as explained previously, the Court would be substantially more likely to sustain the defense attorney's <i>Batson </i>challenge and prevent the prosecutor from exercising a peremptory challenge on the potential juror which will prevent potential jurors from being discriminated against which results in safeguarding the potential juror's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Second, since the claimed process provides prosecutors with substantial clear evidence that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant can be impartial as explained previously, prosecutors will be less likely to attempt to exclude such potential jurors which results in safeguarding the potential juror's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Third and finally, since the claimed process inevitably will provide prosecutors with clear evidence and clear non-discriminatory reasons that some of the potential jurors that share the same minority race and/or gender as the defendant cannot be impartial as explained previously, such clear evidence and clear non-discriminatory reasons will make an impression on such potential jurors that their exclusion justified based on clear non-discriminatory reasons which will spare them the humiliation of being excluded based on their race and will prevent them from losing confidence in the jury system. Since such exclusion of such potential jurors would be justified, such potential jurors would not be excluded based on their race and/or gender which results in safeguarding the potential juror's equal protection rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</p><p id="p-1353" num="1352">The claimed process reduces problems presented to employers of potential jurors caused by the conventional in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1354" num="1353">The claimed process substantially reduces problems presented to employers of potential jurors caused by the conventional in-court jury selection process as follows:</p><p id="p-1355" num="1354">1. The implementation of the claimed process will substantially reduce the amount of money employers have to pay employees who do not yield any labor while participating in the conventional in-court jury selection process. As stated previously, since the conventional jury selection process is time consuming and can take anywhere from 1 day to several months to complete depending on the case, the conventional in-court jury selection process can cause employers to pay a substantial amount of money to their employees for the time they spend in it as potential jurors which causes employers to not receive any labor for the money they spend.</p><p id="p-1356" num="1355">The practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially reduce the time to complete the conventional in-court jury selection process. The explanations of how the implementation of the claimed process before the conventional in-court jury selection process begins will substantially reduce the time to complete the conventional in-court jury selection process are provided herein.</p><p id="p-1357" num="1356">Because the claimed process substantially reduces the time to complete the in-court jury selection process, the potential jurors who become excluded in the in-court jury selection process and the potential jurors who become impaneled as jurors in the in-court jury selection process will be able to return to their jobs much quicker resulting in less money being spent by employers for no labor. For example, if the conventional in-court jury selection process takes 3 months to complete for a murder case involving the death penalty and an employee participating in it as a potential juror is stricken with a peremptory challenge on the last day of the 3 month duration, the respective employer would have to pay such employee for 3 months of wages. If such employee had a contractual salary of $50,000, the employer would have to pay the employee $12,500.00, and the employer would not have received any labor from the employee for the $12,500.00 paid. However, if the claimed process had been implemented in the same case and reduced the time to fully complete the in-court jury selection process to a mere two days, the employer would only have to pay approximately $192 to the employee who did not yield labor.</p><p id="p-1358" num="1357">2. The implementation of the claimed process will substantially reduce the amount of lost labor employers incur when employees participate in the in-court jury selection process as potential jurors. As stated previously, the conventional in-court jury selection process causes employers to lose labor from their employees who participate in it as potential jurors. Obviously, when employees participate in the conventional in-court jury selection process, they are not at their places of employment providing labor for their employers. Since the conventional jury selection process is time consuming and can take anywhere from 1 day to several months to complete depending on the case, loss of labor from certain employees who participate in the conventional in-court jury selection process can be quite problematic and detrimental for some employers.</p><p id="p-1359" num="1358">As stated previously, the practical effect of implementing the claimed process before the in-court jury selection process begins will substantially reduce the time to complete the in-court jury selection process. Because the claimed process substantially reduces the time to complete the in-court jury selection process, the potential jurors who become excluded in the in-court jury selection process and the potential jurors who become impaneled as jurors in the in-court jury selection process will be able to return to their jobs much quicker resulting in more labor being provided to their employers. For example, a conventional in-court jury selection process for a case involving murder and the death penalty begins on September 15 and ends on December 15, and ultimately takes 3 months to complete. An employee participating in it as a potential juror is stricken with a peremptory challenge on the last day of the 3 month duration, the respective employer would have not incurred any labor from the employee for 3 consecutive months. If the employee was a professor at a university and if the fall semester at the university began on August 22, the professor would not be able to finish teaching any of his/her classes. The employer, which would be the university, would have to cancel the classes. However, if the claimed process had been implemented in the same case and reduced the time to fully complete the in-court jury selection process to a mere two days, the employee would only have missed two days of teaching classes, and the university would not have had to cancel the employee's classes. Additionally, as stated previously, the potential jurors being required to respond to questions in the website of the claimed process will not interfere with their jobs as they can respond to such questions at any time day or night which gives them the option to completely avoid taking time away from their jobs resulting in more labor being provided to their employers.</p><p id="p-1360" num="1359">The claimed process's function of automatically transcribing the video and audio recordings of the attorney and juror candidates provides an additional advantage to a court reporter, attorney, and consultant.</p><p id="p-1361" num="1360">The claimed process's function of automatically transcribing the video and audio recordings of the attorney and juror candidates provides an additional advantage to a court reporter, attorney, and consultant. A significant function of the claimed process is that it automatically transcribes each juror candidate's oral response to every question into a typed format and places it under its respective typed formatted question on the questionnaire. Such a function prevents an attorney and a consultant from having to constantly replay a juror candidate's video recording to remember what the juror candidate said. Additionally, every state government and the federal government have procedural rules that require every spoken and/or recorded speech that is a part of a court hearing to be transcribed into a tangible typed form which preserves a party's ability to appeal any issues that may arise during the claimed process which can result in safeguarding a defendant's constitutional due process right to a fair trial by an impartial jury in a criminal case. Thus, the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution guarantee the accused the right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. The due process clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to the federal government, and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state governments. Therefore, such transcription is not only a luxury for an attorney and a consultant, but it also is required by law.</p><p id="p-1362" num="1361">As stated previously, if the claimed process is implemented before the in-court jury selection process, the attorney and consultant only will have a limited time period to review each juror candidate's video recording and transcribed responses. If a human court reporter had to transcribe each potential juror's video recording and if there are 35 juror candidate video recordings to transcribe, transcribing each video recording would take a tremendous amount of time to complete which would hinder the attorney and consultant in their ability to distinguish the juror candidates with their limited time before the in-court jury selection process begins. The claimed process with its code sequence would be able to transcribe each juror candidate's response at a much faster rate. Therefore, the claimed process's function of automatically transcribing the video recordings of the juror candidates would provide the attorney and consultant with the luxury of transcribed typed formatted responses to each question on each juror candidate's questionnaire much quicker which allows them to complete their task of distinguishing juror candidates much quicker.</p><p id="p-1363" num="1362">In summary, the invention has many features and advantages. It can be used to merely question jurors before the in-court jury selection process begins. Basically, the Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, and Judge type their jury selection questions through the website and video record themselves reading their typed questions in front of a webcam in their own respective programs as detailed above, and the jurors respond to each video recorded question through the website in front of a webcam. The Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, Defendant, and Judge then view each potential juror's video recorded responses through the website before the in-court jury selection process begins.</p><p id="p-1364" num="1363">Using the invention to merely question jurors before the in-court jury selection process begins provides many unprecedented advantages for lawyers, jurors, the court, and criminal defendants. It provides lawyers with an opportunity to make more confident juror selections and thus have more confidence in a jury's verdict for the following reasons: 1) It provides lawyers with an opportunity to ask jurors better questions; 2) It provides significantly more quality information on each juror than can be provided in traditional in-court jury selection; 3) It provides more accurate information on each juror than can be provided in traditional in-court jury selection; 4) It provides lawyers with more time to make juror selections; 5) It provides lawyers with an opportunity to obtain a professional analysis of each juror from a professional jury consultant before making juror selections; 6) It provides lawyers with more of an opportunity to see how jurors will react to their presence and the presence of their clients; and 7) It provides lawyers with all of the advantages of traditional jury selection.</p><p id="p-1365" num="1364">The invention provides lawyers with an opportunity to ask jurors better questions as it allows lawyers to easily obtain recommended jury selection questions from a professional jury consultant. Thus, with the invention's internet capabilities, lawyers can obtain the services from any participating professional jury consultant in the world. The lawyer can confidentially inform their selected consultant of all necessary details about the parties and the facts of the case through the internet website, and the selected consultant can send the lawyer professionally recommended jury selection questions through the internet website. Thus, the lawyer can review, edit, and submit professionally recommended jury selection questions to the jury selection questionnaire that is to be answered by the jurors through a webcam.</p><p id="p-1366" num="1365">The invention provides significantly more quality information on each juror than can be provided in typical in-court jury selection. In traditional jury selection, lawyers typically do not have the time to ask each juror every question due to limited time. With the invention website, jurors can respond to jury selection questions through a website, outside of court, on any computer equipped with a webcam, at any time day or night at their own convenience. As a result, the lawyers and the judge can ask as many questions as they desire resulting in substantially more responses from each juror. Also, since the jurors respond to the jury selection questionnaire in front of a webcam which produces a digital video file of them responding, the lawyers, through the website, easily can view the juror's non-verbal responses when they respond to the questions to detect the genuineness of their responses. Thus, the lawyers can get a better feel for how each juror thinks and reasons, and how jurors will respond to certain evidence. With unlimited questioning of the jurors, the lawyers will be able to better assess what each juror values and will be able to better detect any bias or preconceived notions of the jurors.</p><p id="p-1367" num="1366">Additionally, the invention also provides more accurate information on each juror. In traditional in-court jury selection, each juror is questioned in the presence of every other juror. While being questioned in the presence of all other jurors, jurors may have the tendency to conform their responses to other jurors' responses or to adopt the views of other jurors. With the invention's website, each juror is questioned individually and out of the presence of the other jurors before the jurors appear in court for jury selection which prevents the jurors from conforming their responses providing more accurate information. Also, as stated above, since the jurors respond to the jury selection questionnaire in front of a webcam which produces a digital video file of them responding, the lawyers, through the website, easily can view the juror's non-verbal responses when they respond to the questions to detect the genuineness of their responses.</p><p id="p-1368" num="1367">The invention provides lawyers with more time to make juror selections. Traditional jury selection with its limited time constraints also forces lawyers to rush making their juror selections. Because the invention provides lawyers with more significant high quality and accurate information on each juror before the in-court jury selection process takes place, the lawyers can take their time and predetermine their juror selections.</p><p id="p-1369" num="1368">The invention provides lawyers with an opportunity to obtain a professional analysis of each juror from a professional jury consultant before making juror selections in court. As stated above, with the invention's internet capabilities, lawyers can obtain the services from any participating professional jury consultant in the world. The lawyers can send the digital video files and the respective transcribed responses of each juror to their selected professional jury consultants through the invention's website, and the selected consultants can send their respective lawyers a professional analysis of each juror through the invention's website. Thus, the lawyer can review the professional analysis of each juror and base their in-court juror selections on each analysis.</p><p id="p-1370" num="1369">The invention provides lawyers with more of an opportunity to see how jurors will react to their presence and the presence of their clients. In traditional jury selection, lawyers cannot see how every juror reacts to their presence and their client's presence. With the invention playing the video recordings of the Judge, Plaintiff Attorney, Defense Attorney, Plaintiff, and Defendant separately and individually on the website to the Jurors when the Jurors respond to the questionnaires in front of a webcam, the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the Plaintiff Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant, and the Defense Attorney's Professional Jury Consultant can see how each juror responds to the individual video profiles of the Judge, the Plaintiff Attorney, the Defense Attorney, the Plaintiff, and the Defendant, and they can look for nonverbal clues in each juror's video recorded response.</p><p id="p-1371" num="1370">The invention provides lawyers with all of the advantages of traditional jury selection. Thus, the Judge has the option of allowing the lawyers to object to their counterpart's jury selection questions through the website, and the judge can rule on such objections through the website before the jurors respond to the jury selection questionnaire. Additionally, since the invention takes place before the in-court jury selection process takes place, the lawyers, in the in-court jury selection portion, will still have the opportunity to question jurors personally in court and see how the jurors react to them and their clients. Also, since the invention thoroughly questions jurors before the in-court jury selection process takes place, the lawyers can predetermine exactly what if any follow up questions they will ask jurors in the in-court jury selection process.</p><p id="p-1372" num="1371">Furthermore, a video from the judge will be played to the jurors before the jurors respond to the questionnaire in front of a webcam that will impress upon the jurors an in-court presence and tone and will communicate the seriousness of the online questioning to ensure the juror's participate sincerely. Also, since the jurors are required to take a picture of their driver's licenses or their photo identification cards with a webcam, and since such picture is paired with their digital video responses, the invention prevents fraud and ensures the authenticity of the jurors responding to the questionnaire. Additionally, with the judge, attorneys, plaintiff, defendant, and professional jury consultants taking authenticating photos of themselves before submitting anything through the invention's website further prevents fraud and ensures the authenticity of all submissions through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-1373" num="1372">The invention also has unprecedented advantages for the jurors and the court for the following reasons: 1) It may prevent jurors from being excluded from the jury panel based on unconstitutional race and/or gender discrimination; 2) It is more convenient for jurors; and 3) It enhances judicial economy.</p><p id="p-1374" num="1373">The invention's website may also substantially reduce the risk of jurors being excluded from the venire due to race and/or gender discrimination. Due to the limited time constraints and lack of information obtained from the jurors in traditional in-court jury selection, lawyers sometimes base their juror selections on unreliable stereotypes such as race or gender, which is unconstitutional and unfair to the jurors. Because the invention provides lawyers with significantly more quality and accurate information on each juror, the lawyers will get a better feel for how the jurors think and reason and how they will respond to certain issues and evidence, and they will no longer need to rely on stereotypes such as race and/or gender and likely will not base their peremptory challenges on the race and/or gender of the jurors.</p><p id="p-1375" num="1374">The invention is more convenient for jurors. In traditional in-court jury selection, jurors typically have to sit through long jury selection examinations which keep them away from their jobs and their families. By using invention's website, most of the jury selection questions are asked on the jury selection questionnaire which jurors can answer at any time 24 hours a day and at their own conveniences. For example, the jurors can work a full day, have dinner with their families, and then answer jury selection questions through the invention's website in the comfort of their own homes. Also, jurors are not required to answer all of the questions in one sitting. If they desire, they could answer a few questions each day or every other day as long as they answer all of the questions through the invention's website before the deadline expires.</p><p id="p-1376" num="1375">Additionally, the invention substantially reduces the time it takes to complete the in-court jury selection process which saves the court and the jurors' time and money. Because the invention provides significant quality and accurate information on each juror before the in-court jury selection process begins, the lawyers can study the information before the in-court jury selection takes place and predetermine which jurors they desire to exclude. Therefore, the lawyers will not need to question the jurors nearly as much thereby drastically reducing the time it takes to complete the in-court jury selection process. This reduction in time will enhance judicial economy and will allow excluded jurors to get back to their personal lives much quicker. Also, due to this reduction of time to conduct the jury selection process, a court may not have to pay a juror as much for his/her participation in the jury selection process. Additionally, if the judge elected to allow attorneys to exercise challenges for cause and peremptory challenges through the invention's website and basically allow the entire jury selection process to be conducted through the invention's website, judicial economy would be further enhanced as the in-court jury selection process would be eliminated, and potential jurors who did not make the jury panel or alternate juror positions would not have to take time off from work and appear in-court for jury duty.</p><p id="p-1377" num="1376">The invention also has unprecedented advantages for criminal defendants for the following reasons: 1) It substantially enhances a criminal defendant's ability to participate in the jury selection process; and 2) It provides criminal defendants with more confidence in a jury's verdict.</p><p id="p-1378" num="1377">The invention substantially enhances a criminal defendant's ability to participate in the jury selection process. In the invention, a criminal defendant has his/her own program in the invention's website. In the criminal defendant's program, the criminal defendant may submit jury selection questions to his/her respective lawyer through the invention's website to be considered as recommended questions. The lawyer is advised not to submit his/her jury selection questions through the invention's website until the criminal defendant submits such recommended questions to him/her. The lawyer then may edit and place any of the defendant's questions on the questionnaire through the invention's website. Additionally, in the criminal defendant's program, the criminal defendant may view each juror's digital video responses and transcribed questionnaire and submit an analysis of each juror to his/her respective lawyer through the website to be considered as recommendations for either striking or keeping a juror. The defendant's lawyer may then use his/her client's analysis to keep or strike a juror. Additionally, the criminal defendant may view every action his/her lawyer and his/her opposing lawyer submits through the website at any time 24 hours a day. Furthermore, the invention immediately notifies a criminal defendant with a text message to his/her cellular phone and an email message to his/her personal email account each time he/she may participate through the invention's website and every time a lawyer and/or the judge submits an action through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-1379" num="1378">The invention provides criminal defendants with more confidence in a jury's verdict. As stated above, the invention may prevent jurors from being excluded from the jury panel based on unconstitutional race and/or gender discrimination. As a result, a criminal defendant of a racial minority, for example, may feel more confident in a jury's verdict if members of his/her same race are on the jury panel. Additionally, since the invention ultimately provides attorneys an opportunity to make more confident juror selections as stated above, criminal defendants further will have more confidence in a jury's verdict.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-1380" num="1379"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>J</figref> is a flowchart detailing the initial basic steps of the unique method and computer program for questioning jurors through the invention's website, according to the principles of the invention.</p><p id="p-1381" num="1380"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>N</figref> is a flowchart encompassing all of the first 11 steps in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and steps 14 through 22 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and also showing optional subsequent steps of the unique method and computer program that allow attorneys to object to their counterpart's jury selection questions and allow the Judge to rule on such objections all through the invention's website.</p><p id="p-1382" num="1381"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>BB</figref> is a flow chart encompassing steps 1 through 24 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and also showing optional subsequent steps of the unique method and computer program that allow attorneys to submit challenges for cause and peremptory challenges and allow attorneys to object to their counterpart's challenges for cause and peremptory challenges and allow the Judge to rule on such objections all through the invention's website.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-1383" num="1382"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart detailing the initial basic steps of the unique method and computer program for questioning jurors through a website, according to the principles of the invention as detailed above.
