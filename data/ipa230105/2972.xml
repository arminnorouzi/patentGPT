A preferred substrate is cigarette tipping paper.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most cigarettes currently produced include a column of tobacco, wrapped in a cigarette wrapping paper, attached at one end to a filter. The column of tobacco is joined to the filter by specially made paper called tipping paper. Although there are some exceptions, conventional filters are generally formed from either compressed strips of paper or from cellulose acetate tow, a biobased cellulosic fiber. Some filters also include activated carbon.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Filters are attached to cigarettes to filter out particulate matter and other components that may be contained within the cigarette smoke. Filters are also used to blend air with the cigarette smoke when the cigarette is being puffed. The filters are made so that the ratio of air to cigarette smoke is maintained within carefully controlled limits to insure that the cigarette has a constant taste as it is smoked from start to finish. In order to accomplish this goal, the tipping paper surrounding the filter is typically perforated at an end adjacent to the tobacco column.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cigarette filters are either wrapped filters or non-wrapped filters. Wrapped filters are made by wrapping a filter material with a paper known as plug wrap. The plug wrap is machine-rolled with a quantity of heated hot melt adhesive. While the adhesive is still hot, the filter material is anchored to the plug wrap. The plug wrap, which can be machine-perforated or highly porous, must have sufficient stiffness to hold the filter material in a column. As described above, wrapped and non-wrapped filters are attached to a cigarette rod by the tipping paper. The tipping paper is adhered to both the cigarette paper and the filter by an aqueous adhesive. Different methods of making filters and of attaching the filters to cigarettes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,411,279, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The tipping paper used to connect the filter to the tobacco column is a precisely designed high opacity paper product that must meet many requirements and specifications. For example, tipping paper must not discolor when the cigarette is smoked, must not dissolve or degrade when placed in the mouth, must cover discolorations in the filter when the cigarette is smoked, and must hide the union between the tobacco column and the filter. Tipping paper must be capable of being printed upon and should improve the overall appearance of the cigarette.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Tipping Paper is classified by weight. The typical range is 32-40 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The paper used for the present application is 36 g/m<sup>2</sup>. While tipping paper is lightweight, it must also have enough strength so that the paper does not break during high speed paper making, printing and cigarette making machines.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Tipping paper should also be capable of being coated with an adhesive without losing its aesthetic appearance and without compromising any of the above described characteristics. The tipping paper is designed so that the adhesive, once coated on the paper, does not bleed through the paper, which can interfere with the ingress of dilution air and lead to the build-up of adhesive material on machine parts contacted during assembly of the cigarette. Further, the tipping paper must be receptive to the adhesive so that the paper will sufficiently bond to both the filter and the tobacco column.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Currently, most high opacity tipping paper is made using titanium dioxide as a component pigment. Titanium dioxide is a white pigment, but it is often used as an opacifying agent in inks that also contain non-white colorants. For example, the familiar brown ink that is printed onto tipping paper used with cigarette filters to resemble the look of cork is typically provided by an ink colored by a combination of yellow, red, black pigments, and possibly other colorants, along with titanium dioxide to provide opacity. The titanium dioxide is typically added to the paper in amounts from about 30 percent to about 50 percent by weight. Adding titanium dioxide to tipping paper has proven to be an effective method for creating papers with high opacities and with a sufficient amount of strength. Tipping paper containing titanium dioxide is also well suited for use with the adhesives that bond the paper to the filter.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified titanium dioxide as &#x201c;possibly carcinogenic to humans,&#x201d; based on studies that showed increased lung tumors in rats associated with titanium dioxide inhalation. Due to the reclassification of TiO<sub>2</sub>, cigarette manufacturers would like to remove TiO<sub>2 </sub>from all inks that will come in contact with the consumer mouth. Preferably, the replacement inks will match the existing color standards for tipping paper.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Wheeler, et al., EP 2386609 discloses aqueous pigmented coating compositions with a high pigment volume, which compositions comprise as opacifying pigments TiO<sub>2 </sub>and optionally hollow polymeric particles.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Loria, U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,465, discloses an aqueous, non-pigmented, opaque ink composition suitable for use in ink jet printing, comprising a resin component, hollow microspheres, a suitable water-based carrier vehicle and optionally dyes. Solvent can be present in the carrier at 1 to 20%. The hollow microspheres contain a central void region and have an inside diameter from about 0.1 to about 0.5 micron and an outside diameter from about 0.4 to about 1 micron. The central void region is filled with a liquid capable of diffusing through the walls of said microspheres. The hollow microspheres act to effectively scatter light which is incident thereupon, producing the opaque image.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Mead, WO 97/03137, discloses water-based jet ink compositions useful for printing on glass, metal, plastic, and rubber surfaces, comprising an aqueous carrier, a polyamine, a colorant, and an acidic resin. The colorant includes a dye, a pigment, or a hollow polymeric microsphere. The hollow polymeric microsphere provides opacity to the ink. The hollow microspheres can be formed from a variety of polymers including cellulose derivatives, acrylic resins, polyolefins, polyamides, polycarbonates, polystyrene, copolymers of styrene and other vinyl monomers, vinyl polymers such as homo- or copolymers such as 2-ethyhexylacrylate, methyl methacrylate and copolymers of styrene with other vinyl monomers such as acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, and the like.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,465 and WO 97/03137 each employed hollow microspheres made of an acrylic/styrene copolymer that were commercially available as aqueous emulsions, e.g., Ropaque&#xae; OP-62, an aqueous emulsion containing 37.5% by weight of hollow microspheres of an acrylic/styrene copolymer available from the Rohm and Haas Company</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The above references all provide an aqueous ink prepared from aqueous microsphere emulsions. In some applications, aqueous inks, including those prepared from aqueous microsphere emulsions, are not desirable. For example, in cigarette tipping paper, aqueous inks can interact unfavorably with the aqueous adhesives used.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Osorio Murillo, US 2021/0079237, discloses white, solvent-based, high opacity inks and coatings comprising one or more binders, TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment, polymeric void hollowsphere particles, and one or more organic solvents. The polymeric hollowsphere particles preferably consist of polymeric resins comprising styrene-acrylate copolymers, and have an external diameter ranging from about 0.2 micron to about 0.5 micron. The hollow particles scatter more light than solid particles and the inks comprising them achieve a high level of opacity even when low levels of white pigments, such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, are used. The use of colorants in the ink compositions was also disclosed. Dry, powdered microspheres, e.g., SunSpheres&#xae; Powder from Dow, developed for use in personal care products, such as sunscreen lotion, were used in preparation of these solvent-based inks, avoiding complications from unwanted water.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A need exists for a replacement to titanium dioxide in tipping paper. Preferably, the color standards for these new inks will not deviate from current delta E targets. At present, there is no solution that will provide for tipping paper that is not printed with a titanium dioxide containing ink, and that is lightweight, strong, and that meets all of the other requirements of a tipping paper, particularly opacity. Replacing the titanium dioxide containing inks used in the preparation of tipping paper, with a non-aqueous, opaque, titanium-free ink that can be readily formulated to meet existing color standards is a need currently unmet by the existing art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It has been found that certain hollow polymeric microspheres can be substituted for TiO<sub>2 </sub>in a non-water-based ink system without diminishing opacity or negatively impacting the color. It also has been found that while the quantity of hollow polymeric microspheres in the ink may be slightly different than the amount of TiO<sub>2 </sub>originally used, this is readily compensated for by a small difference in the amount of solvent. However, good results in opacity and color matching to the original ink can be obtained without making any other changes to the formulation, e.g., the same pigment combination from the TiO<sub>2 </sub>ink provides acceptable color when used with the hollow polymeric microspheres.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a particular aspect, the present invention provides a method of printing on cigarette tipping paper, the method comprising printing onto the cigarette tipping paper an ink or coating composition comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">a) 3-35 wt % hollow polymeric microspheres, based on the total weight of the composition, wherein the microspheres have an outside diameter of 0.2 to 1.5 microns, said microspheres comprising one or more polymers surrounding a void, wherein one or more of the polymers comprise acrylate monomer units, styrene monomer units, or both acrylate and styrene monomer units;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0021">b) 2-30 wt % one or more resins, based on the total weight of the composition; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0022">c) one or more solvents;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0023">d) wherein the ink or coating composition contains no titanium dioxide and less than 2 wt % water, based on the total weight of the composition.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">The ink or coating used in the present invention provides high opacity when applied to a substrate. In many embodiments, the ink also comprises one or more dyes and/or pigments.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">The present titanium dioxide free ink is solvent-borne and is essentially free from water, i.e., any water present is the result of minor contamination by adventitious water.

For example, hollow microspheres made of polymers comprising one or more one or more acrylic monomer and/or styrenic monomer repeating units are useful in the invention, e.g., excellent results have been obtained using hollow microspheres made of co-polymers comprising one or more acrylic monomer and one or more styrene monomer repeating units.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0067">To prevent water from entering the composition, the use of hollow microspheres prepared or sold as aqueous dispersions is discouraged. Commercial hollow polymeric microspheres are commercially available as powders, e.g., SunSpheres&#xae; Powder from Dow, and have been used successfully in formulating inks for the present invention.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0068">Of particular significance with respect to the hollow microspheres of the present invention is that said microspheres in fact are hollow. Thus, microspheres which do not contain a void or microvoid are not suitable. This is particularly true given that one of the mechanisms by which the present inks are believed to provide high opacity, is that the hollow microspheres scatter more light than solid particles. It is further postulated that the hollow microspheres disperse more readily throughout the coating and remain more evenly dispersed in the dried coating after evaporation of the solvent.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0069">There are some constraints on the size of the microsphere. The microsphere must be able to stay in a reasonably dispersed state in the ink during printing or application of a coating. It also must not be so large as to interfere with the mechanics of the printer being used, but it should still be large enough to effectively scatter light. The hollow microspheres of the invention have an outside diameter of 0.2 to 1.5 microns and typically an inside diameter, i.e., the diameter of the hollow space inside the microsphere, of 0.1 to 1.2 microns.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0070">In various embodiments, the polymeric hollow microsphere of the invention has:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0071">an outside diameter of 0.2 to 1.5 microns, 0.4 to 1 micron. 0.3 to 0.7 microns, 0.2 to 0.5 microns, or 0.5 to 0.7 microns; and</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0072">an inner diameter of 0.1 to 1.2 microns, 0.1 to 0.5 micron, 0.2 to 0.6 micron, 0.2 to about 0.4 micron.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0056" num="0073">For example, in various embodiments the hollow polymeric microsphere of the invention has: an outside diameter of 0.2 to 1.5 microns and an inside diameter of 0.1 to 1.2 microns, an outside diameter of 0.4 to 1.0 micron and an inside diameter of 0.1 to 0.5 microns, an outside diameter of 0.3 to 0.7 microns and an inside diameter of 0.2 to 0.6 microns, or an outside diameter of 0.5 to 0.7 microns and an inside diameter of 0.2 to 0.4 microns.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0074">A variety of resins, e.g., binder resins, are known for use in ink or coating compositions and almost any can be used in the present invention.

The calculations to arrive at DE2000 incorporate several weighting factors, such as compensation for neutral colors, compensation for lightness compensation for chroma and compensation for hue, e.g., dE2000 varies the weighting of L* depending on where in the lightness range the color falls.
