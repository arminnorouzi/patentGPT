id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A packaging structure and methods of manufacturing a packaging structure. The packaging structure, for example, an edge protector, a corner board, etc., may generally include a first ply having a first width, a second ply having a second width, and a third ply having a third width wider than the first width and the second width. The second ply may be wrapped around at least one end of the first ply, and the third ply may be wrapped around the first ply and the second ply. The third ply may overlap at a portion (e.g., an intermediate portion, an apex, etc.) of the packaging structure.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

The plies are each separated by a layer of glue <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>E.

Also, while illustrated as being arranged with the folds on one side of the apex <b>20</b>, in other constructions (not shown), the plies <b>13</b> may be arranged with folds on each opposite side of the apex <b>20</b> (e.g., alternating, grouped, etc.).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The example packaging structures <b>4</b> described above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>29</b>B</figref> may be manufactured in accordance with the method <b>32</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>. In the example method <b>32</b>, the desired configuration (e.g., packaging shape (corner board, U-shaped channel, etc.), caliper thickness, locations of plies, etc.) for the packaging structure <b>4</b> is determined (e.g., via a customer selection) (block <b>34</b>). The supply of available paperboard for various plies <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> is determined (block <b>36</b>).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Based upon at least inputs of the desired configuration and available paperboard supply (on hand, available from suppliers, etc.), the stackup is determined (block <b>40</b>). In at least some aspects, an electronic processor (not shown) may be used in one or more steps of the method (e.g., receiving a customer input, determining available paperboard supply, determining the stackup, etc.).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The processor includes combinations of hardware and software that are operable to, among other things, configure and control manufacturing of the packaging structure <b>4</b>. The processor includes a processing unit (e.g., a microprocessor, a microcontroller, or another suitable programmable device), non-transitory computer-readable media, and an input/output interface. The processing unit, the media, and the input/output interface are connected by one or more control and/or data buses. The computer-readable media stores program instructions and data. The processing unit is configured to retrieve instructions from the media and execute the instructions to perform the control processes and methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The input/output interface transmits data from the processor to external systems, networks, and/or devices and receives data from external systems, networks, and/or devices.

For example, if more paperboard plies <b>8</b> of the first width X are available, the corner board <b>4</b> may be made of a larger number of first plies <b>8</b> than second or third plies <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">At block <b>44</b>, the stackup for the corner board <b>4</b> is then arranged on a packaging manufacturing machine (not shown).

The paperboard plies <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are fed into a gluing section (not shown) of the machine in which glue is applied to the plies (block <b>48</b>). After the glue is applied, the paperboard plies <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are pressed together in a flat paperboard structure (block <b>52</b>).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Wider plies <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> (e.g., wider than or extending beyond an end of plies <b>8</b> that are not wrapped) are wrapped around the unwrapped plies <b>8</b> (block <b>56</b>). The third plies <b>16</b> overlap on a portion of the flat paperboard structure (e.g., proximate a center portion). The paperboard structure is then bent (e.g., folded) at an apex <b>20</b> in a folding portion (not shown) of the machine to form a first leg <b>22</b>A and a second leg <b>22</b>B of the corner board <b>4</b> (block <b>60</b>).

Plies <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may be arranged to provide the desired structural features.
