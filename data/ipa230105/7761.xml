The material is sampled as the sample, and the sample is moved to the detection device for inspection. The material of a sample may be but is not to be selected from a group including quartz, glass, ceramic materials, polymeric materials, metal oxides, oxide semiconductors, metal nitrides, nitride semiconductors, semiconductor materials and glues. It should be understood: considering the detection principles and processes, some kinds of samples should be surface-treated before they are moved to the detection devices to function as samples. Naturally, surface treatment would increase the cost of detection.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The wavelength of the vacuum ultraviolet light mentioned in the present invention ranges from 10 nm to 300 nm, including the ranges of short wavelength ultraviolet light (Ultraviolet-C, UVC) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a side view schematically showing a detection and charge neutralization device for a charged particle beam detection system according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The detection and charge neutralization device <b>2</b> of the present invention comprises a chamber <b>10</b>, an electrical optical system <b>12</b>, and a charge neutralization member <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the chamber <b>10</b> provides a space to function as a vacuum chamber <b>13</b> of the charged particle beam detection system. For example, the space provided by the chamber <b>10</b> is evacuated by a vacuum pump <b>15</b> to function as the vacuum chamber <b>13</b>. The electrical optical system <b>12</b> outputs a charged particle beam <b>21</b>, including a charge generation source, corresponding optical members and imaging members. The electrical optical system <b>12</b> may be fixed onto the chamber <b>10</b> or partly/completely disposed inside the vacuum chamber <b>13</b>. The charge generation source emits a charged particle beam to pass through corresponding optical members and enter the vacuum chamber <b>13</b>. The detection and charge neutralization device <b>2</b> may further includes a carrier member <b>32</b>. A sample <b>34</b> is placed on the carrier member <b>32</b> and moved to an observation position <b>23</b> by the carrier member <b>32</b>. The detection and charge neutralization device <b>2</b> may further comprises an adjustment seat <b>33</b>. The adjustment seat <b>33</b> is connected with the carrier member <b>32</b>, adjusting and changing the position, tilting angle and orientation of the carrier member <b>32</b> via horizontal movement, vertical movement, tilting, and rotation. Thus, the position, tilting angle and orientation of the sample <b>34</b> may be changed by changing the position, tilting angle and orientation of the carrier member <b>32</b>. The charged particle beam <b>21</b> of the electrical optical system <b>12</b> enters the vacuum chamber <b>13</b> and then reaches the observation position <b>23</b>, reacting with the sample <b>34</b> at the observation position <b>23</b> to generate signals carrying the information about the sample <b>34</b>. The electrical optical system <b>12</b> captures the signals and acquires the images or information about the sample. The material of the sample <b>34</b> may be but is not to be selected from a group including quartz, glass, ceramic materials, polymeric materials, metal oxides, oxide semiconductors, metal nitrides, nitride semiconductors, semiconductor materials, glues and combinations one or more thereof. The information about the sample includes the material of the sample, the surface structure of the sample, or the combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> again. The observation position <b>23</b> includes the reaction area where the charged particle beam <b>21</b> reacts with the sample <b>34</b>, wherein the reaction area may be the surface of the sample <b>34</b> or the area under the surface of the sample <b>34</b>. It should be explained: while the charged particle beam <b>21</b> detects the sample <b>34</b>, charges continuously generate and accumulate on the surface of the sample <b>34</b>. During the detection process, the charges accumulating on the surface of the sample <b>34</b> will influence the imaging of the signals. In the conventional technology, a surface treatment, is performed on the detected sample to decrease charge accumulation; for example, a conductive film is electroplated on the surface of the detected sample. However, the present invention is to neutralize charges continuously during the detection process to prevent from charge accumulation. Via the cooperation of the charge neutralization member <b>14</b> and the vacuum chamber <b>13</b>, the present invention projects a focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> to the observation position <b>23</b> to continuously perform neutralization on the observation position <b>23</b>. Alternatively, which minor amount of gas is dissociated into positive ions and negative ions to neutralize the accumulating charges may be adopted in the present invention. Alternatively, the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> is projected onto the surface of the sample <b>34</b> to induce the photoelectric effect and generate charges, whereby to neutralize the accumulating charges. In one embodiment, the charge neutralization member <b>14</b> includes a light output surface <b>42</b> that outputs a vacuum ultraviolet light <b>43</b> and a light focusing member <b>44</b> disposed on the light output surface <b>42</b>. The light focusing member <b>44</b> focuses the vacuum ultraviolet light <b>43</b> emitted by the light output surface <b>42</b>, whereby to increase the luminous flux per unit area on the observation position <b>23</b>. The light output surface <b>42</b> may be sourced from the commercially-available vacuum ultraviolet instruments. The vacuum ultraviolet light emitted by the commercially-available vacuum ultraviolet instruments is normally a collimated light beam or a slightly-scattered light beam. The light focusing member <b>44</b>, such as a convex lens, is disposed on the chamber <b>10</b> or inside the vacuum chamber <b>13</b>, focusing the vacuum ultraviolet light <b>43</b> to output the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> to the observation position <b>23</b> or the perimeter thereof, whereby the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> is focused on the observation position <b>23</b> in a high luminous flux per unit area to generate positive charges for neutralizing the charges accumulating in the nearby of the sample <b>34</b>. For example, the light focusing member <b>44</b> emits the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> onto an area of the surface of the sample <b>34</b>, whose diameter ranges from 0.005 mm to 50 mm, preferably smaller than 10 mm, such as 5 mm, whereby the intensified luminous flux can generate positive charges or negative charges to neutralize the non-signal charges at the observation position <b>23</b>. However, the present invention is not limited by the abovementioned example. Besides, the adjustment seat <b>33</b> may be used to adjust the positon, tilting angle or orientation of the sample <b>34</b>. The adjustment seat <b>33</b> may cooperate with the angle, position and range of the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> to prevent from light blocking caused by the other components of the vacuum chamber <b>13</b> or the structures of the sample <b>34</b>, whereby to enhance the charge-neutralization or charge-reducing effect.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> again. The electrical optical system <b>12</b> is normally exactly above the observation position <b>23</b>. Therefore, the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> output by the charge neutralization member <b>14</b> reaches the observation position <b>23</b> at a tilting angle &#x3b8; (the included angle of the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> and the surface of the carrier member <b>32</b>). The focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> is not parallel to the charged particle beam <b>21</b>. The angle &#x3b8; between the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> and the sample <b>34</b> is smaller than 180 degrees. Furthermore, there is a convergence angle when the focus ultraviolent light <b>41</b> travels from the light focusing member <b>44</b> to the observation position <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Based on the structure described above, the present invention provides a method of using a detection and charge neutralization device to perform detection and charge neutralization process. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In Step S<b>52</b>, move a sample into a vacuum chamber of the detection and charge neutralization device, adjust the sample to an observation position. For a charged particle beam detection system, the observation position is normally exactly under the charge generation source of the charged particle beam detection system. However, the present invention is not limited by the example. In Step S<b>54</b>, project a charged particle beam to the sample on the observation position to make the charged particle beam react with the sample. In Step S<b>56</b>, project a focused vacuum ultraviolet light to the sample on the observation position persistently for a given interval of time to neutralize the non-signal accumulating charges. After the focused vacuum ultraviolet light is turned off or blocked, let the charged particle beam react with the sample to generate signals carrying the information about the sample for imaging. It is an option: in the equipment where the interference in capturing the signals of the information about the sample is less likely to occur, the action of projecting the focused vacuum ultraviolet light and the action of using the charged particle beam to scan the sample may be performed simultaneously. In other words, the action of providing the focused vacuum ultraviolet light is not interrupted but performed persistently to neutralize the non-signal charges.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view schematically showing a detection and charge neutralization device for a charged particle beam detection system according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that the light focusing member <b>44</b> of the charge neutralization member <b>24</b> of the detection and charge neutralization device <b>4</b> is not separated from the light output surface <b>42</b> by a distance but directly attached to the light output surface <b>42</b>. Therefore, in the second embodiment, the collimated vacuum ultraviolet light emitted by the light output surface <b>42</b> directly enters the light focusing member <b>44</b> and then is focused to be the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view schematically showing a detection and charge neutralization device for a charged particle beam detection system according to a third embodiment of the present invention.

The optical module may have a light focusing member <b>44</b> and a reflective member <b>45</b>. In an ultraviolet light source device <b>66</b>, the light output surface <b>42</b> is docked to the light focusing member <b>44</b> of the optical module. The vacuum ultraviolet light output by the light output surface <b>42</b> is focused by the light focusing member <b>44</b> and then reflected by the reflective member <b>45</b> to the observation position <b>23</b>. The detection and charge neutralization device <b>6</b> further includes a sealing member <b>65</b> for securing the ultraviolet light source device <b>66</b> and enabling the docking of the ultraviolet light source device <b>66</b> with the optical module, whereby to guarantee the airtightness of the docking. In comparison with the first embodiment, the charge neutralization member <b>64</b> of the third embodiment additionally has the reflective member <b>45</b> able to change the optical path, whereby is increased the flexibility of installing the charge neutralization member <b>64</b> in the detection and charge neutralization device <b>6</b>.

In the seventh embodiment, the charge neutralization member <b>51</b> of the detection and charge neutralization device <b>5</b> includes a light guide member <b>53</b>, such as a fiber and a light guide. The light guide member <b>53</b> is coupled to the light output surface <b>42</b>.

In the process of detection and charge neutralization, the charge neutralization member <b>63</b> may provide irradiation, which is the same as or different from that provided by the charge neutralization member <b>74</b>, considering the factors of geometrical shapes, surface materials, structures, etc. For example, the charge neutralization member <b>74</b> and the charge neutralization member <b>63</b> respectively provide the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>41</b> and the focused vacuum ultraviolet light <b>46</b>, which separately have different frequency bands or have the same frequency bands; the focused vacuum ultraviolet lights <b>41</b> and <b>46</b> are respectively projected at angles &#x3b8; and &#x3b1;, which are different or identical; the focused vacuum ultraviolet lights <b>41</b> and <b>46</b> are respectively projected to the same or different areas of the observation position; the projection areas of the focused vacuum ultraviolet lights <b>41</b> and <b>46</b> are different or identical; while collaborating with the charged particle beam during detection, the charge neutralization member <b>74</b> and the charge neutralization member <b>63</b> may be continuously or intermittently turned on or turned off/blocked in the same interval of time or in different intervals of time. Therefore, the cooperation of two charge neutralization members is adapted to a single sample having an uneven surface, a heterogeneous junction, or a non-uniform material distribution, overcoming the inefficient charge neutralization caused by light-blocking structure, discontinuous electric conductivity, and uneven charge accumulation speed.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a zoom-in diagram illustrating a focused vacuum ultraviolet light according to the present invention.
