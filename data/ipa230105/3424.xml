For example, in order to achieve high efficiency, it has been proposed to form various films on sliding surfaces of slide members included in the hermetic refrigerant compressor, and to use lubricating oil having a reduced viscosity.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The hermetic refrigerant compressor includes a sealed container in which the lubricating oil is stored. The sealed container also accommodates an electric element and a compression element. The compression element includes, as the slide members, for example, a crankshaft, a piston, and a connecting rod serving as a coupler. A main shaft of the crankshaft and a main bearing, the piston and a bore, a piston pin and the connecting rod, and an eccentric shaft of the crankshaft and the connecting rod, etc., form slide parts with each other.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As one example of the hermetic refrigerant compressor that uses lubricating oil having a reduced viscosity, Patent Literature 1 discloses a reciprocating compressor. In Patent Literature 1, the lubricating oil used in the reciprocating compressor has a kinematic viscosity in the range of 3 mm<sup>2</sup>/S to 10 mm<sup>2</sup>/S at 40&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If the lubricating oil has a low viscosity, an oil film is not easily formed. In this respect, in the reciprocating compressor (hermetic refrigerant compressor) disclosed by Patent Literature 1, the surfaces of the slide members forming the slide parts are subjected to special treatment to facilitate the formation of an oil film.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Specifically, among the slide members, the piston and the connecting rod are each made of a ferrous sintered material and are steam-treated, and then a steam layer is removed from the surface of the piston by cutting, whereas the connecting rod is subjected to nitriding after being steam-treated, so that even in a case where lubricating oil having a low viscosity is used and an oil film formed thereby is thin, wear or seizing of the piston and the connecting rod is prevented.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 2 discloses a hermetic compressor (hermetic refrigerant compressor), in which the dimensions of the main shaft of a crankshaft and the dimensions of a main bearing are defined to reduce vibration. Specifically, in a case where the length of the main shaft of the crankshaft, i.e., the length of the bearing of a pivotally supporting part of the main bearing (bearing length), is L, and the diameter of the crankshaft (shaft diameter) is D, the bearing length/the shaft diameter (&#x201c;a&#x201d; in Patent Literature 2) is less than 2.5 (L/D&#x3c;2.5).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">PTL 1: Japanese Patent No. 5222244</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">PTL 2: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. 2017-014992</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0010">Incidentally, the crankshaft included in a hermetic refrigerant compressor serves as a shaft part of the compression element driven by the electric element, and the shaft part is pivotally supported in a rotatable manner by a bearing part. In order to achieve high efficiency of the hermetic refrigerant compressor, it is conceivable to reduce the sliding area of each of the shaft part and the bearing part (pivotally supporting part). In this case, however, if the sliding area is reduced too much, it adversely causes deterioration in efficiency.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">The above-described reciprocating compressor (hermetic refrigerant compressor) disclosed by Patent Literature 1 uses the low-viscosity lubricating oil, which has a kinematic viscosity in the range of 3 mm<sup>2</sup>/S to 10 mm<sup>2</sup>/S at 40&#xb0; C. However, wear resistance to be improved in Patent Literature 1 is the wear resistance of the piston and the connecting rod. Thus, in Patent Literature 1, regarding components pivotally supported by the bearing part, such as the crankshaft, no consideration is given to how to address issues that arise in the case of using lubricating oil having a low viscosity. Moreover, in Patent Literature 1, no consideration is given to reducing the sliding area of the pivotally supported components, such as the crankshaft, to achieve high efficiency.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">Meanwhile, in the above-described hermetic compressor disclosed by Patent Literature 2, the bearing length/the shaft diameter is set to less than 2.5 (L/D&#x3c;2.5) to reduce vibration. However, Patent Literature 2 describes that in a case where the bearing length/the shaft diameter is less than or equal to 2.0 (L/D&#x2264;2.0), a bearing loss increases. That is, Patent Literature 2 discloses that if L/D&#x2264;2.0, the sliding area is reduced too much, which causes increase in the bearing loss, resulting in deterioration in the efficiency of the hermetic compressor.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0013">The present invention has been made to solve the above-described problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a hermetic refrigerant compressor that uses lubricating oil having a reduced viscosity and that makes it possible to achieve high efficiency and favorable reliability even in the case of reducing the sliding area of the shaft part that is pivotally supported by the bearing part.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0014">In order to solve the above-described problems, a hermetic refrigerant compressor according to the present invention includes a sealed container in which lubricating oil is stored, the sealed container accommodating an electric element and a compression element, the compression element being driven by the electric element and configured to compress a refrigerant. The lubricating oil has a kinematic viscosity in a range of 1 mm<sup>2</sup>/S to 7 mm<sup>2</sup>/S at 40&#xb0; C., has a mass average molecular weight in a range of 150 to 400, and contains 0.5% by mass or more of a high molecular weight component. The high molecular weight component has a mass molecular weight of greater than or equal to 500. The compression element includes: a shaft part that is a crankshaft including a main shaft and an eccentric shaft; and a bearing part that pivotally supports the shaft part, the bearing part including a main bearing and an eccentric bearing, the main bearing pivotally supporting the main shaft, the eccentric bearing pivotally supporting the eccentric shaft. The main shaft includes a sliding surface that slides on the main bearing, the sliding surface being either a single sliding surface or divided into a plurality of sliding surfaces. In a case where the sliding surface is the single sliding surface, a length of the single sliding surface in an axial direction is a single sliding length L, whereas in a case where the sliding surface is divided into the plurality of sliding surfaces, a length of one of the sliding surfaces in the axial direction, the one sliding surface having a least length in the axial direction among the plurality of sliding surfaces, is the single sliding length L. A ratio L/D of the single sliding length L to an external diameter D of the main shaft is less than or equal to 2.0.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">According to the above configuration, the ratio L/D of the single sliding length L to the external diameter D is less than or equal to 2.0 regardless of whether the sliding surface of the main shaft of the crankshaft is a single sliding surface or a plurality of sliding surfaces, and also, even though the lubricating oil used in the hermetic refrigerant compressor has a reduced viscosity, the average molecular weight of the lubricating oil is within a predetermined range, and the lubricating oil contains 0.5% by mass or more of the high molecular weight component whose molecular weight is relatively great. Accordingly, even though the sliding area is reduced such that the ratio L/D is less than or equal to 2.0 and an oil film is formed by the low-viscosity lubricating oil, the oil film can be favorably formed owing to the high molecular weight component. As a result, even with the use of the lubricating oil having a reduced viscosity and the use of the bearing part having a reduced sliding area, the frictional coefficient of the shaft part pivotally supported by the bearing part can be reduced. Consequently, friction at the slide part of the crankshaft can be reduced favorably, which makes it possible to achieve high efficiency and favorable reliability of the hermetic refrigerant compressor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">A refrigerator-freezer according to the present invention includes a refrigerant circuit including: the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above; a radiator; a decompressor; and a heat absorber. In the refrigerant circuit, the hermetic refrigerant compressor, the radiator, the decompressor, and the heat absorber are connected by piping in an annular manner.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017">According to the above configuration, in the hermetic refrigerant compressor, the low-viscosity lubricating oil is used; the sliding area is reduced; and the shaft part has favorable reliability. Since the refrigerator-freezer includes the hermetic refrigerant compressor, which is highly efficient and has favorable reliability, the power consumption of the refrigerator-freezer can be reduced, and also, the refrigerator-freezer can be made highly reliable.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0018">The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will more fully be apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments with accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0019">The present invention is configured as described above, and has an advantage of being able to provide a hermetic refrigerant compressor that uses lubricating oil having a reduced viscosity and that makes it possible to achieve high efficiency and favorable reliability even in the case of reducing the sliding area of the shaft part that is pivotally supported by the bearing part.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view showing one example of the configuration of a hermetic refrigerant compressor according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic side view showing one example of the configuration of a crankshaft included in the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram showing one configuration example in which a sliding surface of the crankshaft shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a single sliding surface; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> are schematic diagrams each showing one configuration example in which the sliding surface of the crankshaft shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is divided into a plurality of sliding surfaces.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing one example of the configuration of a refrigerator-freezer including the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a graph showing one example of the molecular weight distribution of lubricating oil used in the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a graph showing one example of the molecular weight distribution of conventional lubricating oil; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> is a graph showing one example of the molecular weight distribution of a high molecular weight component added to the lubricating oil according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a graph showing one example of a relationship between L/D and a frictional coefficient of the crankshaft in the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in which the lubricating oil shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is used.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graph showing one example of a relationship between the content of the high molecular weight component in the lubricating oil shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and the coefficient of performance of the hermetic refrigerant compressor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0027">A hermetic refrigerant compressor according to the present disclosure includes a sealed container in which lubricating oil is stored, the sealed container accommodating an electric element and a compression element, the compression element being driven by the electric element and configured to compress a refrigerant. The lubricating oil has a kinematic viscosity in a range of 1 mm<sup>2</sup>/S to 7 mm<sup>2</sup>/S at 40&#xb0; C., has a mass average molecular weight in a range of 150 to 400, and contains 0.5% by mass or more of a high molecular weight component. The high molecular weight component has a mass molecular weight of greater than or equal to 500. The compression element includes: a shaft part that is a crankshaft including a main shaft and an eccentric shaft; and a bearing part that pivotally supports the shaft part, the bearing part including a main bearing and an eccentric bearing, the main bearing pivotally supporting the main shaft, the eccentric bearing pivotally supporting the eccentric shaft. The main shaft includes a sliding surface that slides on the main bearing, the sliding surface being either a single sliding surface or divided into a plurality of sliding surfaces. In a case where the sliding surface is the single sliding surface, a length of the single sliding surface in an axial direction is a single sliding length L, whereas in a case where the sliding surface is divided into the plurality of sliding surfaces, a length of one of the sliding surfaces in the axial direction, the one sliding surface having a least length in the axial direction among the plurality of sliding surfaces, is the single sliding length L. A ratio L/D of the single sliding length L to an external diameter D of the main shaft is less than or equal to 2.0.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0028">According to the above configuration, the ratio L/D of the single sliding length L to the external diameter D is less than or equal to 2.0 regardless of whether the sliding surface of the main shaft of the crankshaft is a single sliding surface or a plurality of sliding surfaces, and also, even though the lubricating oil used in the hermetic refrigerant compressor has a reduced viscosity, the average molecular weight of the lubricating oil is within a predetermined range, and the lubricating oil contains 0.5% by mass or more of the high molecular weight component whose molecular weight is relatively great. Accordingly, even though the sliding area is reduced such that the ratio L/D is less than or equal to 2.0 and an oil film is formed by the low-viscosity lubricating oil, the oil film can be favorably formed owing to the high molecular weight component. As a result, even with the use of the lubricating oil having a reduced viscosity and the use of the bearing part having a reduced sliding area, the frictional coefficient of the shaft part pivotally supported by the bearing part can be reduced. Consequently, friction at the slide part of the crankshaft can be reduced favorably, which makes it possible to achieve high efficiency and favorable reliability of the hermetic refrigerant compressor.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0029">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the ratio L/D may be greater than or equal to 0.4.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030">According to the above configuration, the ratio L/D being greater than or equal to 0.4 makes it possible to avoid or reduce the risk of excessive reduction of the sliding area. Accordingly, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the frictional coefficient of the shaft part can be favorably reduced by an oil film formed by the lubricating oil, which is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component. Consequently, the friction at the slide part of the crankshaft can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the lubricating oil may contain an oily agent.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032">According to the above configuration, the low-viscosity lubricating oil contains the oily agent in addition to the high molecular weight component. By additionally containing the oily agent in the lubricating oil, the formation of the oil film by the lubricating oil can be further facilitated. Consequently, the friction at the slide part of the crankshaft can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the oily agent may be an ester-based compound.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">According to the above configuration, since the oily agent contained in the lubricating oil is an ester-based compound, the oily agent has an ester linkage. Accordingly, owing to the polarity derived from the ester linkage, the oil film formation performance of the oily agent can be improved. Consequently, the friction at the slide part of the crankshaft can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, a distillation fraction of the lubricating oil at a distillation temperature of 300&#xb0; C. may be 0.1% or greater, and a distillation end point may be 440&#xb0; C. or higher.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">According to the above configuration, a component having a high distillation temperature is present in the low-viscosity lubricating oil containing the high molecular weight component. Accordingly, even though the temperature of the slide part increases due to the reduction of the sliding area, the evaporation of the lubricating oil can be avoided or suppressed effectively. As a result, the oil film can be more stably formed by the lubricating oil. Consequently, the friction at the slide part of the crankshaft can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the lubricating oil may contain a sliding modifier such that a content of the sliding modifier in the lubricating oil in terms of an atomic weight of sulfur is greater than or equal to 100 ppm.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0038">According to the above configuration, a suitable amount of the sulfur-based sliding modifier is added to the low-viscosity lubricating oil containing the high molecular weight component. Owing to the sliding modifier, the wear resistance of the sliding surface can be improved, which makes it possible to facilitate the reduction of the friction at the slide part of the crankshaft. Accordingly, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the friction at the slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0039">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the lubricating oil may contain a phosphorus-based extreme-pressure additive.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0040">According to the above configuration, the phosphorus-based extreme-pressure additive is added to the low-viscosity lubricating oil containing the high molecular weight component. Owing to the extreme-pressure additive, the wear resistance of the sliding surface can be improved, which makes it possible to facilitate the reduction of the friction at the slide part of the crankshaft. Accordingly, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the friction at the slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the lubricating oil may be at least one selected from the group consisting of mineral oil, alkyl benzene oil, and ester oil.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0042">According to the above configuration, at least one selected from the group consisting of mineral oil, alkyl benzene oil, and ester oil is used as the lubricating oil although the lubricating oil is not particularly limited. As a result, in a case where the lubricating oil is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the frictional coefficient of the shaft part can be readily reduced.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">In the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above, the electric element may be inverter-driven at a plurality of operating frequencies.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0044">According to the above configuration, in the case where the electric element is inverter-driven, regardless of whether low-speed operation is being performed or high-speed operation is being performed, a favorable oil film is formed at the slide part by the low-viscosity lubricating oil containing the high molecular weight component. Even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the frictional coefficient of the shaft part can be reduced favorably. Consequently, the slide part of the crankshaft has a low frictional coefficient and favorable wear resistance regardless of the operating speed. This makes it possible to further improve the efficiency and reliability of the hermetic refrigerant compressor.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0045">A refrigerator-freezer according to the present disclosure may include a refrigerant circuit including: the hermetic refrigerant compressor configured as above; a radiator; a decompressor; and a heat absorber.

From this tendency, it can be considered that if the sliding area becomes too large, the frictional coefficient reduction effect by the lubricating oil <b>103</b> (low-viscosity oil containing a high molecular weight component) in the present disclosure cannot be exerted sufficiently (in other words, the frictional coefficient reduction effect by the lubricating oil <b>103</b> can be exerted sufficiently when the sliding area is smaller than that in the conventional art).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0081">As described above, in the present disclosure, in a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, which is low-viscosity oil containing a high molecular weight component, is used, the upper limit of the ratio L/D of the crankshaft <b>108</b> may be less than or equal to 2.0. Although the lower limit value of the ratio L/D is not particularly limited, one preferable example of the lower limit value is greater than or equal to 0.4. Although depending on various conditions, the ratio L/D being greater than or equal to 0.4 makes it possible to avoid or reduce the risk of excessive reduction of the sliding area.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0082">Accordingly, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, rapid increase in the frictional coefficient of the shaft part can be favorably suppressed by an oil film formed by the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, which is low-viscosity oil containing a high molecular weight component. Consequently, the friction at the slide part of the crankshaft <b>108</b> can be reduced more favorably, which makes it possible to favorably achieve high efficiency and wear resistance of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0083">It should be noted that, in the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the main shaft <b>109</b> of the crankshaft <b>108</b> is referred to as the shaft part, and the ratio L/D is described about the main shaft <b>109</b>. However, the present disclosure is not thus limited. The same is true of the eccentric shaft <b>110</b>. Specifically, in a case where a sliding surface of the eccentric shaft <b>110</b>, the sliding surface being configured to slide on the eccentric bearing <b>119</b>, is a single sliding surface, the length of the single sliding surface in the axial direction is the single sliding length L, whereas in a case where the sliding surface of the eccentric shaft <b>110</b> is divided into a plurality of sliding surfaces, the length of one of the sliding surfaces in the axial direction, the one sliding surface having the least length in the axial direction among the plurality of sliding surfaces, is the single sliding length L. In these cases, the ratio L/D of the single sliding length L to the external diameter D of the eccentric shaft <b>110</b> may be less than or equal to 2.0.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0084">Therefore, in the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure, at least one of the main and eccentric shafts <b>109</b> and <b>110</b> forming the shaft part may have a ratio L/D of less than or equal to 2.0. It will suffice if at least one of the main and eccentric shafts <b>109</b> and <b>110</b> has a ratio L/D of less than or equal to 2.0.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0085">[Configuration of Lubricating Oil]</p><p id="p-0086" num="0086">Next, a more specific configuration of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> stored in the sealed container <b>101</b> is specifically described.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0087">The lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure is low-viscosity oil that has a kinematic viscosity in the range of 1 mm<sup>2</sup>/S to 7 mm<sup>2</sup>/S at 40&#xb0; C., has a mass average molecular weight in the range of 150 to 400, and contains 0.5% by mass or more of a high molecular weight component. The high molecular weight component has a relatively high molecular weight, i.e., has a mass molecular weight of greater than or equal to 500. A specific material of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is not particularly limited. Typically, for example, at least one oil substance selected from the group consisting of mineral oil, alkyl benzene oil, and polyalkylene glycol oil can be suitably used as the lubricating oil <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0088">The lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure may originally contain the high molecular weight component.

In the former case, for example, mineral oil may be used as the lubricating oil <b>103</b>. Unrefined or roughly refined raw material mineral oil may be refined to prepare (produce) the lubricating oil <b>103</b>. At the time, refining conditions or refining technique for refining the raw material oil may be adjusted such that 0.5% by mass or more of the high molecular weight component remains after the refining. In the latter case, for example, mineral oil, alkyl benzene oil, or polyalkylene glycol oil may be contained in the lubricating oil <b>103</b> as its &#x201c;principal component&#x201d; and an oil substance serving as the high molecular weight component may be added as an &#x201c;additive component&#x201d; to the principal component.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0089">As previously mentioned, the mass average molecular weight of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure may be in the range of 150 to 400. In a case where the mass average molecular weight of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is within this range, the aforementioned kinematic viscosity range at 40&#xb0; C. is achieved favorably, and also in this case, by containing 0.5% by mass or more of the high molecular weight component in the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, a favorable oil film can be formed even when the sliding area is reduced such that the ratio L/D is less than or equal to 2.0. The mass average molecular weight of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> may be in the range of 200 to 300.

For example, in a case where the principal component is mineral oil, the high molecular weight component may also be mineral oil, or the high molecular weight component may be alkyl benzene oil, polyalkylene glycol oil, or a different oil substance.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0091">A method of measuring the mass average molecular weight of the lubricating oil and the mass molecular weight of the high molecular weight component is not particularly limited. In the present disclosure, these weights can be measured and expressed in terms of standard polystyrene by GPC (Gel Permeation Chromatography) technique that is used in the below-described Examples. That is, the mass average molecular weight (weight average molecular weight) of the lubricating oil may be measured by GPC technique as a weight (mass) average molecular weight in terms of polystyrene. To determine whether or not the mass molecular weight of the high molecular weight component is greater than or equal to 500, a molecular weight distribution graph indicating a relationship between differential molar mass distribution and mass molecular weight may be measured by GPC technique. By using the molecular weight distribution graph, whether or not the mass molecular weight of the high molecular weight component is greater than or equal to 500 may be determined based on whether or not the mass molecular weight has a peak greater than or equal to 500.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0092">In the lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure, the lower limit content of the high molecular weight component may be 0.5% by mass, and the upper limit content of the high molecular weight component is not particularly limited, so long as the upper limit content does not affect, at least, the functions of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> or the functional advantages provided by the lubricating oil <b>103</b>. According to the Examples described below (see Example 3 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), in a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> contains at least 0.5% by mass of the high molecular weight component, the coefficient of performance (COP) of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> is improved as compared to a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> does not contain the high molecular weight component (0% by mass).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0093">Further, according to the Examples described below (see Example 3 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), one preferable example of the upper limit content of the high molecular weight component in the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is less than or equal to 7.0% by mass. The upper limit content of the high molecular weight component is more preferably less than or equal to 6.0% by mass, and yet more preferably 5.0% by mass. As compared to a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> does not contain the high molecular weight component (0% by mass), the coefficient of performance is improved even in a case where the content of the high molecular weight component in the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is greater than 7.0% by mass. However, if the content of the high molecular weight component in the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is greater than 7.0% by mass, it is possible that the coefficient of performance improving effect obtained in this case is unfavorably disproportionate to the content of the high molecular weight component. In light of this, in the present disclosure, the upper limit content of the high molecular weight component may be set to less than or equal to 7.0% by mass.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0094">Still further, according to the Examples described below, the coefficient of performance in a case where the content of the high molecular weight component is less than or equal to 6.0% by mass is better than the coefficient of performance in a case where the content of the high molecular weight component is greater than 6.0% by mass. In light of this, in the present disclosure, a preferable upper limit content of the high molecular weight component is less than or equal to 6.0% by mass. Still further, according to the Examples described below, the coefficient of performance exhibits its maximal value in a case where the content of the high molecular weight component is about 2.0 to 2.5% by mass. Even in a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> contains about 5.0% by mass of the high molecular weight component, the coefficient of performance is similar to that in a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> contains 0.5% by mass of the high molecular weight component, which is the lower limit content of the high molecular weight component. In light of this, in the present disclosure, a more preferable upper limit content of the high molecular weight component is less than or equal to 5.0% by mass.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0095">Accordingly, in the present disclosure, the content of the high molecular weight component in the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is preferably in the range of 0.5% by mass to 7.0% by mass, more preferably in the range of 0.5% by mass to 6.0% by mass, and yet more preferably in the range of 0.5% by mass to 5.0% by mass. It should be noted that, depending on various conditions of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> or various conditions of the shaft part to be lubricated, it is possible that the maximal value of the coefficient of performance is shifted to the high molecular weight component content decreasing side or to the high molecular weight component content increasing side. In such a case, the upper limit content of the high molecular weight component may be set to a value greater than 7.0% by mass, or to a value less than 0.5% by mass.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0096">It should be noted that if the content of the high molecular weight component in the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is within any of the aforementioned preferable ranges, it is basically determined that the mass average molecular weight of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is in the range of 150 to 400. Specifically, if the ratio of the high molecular weight component to the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is within any of the aforementioned preferable ranges, it can be assumed that, when looking at the lubricating oil <b>103</b> as a whole, the high molecular weight component barely affects increase in the mass average molecular weight (i.e., the mass average molecular weight of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> does not exceed 400). Thus, the upper limit content of the high molecular weight component in the lubricating oil <b>103</b> can be set within such a range as not to affect the functions of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> and not to cause excessive increase in the mass average molecular weight.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0097">In the present disclosure, the reason why the coefficient of performance of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> is improved by containing the high molecular weight component in the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is, as the results in the below-described Examples indicate, that even though the lubricating oil <b>103</b> has a low viscosity (the kinematic viscosity at 40&#xb0; C. is in the range of 1 mm<sup>2</sup>/S to 7 mm<sup>2</sup>/S), the lubricating oil <b>103</b> contributes to the formation of a favorable oil film at the slide part owing to the high molecular weight component. Specifically, while the crankshaft <b>108</b> is sliding, the high molecular weight component can be present on the outer peripheral surface (sliding surface) of the main shaft <b>109</b> and the inner peripheral surface (sliding surface) of the main bearing <b>114</b>, the outer and inner peripheral surfaces forming the slide part, regardless of the entire flow of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> at the slide part, and thereby the oil film is favorably formed by the lubricating oil <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0098">In the present disclosure, only one oil substance may be used as the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, or a suitable combination of two or more oil substances may be used as the lubricating oil <b>103</b>. The definition of a combination of two or more oil substances herein includes not only a combination of, for example, two or more different oil substances, each of which is mineral oil, but also a combination of, for example, at least one oil substance that is a mineral oil and at least one oil substance that is alkyl benzene oil (or at least one oil substance that is polyalkylene glycol oil).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0099">In a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is prepared by adding the high molecular weight component as an additive component to the principal component, for example, one oil substance may be used as the principal component, and another oil substance different from the principal component may be used as the high molecular weight component. Alternatively, two or more oil substances may be used as the principal component, and one oil substance may be used as the high molecular weight component. Further alternatively, one oil substance may be used as the principal component, and two or more oil substances may be used as the high molecular weight component. Still further alternatively, two or more different oil substance mixtures, in each of which the high molecular weight component is added to the principal component, may be mixed together to prepare the lubricating oil <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0100">The oil substances used in the present disclosure are not particularly limited. At least one oil substance from among mineral oil, alkyl benzene oil, and ester oil may be used as the principal component and/or the high molecular weight component. The lubricating oil <b>103</b> thus prepared makes it possible to favorably achieve, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the effect of reducing the frictional coefficient of the shaft part.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0101">The physical properties of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> (oil substance or lubricating oil composition) used in the present disclosure are not particularly limited except the aforementioned kinematic viscosity at 40&#xb0; C. Preferable physical properties of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> are, for example, such distillation properties that the distillation fraction of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> at a distillation temperature of 300&#xb0; C. is 0.1% or greater and the distillation end point is 440&#xb0; C. or higher. A method of measuring the distillation properties is not particularly limited. In the present disclosure, a measurement method in compliance with JIS K2254: 1998 &#x201c;Petroleum products-Determination of distillation characteristics&#x201d; or in compliance with JIS K2601: 1998 &#x201c;Testing methods for crude petroleum&#x201d; is used.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0102">At the slide part formed by the shaft part and the bearing part, heat is generated due to friction between sliding surfaces upon sliding motion, and it is known that at an early stage of the friction, an instantaneous temperature rise called &#x201c;flash temperature&#x201d; occurs. The outer peripheral surface of the shaft part and the inner peripheral surface of the bearing part are configured as smooth sliding surfaces so as to achieve favorable slidability. However, even though the sliding surfaces are macroscopically smooth surfaces, there are microscopically fine protrusions on the sliding surfaces. During sliding motion, the fine protrusions of one sliding surface repeatedly adhere to and break away from the other sliding surface. When the fine protrusions of the one sliding surface break away from the other sliding surface, thermal energy is released, and when the released thermal energy concentrates, an instantaneous temperature rise occurs. A high temperature resulting from the instantaneous temperature rise is hereinafter called &#x201c;flash temperature&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0103">For example, Reference Literature 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. 2006-097096 discloses a carburized or carbonitrided bearing steel component. According to Reference Literature 1, generally speaking, seizing occurs when the flash temperature exceeds about 140&#xb0; C. It is also known that the flash temperature at the slide part reaches several hundred degrees Celsius. In the present disclosure, in the case of using the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, which is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component, a condition that the flash temperature at the slide part is 300&#xb0; C. or higher is important.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0104">Therefore, preferably, the distillation properties of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> (oil substance or lubricating oil composition) used in the present disclosure are such that the distillation fraction (volume fraction) of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> at a distillation temperature of 300&#xb0; C. is 0.1% or greater and the distillation end point is 440&#xb0; C. or higher. In a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> has these preferable distillation properties, even when the flash temperature of 300&#xb0; C. or higher occurs at the slide part, problems such as the evaporation of the oil film formed by the lubricating oil <b>103</b> can be suppressed or prevented effectively. Consequently, even though the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component and the temperature of the slide part increases due to the reduction of the sliding area, the oil film can be more stably formed by the lubricating oil <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0105">The lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure may be a low-viscosity oil substance containing the high molecular weight component. Various additives may be added to the oil substance. In other words, the lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure may be a lubricating oil composition that contains not only the oil substance but also another component. As previously described, only one oil substance may be used as the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, or a combination of two or more oil substances may be used as the lubricating oil <b>103</b>. Also in the case of using a combination of two or more oil substances as the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, the lubricating oil <b>103</b> may be defined as a &#x201c;lubricating oil composition&#x201d;. Alternatively, in the case of using a combination of two or more oil substances as the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, the lubricating oil <b>103</b> may be defined as &#x201c;mixed oil&#x201d;, whereas in the case of containing not only the oil substance but also another component in the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, the lubricating oil <b>103</b> may be defined as a &#x201c;lubricating oil composition&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0106">In a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure is a lubricating oil composition that contains not only the oil substance but also another component, this other component is not particularly limited to a specific component. A typical example of the other component is an additive known in the field of the lubricating oil <b>103</b>. In particular, in the present disclosure, the lubricating oil <b>103</b> preferably contains an oily agent. By adding the oily agent to the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, the formation of the oil film on the sliding surfaces of the slide part by the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is facilitated. Consequently, the friction at the slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0107">The oily agent is not particularly limited to a specific kind of oily agent. Typical examples of the oily agent include higher fatty acids, higher alcohols, esters (ester-based compounds), ethers, amines, amides, and metal soaps. Only one of these oily agents may be used, or two or more of these oily agents may be suitably used in combination. The addition amount(s) of the oily agent(s) is/are not particularly limited, and the oily agent(s) may be added in the range of, for example, 0.01 to 1% by weight.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0108">In the present disclosure, a more preferable example of the oily agent is an ester-based compound. The ester-based compound may be a compound having an ester structure in which an alcohol and a carboxylic acid are reacted with each other. The alcohol may be a monohydric alcohol, or may be a polyhydric alcohol, which is at least bivalent. Similarly, the carboxylic acid may be a monocarboxylic acid, a dicarboxylic acid, or a tricarboxylic acid (or may be a carboxylic acid containing four or more carboxyl groups). Generally speaking, a commercially available ester-based oily agent can be suitably used.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0109">As previously described, the lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component. In a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is a lubricating oil composition containing the oily agent, the oil film formation performance can be further improved. As previously described, since the lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure contains the high molecular weight component, the high molecular weight component is present on the sliding surfaces of the main shaft <b>109</b> and the main bearing <b>114</b>, the sliding surfaces forming a slide part, and consequently, the oil film can be favorably formed by the lubricating oil <b>103</b>. Further, by containing the oily agent in the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, the oily agent adheres to the sliding surfaces of the main shaft <b>109</b> and the main bearing <b>114</b>, and thereby the formation of the oil film by the lubricating oil <b>103</b> (lubricating oil composition) is further facilitated.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0110">In particular, in a case where the oily agent is an ester-based compound, the oily agent has an ester linkage. Accordingly, owing to the polarity derived from the ester linkage, the adhesion of the oil film formed by the lubricating oil <b>103</b> (lubricating oil composition) to the slide part can be further facilitated (i.e., the adhesiveness of the oil film can be further improved), which makes it possible to further improve the oil film formation performance of the lubricating oil <b>103</b>. Therefore, the frictional coefficient can be further reduced, and the friction at the slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0111">The lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure may contain, as additives, not only the above-described oily agent but also a sulfur-based sliding modifier. The sulfur-based sliding modifier may be a sulfur-based sliding modifier that allows the material of the shaft part (shaft part material) and sulfur to react with each other. Accordingly, the sliding modifier may be sulfur, or may be a sulfur compound that contains sulfur and that is reactive with the shaft part material.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0112">In the present disclosure, since the material of the shaft part is a ferrous material, examples of sulfur compounds usable as the sliding modifier include sulfurized olefins, sulfide-based compounds (e.g., dibenzyl disulfide (DBDS)), xanthates, thiadiazoles, thiocarbonates, sulfurized oil or fat, sulfurized esters, dithiocarbamates, and sulfurized terpenes.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0113">The content of the sulfur-based sliding modifier in the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is not particularly limited. Preferably, the sliding modifier may be added to the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, such that the content of the sliding modifier in the lubricating oil <b>103</b> in terms of the atomic weight of sulfur is greater than or equal to 100 ppm. It should be noted that the upper limit addition amount of the sliding modifier is not particularly limited, so long as the upper limit addition amount is such an amount (e.g., 1000 ppm or less) as not to affect the physical properties of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> (lubricating oil composition).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0114">As previously described, the lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component. In a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is a lubricating oil composition containing the sliding modifier in addition to the oily agent, the wear resistance of the sliding surfaces can be improved by the sliding modifier. Accordingly, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the friction at the slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0115">The lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure may contain, as additives, not only the above-described oily agent and sliding modifier but also a known extreme-pressure additive. A specific extreme-pressure additive to be added to the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is not particularly limited, and a known extreme-pressure additive can be suitably used. Examples of known extreme-pressure additives that can be suitably used include phosphorus-based compounds, such as phosphate esters, and halogenated compounds, such as chlorine-based hydrocarbons or fluorine-based hydrocarbons. Only one of these extreme-pressure additives may be added to the lubricating oil composition (lubricating oil <b>103</b>), or a suitable combination of two or more of these extreme-pressure additives may be added to the lubricating oil composition (lubricating oil <b>103</b>).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0116">Among these extreme-pressure additives, a phosphorus-based compound can be used preferably. Typical examples of the phosphorus-based compound include tricresyl phosphate (TCP), tributyl phosphate (TBP), and triphenyl phosphate (TPP). Among these, TCP is particularly preferable. In addition to the sulfur-based sliding modifier, a phosphorus-based extreme-pressure additive may be added to the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, and thereby, for example, wear of the shaft slide part can be reduced favorably.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0117">The amount of the extreme-pressure additive to be added to the lubricating oil composition is not particularly limited. For example, in a case where the principal component of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is a low-polarity substance such as mineral oil or alkyl benzene oil, a suitable addition amount of the extreme-pressure additive is in the range of 0.5 to 8.0% by weight, and more preferably in the range of 1 to 3% by weight.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0118">As previously described, the lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the present disclosure is low-viscosity oil containing the high molecular weight component. In a case where the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is a lubricating oil composition containing the extreme-pressure additive in addition to the oily agent, the wear resistance of the sliding surfaces can be improved by the extreme-pressure additive. In particular, by containing both the sliding modifier and the extreme-pressure additive in the lubricating oil <b>103</b>, wear of the sliding surfaces can be reduced more favorably by their synergistic effect. Accordingly, even in a state where the sliding area is reduced, the friction at the slide part can be reduced more favorably.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0119">Further, in the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure, known various additives may be added to the lubricating oil <b>103</b> in addition to the oily agent, the sliding modifier, and the extreme-pressure additive. Those known in the field of the lubricating oil <b>103</b> can be suitably used as the various additives to be added to the lubricating oil <b>103</b>. Typical examples of such additives include antioxidants, acid-acceptors, metal deactivators, defoaming agents, anti-corrosive agents, and dispersants.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0120">In other words, the lubricating oil <b>103</b> used in the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure may be a low-viscosity oil substance containing a high molecular weight component (the low-viscosity oil substance may be formed by only one oil substance, or may be mixed oil containing two or more oil substances). Preferably, the lubricating oil <b>103</b> may be a lubricating oil composition (formed by an oil substance and an oily agent) that is prepared by adding the oily agent to the oil substance. As another preferable example, the lubricating oil composition may contain, as the additive(s), a sliding modifier and/or an extreme-pressure additive.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0121">As described above, the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure satisfies the following conditions (1) and (2).

As one preferable example, the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> may satisfy, in addition to the conditions (1) and (2), a condition (3) that the lubricating oil <b>103</b> contains an oily agent (in particular, an ester-based oily agent).</p><p id="p-0122" num="0122">Accordingly, even though the lubricating oil <b>103</b> is low-viscosity oil and the sliding area is reduced such that the ratio L/D is less than or equal to 2.0, the oil film can be favorably formed by the lubricating oil <b>103</b> at the slide part formed by the shaft part and the bearing part owing to the high molecular weight component whose mass molecular weight is greater than or equal to 500. This makes it possible to reduce the frictional coefficient of the slide part and also to favorably suppress the wear of the slide part. Therefore, the reliability of the shaft part pivotally supported by the bearing part can be improved. Consequently, the efficiency and reliability of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0123">It should be noted that the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure may be inverter-driven at a plurality of operating frequencies as previously mentioned. In a case where the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> is inverter-driven, there are two operation modes of the electric element <b>106</b>, in one of which the electric element <b>106</b> is operated at a low rotation speed (low-speed operation), and in the other of which the electric element <b>106</b> is operated at a high rotation speed (high-speed operation). When the electric element <b>106</b> is operated at a low rotation speed, the amount of lubricating oil <b>103</b> fed to the shaft slide part decreases. In the present disclosure, although the sliding area of the shaft slide part is reduced, even when the amount of lubricating oil <b>103</b> fed to the shaft slide part decreases, high efficiency and favorable wear resistance can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0124">Also, even when the rotation speed of the electric element <b>106</b> shifts from a low rotation speed to a high rotation speed (i.e., even when the rotation speed of the electric element <b>106</b> increases), favorable wear resistance can be achieved. Therefore, in a case where the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> is inverter-driven, regardless of whether the low-speed operation is being performed or the high-speed operation is being performed, the oil film that is derived from the ester-based oily agent and the component whose mass molecular weight is greater than or equal to 500 can be formed on the shaft slide part. Consequently, the reliability of the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> can be improved, and also, the operating efficiency can be improved.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading><p id="p-0125" num="0125">In Embodiment 2, one example of a refrigerator-freezer that includes the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> described above in Embodiment 1 is specifically described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a schematic configuration of the refrigerator-freezer including the refrigerant compressor <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1.
