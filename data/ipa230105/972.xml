Nevertheless, globally, an estimated 38 million people were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 2019 (www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet), which is an increase from previous years as a result of the wider availability of life-saving antiretroviral therapies (ART).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite its proven success at suppressing viral replication saving lives, there are significant challenges to initiating and maintaining ART for all of those HIV-infected patients that need it in the world. For example, ART does not eliminate the viral reservoir, and treatment is associated with an incomplete restoration of the host immune system. In particular, while ART facilitates CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell reconstitution in the blood, there is only a limited improvement in the function of anti-HIV specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Also, ART must be taken life-long with near perfect adherence in order to be effective. This places extreme pressure and costs on international donors and over-taxed health systems in developing countries where HIV prevalence rates are highest. Moreover, ART has both short-term and long-term side effects for users, and drug resistance rates rise as more people are on treatment for longer periods of time. Thus, alternative or complementary treatments, including a therapeutic vaccine, which could induce a true or &#x201c;functional&#x201d; cure of HIV infection and lessen or eliminate the need for lifelong ART for HIV infected individuals, would therefore be of great benefit. The concept of a &#x201c;functional cure&#x201d; includes therapeutic strategies that enable host control of the virus without the need for antiretroviral treatment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods of treating HIV-infected subjects, particularly novel therapies that seek to achieve a functional cure of HIV, including a therapeutic vaccine that preferably would improve immune responses to HIV and possibly allow at least some treated subjects to discontinue ART while maintaining viremic control.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The application relates to methods for inducing an immune response against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in an HIV-infected subject undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a first vaccine comprising one or more adenovirus vectors encoding mosaic HIV immunogens, a second vaccine comprising poxvirus vector(s) encoding the mosaic HIV immunogens, and at least two, preferably three different anti-HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one general aspect, the application relates to a method of inducing an immune response against a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in an HIV-infected human subject undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART), the method comprising:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">(i) administering to the human subject an adenovirus vaccine comprising one or more adenovirus vectors together encoding HIV gag, pol, and env immunogens, preferably four HIV immunogens having the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, and SEQ ID NO: 4, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">(ii) administering to the human subject a poxvirus vaccine comprising one or more poxvirus vectors together encoding the HIV gag, pol, and env immunogens, preferably, the four HIV immunogens and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(iii) administering to the human subject at least two, preferably three different anti-HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In certain embodiments, the one or more adenovirus vectors are adenovirus 26 (Ad26) vectors.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, the adenovirus vaccine comprises more than one Ad26 vectors.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain embodiments, wherein the one or more poxvirus vectors are Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectors.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In certain embodiments, the poxvirus vaccine consists of a single MVA vector encoding the four HIV immunogens.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments, the at least two anti-HIV bNAbs each bind to an epitope or region of HIV gp120 envelope selected from the group consisting of (i) CD4-binding site (CD4bs) (ii) third variable loop (V3) and/or high mannose patch comprising a N332 oligomannose glycan; (iii) second variable loop (V2) and/or Env trimer apex; (iv) gp120/gp41 interface; or (v) silent face of gp120.

Thus, a chimeric adenovirus that combines desirable properties from different serotypes can be produced. Thus, in some embodiments, a chimeric adenovirus of the invention could combine the absence of pre-existing immunity of a first serotype with characteristics such as temperature stability, assembly, anchoring, production yield, redirected or improved infection, stability of the DNA in the target cell, and the like.

An advantage of human adenovirus serotype 26 is that, so far, significant experience was obtained with such vectors in humans, and this did not reveal that pre-existing neutralizing antibody responses against such vectors would cause substantial interference with desired vaccine-induced responses, e.g., against the encoded immunogens in such vectors.

In some embodiments, the adenovirus is replication deficient, e.g., because it contains a deletion in the E1 region of the genome. For the adenoviruses derived from Ad26 used in the application, it is typical to exchange the E4-orf6 coding sequence of the adenovirus with the E4-orf6 of an adenovirus of human subgroup C such as Ad5. This allows propagation of such adenoviruses in well-known complementing cell lines that express the E1 genes of Ad5, such as for example 293 cells, PER.C6 cells, and the like (see, e.g., Havenga, et al., 2006<i>, J Gen Virol </i>87: 2135-43; WO 03/104467). However, such adenoviruses will not be capable of replicating in non-complementing cells that do not express the E1 genes of Ad5. Thus, in certain embodiments, the adenovirus is a human adenovirus of serotype 26, with a deletion in the E1 region into which the nucleic acid encoding one or more mosaic HIV immunogens has been cloned, and with an E4 orf6 region of Ad5.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The preparation of recombinant adenoviral vectors is well known in the art.

In these embodiments, the virus is rendered replication deficient by deletion or inactivation of regions critical to replication of the virus, such as the E1 region. The regions can be substantially deleted or inactivated by, for example, inserting a gene of interest, such as a gene encoding an HIV immunogen (usually linked to a promoter) within the region. In some embodiments, the vectors of the application can contain deletions in other regions, such as the E3 region, or insertions of heterologous genes linked to a promoter within such regions. Mutations in the E3 region of the adenovirus need not be complemented by the cell line, since E3 is not required for replication.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A packaging cell line is typically used to produce sufficient amounts of adenovirus vectors for use in methods of the application. A packaging cell is a cell that comprises those genes that have been deleted or inactivated in a replication deficient vector, thus allowing the virus to replicate in the cell.

In 1976, MVA derived from MVA-571 seed stock (corresponding to the 571st passage) was registered in Germany as the primer vaccine in a two-stage parenteral smallpox vaccination program. As a result of the passaging used to attenuate MVA, there are a number of different strains or isolates, depending on the number of passages conducted in CEF cells. For example, MVA-572 was used in a small dose as a pre-vaccine in Germany during the smallpox eradication program, and MVA-575 was extensively used as a veterinary vaccine. MVA as well as MVA-BN lacks approximately 15% (31 kb from six regions) of the genome compared with ancestral CVA virus.

The use of selection or marker cassettes simplifies the identification and isolation of the generated recombinant poxvirus. However, a recombinant poxvirus can also be identified by PCR technology. Subsequently, a further cell can be infected with the recombinant poxvirus obtained as described above and transfected with a second vector comprising a second foreign or heterologous gene or genes. In case, this gene shall be introduced into a different insertion site of the poxviral genome, the second vector also differs in the poxvirus-homologous sequences directing the integration of the second foreign gene or genes into the genome of the poxvirus. After homologous recombination has occurred, the recombinant virus comprising two or more foreign or heterologous genes can be isolated. For introducing additional foreign genes into the recombinant virus, the steps of infection and transfection can be repeated by using the recombinant virus isolated in previous steps for infection and by using a further vector comprising a further foreign gene or genes for transfection.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Alternatively, the steps of infection and transfection as described above are interchangeable, i.e., a suitable cell can at first be transfected by the plasmid vector comprising the foreign gene and, then, infected with the poxvirus. As a further alternative, it is also possible to introduce each foreign gene into different viruses, co-infect a cell with all the obtained recombinant viruses and screen for a recombinant including all foreign genes. A third alternative is ligation of DNA genome and foreign sequences in vitro and reconstitution of the recombined vaccinia virus DNA genome using a helper virus. A fourth alternative is homologous recombination in <i>E. coli </i>or another bacterial species between a vaccinia virus genome cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and a linear foreign sequence flanked with DNA sequences homologous to sequences flanking the desired site of integration in the vaccinia virus genome</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The heterologous nucleic acid encoding one or more mosaic HIV immunogens can be under the control of (i.e., operably linked to) one or more poxvirus promoters.

The monoclonal antibodies can be full-length or intact monoclonal antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof. Examples of the multispecific antibodies include bispecific antibodies or trispecific antibodies. An antibody typically comprises both light chains and heavy chains. The light chains of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (&#x3ba;) and lambda (&#x3bb;), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these can be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, lgA1, and lgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called &#x3b1;, &#x3b4;, &#x3b5;, &#x3b3;, and &#x3bc;, respectively.

Including more anti-HIV bNAbs ensures broader coverage of HIV variants and decreases the chance for escape mutants. However, each antibody will need to be manufactured and controlled as a pharmaceutical product and thus including more anti-HIV bNAbs will add to costs and complexity of the method of the invention. In preferred embodiments a balance is found by using two, three, or four anti-HIV bNAbs for methods of the application. Most preferably three anti-HIV bNAbs are used for methods of the invention.

In certain embodiments, such variants include variants with higher affinity, e.g., by a limited number (e.g., 1, 2, or 3) of mutations in one or more of the complementarity determining regions. In certain embodiments, such variants include variants with increased in vivo half-life, e.g., by a limited number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) of mutations in the constant region of the heavy chain. In certain non-limiting embodiments, to optimize in vivo half-life, an LS mutation can be added to the FcRn receptor binding region of an antibody. This mutation has no effect on neutralization breadth or potency but increases the half-life of the antibody by 2- to 3-fold in both humanized mice and non-human primates. Thus, an anti-HIV bNAb comprising an LS mutation can be administered fewer times than an antibody without the LS mutation. Addition of the LS mutation to a monoclonal antibody is known to the person of skill in the art (see, U.S. Pat.

In a subject undergoing antiretroviral therapy, the antiretroviral therapy is continued during administration of the vaccine part (i.e. adenovirus and poxvirus vectors) of the regimen of the application. ART is considered &#x201c;suppressive&#x201d; as used herein if the subject has plasma HIV RNA levels at less than 50 copies/mL for a certain period of time, including the possibility of blips. The term &#x201c;stable suppressive&#x201d; ART as used herein means that the suppressive ART regimen is not modified for a certain period of time.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In certain embodiments, a human subject undergoing antiretroviral therapy is on current stable suppressive ART for at least 48 weeks, meaning that while receiving the same ART regimen the subject has plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels at less than 50 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks prior to initiation of a regimen according to the application.

ART are medications that treat HIV, although the drugs do not kill the virus or remove the virus from the body. However, when taken in combination they can prevent the growth of the virus. When the virus is slowed down, so is HIV disease. Antiretroviral drugs are referred to as ARV. Combination ARV therapy (cART) is referred to as highly active ART (HAART). Typically, an ART regimen includes at least three antiviral compounds, e.g., two different reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine the appropriate antiretroviral treatment, frequency of administration, dosage of the ART, etc. so as to be compatible with simultaneous administration of the regimens of the application.

Any of the adenovirus vectors and poxvirus vectors described herein can be used in additional immunizations. Preferably however, each of the vaccine components (adenovirus and poxvirus) is administered only once.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The vaccine compositions can be administered by any method known in the art in view of the present disclosure, and administration is typically via intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous administration, preferably intramuscular administration. Intramuscular administration can be achieved by using a needle to inject a suspension or solution of the adenovirus and/or MVA vectors. An alternative is the use of a needleless injection device to administer the composition (using, e.g., Biojector&#x2122;) or a freeze-dried powder containing the vaccine.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Other modes of administration, such as intravenous, cutaneous, intradermal, oral, intratracheal, or nasal are also envisaged. For intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, the vector will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of ordinary skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection. Preservatives, stabilizers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives can be included, as required. A slow-release formulation can also be employed.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Accordingly, another general aspect of the application relates to a method of treating a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a human subject in need thereof, comprising:</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">(i) treating the human subject with an antiretroviral therapy (ART); and</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">(ii) inducing an immune response against the HIV in the human subject using a method according to an embodiment of the application.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In certain embodiments, the method of treatment further comprises discontinuing the ART treatment of step (i), preferably after an immune response is induced by a method of the application, more preferably after the first administration of the two or more anti-HIV bNAbs. The ART treatment may be resumed if needed at a later stage upon detection of viral rebound.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In certain embodiments, subjects undergo interruption (also referred to as discontinuation, used interchangeably herein) of ART after completion of a regimen according to embodiments of the application. In some embodiments, subjects can undergo antiretroviral analytical treatment interruption (ARV ATI) after completion of a regimen according to embodiments of the application. &#x201c;Antiretroviral analytical treatment interruption&#x201d; and &#x201c;ARV ATI&#x201d; as used in the application refer to discontinuation of treatment with antiretroviral drugs in order to assess viral suppression and viremic control in the absence of continued ART. Typically, subjects can undergo ARV ATI, i.e., ART can be discontinued, for example when the subject has plasma HIV RNA levels at less than 50 copies/mL for at least about 52 weeks, but a subject can still undergo ARV ATI even if the subject has one or more blips (i.e., instances) of plasma HIV RNA greater than 50 copies/ml to less than 200 copies/ml within this period, provided that the screening immediately prior to ARV ATI shows less than 50 copies/ml of plasma HIV RNA. HIV viral load, e.g., plasma HIV RNA levels, can be measured using known methods in view of the present disclosure, for example, using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 viral load assay, or the Roche Cobas Taqman HIV-1 viral load assay.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">According to embodiments of the application, the ART can be stopped at about 1 to 10 days, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 days, after the two or more anti-HIV bNAbs are initially administered, preferably 2 days after the two or more anti-HIV bNAbs are initially administered.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">Subjects undergoing ARV ATI can be monitored, e.g., by measuring plasma HIV RNA levels. As a non-limiting example, monitoring after the initiation of ARV ATI can occur up to two times per week during the first six weeks when rebound viremia is most likely to occur. &#x201c;Rebound viremia&#x201d; is for example defined as plasma HIV RNA levels of greater than 1,000 copies/ml after ARV ATI. ART can be re-initiated in subjects with rebound viremia. Preferably, a subject treated according to the methods of the application will maintain viremic control after ART interruption. As used herein, &#x201c;maintain viremic control&#x201d; means &#x201c;suppress viral replication&#x201d; which results in levels of virus at such low levels that there is limited weakening of the immune system (which would be the natural course of HIV infection), and maintaining viremic control is in exemplary embodiments defined as at least 24 weeks with plasma HIV RNA of less than 50 copies/mL after ARV ATI. The &#x201c;maintained viremic control&#x201d; criterion is in certain exemplary embodiments still deemed to be met if there are one or more instances of plasma HIV RNA greater than 50 copies/ml to less than 1000 copies/ml, as long as the subject does not have plasma HIV RNA levels above 1000 copies/ml on two consecutive determinations at least one week apart.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Typically (not using the methods of the instant invention) human HIV-infected subjects have a return of viremia after 2-3 weeks following ART interruption. Without wishing to be bound by any theories, it is believed that vaccine therapy using an adenovirus vaccine and a poxvirus vaccine according to embodiments of the invention among individuals with fully suppressed HIV will result in a measurable immune response and maintain viremic control after ARV ATI. In some embodiments, subjects can discontinue ART after being treated according to a method of the invention. Discontinuation of ART can be for long periods of time (e.g., at least 24 weeks, preferably longer, e.g., at least about 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 weeks, 16 months, 18, 20, 22, 24 months, or even longer). Such periods of time in which ART is stopped or discontinued are referred to as a &#x201c;holiday&#x201d; or &#x201c;ART holiday&#x201d; or &#x201c;treatment holiday&#x201d;. In other embodiments, vaccine therapy according to the methods of the invention can provide HIV remission, meaning that viral suppression is maintained in the absence of ART. In certain embodiments of the invention, a human subject that received the priming and boosting vaccines of the invention, discontinues ART and maintains viral suppression for at least 24 weeks after discontinuing ART.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In one exemplary regimen of the application, an Ad26 vaccine comprising one or more adenovirus 26 vectors is administered (e.g., intramuscularly) in an amount of about 100 &#x3bc;l to about 2 ml, preferably about 0.5 ml, of a solution containing concentrations of about 10<sup>8 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>virus particles/ml.

However, although the Ad26/MVA vaccines effectively induced cellular immunity, it failed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Indeed, increasing evidence suggests a role of antibodies in control of the viral reservoir by specifically recruiting antibody fragment crystallizable (Fc)&#x2014;dependent anti-viral activities such as antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Interestingly, ADCC-inducing antibodies are enriched in spontaneous controllers of HIV-1. Furthermore, it has been proposed that bNAbs have the potential to expand vaccine-induced T-cell responses either by slowing viral rebound and thus allowing controlled virus-induced expansion of T-cell responses, or alternatively by forming immune complexes and augmenting T-cell responses by a vaccinal effect (Niessl 2020; Nishimura 2017).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">In a study in SIV-infected rhesus macaques on ART, administration of a toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 agonist in combination with the bNAb PGT121 to SIV-infected rhesus macaques on ART resulted in delayed viral rebound and post viral rebound control following ART discontinuation (Borducchi et al, 2018).</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">A similar administration of an HIV-1 vaccine regimen in sequential combination with bNAbs may help to achieve sustained virologic control (below 50 copies/mL) and/or reduce the size of the viral reservoir after initial viral rebound following ART interruption in humans infected with HIV-1 on ART.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">The present inventors propose that combining both active and passive immunization, via use of therapeutic adenovirus and poxvirus vaccines and a combination of bNAbs, may have the ability to induce long-term ART-free virologic control.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Clinical studies in humans are conducted to investigate the effect of safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of a vaccine regimen consisting of an adenovirus 26 (Ad26) vector prime and a boost with an MVA vector in combination with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) PGT121, PGDM1400 and VRC07-523LS in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)&#x2014;infected study participants on suppressive anti-retroviral therapy (ART).</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Objectives</heading><p id="p-0182" num="0181">This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of a vaccine regimen containing Ad26.Mos4.HIV and MVA-BN-HIV and the broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) PGT121, PGDM1400 and VRC07-523LS in HIV-1-infected adults.

VRC07-523LS is administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0195">(vi) Placebo is 0.9% sodium chloride (0.5 mL injection).</p><p id="p-0199" num="0196">In vitro data show that VRC07-523LS, PGDM1400, PGT121 are complementary in their coverage of viral strains; many of the HIV-1 strains that are resistant to one mAb are sensitive to the other(s). The combination of VRC07-523LS, PGDM1400, and PGT121 yields theoretical coverage of over 99% of HIV-1 strains on a multi-clade panel. Moreover, 86% of global viruses are sensitive to at least 2 antibodies in this cocktail, thus assuring that the majority of individuals will receive at least 2 active antibodies.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0197">Preliminary pharmacokinetics data show that PGT121's and PGDM1400's half-life in HIV-uninfected volunteers is approximately 20 days. In HIV infected, viremic individuals the half-life for both bNAbs is between 11 and 12 days. Initial data suggests that the PK of each antibody is not affected by co-administration. VRC07-523LS half-life in HIV infected, viremic individuals is approximately 30 days.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0198">PK simulation results suggest that the proposed study design should be able to attain desirable serum concentration levels &#x3e;10 ug/ml for the initial 10 weeks after the first bNAb administration conferring sufficient neutralization efficacy based on the measured neutralization potency against diverse panels of pseudoviruses in the TZM-bl assay. In addition, this dosing regimen also guarantees sufficient wash-out of all three antibodies by week 24 following first bNAb administration to serum levels that are likely considered non-therapeutic for each bNAb based on known potency (IC50/IC80). As PGDM1400 and PGT121 showing up to 10-fold higher potency than VRC07-523LS, plasma level cut-off of &#x3c;1 ug/ml for PGDM1400 and PGT121 and &#x3c;10 ug/ml of VRC07-523LS were applied.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0199">Subjects receive the study vaccines administered by intramuscular administration and bNAbs by intravenous administration or placebo according to the schedule in Table 2 below:</p><p id="p-0203" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Schedule for administration of study vaccines</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Group</entry><entry>N</entry><entry>Week 0</entry><entry>Week 12</entry><entry>Week 24</entry><entry>Week 28</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Test</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>Ad26.Mos4.HIV</entry><entry>MVA-</entry><entry>PGT121 +</entry><entry>PGT121 +</entry></row><row><entry>Group</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>BN-HIV</entry><entry>PGDM1400 +</entry><entry>PGDM1400</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>VRC07-523LS</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Control</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>Ad26.Mos4.HIV</entry><entry>MVA-</entry><entry>Placebo</entry><entry>Placebo</entry></row><row><entry>Group</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>BN-HIV</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>1</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Control</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>Placebo</entry><entry>Placebo</entry><entry>PGT121 +</entry><entry>PGT121 +</entry></row><row><entry>Group</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>PGDM1400 +</entry><entry>PGDM1400</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>VRC07-523LS</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0204" num="0200">Subjects in both the test and control groups continue to receive standard ART (e.g. at least two antiretroviral agents, e.g. two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus either non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor) for HIV treatment until 2 days after the administration of the first dose of bNAbs (at week 24).
