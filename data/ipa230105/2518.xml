The polyvinyl alcohol resin having conjugated double bonds in its molecule is typically prepared by heat-treating a polyvinyl alcohol resin or a carbonyl-containing polyvinyl alcohol resin to generate double bonds therein through fatty acid elimination (e.g., acetic acid elimination).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">PTL 1, for example, discloses that a polyvinyl alcohol resin having conjugated double bonds in its molecule is prepared by melt-kneading a carbonyl-containing polyvinyl alcohol resin for heat treatment and extruding the resulting melt into a strand by means of an extruder, and pulverizing the resulting strand. The amount of the conjugated double bonds can be determined based on an absorbance used as an index.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">RELATED ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PTL 1: JP-A-2004-250695</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the polyvinyl alcohol resin production method disclosed in PTL 1 fails to ensure very high productivity and, therefore, requires further improvement to increase the productivity. That is, the polyvinyl alcohol resin is water-soluble, so that the strand of the polyvinyl alcohol resin extruded from the extruder cannot be cooled with water but should be cooled with air. This makes it difficult to improve the productivity. If the extrusion rate of the extruder is increased for the improvement of the productivity, the amount of the polyvinyl alcohol resin is increased and the heat amount of the polyvinyl alcohol resin is also increased. Therefore, an ordinary air-cooling method cannot ensure sufficient cooling, making it difficult to cut or pulverize the extruded strand, sheet, or the like. Further, gelation is liable to occur around an extrusion part of the extruder to thereby deteriorate the long-run property.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides a polyvinyl alcohol resin production method ensuring a higher productivity and an excellent long-run property.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing, the inventors conducted intensive studies and, as a result, found that, where the melt-kneaded polyvinyl alcohol resin is extruded into a sheet but not into the strand and the resulting polyvinyl alcohol resin sheet is cooled, the aforementioned problem can be solved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure has the following features [1] to [4].</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">[1] A method for producing a polyvinyl alcohol resin having an absorbance of not less than 0.2 at 280 nm, the polyvinyl alcohol resin production method including: melt-kneading a polyvinyl alcohol resin material and extruding a resulting melt into a polyvinyl alcohol resin sheet; cooling the polyvinyl alcohol resin sheet; and pulverizing the cooled polyvinyl alcohol resin sheet.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">[2] In the polyvinyl alcohol resin production method according to Item [1], the polyvinyl alcohol resin material is a carbonyl-containing polyvinyl alcohol resin.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">[3] In the polyvinyl alcohol resin production method according to Item [1] or [2], the cooling the polyvinyl alcohol resin sheet is sandwiching the polyvinyl alcohol resin sheet between belt coolers for the cooling.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">[4] In the polyvinyl alcohol resin production method according to any one of Items [1] to [3], the polyvinyl alcohol resin is a polyvinyl alcohol resin to be used as a dispersant for suspension polymerization of a vinyl compound.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present disclosure, the method for producing the polyvinyl alcohol resin having an absorbance of not less than 0.2 at 280 nm includes the steps of melt-kneading the polyvinyl alcohol resin material and extruding the resulting melt into a sheet; cooling the resulting polyvinyl alcohol resin sheet; and pulverizing the cooled polyvinyl alcohol resin sheet. Thus, the polyvinyl alcohol resin is extruded into the sheet but not into the strand, unlike in the conventional art, so that the extrusion rate of the extruder can he increased to thereby improve the productivity. Further, where the resin is extruded into the sheet but not into the strand, the resin is less liable to stagnate around the extrusion part even with an increased extrusion rate, thereby ensuring an excellent long-run property. Since the polyvinyl alcohol resin sheet has a greater surface area, the sheet can be highly efficiently cooled to a temperature that permits the pulverization of the polyvinyl alcohol resin. Therefore, even if the extrusion rate of the extruder is increased and, hence, the extruded polyvinyl alcohol resin has a higher heat amount, the polyvinyl alcohol resin can be efficiently cooled and pulverized. That is, the pulverized polyvinyl alcohol resin can be produced with a higher productivity. The polyvinyl alcohol resin produced by the production method of the present disclosure is useful as a dispersant for suspension polymerization of a vinyl compound, particularly vinyl chloride.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the present disclosure will hereinafter be described in detail by way of example.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The polyvinyl alcohol (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;PVA&#x201d;) resin produced by the production method of the present disclosure is mainly used as a dispersant for suspension polymerization of a vinyl compound, and is a PVA resin produced by introducing conjugated double bonds into the PVA resin material.

The preferred carbonyl-containing PVA resin production method (2) will be described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Examples of the vinyl ester compound to be used for the polymerization include vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl trifluoroacetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl caprate, vinyl laurate, vinyl versatate, vinyl palmitate, and vinyl stearate. Of these, vinyl acetate is preferably used. The vinyl ester compounds described above may be each used alone, or two or more of the vinyl ester compounds may be used in combination.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As a polymerization component other than the vinyl ester compound, an additional monomer polymerizable with the vinyl ester compound may be used in a proportion of not greater than 15 mol %, preferably not greater than 5 mol %, based on the amount of the polymerization component.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Examples of the additional monomer include: unsaturated carboxylic acids and alkyl esters of the unsaturated acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, and monoalkyl maleates; nitriles and amides such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylamide, and methacrylamide; olefin sulfonic acids such as ethylenesulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, and methallylsulfonic acid, and salts of these olefin sulfonic acids; vinyl esters other than vinyl esters of fatty acids, vinyl ethers, vinyl ketones, ethylene, a-olefins, vinyl halides, vinylidene halides, vinyl ethylene carbonate, and 3,4-diacetoxy-1-butene.

Of these, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and n-butyraldehyde are preferred for easier control of the chain transfer of the vinyl ester compound to the carbonyl compound. These chain transfer agents may be each used alone, or two or more of these chain transfer agents may be used in combination.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The amount of the chain transfer agent to be added may be adjusted according to the chain transfer constant of the chain transfer agent and the polymerization degree of the PVA resin to be produced, and is preferably 0.1 to 5 wt. %, more preferably 0.5 to 3 wt. %, based on the weight of the polymerization component. The chain transfer agent may be fed in a batch at the initial stage of the polymerization, or may be fed in the middle of the polymerization. The molecular weight distribution of the PVA resin can be controlled by feeding the chain transfer agent by a desired method.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The method for polymerizing the vinyl ester compound is not particularly limited, but known examples of the polymerization method include solution polymerization, bulk polymerization, emulsion polymerization, and suspension polymerization. In particular, the solution polymerization is preferred.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol is typically used as a solvent for the solution polymerization. In the solution polymerization, the polymerization component may be fed dividedly or in a batch, or may be fed continuously or intermittently by given means.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Exemplary polymerization initiators to be used for the solution polymerization include known radical polymerization initiators such as azobisisobutyronitrile, acetyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, azobisdimethylvaleronitrile, and azobismethoxyvaleronitrile.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The reaction temperature for the polymerization is selected from a range of 40&#xb0; C. to around the boiling point of the solvent.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The polyvinyl ester resin prepared in the aforementioned manner can be saponified by a known method. Typically, the polyvinyl ester resin is dissolved in an alcohol, and then saponified in the presence of an alkali catalyst or an acid catalyst. Examples of the alcohol include methanol, ethanol, butanol, and isopropanol, and solvent mixtures containing methyl acetate and any of these alcohols such as a solvent mixture containing methanol and methyl acetate. The concentration of the polyvinyl ester resin in the alcohol is selected from a range of 20 to 50 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The saponification is preferably carried out in a solvent having a dielectric constant of not higher than 32 for control of a block character to be described later. Examples of the solvent having a dielectric constant of not higher than 32 include methanol (31.2), a solvent mixture (27.1) of methyl acetate/methanol=l/3 (weight ratio), a solvent mixture (21.0) of methyl acetate/methanol=1/1 (weight ratio), a solvent mixture (13.9) of methyl acetate/methanol=3/1 (weight ratio), methyl acetate (7.03), isopropyl acetate (6.3), trichloroethylene (3.42), xylene (2.37), toluene (2.38), benzene (2.28), and acetone (21.4).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Of these, methanol is preferably used. The parenthesized numerals represent the dielectric constants of the respective solvents.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Usable examples of the alkali catalyst include hydroxides and alcoholates of alkali metals such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium methylate, sodium ethylate, and potassium methylate.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Usable examples of the acid catalyst include aqueous solutions of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, and organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The amount of the alkali catalyst or the acid catalyst to be used is preferably 1 to 100 mmol equivalent, more preferably 1 to 40 mmol equivalent, still more preferably 1 to 20 mmol equivalent, based on 1 mol of the vinyl ester compound. If the use amount of the alkali catalyst or the acid catalyst is excessively small, it tends to be difficult to increase the saponification degree to a desired saponification degree. If the use amount of the alkali catalyst or the acid catalyst is excessively great, the saponification degree tends to be much higher than the desired saponification degree.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The temperature for the saponification is not particularly limited, but is preferably 10&#xb0; C. to 70&#xb0; C., more preferably 20&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Exemplary saponification methods include a continuous saponification method to be performed on a carrier belt machine, and a batch saponification method. In the continuous saponification method, the saponification reaction is typically allowed to proceed for about 15 to about 20 minutes. In the batch saponification method, the saponification reaction is typically allowed to proceed for 2 to 3 hours.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The carbonyl-containing PVA resin prepared in the aforementioned manner preferably has a saponification degree of 65 to 98 mol %, more preferably 68 to 85 mol still more preferably 68 to 82 mol %. If the saponification degree is excessively low, the water dispersibility tends to be deteriorated. If the saponification degree is excessively high, the PVA resin to be used as a dispersant tends to have a reduced surface activity, thereby deteriorating the dispersibility of the vinyl compound. Therefore, blocks are liable to be generated during the suspension polymerization.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The carbonyl-containing PVA resin preferably has an average polymerization degree of 200 to 3,000, more preferably 400 to 1,200. If the average polymerization degree is excessively low, agglomeration is liable to occur with the protective colloid property excessively lowered in the suspension polymerization of the vinyl compound. If the average polymerization degree is excessively high, the polyvinyl resin prepared by the suspension polymerization tends to have a reduced plasticizer absorbability.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The carbonyl-containing PVA resin preferably has a carbonyl content of not less than 0.05 mol more preferably not less than 0.1 mol %, and preferably not greater than 0.5 mol %. If the carbonyl content is excessively low, the introduction of the conjugated double bonds tends to be insufficient in the melt-kneading to be described later, so that the PVA resin as the dispersant has a lower protective colloid property and the use amount of the dispersant is increased.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the melt-kneading to be described later, some of 1,2-glycol bonds contained in the carbonyl-containing PVA resin are cut, and carbonyl groups are further introduced into the carbonyl-containing PVA resin. Accordingly, the carbonyl-containing PVA resin preferably has a 1,2-glycol bond content of 1.0 to 3.5 mol %. The expression &#x201c;some of 1,2-glycol bonds&#x201d; herein means not greater than 15% of the total amount of the 1,2-glycol bonds contained in the carbonyl-containing PVA resin. The 1,2-glycol bond content can be controlled by properly selecting the polymerization temperature.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the carbonyl-containing PVA resin preferably contains a salt or hydroxide of a monovalent to trivalent metal in order to promote the elimination of fatty acid such as acetic acid from residual fatty acid groups adjacent to the carbonyl groups in the molecule during the melt-kneading to be described later.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Examples of the monovalent to trivalent metals include alkali metals and alkali earth metals such as sodium, magnesium, calcium, and zinc, and aluminum. Of these, at least one selected from the group consisting of sodium, magnesium, and calcium is preferred, and calcium and magnesium are particularly preferred, because the fatty acid can be efficiently eliminated from the residual fatty acid groups adjacent to the carbonyl groups in the molecule.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The salt of the monovalent to trivalent metal is preferably an aliphatic carboxylic acid salt having a carbon number of not greater than 3, because such a salt is soluble or swellable in water and/or an alcohol such as methanol to ensure easier industrial handling. Examples of the aliphatic carboxylic acid salt having a carbon number of not greater than 3 include acetic acid salts and propionic acid salts.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Specific examples of the salt and the hydroxide of the monovalent to trivalent metal include aluminum hydroxide, alkali metal salts and alkali earth metal salts such as sodium acetate, magnesium acetate, calcium acetate, calcium propionate, and zinc acetate. These may be each used alone, or two or more of these may be used in combination. Of these, magnesium acetate tetrahydrate and calcium acetate are preferred because they are soluble in water and/or methanol and ensure easier industrial handling. Particularly, magnesium acetate tetrahydrate is preferred.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The proportion of the salt or the hydroxide of the monovalent to trivalent metal is preferably 0.1 to 3 mol more preferably 0.2 to 2 mol %, still more preferably 0.2 to 1.5 mol %, based on the amount of the carbonyl-containing PVA resin. If the proportion of the salt or the hydroxide of the monovalent to trivalent metal is excessively small, the conjugated double bond generating efficiency tends to be reduced in the melt-kneading. If the proportion of the salt or the hydroxide of the monovalent to trivalent metal is excessively great, the carbonyl-containing PVA resin is liable to be decomposed in the melt-kneading.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The method for adding the salt or the hydroxide of the monovalent to trivalent metal to the carbonyl-containing PVA resin is not particularly limited. For example, the salt or the hydroxide may be added directly to a paste of the unsaponified polyvinyl ester resin, a slurry resulting from the saponification, or pellets or powder of the carbonyl-containing PVA resin. Preferably, the salt or the hydroxide is added to the slurry resulting from the saponification. Where the salt or the hydroxide of the monovalent to trivalent metal is added to the slurry resulting from the saponification, a solution or a dispersion prepared by dissolving or dispersing 3 to 15 wt. % of the salt or the hydroxide in water or an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or propanol may be added to the slurry.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, the carbonyl-containing PVA resin to be used in the production method of the present disclosure can be prepared. The form of the carbonyl-containing PVA resin is not particularly limited, but is preferably powdery from the viewpoint of workability.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The carbonyl-containing PVA resin may be used alone, or a blend of two or more such carbonyl-containing PVA resins having different properties may be use. By using the blend of the two or more carbonyl-containing PVA resins, the viscosity, the polymerization degree, the saponification degree, and the molecular weight distribution can be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">&#x3c;PVA Resin Production Method&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, a method for producing the polyvinyl alcohol resin having an absorbance of not less than 0.2 at 280 nm according to the present disclosure will be described.

The carbonyl-containing PVA resin is melted to be heat-treated with the use of the extruder. As a result, the randomness of the distribution of the fatty acid vinyl ester unit is improved, whereby a foaming suppressing effect is improved when the PVA resin is used as the dispersant.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0064">The temperature for the melt-kneading is typically 175&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C., preferably 200&#xb0; C. to 240&#xb0; C. If the melt-kneading temperature is excessively low, the conjugated double bond introducing efficiency tends to be reduced. If the melt-kneading temperature is excessively high, the carbonyl-containing EVA resin is liable to be decomposed, resulting in gelation. Further, scorch and other foreign matter tend to be incorporated in the resulting PVA resin.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0065">The retention period (melt-kneading period) in the extruder is preferably 1 to 15 minutes, more preferably 2 to 10 minutes. If the melt-kneading period is excessively short, the conjugated double bond introducing efficiency tends to be reduced. If the melt-kneading period is excessively long, scorch and other foreign matter tend to be incorporated in the resulting PVA resin.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0066">Usable as the extruder are a single-screw extruder and a twin-screw extruder, of which the twin-screw extruder is preferably used.

Conventionally, the melt-kneaded PVA resin is extruded into a strand and, therefore, the productivity is lower. Further, if the extrusion rate for the extrusion into the strand is increased for improvement of the productivity, gelation is liable to occur around an extrusion part of the extruder, thereby deteriorating the long-run property. In the production method of the present disclosure, on the other hand, the melt resin sheet which is produced by extruding the melt-kneaded EVA resin into the sheet and, hence, has a greater surface area can be efficiently cooled.

If the thickness is excessively great, a longer period of time tends to be required for the cooling, thereby reducing the productivity.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0069">The width of the PVA resin sheet is not particularly limited, but is typically 0.1 to 2.0 m, preferably 0.15 to 1.0 m.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0070">[Step [2]]</p><p id="p-0069" num="0071">Next, the PVA resin sheet produced in the aforementioned manner is cooled.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0072">Exemplary methods for cooling the PVA resin sheet include a belt cooler method, an air-cooling method, and a spot cooler method. These may be each used alone, or two or more of these may he used in combination. Particularly, a belt cooler is preferably used from the viewpoint of the cooling efficiency.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0073">The belt cooler is a device configured so that the PVA resin sheet is fed onto a metal belt such as steel belt (e.g., a stainless steel belt) and is cooled by spouting spray water from below the belt. From the viewpoint of the cooling efficiency, the PVA resin sheet is preferably sandwiched between cooling-controlled belt coolers and cooled from opposite sides thereof. That is, the PVA resin sheet having a greater surface area is sandwiched between the cooling-controlled belt coolers from a front side and a back side thereof, whereby the PVA resin having a higher heat amount can be more efficiently cooled to a temperature that permits pulverization.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0074">The temperature of the cooled PVA resin sheet is typically not greater than 40&#xb0; C., preferably not greater than 30&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0075">[Step 3]</p><p id="p-0074" num="0076">Next, the cooled PVA resin sheet is pulverized.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">The method for pulverizing the PVA resin sheet is not particularly limited. The PVA resin sheet can be pulverized by a known method. For efficient pulverization, a two-stage pulverization method is preferred.

An impact pulverizer is particularly preferred.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0079">A typical pulverization method is, for example, such that the PVA resin is coarsely pulverized by a hammer crusher, and then the coarsely pulverized PVA resin is finely pulverized by a Makino-type pulverizer.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0080">The pulverized PVA resin typically has an average particle diameter of 250 to 1,500 &#x3bc;m, preferably 350 to 1,000 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0081">The PVA resin produced by the production method of the present disclosure is useful as the dispersant (main dispersant) for the suspension polymerization of the vinyl compound, particularly vinyl chloride.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0082">The EVA resin thus produced has an absorbance of not less than 0.2, preferably not less than 0.3, more preferably not less than 0.4, as observed at 280 nm in ultraviolet absorption spectrum measured with the use of a 0.1 wt. % aqueous solution thereof. If a PVA resin having an excessively low absorbance is used as the dispersant for the suspension polymerization of the vinyl compound, the resulting polymer tends to have a broader particle distribution with a lower polymerization stability, and coarse particles tend to occur. The upper limit of the absorbance is typically 0.7.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">The absorption observed at 280 nm in the ultraviolet absorption spectrum is attributable to a &#x2014;CO&#x2014;(CH&#x2550;CH)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; structure in the PVA resin. Therefore, if the amount of the conjugated double bonds in the EVA resin is increased, the absorbance is correspondingly increased.

If the absorbance ratio is excessively small, the PVA resin as the dispersant tends to have a lower protective colloid property, thereby reducing the suspension polymerization stability. If the absorbance ratio is excessively great, an aqueous solution of the EVA resin is more liable to be foamed, resulting in occurrence of scale during the suspension polymerization.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">The block character of the fatty acid ester groups remaining in the EVA resin is not less than 0.5, preferably not less than 0.55.
