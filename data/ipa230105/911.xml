Each tumor's cellular composition, as well as the interplay between these components, may exert critical roles in cancer development (2). However, the specific components, their salient biological functions, and the means by which they collectively define tumor behavior remain incompletely characterized.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Tumor cellular diversity poses both challenges and opportunities for cancer therapy. This is most clearly demonstrated by the remarkable but varied clinical efficacy achieved in malignant melanoma with targeted therapies and immunotherapies. First, immune checkpoint inhibitors produce substantial clinical responses in some patients with metastatic melanomas (3-7); however, the genomic and molecular determinants of response to these agents remain poorly understood. Although tumor neoantigens and PD-L1 expression clearly contribute (8-10), it is likely that other factors from subsets of malignant cells, the microenvironment, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) also play essential roles (11). Second, melanomas that harbor the BRAFV600E mutation are commonly treated with RAF/MEK-inhibition prior to or following immune checkpoint inhibition. Although this regimen improves survival, virtually all patients eventually develop resistance to these drugs (12,13). Unfortunately, no targeted therapy currently exists for patients whose tumors lack BRAF mutations including NRAS mutant tumors, those with inactivating NF1 mutations, or rarer events (e.g., RAF fusions). Collectively, these factors highlight the need for a deeper understanding of melanoma composition and its impact on clinical course.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The next wave of therapeutic advances in cancer will likely be accelerated by emerging technologies that systematically assess the malignant, microenvironmental, and immunologic states most likely to inform treatment response and resistance. An ideal approach would assess salient cellular heterogeneity by quantifying variation in oncogenic signaling pathways, drug-resistant tumor cell subsets, and the spectrum of immune, stromal and other cell states that may inform immunotherapy response. Toward this end, emerging single-cell genomic approaches enable detailed evaluation of genetic and transcriptional features present in 100s-1000s of individual cells per tumor (14-16). In principle, this approach may provide a comprehensive means to identify all major cellular components simultaneously, determine their individual genomic and molecular states (15), and ascertain which of these features may predict or explain clinical responses to anticancer agents.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Intra-tumoral heterogeneity contributes to therapy failure and disease progression in cancer. Tumor cells vary in proliferation, sternness, invasion, apoptosis, chemoresistance and metabolism (72). Various factors may contribute to this heterogeneity. On the one hand, in the genetic model of cancer, distinct tumor subclones are generated by branched genetic evolution of cancer cells; on the other hand, it is also becoming increasingly clear that certain cancers display diversity due to features of normal tissue organization. From this perspective, non-genetic determinants, related to developmental pathways and epigenetic programs, such as those associated with the self-renewal of tissue stem cells and their differentiation into specialized cell types, contribute to tumor functional heterogeneity (73,74). In particular, in a hierarchical developmental model of cancer, cancer stem cells (CSC) have the unique capacity to self-renew and to generate non-tumorigenic differentiated cancer cells. This model is still controversial, but&#x2014;if correct&#x2014;has important practical implications for patient management (75,76). Pioneering studies in leukemias have indeed demonstrated that targeting stem cell programs or triggering cellular differentiation can override genetic alterations and yield clinical benefit (72,77).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Relating the genetic and non-genetic models of cancer heterogeneity, especially in solid human tumors, has been limited due to technical challenges. Analysis of human tumor genomes has shed light on the genetic model, but is typically performed in bulk and does not inform us on the concomitant functional states of cancer cells. Conversely, various markers have been used to isolate candidate CSCs across different human malignancies, and to demonstrate their capacity to propagate tumors in mouse xenograft experiments (72, 78-80). For example, in the field of human gliomas, candidate CSCs have been isolated in high-grade (WHO grades III-IV) lesions, using either combinations of cell surface markers such as CD133, SSEA-1, A2B5, CD44 and &#x3b1;-6 integrin or by in vitro selection and expansion of gliomaspheres in serum-free conditions (75, 76, 78, 80-83). However, these functional approaches have generated controversy, as they require in vitro or in vivo selection in animal models with results dependent on xenogeneic environments that are very different from the native human tumor milieu. In addition, these methods do not interrogate the relative contribution of genetic mutations to the observed phenotypes (which can limit reproducibility) and do not allow an unbiased analysis of cellular states in situ in human patients (72). It also remains largely unknown if candidate CSC-like cells described in human high-grade tumors are aberrantly generated during glioma progression by dedifferentiation of mature glial cells or if gliomas contain CSC-like cells early in their development&#x2014;as grade II lesions&#x2014;a question central for our understanding of the initial steps of gliomagenesis (84).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Tumor fitness, evolution and resistance to therapy are governed by genetic selection of cancer cells, by non-genetic programs related to developmental pathways and by influences of the tumor microenvironment (TME) (72). In recent years, seminal studies such as those of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have charted the genetic landscape and the bulk expression states of thousands of tumors, identifying novel driver mutations and defining tumor transcriptional subtypes (112, 125). While the genetic state of tumors could be studied with high precision, due to the ability to distinguish malignant from germline genetic variation, bulk transcriptional profiles provided only limited insight into non-genetic determinants of cancer programs, TME influences and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis can help address those challenges (15, 85, 86, 126), but financial and logistic considerations, including the time required to accrue large cohorts of fresh tumor specimens, especially in rare entities, limit the ability to repeat a TCGA like effort at single-cell resolution. Thus, it is critical to cancer biology to develop a framework that allows the unbiased analysis of cellular programs at the single-cell level and across different genetic clones in human tumors, in situ, and at each stage of clinical progression, especially early in their development.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides novel methods of identifying gene expression profiles representative of malignant, microenvironmental, or immunologic states of tumors and tissues, and of cells and cell types which they comprise. The invention further provides methods of diagnosing, prognosing and/or staging of tumors, tissues and cells. The invention also provides compositions and methods of modulating expression of genes and gene networks of tumors, tissues and cells, as well as methods of identifying, designing and selecting appropriate treatment regimens.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Citation or identification of any document in this application is not an admission that such document is available as prior art to the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention relates to gene expression signatures and networks of tumors and tissues, as well as multicellular ecosystems of tumors and tissues and the cells and cell type which they comprise. Tumors are multicellular assemblies that encompass many distinct genotypic and phenotypic states. The invention provides methods of characterizing components, functions and interactions of tumors and tissues and the cells which they comprise. Single-cell RNA-seq was applied to thousands of malignant and non-malignant cells derived from melanomas, gliomas, head and neck cancer, brain metastases of breast cancer, and tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to examine tumor ecosystems.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention provides signature genes, gene products, and expression profiles of signature genes, gene networks, and gene products of tumors and component cells. The cancer may include, without limitation, liquid tumors such as leukemia (e.g., acute leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute myelomonocytic leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, acute erythroleukemia, chronic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia), polycythemia vera, lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's disease), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, heavy chain disease, and solid tumors such as sarcomas and carcinomas (e.g., fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, nile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilm's tumor, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, testicular cancer, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodenroglioma, schwannoma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma). Lymphoproliferative disorders are also considered to be proliferative diseases. In one embodiment, the patient is suffering from melanoma. The signature genes, gene products, and expression profiles are useful to identify components of tumors and tissues and states of such components, such as, without limitation, neoplastic cells, malignant cells, stem cells, immune cells, and malignant, microenvironmental, or immunologic states of such component cells.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Using single cell analysis in cancers including melanoma, glioma, brain metastases of breast cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), as well as analyzing tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), applicants have determined novel gene signature patterns and therapeutic targets.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Human tumor subclasses differ in genetic mutations, in non-genetic programs reflecting the cell-of-origin and associated pathways, and in the composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME). While cancer genomic studies such as those of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified genetic mutations that distinguish tumor subclasses, they provided only limited insight into developmental lineages and TME composition.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Using human oligodendrogliomas as a model, the inventors have profiled single cells from six patient tumors by RNA-seq and reconstructed their transcriptional architecture and related it to genetic mutations. It was surprisingly found that most cancer cells are differentiated along two specialized glial programs, while a rare subpopulation of cells is undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell/progenitor expression program. Surprisingly, cellular proliferation was highly enriched in this rare subpopulation, consistent with a model where a cancer stem cell/progenitor compartment is primarily responsible for fueling growth of oligodendrogliomas in humans. Analysis of sub-clonal genetic events shows that distinct clones within tumors span a similar cellular hierarchy, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is primarily dictated by non-genetic developmental programs. These results provide unprecedented insight into the cellular composition of brain tumors at single-cell resolution and may help harmonize the cancer stem cell and the genetic models of cancer, with critical implications for disease management.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Moreover, Applicants also combined 9,879 single-cell RNA-seq profiles from ten IDH-mutant astrocytomas (IDH-A) with 4,347 single-cell profiles in the six IDH-mutant oligodendrogliomas (IDH-O) and 165 TCGA bulk RNA profiles to decouple genetic, epigenetic and TME effects of tumor composition and function across IDH-mutant gliomas. Differences in bulk profiles between IDH-A and IDH-O can be primarily explained by distinct TME composition and by signature genetic events, but not by distinct influences of glial lineages in the malignant cells of the two tumor types. Conversely, both tumor types share similar developmental hierarchies and lineages of glial differentiation, which differ from those of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Furthermore, as tumor grade increases, Applicants find both enhanced proliferation of malignant cells, a larger pool of undifferentiated gliomas cells and an increase in macrophage over microglia programs in the TME. These findings redefine the cellular composition of human IDH-mutant gliomas and outlines a general framework to dissect the differences between human tumor subclasses.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one aspect, the invention relates to a method of treating glioma, comprising administering to a subject having glioma a therapeutically effective amount of an agent capable of reducing the expression or inhibiting the activity of one or more stem cell or progenitor cell signature genes or polypeptides; or capable of targeting or binding to one or more cell surface exposed stem cell or progenitor cell signature polypeptides.

Expression differences between IDH-A and IDH-O are governed by the tumor microenvironment and genetics. (A) Single cell RNA-seq of 10 IDH-A tumors. Freshly-resected tumors were dissociated to single cell suspension, FACS-sorted and profiled by SmartSeq2 in 96-well plates. (B) Differential expression as defined by analysis of bulk TCGA tumors is only partially recapitulated in analysis of single cells. Shown are differentially expressed genes (rows), which are higher in either IDH-A (top) or IDH-A (bottom) bulk tumors. Relative expression is shown across all bulk tumors (left) or single malignant cells (middle). The corresponding differential expression between IDH-A and IDH-O after averaging all bulk tumors or all single cells is shown on the right. (C-E) TME contribution to differential expression. (C) Microglia/macrophage-specific genes (left column) and neuron-specific genes (right column) are enriched in genes with higher expression in IDH-A and IDH-O, respectively. (D) Distribution of expression differences between bulk IDH-A and IDH-O samples for microglia/macrophage-specific genes (black) and neuron-specific genes (grey). (E) Microglia/macrophage scores (X-axis) and neuron scores (Y-axis) (SOM), for bulk IDH-O (blue) and IDH-A (purple) tumors. (F) Most expression differences between IDH-A and IDH-O malignant cells are accounted for by genetic differences. Left: The assignment of differentially expressed genes (columns) (IDH-A vs. IDH-O) by both bulk and single cell analysis into four categories (top to bottom rows, SOM): (i) genes residing in chromosome arms 1p or 19q (which are co-deleted only in IDH-O), (ii) genes activated and (iii) genes repressed by CIC (for which one copy is lost in al IDH-O and a second copy is mutated in most IDH-O), and (iv) P53 target genes. Right: Observed and expected percentage of IDH-A specific genes and IDH-O specific genes which may be accounted by genetics; observed percentage was defined by inclusion in the first two and last two gene-sets for IDH-A and IDH-O specific genes, respectively. Expected percentage was defined by inclusion in the same gene-sets but across all genes rather than only the IDH-A and IDH-O specific genes.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref>. Differentiation programs are shared among IDH-A and IDH-O and account for most differences not explained by genetics. (A) Glia lineages do not distinguish IDH-A from IDH-O. Shown are the average expression levels of oligodendrocytic-specific (light blue) and astrocytic-specific (black) genes across all IDH-A (Y axis) and IDH-O (X axis) malignant cells. Line indicates equal expression in IDH-A and IDH-O. (B) Glia lineages distinguish cells within IDH-A. Shown are the correlations of oligodendrocytic-specific (light blue) and astrocyticspecific (black) genes with PC1 (X axis) and PC2 (Y axis) from a PCA of all IDH-A malignant cells. Line indicates equal expression in IDH-A and IDH-O. Selected genes are marked. (C) Classification of malignant cells (columns) from IDH-A (left panel) and IDH-O (right panel), based on the relative expression of the oligodendrocytic and astrocytic expression programs. Cells are ordered by the relative expression of the two programs. Top: significance of differential expression (Y axis, &#x2212; log 10(P-value of a t-test)) between oligodendrocytic and astrocytic genes. Cells were sorted by significance from the most oligodendrocytic-like to the most astrocytic-like cells; dashed lines indicate a significance threshold of P&#x3c;0.01. Bottom: Relative expression of 50 oligodendrocytic and 50 astrocytic genes for cells sorted by significance as in the top panel. (D) Lower differential expression between IDH-A and IDH-O among undifferentiated cells. For each malignant in IDH-A (purple) and IDH-O (blue), Applicants present its differentiation scores (Xaxis), defined as the maximum between the average expression of oligodendrocytic and astrocytic genes, vs. the average expression of IDH-A (left) or IDH-O specific (right) genes (Y axis), based on combined bulk and single cell analysis, but after excluding genes accounted by genetics. Lines indicate the corresponding local weighted smoothing regression (LOWESS), demonstrate the decrease in differences between IDH-A and IDH-O programs in cells with low glial differentiation scores.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref>. Undifferentiated cells in IDH-A and IDH-O are associated with cell cycle and a putative sternness program. (A) Inverse relation between cell cycle and cell differentiation. Shown is the percentage of cycling cells (Y axis) in any sliding window of 200 cells ranked by differentiation scores (X axis) for either IDH-A (purple) or IDH-O (blue) malignant cells. (B, C) Shared stemness program. (B) Shown are the Pearson correlation coefficients (color bar) between the expression profiles of genes (rows, columns) across undifferentiated IDH-A and IDH-O cells, for the ninety genes that were preferentially expressed in undifferentiated cells. Genes are ordered by their correlation with the highest-scoring cluster in each analysis (SOM). (C) Pearson correlations of the ninety genes in (B) with the highest-scoring clusters in (B) in IDH-A (X-axis) and IDH-O (Y-axis). The top consistent genes are marked. (D) In situ RNA hybridization (ISH) for the astrocytic markers APOE (apolipoprotein E, blue) and oligodendrocytic marker APOD (apolipoprotein D, red) shows expression of these lineage markers in distinct cells in IDH-A. APOE (blue) and the proliferation marker Ki67 (red, arrow) are mutually exclusive. The stem/progenitor markers SOX4 (SRY (sex determining region Y)&#x2014; box4, blue) and Ki67 (red) are co-expressed in the same cells (arrow).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>H</figref>. Diversity and frequency of microglia and macrophages across IDH-mutant glioma. (A) Distinct microglia and macrophage programs. Shown are the expression levels of mouse orthologs of genes with high (red) and low (blue) scores in PC1 of a PCA across all microglia and macrophages in mice microglia (19) (Y-axis) and macrophages (X-axis; maximal expression across multiple macrophage types). (B,C) Relative expression of microglia- and macrophage-specific genes defines a spectrum of cellular states. (B) Top: distribution of scores defined by the average expression of microglia (PC1 high) vs. macrophage (PC1 low) genes (SOM). Bottom: differential expression of 10 representative genes (4 microglia- and 6 macrophage-specific) among all cells ranked by the scores at top. (C) For each tumor, shown is the fraction (color code) of cells in each bin of scores, as defined in (B, top). Macrophages from melanoma (5) are included for reference (top row). Tumor grades are shown on the right. (D, E) Endothelial expression program correlates with macrophage, but not with microglia, expression signatures across bulk TCGA samples. (D) Average endothelial scores (X-axis) vs. immune scores (Y-axis: macrophage, left; microglia, right) across IDH-A (purple filling) and IDH-O (blue filling) tumors partitioned by grade (gray, grade II; black, grade III; red, grade IV). Arrows indicate grade-specific changes that are associated with increased expression of the endothelial program. (E) Correlation between endothelial scores and immune scores (macrophage or microglia) across all IDH-A (purple) or IDH-O (blue) bulk TCGA tumors. (F,G) Factors associated with immune infiltration. (F) Top: correlation of the expression of each gene (column) with microglia or macrophage (row) scores across IDH-A (top two rows) and across IDH-O (bottom two rows) bulk tumors, for the 24 genes that are not expressed by microglia/macrophages but correlate significantly (P&#x3c;0.05) with both microglia and macrophage scores.

Shown are Pearson correlation coefficients for the relative expression profiles of all analyzed genes, among all IDH-A single cells. Cells were ordered first based on assignment to three clusters as identified by hierarchical clustering; within each cluster cells were further ordered based on their tumor of origin, as indicated at the bottom panel, and within each sub-cluster that reflects a given tumor the cells were ordered based on hierarchical clustering. The three clusters were annotated as oligodendrocytes, microglia/macrophages, and malignant based on the top differentially expressed genes (Methods). (B-C) classification by CNVs. Applicants estimated CNVs based on the relative expression of genes in a sliding window of 100 genomically contiguous genes (Methods). (B) Shown are the estimated CNV values of all cells (rows) across all genomic positions (columns). Cells were sorted as in (A), demonstrating that the two clusters Applicants inferred as non-malignant have consistent CNV patterns despite harboring cells from different tumors, while the cells inferred as malignant have tumor-specific CNV patterns as expected for malignant cells. (C) Comparison of CNVs inferred from gene expression and averaged over cells from each tumor (RNA), to those defined from bulk whole-exome sequencing (WES) for three tumors. The consistency between CNV estimates was high in all three cases (Pearson R&#x3e;0.6, P&#x3c;10<sup>&#x2212;16 </sup>in all cases); the remaining inconsistencies could reflect spatial differences between the tumor region used for single cell analysis and the one used for WES, as well as quantitative differences due to the limited sensitivities and caveats of both approaches.

Consistency between expression and genetic analysis, and integrated cell classification. (A) Each cell was scored for the overall signal of CNVs (X-axis) and for the correlation between the CNV pattern of that cell and the average CNV pattern of all malignant cells from the same tumor (when malignant cells were determined based on gene expression clustering) (Y-axis). Cells are colored based on their assignment to the non-malignant expression clusters (blue and purple for microglia and oligodendrocytes, as well as 11 cells which Applicants identified as expressing a T-cell signature and are shown in green), while all other cells (malignant and unresolved cells) are colored in red. (B) Integrated expression and CNV classification. Shown are the expression and CNV scores for all cells which were retained for final analysis and classified as non-malignant (top) and malignant (bottom). Note that only three cells were excluded due to discordant classification by expression and CNV analysis, and 44 more cells were excluded due to unresolved assignment by both methods. (C-F) tSNE analysis of all cells profiled in this work, as well as fetal NPCs profiled recently (1), in which cells are grouped based on global similarity in gene expression (2). The same tSNE analysis is shown in each panel, but cells are colored by different criteria, demonstrating expression or genetic features. (C) Colors represent the tumor-of-origin of each cell, demonstrating that tumors primarily form distinct clusters, except for two main clusters that include cells from many tumors and correspond to immune cells (top left cluster) and oligodendrocytes (bottom left cluster) as demonstrated in (D). (D) Colors correspond to high expression levels (32-fold above average) of signatures specific to four cell types; the remaining cells that do not pass the threshold for any of the signatures are shown in red, and primarily correspond to cancer cells. (E) Colors represent cell classification as malignant based on CNV analysis: cells passing both thresholds in (A) are shown in red and all others are shown in black. (F) Cells in which an IDH1 mutation (p.R132C/H mutation) is identified in scRNA-seq reads are colored in red and all others are colored in black; right panel: Shown are the percentages of cells classified as malignant (left) and non-malignant (right) in which Applicants observed at least one read covering the site of the mutation and identified either a mutant allele (shown in red), a wild-type allele (blue), or both (purple). The &#x2dc;100-fold enrichment of mutant IDH reads in cells classified as malignant (P&#x3c;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>, hypergeometric test) further supports our classification, but these results also highlight the limited sensitivity of scRNA-seq mutation calling. This limitation is also observed for the wild-type allele, which is detected in a comparable fraction of cells as the mutant allele, indicating that scRNA-seq reads cover the exact site of the IDH1 mutation in &#x3c;40% of the cells. Moreover, while the IDH mutation is heterozygote Applicants detect both the wild-type and the mutant alleles only in &#x2dc;5% of the malignant cells (and in none of the non-malignant cells), again reflecting the limited sensitivity and indicating that in most cells either none or one of the alleles is detected due to insufficient coverage of the mutation site (137).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>. The tumor microenvironment contributes to bulk differences between IDH-A and IDH-O. (A) Analysis of the fraction of expression differences between IDH-A and IDH-O, identified in bulk analysis, which are recapitulated in single cell analysis, and those that may be accounted by the tumor-microenvironment (TME). The fraction of bulk differences recapitulated in single cell analysis depends on the threshold for defining expression differences in single cell analysis, while the fraction of remaining bulk differences that may be accounted by TME (i.e. preferential IDH-A expression of immune-specific genes and preferential IDH-O expression of neuron-specific genes) depends on the thresholds to assign genes as immune-specific and neuron-specific. Applicants thus examined these fractions with multiple fold-change thresholds for defining differential expression in single cell analysis, and for two stringencies of defining genes as cell type specific (strict and lenient, see Methods). For each fold-change threshold, the red line indicates the fraction of bulk differences recapitulated in single cell analysis above that threshold, while the dashed red line indicates the expected fraction based on the overall frequency of genes with IDH-A vs. IDH-O differences above that threshold in single cell analysis. The fraction of remaining differences which may be accounted by TME is shown for each fold-change threshold, based on the strict TME-specific genes definition (black line) and the lenient TME-specific gene definition (grey line); dashed black and grey lines indicate the expected fractions based on the overall number of immune-specific and neuron-specific genes. While the results are threshold dependent, in all cases a considerable fraction of bulk differences are not recapitulated by single cell analysis (38-64%) and, of those, most differences may be accounted by TME (53-75%).

Shown are IDH-A (purple) and IDH-O (blue) bulk samples separated by grade (grade II, top panel; grade III; bottom panel).

Multiple subclonal mutations each span the cellular hierarchy. Each panel shows lineage (X axis) and sternness (Y axis) scores of cells in which Applicants ascertained by single cell RNA-seq a mutant (red), a wild-type (blue) or none (black) of the alleles. Included are mutations for which at least three cells were identified as mutants and that were identified by WES as subclonal (fraction&#x3c;60%). The gene names, tumor name, ABSOLUTE-derived fraction of mutant cells (E, for Expected fraction) and the fraction of cells detected as mutant by RNA-seq (0, for Observed) are also indicated within each panel. Applicants note that identification of a wild-type allele (blue) does not imply a wild-type cell because mutations may be heterozygous and thus cells could contain both alleles while only one may be detected by single cell RNA-seq. The observed fraction of mutations (O) is much lower than expected (E) due to limited coverage of the single cell RNA-seq data as well as due to heterozygosity. The vast majority of mutations (20 of 22) are distributed across the hierarchy and span multiple compartments. Two remaining mutations (H2AFV and EIF2AK2) appear more restricted to the &#x201c;undifferentiated&#x201d; region (intermediate lineage and stemness scores), which could reflect our limited detection rate of mutant cells and/or a bias of the mutation to a particular region. To test the significance of potential biases in the distribution of mutations Applicants calculated, for each mutation, a Euclidean distance among all pairs of mutant cells (based on their lineage and stemness scores), and compared the average pairwise distances among mutant cells to that among randomly selected subsets of the same number of cells. None of the mutations were significant with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1, although this could reflect our limited statistical power and Applicants cannot exclude a potential bias. Applicants note, however, that even if a subset of mutations are biased in their distribution (as Applicants show for clone 1 in MGH36, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>,B), the wide distribution of expression states for most mutations, as well as for the CNV clones (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>,B) and for the LOH-clones (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>), is highly inconsistent with a model in which the hierarchy is driven by genetics, which would predict that all low-frequency subclones would be restricted to regions of the hierarchy, as Applicants discuss in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>. The apparent bias of mutant cells to the OC lineage over the AC lineage (i.e. positive vs. negative lineage scores) reflects the lower frequencies of AC-like cells compared to OC-like cells in MGH53 and MGH54 (MGH53: 17% AC vs. 39% OC; MGH54: 23% AC vs. 45% OC); this bias is also observed for the detection of wild-type alleles (blue) further demonstrating that there is no bias against mutation detection in the AC lineage.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b>A-<b>39</b>B</figref>. Loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) event in MGH54 reveals two clones that span the cellular hierarchy. (A) Chromosome 18 LOH in MGH54. Allelic fraction analysis of MGH54 SNPs from WES shows an imbalance (red and blue dots) in the frequency of alternative alleles in chromosome 1p, 19q, as well as chromosome 18, despite the normal copy number at this chromosome (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>). This is consistent with an LOH event in which presumably one copy of chromosome 18 was deleted, and the other copy amplified. The weaker imbalance compared to chromosomes 1p and 19q further indicates that this is a subclonal event. (B) Each of two clones defined by Chr. 18 LOH status spans the full hierarchy. Shown are the lineage (X axis) and stemness (Y axis) scores for each cell from MGH54 classified as pre-LOH (red), post-LOH (blue) and unresolved (black) based on RNA-seq reads that map to SNPs in the minor (i.e. deleted) chromosome. Both the pre- and post-LOH clones span the different tumor subpopulations. Pre-LOH cells were defined as all cells with reads that map to minor alleles in chromosome 18; post-LOH cells were defined as all cells with reads that map to at least five different major alleles, but no reads that map to minor alleles in chromosome 18; all other cells were defined as unresolved.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>E</figref>. The observed distribution of mutations is highly inconsistent with a model of genetically-driven hierarchy. (A) Phylogenetic tree for a hypothetical tumor, where each circle corresponds to a cell. Six subclonal mutations are shown (black arrows), each defining a genetic subclone. (B) Under a genetically-driven hierarchy, specific subclones would correspond to subpopulations with distinct expression states, such that all cells in those subclones map into a specific expression state. Shown are schemes of the cellular hierarchy in oligondroglioma (i.e. the two lower branches reflect the AC-like and OC-like lineages and the top part reflect stem-like cells), with cells from a given subclone marked in red and confined to specific transcriptional states. Importantly, the restriction of a subclone to a specific expression state holds true not only for the subclones which are defined by the mutation that is causal for an expression state but also for any other subclone that is contained within it. For example, assuming that subclones 1 and 4 reflect the mutations that are causal for the OC-like and AC-like expression states, subclones 2 and 5 would also be confined to either the OC-like or the AC-like states. This is especially true for small subclones (i.e., mutations with a low clonal fraction), as these should be confined to a small branch in the phylogenetic tree that is unlikely to cover multiple subpopulations. Small subclones that nevertheless cover all three subpopulations are especially unlikely by this model, although these are observed in the data (e.g. ZEB2, FRG1, FTH1 and EEF1B2 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>C</figref> all have a clonal fraction of 11% or less but span the three compartments of the hierarchy). Such cases could theoretically be explained by an identical mutation that occurs independently in multiple branches and thereby covers small subsets of cells from multiple braches. However, this is highly unlikely to account for the mutations that Applicants observe, as none of these mutations with the potential exception of the CIC mutation is a known &#x201c;hot-spot&#x201d; mutation that is expected to recur (and even the specific CIC mutation Applicants find is one of many mutations for this gene, and reported for 4 of 66 CIC-mutated TCGA patient samples). Thus, even convergent evolution is unlikely to result in these mutations occurring independently in different branches of the phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, Applicants identified three cases of compound chromosomal aberrations (two concurrent chromosomal deletions in MGH36, a chromosomal deletion and gain in MGH97, and a chromosome-wide LOH in MGH54 that requires two distinct genetic events) that in each case define two distinct clones, each of which spanning the different expression-based subpopulations; these events are highly unlikely to occur independently in different branches. (C) Under a non-genetic driven hierarchy, individual subclones tend to span the different expression states represented by the cellular hierarchy, consistent with the data herein. Applicants note that this model does not exclude the possibility that subclones would be biased towards (or against) a certain cellular state, as genetic evolution could interact with non-genetic states and influence their prevalence. (D) Phylogenetic tree for a hypothetical tumor, where each circle corresponds to a cell. According to the model of genetically-driven hierarchy, specific regions in the tree would correspond to subpopulations with distinct expression states. Shown are examples of three such potential subpopulations. (E) Mutations acquired during tumor evolution (numbered arrows) generate tumor subclones that harbor these mutations (indicated as numbered circles) and are confined to specific branches of the tree. Therefore, according to the model of genetically-driven hierarchy, subclonal mutations are expected to be present only in cells from a specific subpopulation, as defined by expression states. This is especially true for small subclones (i.e. mutations with a low clonal fraction), as these should be confined to a small branch that is unlikely to cover multiple subpopulations. Small subclones that nevertheless cover all three subpopulations are especially unlikely by this model (such as ZEB2, FRG1 and EEF1B2 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>; all with clonal fraction of 11% or less but span the three compartments of the hierarchy). Such cases could theoretically be explained by an identical mutation that occurs independently in multiple branches and thereby covers small subsets of cells from multiple braches. However, this is highly unlikely to account for the mutations that Applicants observe, as none of these mutations, except for CIC, is a known &#x201c;hot-spot&#x201d; mutation that is expected to recur. Thus, even convergent evolution is unlikely to result in these mutations occurring independently in different branches of the phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, Applicants identified two cases of large chromosomal aberrations (two concurrent chromosomal deletions in MGH36, and a chromosome-wide LOH in MGH54) that in each case define two distinct clones, and each of which spans the different expression-based subpopulations; these events are highly unlikely to occur independently in different branches.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>. Model for oligodendroglioma architecture and clonal evolution. Early in their pathogenesis (left), tumors are composed of a single genetic clone and hierarchically organized, such that a subpopulation of cycling stem/progenitor cells gives rise to differentiated progeny in two glial lineages. As the tumor evolves (right), multiple genetic clones are generated and co-exist, with each genetic clone maintaining a hierarchical organization where the relative distribution of the different compartment may vary due to genetic effects but is overall similar.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref>. For each of the three tumors profiled at high depth (horizontal panels) and for the two lineages (vertical panels) Applicants calculated the significance of co-expression among sets of AC-related and OC-related genes within limited ranges of lineage scores (between the value of the X axis and that of the Y axis). Significance was calculated by comparison to 100,000 control gene-sets with similar number of genes and distribution of average expression levels, and is indicated by color. The significant co-expression patterns within limited ranges of lineage scores suggest that variability of lineage scores in these ranges cannot be driven by noise alone, and implies the existence of multiple states within each lineage, presumably reflecting intermediate differentiation states (see Note 2).</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The invention relates to gene expression signatures and networks of tumors and tissues, as well as multicellular ecosystems of tumors and tissues and the cells and cell type which they comprise. The invention provides methods of characterizing components, functions and interactions of tumors and tissues and the cells which they comprise.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The invention further relates to controlling an immune response by modulating the activity of a component of the complement system. Cancer is but a single exemplary condition that can be controlled by an immune reaction. The present invention describes for how complement expression in the microenvironment can control the abundance of immune cells at a site of disease or condition requiring a shift in balance of an immune response.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The invention provides signature genes, gene products, and expression profiles of signature genes, gene networks, and gene products of tumors and component cells, and including especially melanoma tumors, gliomas, head and neck cancer, brain metastases of breast cancer, and tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and tissues. This invention further relates generally to compositions and methods for identifying genes and gene networks that respond to, modulate, control or otherwise influence tumors and tissues, including cells and cell types of the tumors and tissues, and malignant, microenvironmental, or immunologic states of the tumor cells and tissues. The invention also relates to methods of diagnosing, prognosing and/or staging of tumors, tissues and cells, and provides compositions and methods of modulating expression of genes and gene networks of tumors, tissues and cells, as well as methods of identifying, designing and selecting appropriate treatment regimens.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Use of Signature Genes</heading><p id="p-0124" num="0123">As used herein a signature may encompass any gene or genes, protein or proteins, or epigenetic element(s) whose expression profile or whose occurrence is associated with a specific cell type, subtype, or cell state of a specific cell type or subtype within a population of cells. Increased or decreased expression or activity or prevalence may be compared between different cells in order to characterize or identify for instance specific cell (sub)populations. A gene signature as used herein, may thus refer to any set of up- and down-regulated genes between different cells or cell (sub)populations derived from a gene-expression profile. For example, a gene signature may comprise a list of genes differentially expressed in a distinction of interest. It is to be understood that also when referring to proteins (e.g. differentially expressed proteins), such may fall within the definition of &#x201c;gene&#x201d; signature.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The signature as defined herein (being it a gene signature, protein signature or other genetic or epigenetic signature) can be used to indicate the presence of a cell type, a subtype of the cell type, the state of the microenvironment of a population of cells, a particular cell type population or subpopulation, and/or the overall status of the entire cell (sub)population. Furthermore, the signature may be indicative of cells within a population of cells in vivo. The signature may also be used to suggest for instance particular therapies, or to follow up treatment, or to suggest ways to modulate immune systems. The signatures of the present invention may be discovered by analysis of expression profiles of single-cells within a population of cells from isolated samples (e.g. blood samples), thus allowing the discovery of novel cell subtypes or cell states that were previously invisible or unrecognized. The presence of subtypes or cell states may be determined by subtype specific or cell state specific signatures. The presence of these specific cell (sub)types or cell states may be determined by applying the signature genes to bulk sequencing data in a sample. Not being bound by a theory the signatures of the present invention may be microenvironment specific, such as their expression in a particular spatio-temporal context. Not being bound by a theory, signatures as discussed herein are specific to a particular pathological context. Not being bound by a theory, a combination of cell subtypes having a particular signature may indicate an outcome. Not being bound by a theory, the signatures can be used to deconvolute the network of cells present in a particular pathological condition. Not being bound by a theory the presence of specific cells and cell subtypes are indicative of a particular response to treatment, such as including increased or decreased susceptibility to treatment. The signature may indicate the presence of one particular cell type. In one embodiment, the novel signatures are used to detect multiple cell states or hierarchies that occur in subpopulations of cancer cells that are linked to particular pathological condition (e.g. cancer grade), or linked to a particular outcome or progression of the disease, or linked to a particular response to treatment of the disease.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The signature according to certain embodiments of the present invention may comprise or consist of one or more genes, proteins and/or epigenetic elements, such as for instance 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more.

This allows one to define a particular subpopulation of tumor cells. As referred to herein, a &#x201c;subpopulation&#x201d; of cells preferably refers to a particular subset of cells of a particular cell type which can be distinguished or are uniquely identifiable and set apart from other cells of this cell type. The cell subpopulation may be phenotypically characterized, and is preferably characterized by the signature as discussed herein. A cell (sub)population as referred to herein may constitute of a (sub)population of cells of a particular cell type characterized by a specific cell state.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">When referring to induction, or alternatively suppression of a particular signature, preferable is meant induction or alternatively suppression (or upregulation or downregulation) of at least one gene/protein and/or epigenetic element of the signature, such as for instance at least to, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, or all genes/proteins and/or epigenetic elements of the signature.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Signatures may be functionally validated as being uniquely associated with a particular immune responder phenotype.

In one embodiment, genes in one population of cells may be activated or suppressed in order to affect the cells of another population. In related aspects, modulating, such as inducing or repressing, a particular a particular gene signature, protein signature, and/or other genetic or epigenetic signature may modify overall tumor composition, such as tumor cell composition, such as tumor cell subpopulation composition or distribution, or functionality.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">As used herein the term &#x201c;signature gene&#x201d; means any gene or genes whose expression profile is associated with a specific cell type, subtype, or cell state of a specific cell type or subtype within a population of cells. The signature gene can be used to indicate the presence of a cell type, a subtype of the cell type, the state of the microenvironment of a population of cells, and/or the overall status of the entire cell population. Furthermore, the signature genes may be indicative of cells within a population of cells in vivo. The signature genes of the present invention were discovered by analysis of expression profiles of single-cells within a population of cells from freshly isolated tumors, thus allowing the discovery of novel cell subtypes that were previously invisible in a population of cells within a tumor. The presence of subtypes may be determined by subtype specific signature genes. The presence of these specific cell types may be determined by applying the signature genes to bulk sequencing data in a patient tumor. Not being bound by a theory, a tumor is a conglomeration of many cells that make up a tumor microenvironment, whereby the cells communicate and affect each other in specific ways. As such, specific cell types within this microenvironment may express signature genes specific for this microenvironment. Not being bound by a theory the signature genes of the present invention may be microenvironment specific, such as their expression in a tumor. Not being bound by a theory, signature genes determined in single cells that originated in a tumor are specific to other tumors. Not being bound by a theory, a combination of cell subtypes in a tumor may indicate an outcome. Not being bound by a theory, the signature genes can be used to deconvolute the network of cells present in a tumor based on comparing them to data from bulk analysis of a tumor sample. Not being bound by a theory the presence of specific cells and cell subtypes are indicative of tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The signature gene may indicate the presence of one particular cell type. In one embodiment, the signature genes may indicate that tumor infiltrating T-cells are present. The presence of cell types within a tumor may indicate that the tumor will be resistant to a treatment. In one embodiment, the signature genes of the present invention are applied to bulk sequencing data from a tumor sample to transform the data into information relating to disease outcome and personalized treatments. In one embodiment, the novel signature genes are used to detect multiple cell states that occur in a subpopulation of tumor cells that are linked to resistance to targeted therapies and progressive tumor growth.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In one embodiment, the signature genes are detected by immunofluorescence, by mass cytometry (CyTOF), drop-seq, single cell qPCR, MERFISH (multiplex (in situ) RNA FISH) and/or by in situ hybridization.

In an embodiment of the invention, these signatures are useful in monitoring subjects undergoing treatments and therapies for cancer to determine whether the patient is responsive to the treatment or therapy. In an embodiment of the invention, these signatures are also useful for selecting or modifying therapies and treatments that would be efficacious in treating, delaying the progression of or otherwise ameliorating a symptom of cancer. In an embodiment of the invention, the signatures provided herein are used for selecting a group of patients at a specific state of a disease with accuracy that facilitates selection of treatments.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In certain embodiments, the invention involves high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq and/or targeted nucleic acid profiling (for example, sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the like) where the RNAs from different cells are tagged individually, allowing a single library to be created while retaining the cell identity of each read.

In one embodiment, sequencing is targeted for gene signatures of a specific cell type. Cells may be quantitated based on the sequencing of a cell specific gene signature. In certain embodiments, the depth of sequencing may be adjusted, such that cells having a particular gene signature can be detected. The term &#x201c;depth (coverage)&#x201d; as used herein refers to the number of times a nucleotide is read during the sequencing process. Depth can be calculated from the length of the original genome (G), the number of reads (N), and the average read length (L) as N&#xd7;L/G. For example, a hypothetical genome with 2,000 base pairs reconstructed from 8 reads with an average length of 500 nucleotides will have 2&#xd7; redundancy. This parameter also enables one to estimate other quantities, such as the percentage of the genome covered by reads (sometimes also called coverage). A high coverage in shotgun sequencing is desired because it can overcome errors in base calling and assembly. The subject of DNA sequencing theory addresses the relationships of such quantities. Even though the sequencing accuracy for each individual nucleotide is very high, the very large number of nucleotides in the genome means that if an individual genome is only sequenced once, there will be a significant number of sequencing errors. Furthermore rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are common. Hence to distinguish between sequencing errors and true SNPs, it is necessary to increase the sequencing accuracy even further by sequencing individual genomes a large number of times.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The term &#x201c;deep sequencing&#x201d; as used herein indicates that the total number of reads is many times larger than the length of the sequence under study.

No. 8,697,854; PCT Patent Publications: WO2003020763, WO2004033685, WO2004044004, WO2005114215, WO2006000830, WO2008038002, WO2008039818, WO2004074322, WO2005113595, WO2006125962, WO2013166321, WO2013039889, WO2014018863, WO2014083173; U.S. Pat. No. 8,088,379).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">As an alternative to, or addition to, TCR modifications, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) may be used in order to generate immunoresponsive cells, such as T cells, specific for selected targets, such as malignant cells, with a wide variety of receptor chimera constructs having been described (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,843,728; 5,851,828; 5,912,170; 6,004,811; 6,284,240; 6,392,013; 6,410,014; 6,753,162; 8,211,422; and, PCT Publication WO9215322). Alternative CAR constructs may be characterized as belonging to successive generations. First-generation CARs typically consist of a single-chain variable fragment of an antibody specific for an antigen, for example comprising a V<sub>L </sub>linked to a V<sub>H </sub>of a specific antibody, linked by a flexible linker, for example by a CD8&#x3b1; hinge domain and a CD8&#x3b1; transmembrane domain, to the transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains of either CD3&#x3b6; or FcR&#x3b3; (scFv-CD3&#x3b6; or scFv-FcR&#x3b3;; see U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,741,465; 5,912,172; 5,906,936). Second-generation CARs incorporate the intracellular domains of one or more costimulatory molecules, such as CD28, OX40 (CD134), or 4-1BB (CD137) within the endodomain (for example scFv-CD28/OX40/4-1BB-CD3&#x3b6;; see U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,911,993; 8,916,381; 8,975,071; 9,101,584; 9,102,760; 9,102,761). Third-generation CARs include a combination of costimulatory endodomains, such a CD3&#x3b6;-chain, CD97, GDI 1a-CD18, CD2, ICOS, CD27, CD154, CDS, OX40, 4-1BB, or CD28 signaling domains (for example scFv-CD28-4-1BB-CD3&#x3b6; or scFv-CD28-OX40-CD3&#x3b6;; see U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,906,682; 8,399,645; 5,686,281; PCT Publication No. WO2014134165; PCT Publication No. WO2012079000). Alternatively, costimulation may be orchestrated by expressing CARs in antigen-specific T cells, chosen so as to be activated and expanded following engagement of their native &#x3b1;&#x3b2;TCR, for example by antigen on professional antigen-presenting cells, with attendant costimulation. In addition, additional engineered receptors may be provided on the immunoresponsive cells, for example to improve targeting of a T-cell attack and/or minimize side effects.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Alternative techniques may be used to transform target immunoresponsive cells, such as protoplast fusion, lipofection, transfection or electroporation. A wide variety of vectors may be used, such as retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors, plasmids or transposons, such as a Sleeping Beauty transposon (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,489,458; 7,148,203; 7,160,682; 7,985,739; 8,227,432), may be used to introduce CARs, for example using 2nd generation antigen-specific CARs signaling through CD3&#x3b6; and either CD28 or CD137. Viral vectors may for example include vectors based on HIV, SV40, EBV, HSV or BPV.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Cells that are targeted for transformation may for example include T cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), regulatory T cells, human embryonic stem cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or a pluripotent stem cell from which lymphoid cells may be differentiated. T cells expressing a desired CAR may for example be selected through co-culture with &#x3b3;-irradiated activating and propagating cells (AaPC), which co-express the cancer antigen and co-stimulatory molecules. The engineered CAR T-cells may be expanded, for example by co-culture on AaPC in presence of soluble factors, such as IL-2 and IL-21. This expansion may for example be carried out so as to provide memory CAR+ T cells (which may for example be assayed by non-enzymatic digital array and/or multi-panel flow cytometry). In this way, CAR T cells may be provided that have specific cytotoxic activity against antigen-bearing tumors (optionally in conjunction with production of desired chemokines such as interferon-y). CAR T cells of this kind may for example be used in animal models, for example to threat tumor xenografts.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Approaches such as the foregoing may be adapted to provide methods of treating and/or increasing survival of a subject having a disease, such as a neoplasia, for example by administering an effective amount of an immunoresponsive cell comprising an antigen recognizing receptor that binds a selected antigen, wherein the binding activates the immunoreponsive cell, thereby treating or preventing the disease (such as a neoplasia, a pathogen infection, an autoimmune disorder, or an allogeneic transplant reaction).</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In one embodiment, the treatment can be administrated into patients undergoing an immunosuppressive treatment. The cells or population of cells, may be made resistant to at least one immunosuppressive agent due to the inactivation of a gene encoding a receptor for such immunosuppressive agent. Not being bound by a theory, the immunosuppressive treatment should help the selection and expansion of the immunoresponsive or T cells according to the invention within the patient.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">The administration of the cells or population of cells according to the present invention may be carried out in any convenient manner, including by aerosol inhalation, injection, ingestion, transfusion, implantation or transplantation. The cells or population of cells may be administered to a patient subcutaneously, intradermally, intratumorally, intranodally, intramedullary, intramuscularly, by intravenous or intralymphatic injection, or intraperitoneally. In one embodiment, the cell compositions of the present invention are preferably administered by intravenous injection.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">The administration of the cells or population of cells can consist of the administration of 104-10 cells per kg body weight, preferably 10 to 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/kg body weight including all integer values of cell numbers within those ranges. Dosing in CAR T cell therapies may for example involve administration of from 10<sup>6 </sup>to 10 cells/kg, with or without a course of lymphodepletion, for example with cyclophosphamide. The cells or population of cells can be administrated in one or more doses. In another embodiment, the effective amount of cells are administrated as a single dose. In another embodiment, the effective amount of cells are administrated as more than one dose over a period time. Timing of administration is within the judgment of managing physician and depends on the clinical condition of the patient. The cells or population of cells may be obtained from any source, such as a blood bank or a donor. While individual needs vary, determination of optimal ranges of effective amounts of a given cell type for a particular disease or conditions are within the skill of one in the art. An effective amount means an amount which provides a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit. The dosage administrated will be dependent upon the age, health and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment and the nature of the effect desired.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In another embodiment, the effective amount of cells or composition comprising those cells are administrated parenterally. The administration can be an intravenous administration. The administration can be directly done by injection within a tumor.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">To guard against possible adverse reactions, engineered immunoresponsive cells may be equipped with a transgenic safety switch, in the form of a transgene that renders the cells vulnerable to exposure to a specific signal. For example, the herpes simplex viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene may be used in this way, for example by introduction into allogeneic T lymphocytes used as donor lymphocyte infusions following stem cell transplantation (Greco, et al., Improving the safety of cell therapy with the TK-suicide gene. Front. Pharmacol. 2015; 6: 95). In such cells, administration of a nucleoside prodrug such as ganciclovir or acyclovir causes cell death. Alternative safety switch constructs include inducible caspase 9, for example triggered by administration of a small-molecule dimerizer that brings together two nonfunctional icasp9 molecules to form the active enzyme. A wide variety of alternative approaches to implementing cellular proliferation controls have been described (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 20130071414; PCT Patent Publication WO2011146862; PCT Patent Publication WO2014011987; PCT Patent Publication WO2013040371; Zhou et al.

Cells may be edited using any CRISPR system, TALE, TALEN, or Zinc finger protein and method of use thereof as described herein. CRISPR systems may be delivered to an immune cell by any method described herein. In preferred embodiments, cells are edited ex vivo and transferred to a subject in need thereof. Immunoresponsive cells, CAR T cells or any cells used for adoptive cell transfer may be edited. Editing may be performed to eliminate potential alloreactive T-cell receptors (TCR), disrupt the target of a chemotherapeutic agent, block an immune checkpoint, activate a T cell, and/or increase the differentiation and/or proliferation of functionally exhausted or dysfunctional CD8+ T-cells (see PCT Patent Publications: WO2013176915, WO2014059173, WO2014172606, WO2014184744, and WO2014191128). Editing may result in inactivation of a gene.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">By inactivating a gene, it is intended that the gene of interest is not expressed in a functional protein form. In a particular embodiment, the CRISPR system specifically catalyzes cleavage in one targeted gene thereby inactivating said targeted gene. The nucleic acid strand breaks caused are commonly repaired through the distinct mechanisms of homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). However, NHEJ is an imperfect repair process that often results in changes to the DNA sequence at the site of the cleavage. Repair via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) often results in small insertions or deletions (Indel) and can be used for the creation of specific gene knockouts. Cells in which a cleavage induced mutagenesis event has occurred can be identified and/or selected by well-known methods in the art.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">T cell receptors (TCR) are cell surface receptors that participate in the activation of T cells in response to the presentation of antigen. The TCR is generally made from two chains, &#x3b1; and &#x3b2;, which assemble to form a heterodimer and associates with the CD3-transducing subunits to form the T cell receptor complex present on the cell surface. Each &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; chain of the TCR consists of an immunoglobulin-like N-terminal variable (V) and constant (C) region, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic region. As for immunoglobulin molecules, the variable region of the &#x3b1; and &#x3c1; chains are generated by V(D)J recombination, creating a large diversity of antigen specificities within the population of T cells. However, in contrast to immunoglobulins that recognize intact antigen, T cells are activated by processed peptide fragments in association with an MHC molecule, introducing an extra dimension to antigen recognition by T cells, known as MHC restriction. Recognition of MHC disparities between the donor and recipient through the T cell receptor leads to T cell proliferation and the potential development of graft versus host disease (GVHD). The inactivation of TCR&#x3b1; or TCR&#x3b2; can result in the elimination of the TCR from the surface of T cells preventing recognition of alloantigen and thus GVHD. However, TCR disruption generally results in the elimination of the CD3 signaling component and alters the means of further T cell expansion.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">Allogeneic cells are rapidly rejected by the host immune system. It has been demonstrated that, allogeneic leukocytes present in non-irradiated blood products will persist for no more than 5 to 6 days (Boni, Muranski et al. 2008 Blood 1; 112(12):4746-54). Thus, to prevent rejection of allogeneic cells, the host's immune system usually has to be suppressed to some extent. However, in the case of adoptive cell transfer the use of immunosuppressive drugs also have a detrimental effect on the introduced therapeutic T cells. Therefore, to effectively use an adoptive immunotherapy approach in these conditions, the introduced cells would need to be resistant to the immunosuppressive treatment. Thus, in a particular embodiment, the present invention further comprises a step of modifying T cells to make them resistant to an immunosuppressive agent, preferably by inactivating at least one gene encoding a target for an immunosuppressive agent. An immunosuppressive agent is an agent that suppresses immune function by one of several mechanisms of action. An immunosuppressive agent can be, but is not limited to a calcineurin inhibitor, a target of rapamycin, an interleukin-2 receptor &#x3b1;-chain blocker, an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an inhibitor of dihydrofolic acid reductase, a corticosteroid or an immunosuppressive antimetabolite. The present invention allows conferring immunosuppressive resistance to T cells for immunotherapy by inactivating the target of the immunosuppressive agent in T cells. As non-limiting examples, targets for an immunosuppressive agent can be a receptor for an immunosuppressive agent such as: CD52, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a FKBP family gene member and a cyclophilin family gene member.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Immune checkpoints are inhibitory pathways that slow down or stop immune reactions and prevent excessive tissue damage from uncontrolled activity of immune cells. In certain embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is the programmed death-1 (PD-1 or CD279) gene (PDCD1). In other embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4). In additional embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is another member of the CD28 and CTLA4 Ig superfamily such as BTLA, LAG3, ICOS, PDL1 or KIR. In further additional embodiments, the immune checkpoint targeted is a member of the TNFR superfamily such as CD40, OX40, CD137, GITR, CD27 or TIM-3.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Additional immune checkpoints include Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) (Watson H A, et al., SHP-1: the next checkpoint target for cancer immunotherapy? Biochem Soc Trans. 2016 Apr. 15; 44(2):356-62). SHP-1 is a widely expressed inhibitory protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). In T-cells, it is a negative regulator of antigen-dependent activation and proliferation. It is a cytosolic protein, and therefore not amenable to antibody-mediated therapies, but its role in activation and proliferation makes it an attractive target for genetic manipulation in adoptive transfer strategies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Immune checkpoints may also include T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT/Vstm3/WUCAM/VSIG9) and VISTA (Le Mercier I, et al., (2015) Beyond CTLA-4 and PD-1, the generation Z of negative checkpoint regulators.

Activation or stimulation methods have been described herein and is preferably required before T cells are administered to a subject in need thereof. Examples of these type of treatments include the use tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) cells (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,126,132), cytotoxic T-cells (see U.S. Pat.

These patents are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">For maximum effectiveness of T-cells in cell therapy protocols, the ex vivo activated T-cell population should be in a state that can maximally orchestrate an immune response to cancer, infectious diseases, or other disease states. For an effective T-cell response, the T-cells first must be activated. For activation, at least two signals are required to be delivered to the T-cells. The first signal is normally delivered through the T-cell receptor (TCR) on the T-cell surface. The TCR first signal is normally triggered upon interaction of the TCR with peptide antigens expressed in conjunction with an MHC complex on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC). The second signal is normally delivered through co-stimulatory receptors on the surface of T-cells. Co-stimulatory receptors are generally triggered by corresponding ligands or cytokines expressed on the surface of APCs.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Due to the difficulty in maintaining large numbers of natural APC in cultures of T-cells being prepared for use in cell therapy protocols, alternative methods have been sought for ex-vivo activation of T-cells. One method is to by-pass the need for the peptide-MHC complex on natural APCs by instead stimulating the TCR (first signal) with polyclonal activators, such as immobilized or cross-linked anti-CD3 or anti-CD2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or superantigens. The most investigated co-stimulatory agent (second signal) used in conjunction with anti-CD3 or anti-CD2 mAbs has been the use of immobilized or soluble anti-CD28 mAbs. The combination of anti-CD3 mAb (first signal) and anti-CD28 mAb (second signal) immobilized on a solid support such as paramagnetic beads (see U.S. Pat.

T cells may be removed during surgery. T cells may be isolated after removal of tumor tissue by biopsy. T cells may be isolated by any means known in the art. In one embodiment, the method may comprise obtaining a bulk population of T cells from a tumor sample by any suitable method known in the art. For example, a bulk population of T cells can be obtained from a tumor sample by dissociating the tumor sample into a cell suspension from which specific cell populations can be selected. Suitable methods of obtaining a bulk population of T cells may include, but are not limited to, any one or more of mechanically dissociating (e.g., mincing) the tumor, enzymatically dissociating (e.g., digesting) the tumor, and aspiration (e.g., as with a needle).</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">The bulk population of T cells obtained from a tumor sample may comprise any suitable type of T cell.

In certain embodiments of the present invention, T cells can be obtained from a unit of blood collected from a subject using any number of techniques known to the skilled artisan, such as Ficoll separation. In one preferred embodiment, cells from the circulating blood of an individual are obtained by apheresis or leukapheresis. The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. In one embodiment, the cells collected by apheresis may be washed to remove the plasma fraction and to place the cells in an appropriate buffer or media for subsequent processing steps. In one embodiment of the invention, the cells are washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In an alternative embodiment, the wash solution lacks calcium and may lack magnesium or may lack many if not all divalent cations. Initial activation steps in the absence of calcium lead to magnified activation. As those of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate a washing step may be accomplished by methods known to those in the art, such as by using a semi-automated &#x201c;flow-through&#x201d; centrifuge (for example, the Cobe 2991 cell processor) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, the cells may be resuspended in a variety of biocompatible buffers, such as, for example, Ca-free, Mg-free PBS. Alternatively, the undesirable components of the apheresis sample may be removed and the cells directly resuspended in culture media.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">In another embodiment, T cells are isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes by lysing the red blood cells and depleting the monocytes, for example, by centrifugation through a PERCOLL&#x2122; gradient. A specific subpopulation of T cells, such as CD28+, CD4+, CDC, CD45RA+, and CD45RO+ T cells, can be further isolated by positive or negative selection techniques. For example, in one preferred embodiment, T cells are isolated by incubation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (i.e., 3&#xd7;28)-conjugated beads, such as DYNABEADS&#xae; M-450 CD3/CD28 T, or XCYTE DYNABEADS&#x2122; for a time period sufficient for positive selection of the desired T cells. In one embodiment, the time period is about 30 minutes. In a further embodiment, the time period ranges from 30 minutes to 36 hours or longer and all integer values there between. In a further embodiment, the time period is at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hours. In yet another preferred embodiment, the time period is 10 to 24 hours. In one preferred embodiment, the incubation time period is 24 hours. For isolation of T cells from patients with leukemia, use of longer incubation times, such as 24 hours, can increase cell yield. Longer incubation times may be used to isolate T cells in any situation where there are few T cells as compared to other cell types, such in isolating tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from tumor tissue or from immunocompromised individuals. Further, use of longer incubation times can increase the efficiency of capture of CD8+ T cells.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">In one embodiment of the present invention, any combination of therapeutic, not limited to a small molecule, compound, mixture, nucleic acid, vector, or protein, is administered to a subject in order to increase or decrease the activity of the complement system.

The terms &#x201c;complement,&#x201d; &#x201c;complement system&#x201d; and &#x201c;complement components&#x201d; also includes the defense molecules (protection molecules) CD46, CD55 and CD59.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">The classical pathway is triggered by activation of the C1-complex. The C1-complex is composed of 1 molecule of C1q, 2 molecules of C1r and 2 molecules of C1s, or C1qr2s2. This occurs when C1q binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens. A single pentameric IgM can initiate the pathway, while several, ideally six, IgGs are needed. This also occurs when C1q binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two C1r molecules. C1r is a serine protease. They then cleave C1s (another serine protease). The C1r2s2 component now splits C4 and then C2, producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b. C4b and C2a bind to form the classical pathway C3-convertase (C4b2a complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b; C3b later joins with C4b2a (the C3 convertase) to make C5 convertase (C4b2a3b complex). The inhibition of C1r and C1s is controlled by C1-inhibitor (SERPING1).</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">The alternative pathway is continuously activated at a low level as a result of spontaneous C3 hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond. The alternative pathway does not rely on pathogen-binding antibodies like the other pathways. C3b that is generated from C3 by a C3 convertase enzyme complex in the fluid phase is rapidly inactivated by factor H and factor I, as is the C3b-like C3 that is the product of spontaneous cleavage of the internal thioester. In contrast, when the internal thioester of C3 reacts with a hydroxyl or amino group of a molecule on the surface of a cell or pathogen, the C3b that is now covalently bound to the surface is protected from factor H-mediated inactivation. The surface-bound C3b may now bind factor B to form C3bB. This complex in the presence of factor D will be cleaved into Ba and Bb. Bb will remain associated with C3b to form C3bBb, which is the alternative pathway C3 convertase.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">The C3bBb complex is stabilized by binding oligomers of factor P (Properdin). The stabilized C3 convertase, C3bBbP, then acts enzymatically to cleave much more C3, some of which becomes covalently attached to the same surface as C3b. This newly bound C3b recruits more B, D and P activity and greatly amplifies the complement activation. When complement is activated on a cell surface, the activation is limited by endogenous complement regulatory proteins, which include CD35, CD46, CD55 and CD59, depending on the cell. Pathogens, in general, don't have complement regulatory proteins Thus, the alternative complement pathway is able to distinguish self from non-self on the basis of the surface expression of complement regulatory proteins. Host cells don't accumulate cell surface C3b (and the proteolytic fragment of C3b called iC3b) because this is prevented by the complement regulatory proteins, while foreign cells, pathogens and abnormal surfaces may be heavily decorated with C3b and iC3b. Accordingly, the alternative complement pathway is one element of innate immunity.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Once the alternative C3 convertase enzyme is formed on a pathogen or cell surface, it may bind covalently another C3b, to form C3bBbC3bP, the C5 convertase. This enzyme then cleaves C5 to C5a, a potent anaphylatoxin, and C5b. The C5b then recruits and assembles C6, C7, C8 and multiple C9 molecules to assemble the membrane attack complex. This creates a hole or pore in the membrane that can kill or damage the pathogen or cell.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">The lectin pathway is homologous to the classical pathway, but with the opsonin, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and ficolins, instead of C1q. This pathway is activated by binding of MBL to mannose residues on the pathogen surface, which activates the MBL-associated serine proteases, MASP-1, and MASP-2 (very similar to C1r and Cis, respectively), which can then split C4 into C4a and C4b and C2 into C2a and C2b. C4b and C2a then bind together to form the classical C3-convertase, as in the classical pathway. Ficolins are homologous to MBL and function via MASP in a similar way. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been described in M-ficolin in humans, with effect on ligand-binding ability and serum levels. Historically, the larger fragment of C2 was named C2a, but it is now referred as C2b. In invertebrates without an adaptive immune system, ficolins are expanded and their binding specificities diversified to compensate for the lack of pathogen-specific recognition molecules.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">In certain embodiments, combination therapies are administered to a patient in need thereof. In one preferred embodiment, the administration of an immunotherapy, such as adoptive cell transfer, may be enhanced by the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor. Not being bound by a theory, the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor may enhance an immune response against a targeted cell type.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">The term &#x201c;MDSC&#x201d; (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) refers to a heterogenous group of immune cells from the myeloid lineage (a family of cells that originate from bone marrow stem cells), to which dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils also belong. MDSCs strongly expand in pathological situations such as chronic infections and cancer, as a result of an altered hematopoiesis. Thus, it is yet unclear whether MDSCs represent a group of immature myeloid cell types that have stopped their differentiation towards DCs, macrophages or granulocytes, or if they represent a myeloid lineage apart. MDSCs are however discriminated from other myeloid cell types in which they possess strong immunosuppressive activities rather than immunostimulatory properties. Similarly to other myeloid cells, MDSCs interact with other immune cell types including T cells (the effector immune cells that kill pathogens, infected and cancer cells), dendritic cells, macrophages and NK cells to regulate their functions. Their mechanisms of action are beginning to be understood although they are still under heated debate and close examination by the scientific community. Nevertheless, clinical and experimental evidence has shown that cancer tissues with high infiltration of MDSC are associated with poor patient prognosis and resistance to therapies.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">With respect to general information on CRISPR-Cas Systems, components thereof, and delivery of such components, including methods, materials, delivery vehicles, vectors, particles, AAV, and making and using thereof, including as to amounts and formulations, all useful in the practice of the instant invention, reference is made to: U.S. Pat.

Their study further showed that Cas9 as converted into a nicking enzyme can be used to facilitate homology-directed repair in eukaryotic cells with minimal mutagenic activity. Additionally, their study demonstrated that multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several at endogenous genomic loci sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology. This ability to use RNA to program sequence specific DNA cleavage in cells defined a new class of genome engineering tools. These studies further showed that other CRISPR loci are likely to be transplantable into mammalian cells and can also mediate mammalian genome cleavage. Importantly, it can be envisaged that several aspects of the CRISPR-Cas system can be further improved to increase its efficiency and versatility.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0028" num="0229">Jiang et al. used the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated Cas9 endonuclease complexed with dual-RNAs to introduce precise mutations in the genomes of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae </i>and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The approach relied on dual-RNA:Cas9-directed cleavage at the targeted genomic site to kill unmutated cells and circumvents the need for selectable markers or counter-selection systems. The study reported reprogramming dual-RNA:Cas9 specificity by changing the sequence of short CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to make single- and multinucleotide changes carried on editing templates. The study showed that simultaneous use of two crRNAs enabled multiplex mutagenesis. Furthermore, when the approach was used in combination with recombineering, in <i>S. pneumoniae</i>, nearly 100% of cells that were recovered using the described approach contained the desired mutation, and in <i>E. coli, </i>65% that were recovered contained the mutation.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0029" num="0230">Wang et al. (2013) used the CRISPR/Cas system for the one-step generation of mice carrying mutations in multiple genes which were traditionally generated in multiple steps by sequential recombination in embryonic stem cells and/or time-consuming intercrossing of mice with a single mutation. The CRISPR/Cas system will greatly accelerate the in vivo study of functionally redundant genes and of epistatic gene interactions.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0030" num="0231">Konermann et al.

(2013-A) described an approach that combined a Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. This addresses the issue of the Cas9 nuclease from the microbial CRISPR-Cas system being targeted to specific genomic loci by a guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the DNA target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. Because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide RNAs is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. The authors demonstrated that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. This versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0032" num="0233">Hsu et al. (2013) characterized SpCas9 targeting specificity in human cells to inform the selection of target sites and avoid off-target effects. The study evaluated &#x3e;700 guide RNA variants and SpCas9-induced indel mutation levels at &#x3e;100 predicted genomic off-target loci in 293T and 293FT cells. The authors that SpCas9 tolerates mismatches between guide RNA and target DNA at different positions in a sequence-dependent manner, sensitive to the number, position and distribution of mismatches. The authors further showed that SpCas9-mediated cleavage is unaffected by DNA methylation and that the dosage of SpCas9 and sgRNA can be titrated to minimize off-target modification. Additionally, to facilitate mammalian genome engineering applications, the authors reported providing a web-based software tool to guide the selection and validation of target sequences as well as off-target analyses.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0033" num="0234">Ran et al. (2013-B) described a set of tools for Cas9-mediated genome editing via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) in mammalian cells, as well as generation of modified cell lines for downstream functional studies. To minimize off-target cleavage, the authors further described a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. The protocol provided by the authors experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity. The studies showed that beginning with target design, gene modifications can be achieved within as little as 1-2 weeks, and modified clonal cell lines can be derived within 2-3 weeks.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0034" num="0235">Shalem et al. described a new way to interrogate gene function on a genome-wide scale. Their studies showed that delivery of a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library targeted 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences enabled both negative and positive selection screening in human cells. First, the authors showed use of the GeCKO library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, the authors screened for genes whose loss is involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic that inhibits mutant protein kinase BRAF. Their studies showed that the highest-ranking candidates included previously validated genes NF1 and MED12 as well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1. The authors observed a high level of consistency between independent guide RNAs targeting the same gene and a high rate of hit confirmation, and thus demonstrated the promise of genome-scale screening with Cas9.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0035" num="0236">Nishimasu et al. reported the crystal structure of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>Cas9 in complex with sgRNA and its target DNA at 2.5 A&#xb0; resolution. The structure revealed a bilobed architecture composed of target recognition and nuclease lobes, accommodating the sgRNA:DNA heteroduplex in a positively charged groove at their interface. Whereas the recognition lobe is essential for binding sgRNA and DNA, the nuclease lobe contains the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains, which are properly positioned for cleavage of the complementary and non-complementary strands of the target DNA, respectively. The nuclease lobe also contains a carboxyl-terminal domain responsible for the interaction with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). This high-resolution structure and accompanying functional analyses have revealed the molecular mechanism of RNA-guided DNA targeting by Cas9, thus paving the way for the rational design of new, versatile genome-editing technologies.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0036" num="0237">Wu et al. mapped genome-wide binding sites of a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>loaded with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The authors showed that each of the four sgRNAs tested targets dCas9 to between tens and thousands of genomic sites, frequently characterized by a 5-nucleotide seed region in the sgRNA and an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Chromatin inaccessibility decreases dCas9 binding to other sites with matching seed sequences; thus 70% of off-target sites are associated with genes. The authors showed that targeted sequencing of 295 dCas9 binding sites in mESCs transfected with catalytically active Cas9 identified only one site mutated above background levels. The authors proposed a two-state model for Cas9 binding and cleavage, in which a seed match triggers binding but extensive pairing with target DNA is required for cleavage.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0037" num="0238">Platt et al. established a Cre-dependent Cas9 knockin mouse.

For example, wherein Cas9 protein and sgRNA were mixed together at a suitable, e.g., 3:1 to 1:3 or 2:1 to 1:2 or 1:1 molar ratio, at a suitable temperature, e.g., 15-30C, e.g., 20-25C, e.g., room temperature, for a suitable time, e.g., 15-45, such as 30 minutes, advantageously in sterile, nuclease free buffer, e.g., 1&#xd7;PBS.

In general, a CRISPR system is characterized by elements that promote the formation of a CRISPR complex at the site of a target sequence (also referred to as a protospacer in the context of an endogenous CRISPR system). In the context of formation of a CRISPR complex, &#x201c;target sequence&#x201d; refers to a sequence to which a guide sequence is designed to have complementarity, where hybridization between a target sequence and a guide sequence promotes the formation of a CRISPR complex.

In some embodiments, direct repeats may be identified in silico by searching for repetitive motifs that fulfill any or all of the following criteria: 1. found in a 2 Kb window of genomic sequence flanking the type II CRISPR locus; 2. span from 20 to 50 bp; and 3. interspaced by 20 to 50 bp.

In some embodiments, all 3 criteria may be used.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0257">In embodiments of the invention the terms guide sequence and guide RNA, i.e. RNA capable of guiding Cas to a target genomic locus, are used interchangeably as in foregoing cited documents such as WO 2014/093622 (PCT/US2013/074667). In general, a guide sequence is any polynucleotide sequence having sufficient complementarity with a target polynucleotide sequence to hybridize with the target sequence and direct sequence-specific binding of a CRISPR complex to the target sequence. In some embodiments, the degree of complementarity between a guide sequence and its corresponding target sequence, when optimally aligned using a suitable alignment algorithm, is about or more than about 50%, 60%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97.5%, 99%, or more. Optimal alignment may be determined with the use of any suitable algorithm for aligning sequences, non-limiting example of which include the Smith-Waterman algorithm, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, algorithms based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (e.g. the Burrows Wheeler Aligner), ClustalW, Clustal X, BLAT, Novoalign (Novocraft Technologies; available at www.novocraft.com), ELAND (Illumina, San Diego, Calif.), SOAP (available at soap.genomics.org.cn), and Maq (available at maq.sourceforge.net). In some embodiments, a guide sequence is about or more than about 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, or more nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, a guide sequence is less than about 75, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 12, or fewer nucleotides in length. Preferably the guide sequence is 10 30 nucleotides long. The ability of a guide sequence to direct sequence-specific binding of a CRISPR complex to a target sequence may be assessed by any suitable assay. For example, the components of a CRISPR system sufficient to form a CRISPR complex, including the guide sequence to be tested, may be provided to a host cell having the corresponding target sequence, such as by transfection with vectors encoding the components of the CRISPR sequence, followed by an assessment of preferential cleavage within the target sequence, such as by Surveyor assay as described herein. Similarly, cleavage of a target polynucleotide sequence may be evaluated in a test tube by providing the target sequence, components of a CRISPR complex, including the guide sequence to be tested and a control guide sequence different from the test guide sequence, and comparing binding or rate of cleavage at the target sequence between the test and control guide sequence reactions. Other assays are possible, and will occur to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0258">In a classic CRISPR-Cas systems, the degree of complementarity between a guide sequence and its corresponding target sequence can be about or more than about 50%, 60%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97.5%, 99%, or 100%; a guide or RNA or sgRNA can be about or more than about 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, or more nucleotides in length; or guide or RNA or sgRNA can be less than about 75, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 12, or fewer nucleotides in length; and advantageously tracr RNA is 30 or 50 nucleotides in length. However, an aspect of the invention is to reduce off-target interactions, e.g., reduce the guide interacting with a target sequence having low complementarity. Indeed, in the examples, it is shown that the invention involves mutations that result in the CRISPR-Cas system being able to distinguish between target and off-target sequences that have greater than 80% to about 95% complementarity, e.g., 83%-84% or 88-89% or 94-95% complementarity (for instance, distinguishing between a target having 18 nucleotides from an off-target of 18 nucleotides having 1, 2 or 3 mismatches). Accordingly, in the context of the present invention the degree of complementarity between a guide sequence and its corresponding target sequence is greater than 94.5% or 95% or 95.5% or 96% or 96.5% or 97% or 97.5% or 98% or 98.5% or 99% or 99.5% or 99.9%, or 100%.

Optimal concentrations of Cas mRNA and guide RNA can be determined by testing different concentrations in a cellular or non-human eukaryote animal model and using deep sequencing the analyze the extent of modification at potential off-target genomic loci. Alternatively, to minimize the level of toxicity and off-target effect, Cas nickase mRNA (for example <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 with the D10A mutation) can be delivered with a pair of guide RNAs targeting a site of interest. Guide sequences and strategies to minimize toxicity and off-target effects can be as in WO 2014/093622 (PCT/US2013/074667); or, via mutation as herein.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0262">Typically, in the context of an endogenous CRISPR system, formation of a CRISPR complex (comprising a guide sequence hybridized to a target sequence and complexed with one or more Cas proteins) results in cleavage of one or both strands in or near (e.g. within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, or more base pairs from) the target sequence.

An example of a codon optimized sequence, is in this instance a sequence optimized for expression in a eukaryote, e.g., humans (i.e. being optimized for expression in humans), or for another eukaryote, animal or mammal as herein discussed; see, e.g., SaCas9 human codon optimized sequence in WO 2014/093622 (PCT/US2013/074667). Whilst this is preferred, it will be appreciated that other examples are possible and codon optimization for a host species other than human, or for codon optimization for specific organs is known. In some embodiments, an enzyme coding sequence encoding a Cas is codon optimized for expression in particular cells, such as eukaryotic cells. The eukaryotic cells may be those of or derived from a particular organism, such as a mammal, including but not limited to human, or non-human eukaryote or animal or mammal as herein discussed, e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, livestock, or non-human mammal or primate. In some embodiments, processes for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings and/or processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering without any substantial medical benefit to man or animal, and also animals resulting from such processes, may be excluded. In general, codon optimization refers to a process of modifying a nucleic acid sequence for enhanced expression in the host cells of interest by replacing at least one codon (e.g. about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, or more codons) of the native sequence with codons that are more frequently or most frequently used in the genes of that host cell while maintaining the native amino acid sequence. Various species exhibit particular bias for certain codons of a particular amino acid. Codon bias (differences in codon usage between organisms) often correlates with the efficiency of translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is in turn believed to be dependent on, among other things, the properties of the codons being translated and the availability of particular transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The predominance of selected tRNAs in a cell is generally a reflection of the codons used most frequently in peptide synthesis. Accordingly, genes can be tailored for optimal gene expression in a given organism based on codon optimization. Codon usage tables are readily available, for example, at the &#x201c;Codon Usage Database&#x201d; available at www.kazusa.orjp/codon/and these tables can be adapted in a number of ways. See Nakamura, Y., et al. &#x201c;Codon usage tabulated from the international DNA sequence databases: status for the year 2000&#x201d; Nucl. Acids Res. 28:292 (2000). Computer algorithms for codon optimizing a particular sequence for expression in a particular host cell are also available, such as Gene Forge (Aptagen; Jacobus, P A), are also available. In some embodiments, one or more codons (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, or more, or all codons) in a sequence encoding a Cas correspond to the most frequently used codon for a particular amino acid.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0264">In certain embodiments, the methods as described herein may comprise providing a Cas transgenic cell in which one or more nucleic acids encoding one or more guide RNAs are provided or introduced operably connected in the cell with a regulatory element comprising a promoter of one or more gene of interest.

The nature, type, or origin of the cell are not particularly limiting according to the present invention. Also, the way how the Cas transgene is introduced in the cell is may vary and can be any method as is known in the art. In certain embodiments, the Cas transgenic cell is obtained by introducing the Cas transgene in an isolated cell. In certain other embodiments, the Cas transgenic cell is obtained by isolating cells from a Cas transgenic organism. By means of example, and without limitation, the Cas transgenic cell as referred to herein may be derived from a Cas transgenic eukaryote, such as a Cas knock-in eukaryote.

In some embodiments, the Cas comprises about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more NLSs at or near the amino-terminus, about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more NLSs at or near the carboxy-terminus, or a combination of these (e.g. zero or at least one or more NLS at the amino-terminus and zero or at one or more NLS at the carboxy terminus). When more than one NLS is present, each may be selected independently of the others, such that a single NLS may be present in more than one copy and/or in combination with one or more other NLSs present in one or more copies. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the Cas comprises at most 6 NLSs. In some embodiments, an NLS is considered near the N- or C-terminus when the nearest amino acid of the NLS is within about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, or more amino acids along the polypeptide chain from the N- or C-terminus. Non-limiting examples of NLSs include an NLS sequence derived from: the NLS of the SV40 virus large T-antigen, having the amino acid sequence PKKKRKV (SEQ ID NO: 1); the NLS from nucleoplasmin (e.g. the nucleoplasmin bipartite NLS with the sequence KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK) (SEQ ID NO: 2); the c-myc NLS having the amino acid sequence PAAKRVKLD (SEQ ID NO: 3) or RQRRNELKRSP (SEQ ID NO: 4); the hRNPA1 M9 NLS having the sequence NQSSNFGPMKGGNFGGRSSGPYGGGGQYFAKPRNQGGY(SEQ ID NO: 5); the sequence RMRIZFKNKGKDTAELRRRRVEVSVELRKAKKDEQILKRRNV (SEQ ID NO: 6) of the IBB domain from importin-alpha; the sequences VSRKRPRP (SEQ ID NO: 7) and PPKKARED (SEQ ID NO: 8) of the myoma T protein; the sequence PQPKKKPL (SEQ ID NO: 9) of human p53; the sequence SALIKKKKKMAP (SEQ ID NO: 10) of mouse c-abl IV; the sequences DRLRR (SEQ ID NO: 11) and PKQKKRK (SEQ ID NO: 12) of the influenza virus NS1; the sequence RKLKKKIKKL (SEQ ID NO: 13) of the Hepatitis virus delta antigen; the sequence REKKKFLKRR (SEQ ID NO: 14) of the mouse Mx1 protein; the sequence KRKGDEVDGVDEVAKKKSKK (SEQ ID NO: 15) of the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; and the sequence RKCLQAGMNLEARKTKK (SEQ ID NO: 16) of the steroid hormone receptors (human) glucocorticoid. In general, the one or more NLSs are of sufficient strength to drive accumulation of the Cas in a detectable amount in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. In general, strength of nuclear localization activity may derive from the number of NLSs in the Cas, the particular NLS(s) used, or a combination of these factors. Detection of accumulation in the nucleus may be performed by any suitable technique. For example, a detectable marker may be fused to the Cas, such that location within a cell may be visualized, such as in combination with a means for detecting the location of the nucleus (e.g. a stain specific for the nucleus such as DAPI). Cell nuclei may also be isolated from cells, the contents of which may then be analyzed by any suitable process for detecting protein, such as immunohistochemistry, Western blot, or enzyme activity assay. Accumulation in the nucleus may also be determined indirectly, such as by an assay for the effect of CRISPR complex formation (e.g. assay for DNA cleavage or mutation at the target sequence, or assay for altered gene expression activity affected by CRISPR complex formation and/or Cas enzyme activity), as compared to a control no exposed to the Cas or complex, or exposed to a Cas lacking the one or more NLSs.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0267">In certain aspects, the invention involves vectors, e.g. for delivering or introducing in a cell the DNA targeting agent according to the invention as described herein, such as by means of example Cas and/or RNA capable of guiding Cas to a target locus (i.e. guide RNA), but also for propagating these components (e.g. in prokaryotic cells). A used herein, a &#x201c;vector&#x201d; is a tool that allows or facilitates the transfer of an entity from one environment to another. It is a replicon, such as a plasmid, phage, or cosmid, into which another DNA segment may be inserted so as to bring about the replication of the inserted segment. Generally, a vector is capable of replication when associated with the proper control elements. In general, the term &#x201c;vector&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. Vectors include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid molecules that are single-stranded, double-stranded, or partially double-stranded; nucleic acid molecules that comprise one or more free ends, no free ends (e.g. circular); nucleic acid molecules that comprise DNA, RNA, or both; and other varieties of polynucleotides known in the art. One type of vector is a &#x201c;plasmid,&#x201d; which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be inserted, such as by standard molecular cloning techniques. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein virally-derived DNA or RNA sequences are present in the vector for packaging into a virus (e.g. retroviruses, replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses, replication defective adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)). Viral vectors also include polynucleotides carried by a virus for transfection into a host cell. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively-linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as &#x201c;expression vectors.&#x201d; Common expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0268">Recombinant expression vectors can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory elements, which may be selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, that is operatively-linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory element(s) in a manner that allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g. in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell). With regards to recombination and cloning methods, mention is made of U.S. patent application Ser.

The vector(s) can comprise Cas encoding sequences, and/or a single, but possibly also can comprise at least 3 or 8 or 16 or 32 or 48 or 50 guide RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs) encoding sequences, such as 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 1-5, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8, 3-9, 3-10, 3-8, 3-16, 3-30, 3-32, 3-48, 3-50 RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs). In a single vector there can be a promoter for each RNA (e.g., sgRNA), advantageously when there are up to about 16 RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs); and, when a single vector provides for more than 16 RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs), one or more promoter(s) can drive expression of more than one of the RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs), e.g., when there are 32 RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs), each promoter can drive expression of two RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs), and when there are 48 RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs), each promoter can drive expression of three RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNAs). By simple arithmetic and well established cloning protocols and the teachings in this disclosure one skilled in the art can readily practice the invention as to the RNA(s) (e.g., sgRNA(s) for a suitable exemplary vector such as AAV, and a suitable promoter such as the U6 promoter, e.g., U6-sgRNAs. For example, the packaging limit of AAV is &#x2dc;4.7 kb. The length of a single U6-sgRNA (plus restriction sites for cloning) is 361 bp. Therefore, the skilled person can readily fit about 12-16, e.g., 13 U6-sgRNA cassettes in a single vector. This can be assembled by any suitable means, such as a golden gate strategy used for TALE assembly (www.genome-engineering.org/taleffectors/). The skilled person can also use a tandem guide strategy to increase the number of U6-sgRNAs by approximately 1.5 times, e.g., to increase from 12-16, e.g., 13 to approximately 18-24, e.g., about 19 U6-sgRNAs. Therefore, one skilled in the art can readily reach approximately 18-24, e.g., about 19 promoter-RNAs, e.g., U6-sgRNAs in a single vector, e.g., an AAV vector. A further means for increasing the number of promoters and RNAs, e.g., sgRNA(s) in a vector is to use a single promoter (e.g., U6) to express an array of RNAs, e.g., sgRNAs separated by cleavable sequences. And an even further means for increasing the number of promoter-RNAs, e.g., sgRNAs in a vector, is to express an array of promoter-RNAs, e.g., sgRNAs separated by cleavable sequences in the intron of a coding sequence or gene; and, in this instance it is advantageous to use a polymerase II promoter, which can have increased expression and enable the transcription of long RNA in a tissue specific manner. (see, e.g., nar.oxfordjoumals.org/content/34/7/e53.short, www.nature.com/mt/journal/v16/n9/abs/mt2008144a.html).

One skilled in the art understands that the actual dosage to be delivered herein may vary greatly depending upon a variety of factors, such as the vector choice, the target cell, organism, or tissue, the general condition of the subject to be treated, the degree of transformation/modification sought, the administration route, the administration mode, the type of transformation/modification sought, etc.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0273">Such a dosage may further contain, for example, a carrier (water, saline, ethanol, glycerol, lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, gelatin, dextran, agar, pectin, peanut oil, sesame oil, etc.), a diluent, a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline), a pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient, and/or other compounds known in the art. The dosage may further contain one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts such as, for example, a mineral acid salt such as a hydrochloride, a hydrobromide, a phosphate, a sulfate, etc.; and the salts of organic acids such as acetates, propionates, malonates, benzoates, etc. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, gels or gelling materials, flavorings, colorants, microspheres, polymers, suspension agents, etc. may also be present herein. In addition, one or more other conventional pharmaceutical ingredients, such as preservatives, humectants, suspending agents, surfactants, antioxidants, anticaking agents, fillers, chelating agents, coating agents, chemical stabilizers, etc. may also be present, especially if the dosage form is a reconstitutable form. Suitable exemplary ingredients include microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, polysorbate 80, phenylethyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, potassium sorbate, sorbic acid, sulfur dioxide, propyl gallate, the parabens, ethyl vanillin, glycerin, phenol, parachlorophenol, gelatin, albumin and a combination thereof. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients is available in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Mack Pub. Co., N.J. 1991) which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0274">In an embodiment herein the delivery is via an adenovirus, which may be at a single booster dose containing at least 1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>particles (also referred to as particle units, pu) of adenoviral vector. In an embodiment herein, the dose preferably is at least about 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>particles (for example, about 1&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>-1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>particles), more preferably at least about 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>particles, more preferably at least about 1&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>particles (e.g., about 1&#xd7;10<sup>8</sup>-1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>particles or about 1&#xd7;10<sup>1</sup>-1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>particles), and most preferably at least about 1&#xd7;10<sup>0 </sup>particles (e.g., about 1&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>-1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>particles or about 1&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>-1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>particles), or even at least about 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>particles (e.g., about 1&#xd7;10<sup>10</sup>-1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>particles) of the adenoviral vector. Alternatively, the dose comprises no more than about 1&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>particles, preferably no more than about 1&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>particles, even more preferably no more than about 1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>particles, even more preferably no more than about 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>particles, and most preferably no more than about 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>particles (e.g., no more than about 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>particles). Thus, the dose may contain a single dose of adenoviral vector with, for example, about 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>particle units (pu), about 2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>pu, about 4&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>pu, about 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>pu, about 2&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>pu, about 4&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>pu, about 1&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>pu, about 2&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>pu, about 4&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>pu, about 1&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pu, about 2&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>pu, about 4&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>pu, about 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>pu, about 2&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>pu, about 4&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>pu, about 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>pu, about 2&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>pu, about 4&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>pu, about 1&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>pu, about 2&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>pu, or about 4&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>pu of adenoviral vector. See, for example, the adenoviral vectors in U.S. Pat. No. 8,454,972 B2 to Nabel, et. al., granted on Jun. 4, 2013; incorporated by reference herein, and the dosages at col 29, lines 36-58 thereof. In an embodiment herein, the adenovirus is delivered via multiple doses.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0275">In an embodiment herein, the delivery is via an AAV. A therapeutically effective dosage for in vivo delivery of the AAV to a human is believed to be in the range of from about 20 to about 50 ml of saline solution containing from about 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>functional AAV/ml solution. The dosage may be adjusted to balance the therapeutic benefit against any side effects. In an embodiment herein, the AAV dose is generally in the range of concentrations of from about 1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>50 </sup>genomes AAV, from about 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>genomes AAV, from about 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>genomes, or about 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>genomes AAV. A human dosage may be about 1&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>genomes AAV. Such concentrations may be delivered in from about 0.001 ml to about 100 ml, about 0.05 to about 50 ml, or about 10 to about 25 ml of a carrier solution. Other effective dosages can be readily established by one of ordinary skill in the art through routine trials establishing dose response curves. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,404,658 B2 to Hajjar, et al., granted on Mar. 26, 2013, at col. 27, lines 45-60.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0276">In an embodiment herein the delivery is via a plasmid. In such plasmid compositions, the dosage should be a sufficient amount of plasmid to elicit a response. For instance, suitable quantities of plasmid DNA in plasmid compositions can be from about 0.1 to about 2 mg, or from about 1 &#x3bc;g to about 10 &#x3bc;g per 70 kg individual. Plasmids of the invention will generally comprise (i) a promoter; (ii) a sequence encoding a DNA targeting agent as described herein, such as a comprising a CRISPR enzyme, operably linked to said promoter; (iii) a selectable marker; (iv) an origin of replication; and (v) a transcription terminator downstream of and operably linked to (ii). The plasmid can also encode the RNA components of a CRISPR complex, but one or more of these may instead be encoded on a different vector.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0277">The doses herein are based on an average 70 kg individual. The frequency of administration is within the ambit of the medical or veterinary practitioner (e.g., physician, veterinarian), or scientist skilled in the art. It is also noted that mice used in experiments are typically about 20 g and from mice experiments one can scale up to a 70 kg individual.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0278">In some embodiments the RNA molecules of the invention are delivered in liposome or lipofectin formulations and the like and can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,593,972, 5,589,466, and 5,580,859, which are herein incorporated by reference. Delivery systems aimed specifically at the enhanced and improved delivery of siRNA into mammalian cells have been developed, (see, for example, Shen et al FEBS Let. 2003, 539:111-114; Xia et al., Nat. Biotech. 2002, 20:1006-1010; Reich et al., Mol. Vision. 2003, 9: 210-216; Sorensen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2003, 327: 761-766; Lewis et al., Nat. Gen. 2002, 32: 107-108 and Simeoni et al., NAR 2003, 31, 11: 2717-2724) and may be applied to the present invention. siRNA has recently been successfully used for inhibition of gene expression in primates (see for example. Tolentino et al., Retina 24(4):660 which may also be applied to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0279">Indeed, RNA delivery is a useful method of in vivo delivery. It is possible to deliver the DNA targeting agent as described herein, such as Cas9 and gRNA (and, for instance, HR repair template) into cells using liposomes or particles. Thus delivery of the CRISPR enzyme, such as a Cas9 and/or delivery of the RNAs of the invention may be in RNA form and via microvesicles, liposomes or particles. For example, Cas9 mRNA and gRNA can be packaged into liposomal particles for delivery in vivo. Liposomal transfection reagents such as lipofectamine from Life Technologies and other reagents on the market can effectively deliver RNA molecules into the liver.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0280">Means of delivery of RNA also preferred include delivery of RNA via nanoparticles (Cho, S., Goldberg, M., Son, S., Xu, Q., Yang, F., Mei, Y., Bogatyrev, S., Langer, R. and Anderson, D., Lipid-like nanoparticles for small interfering RNA delivery to endothelial cells, Advanced Functional Materials, 19: 3112-3118, 2010) or exosomes (Schroeder, A., Levins, C., Cortez, C., Langer, R., and Anderson, D., Lipid-based nanotherapeutics for siRNA delivery, Journal of Internal Medicine, 267: 9-21, 2010, PMID: 20059641). Indeed, exosomes have been shown to be particularly useful in delivery siRNA, a system with some parallels to the CRISPR system. For instance, El-Andaloussi S, et al. (&#x201c;Exosome-mediated delivery of siRNA in vitro and in vivo.&#x201d; Nat Protoc. 2012 Dec.; 7(12):2112-26. doi: 10.1038/nprot.2012.131. Epub 2012 Nov. 15.) describe how exosomes are promising tools for drug delivery across different biological barriers and can be harnessed for delivery of siRNA in vitro and in vivo. Their approach is to generate targeted exosomes through transfection of an expression vector, comprising an exosomal protein fused with a peptide ligand. The exosomes are then purify and characterized from transfected cell supernatant, then RNA is loaded into the exosomes. Delivery or administration according to the invention can be performed with exosomes, in particular but not limited to the brain. Vitamin E (&#x3b1;-tocopherol) may be conjugated with CRISPR Cas and delivered to the brain along with high density lipoprotein (HDL), for example in a similar manner as was done by Uno et al. (HUMAN GENE THERAPY 22:711-719 (June 2011)) for delivering short-interfering RNA (siRNA) to the brain. Mice were infused via Osmotic minipumps (model 1007D; Alzet, Cupertino, Calif.) filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or free TocsiBACE or Toc-siBACE/HDL and connected with Brain Infusion Kit 3 (Alzet). A brain-infusion cannula was placed about 0.5 mm posterior to the bregma at midline for infusion into the dorsal third ventricle. Uno et al. found that as little as 3 nmol of Toc-siRNA with HDL could induce a target reduction in comparable degree by the same ICV infusion method. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas conjugated to &#x3b1;-tocopherol and co-administered with HDL targeted to the brain may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 3 nmol to about 3 &#x3bc;mol of CRISPR Cas targeted to the brain may be contemplated. Zou et al. ((HUMAN GENE THERAPY 22:465-475 (April 2011)) describes a method of lentiviral-mediated delivery of short-hairpin RNAs targeting PKC&#x3b3; for in vivo gene silencing in the spinal cord of rats. Zou et al. administered about 10 &#x3bc;l of a recombinant lentivirus having a titer of 1&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>transducing units (TU)/ml by an intrathecal catheter. A similar dosage of CRISPR Cas expressed in a lentiviral vector targeted to the brain may be contemplated for humans in the present invention, for example, about 10-50 ml of CRISPR Cas targeted to the brain in a lentivirus having a titer of 1&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>transducing units (TU)/ml may be contemplated.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0281">In terms of local delivery to the brain, this can be achieved in various ways. For instance, material can be delivered intrastriatally e.g. by injection. Injection can be performed stereotactically via a craniotomy.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0282">Enhancing NHEJ or HR efficiency is also helpful for delivery. It is preferred that NHEJ efficiency is enhanced by co-expressing end-processing enzymes such as Trex2 (Dumitrache et al. Genetics. 2011 August; 188(4): 787-797). It is preferred that HR efficiency is increased by transiently inhibiting NHEJ machineries such as Ku70 and Ku86. HR efficiency can also be increased by co-expressing prokaryotic or eukaryotic homologous recombination enzymes such as RecBCD, RecA.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0283">Packaging and Promoters Generally</p><p id="p-0233" num="0284">Ways to package nucleic acid molecules, in particular the DNA targeting agent according to the invention as described herein, such as Cas9 coding nucleic acid molecules, e.g., DNA, into vectors, e.g., viral vectors, to mediate genome modification in vivo include:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0285">To achieve NHEJ-mediated gene knockout:        <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0286">Single virus vector:            <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">                <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0287">Vector containing two or more expression cassettes:</li>                <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0288">Promoter-Cas9 coding nucleic acid molecule-terminator</li>                <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0289">Promoter-gRNA1-terminator</li>                <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0290">Promoter-gRNA2-terminator</li>                <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0291">Promoter-gRNA(N)-terminator (up to size limit of vector)</li>            </ul>            </li>            <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0292">Double virus vector:            <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">                <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0293">Vector 1 containing one expression cassette for driving the expression of Cas9</li>                <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0294">Promoter-Cas9 coding nucleic acid molecule-terminator</li>                <li id="ul0007-0003" num="0295">Vector 2 containing one more expression cassettes for driving the expression of one or more guideRNAs</li>                <li id="ul0007-0004" num="0296">Promoter-gRNA1-terminator</li>                <li id="ul0007-0005" num="0297">Promoter-gRNA(N)-terminator (up to size limit of vector)</li>            </ul>            </li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0298">To mediate homology-directed repair.        <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0299">In addition to the single and double virus vector approaches described above, an additional vector is used to deliver a homology-direct repair template.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0234" num="0300">The promoter used to drive Cas9 coding nucleic acid molecule expression can include:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0301">AAV ITR can serve as a promoter: this is advantageous for eliminating the need for an additional promoter element (which can take up space in the vector).

In one aspect, the aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds are combined with an agent to be delivered to a cell or a subject to form microparticles, particles, liposomes, or micelles. The agent to be delivered by the particles, liposomes, or micelles may be in the form of a gas, liquid, or solid, and the agent may be a polynucleotide, protein, peptide, or small molecule. The minoalcohol lipidoid compounds may be combined with other aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds, polymers (synthetic or natural), surfactants, cholesterol, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, etc. to form the particles.

One or more equivalents of an amine are allowed to react with one or more equivalents of an epoxide-terminated compound under suitable conditions to form an aminoalcohol lipidoid compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments, all the amino groups of the amine are fully reacted with the epoxide-terminated compound to form tertiary amines. In other embodiments, all the amino groups of the amine are not fully reacted with the epoxide-terminated compound to form tertiary amines thereby resulting in primary or secondary amines in the aminoalcohol lipidoid compound. These primary or secondary amines are left as is or may be reacted with another electrophile such as a different epoxide-terminated compound. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, reacting an amine with less than excess of epoxide-terminated compound will result in a plurality of different aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds with various numbers of tails. Certain amines may be fully functionalized with two epoxide-derived compound tails while other molecules will not be completely functionalized with epoxide-derived compound tails. For example, a diamine or polyamine may include one, two, three, or four epoxide-derived compound tails off the various amino moieties of the molecule resulting in primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. In certain embodiments, all the amino groups are not fully functionalized. In certain embodiments, two of the same types of epoxide-terminated compounds are used. In other embodiments, two or more different epoxide-terminated compounds are used. The synthesis of the aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds is performed with or without solvent, and the synthesis may be performed at higher temperatures ranging from 30-100&#xb0; C., preferably at approximately 50-90&#xb0; C. The prepared aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds may be optionally purified. For example, the mixture of aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds may be purified to yield an aminoalcohol lipidoid compound with a particular number of epoxide-derived compound tails. Or the mixture may be purified to yield a particular stereo- or regioisomer. The aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds may also be alkylated using an alkyl halide (e.g., methyl iodide) or other alkylating agent, and/or they may be acylated.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0355">US Patent Publication No. 20110293703 also provides libraries of aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds prepared by the inventive methods. These aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds may be prepared and/or screened using high-throughput techniques involving liquid handlers, robots, microtiter plates, computers, etc. In certain embodiments, the aminoalcohol lipidoid compounds are screened for their ability to transfect polynucleotides or other agents (e.g., proteins, peptides, small molecules) into the cell.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0356">US Patent Publication No. 20130302401 relates to a class of poly(beta-amino alcohols) (PBAAs) has been prepared using combinatorial polymerization. The inventive PBAAs may be used in biotechnology and biomedical applications as coatings (such as coatings of films or multilayer films for medical devices or implants), additives, materials, excipients, non-biofouling agents, micropatterning agents, and cellular encapsulation agents. When used as surface coatings, these PBAAs elicited different levels of inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo, depending on their chemical structures. The large chemical diversity of this class of materials allowed us to identify polymer coatings that inhibit macrophage activation in vitro. Furthermore, these coatings reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells, and reduce fibrosis, following the subcutaneous implantation of carboxylated polystyrene microparticles. These polymers may be used to form polyelectrolyte complex capsules for cell encapsulation. The invention may also have many other biological applications such as antimicrobial coatings, DNA or siRNA delivery, and stem cell tissue engineering.

An antitransthyretin small interfering RNA has been encapsulated in lipid particles and delivered to humans (see, e.g., Coelho et al., N Engl J Med 2013; 369:819-29), and such a system may be adapted and applied to the CRISPR Cas system of the present invention. Doses of about 0.01 to about 1 mg per kg of body weight administered intravenously are contemplated. Medications to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions are contemplated, such as dexamethasone, acetampinophen, diphenhydramine or cetirizine, and ranitidine are contemplated. Multiple doses of about 0.3 mg per kilogram every 4 weeks for five doses are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0358">LNPs have been shown to be highly effective in delivering siRNAs to the liver (see, e.g., Tabernero et al., Cancer Discovery, April 2013, Vol. 3, No. 4, pages 363-470) and are therefore contemplated for delivering RNA encoding CRISPR Cas to the liver. A dosage of about four doses of 6 mg/kg of the LNP every two weeks may be contemplated. Tabernero et al. demonstrated that tumor regression was observed after the first 2 cycles of LNPs dosed at 0.7 mg/kg, and by the end of 6 cycles the patient had achieved a partial response with complete regression of the lymph node metastasis and substantial shrinkage of the liver tumors. A complete response was obtained after 40 doses in this patient, who has remained in remission and completed treatment after receiving doses over 26 months. Two patients with RCC and extrahepatic sites of disease including kidney, lung, and lymph nodes that were progressing following prior therapy with VEGF pathway inhibitors had stable disease at all sites for approximately 8 to 12 months, and a patient with PNET and liver metastases continued on the extension study for 18 months (36 doses) with stable disease.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0359">However, the charge of the LNP must be taken into consideration. As cationic lipids combined with negatively charged lipids to induce nonbilayer structures that facilitate intracellular delivery. Because charged LNPs are rapidly cleared from circulation following intravenous injection, ionizable cationic lipids with pKa values below 7 were developed (see, e.g., Rosin et al, Molecular Therapy, vol. 19, no. 12, pages 1286-2200, December 2011). Negatively charged polymers such as RNA may be loaded into LNPs at low pH values (e.g., pH 4) where the ionizable lipids display a positive charge. However, at physiological pH values, the LNPs exhibit a low surface charge compatible with longer circulation times. Four species of ionizable cationic lipids have been focused upon, namely 1,2-dilineoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane (DLinDAP), 1,2-dilinoleyloxy-3-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DLinDMA), 1,2-dilinoleyloxy-keto-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane (DLinKDMA), and 1,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-[1,3]-dioxolane (DLinKC2-DMA). It has been shown that LNP siRNA systems containing these lipids exhibit remarkably different gene silencing properties in hepatocytes in vivo, with potencies varying according to the series DLinKC2-DMA&#x3e;DLinKDMA&#x3e;DLinDMA&#x3e;&#x3e;DLinDAP employing a Factor VII gene silencing model (see, e.g., Rosin et al, Molecular Therapy, vol. 19, no. 12, pages 1286-2200, December 2011). A dosage of 1 &#x3bc;g/ml of LNP or by means of example CRISPR-Cas RNA in or associated with the LNP may be contemplated, especially for a formulation containing DLinKC2-DMA.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0360">Preparation of LNPs and the DNA targeting agent according to the invention as described herein, such as by means of example CRISPR Cas encapsulation may be used/and or adapted from Rosin et al, Molecular Therapy, vol. 19, no. 12, pages 1286-2200, December 2011). The cationic lipids 1,2-dilineoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane (DLinDAP), 1,2-dilinoleyloxy-3-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DLinDMA), 1,2-dilinoleyloxyketo-N,N-dimethyl-3-aminopropane (DLinK-DMA), 1,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-[1,3]-dioxolane (DLinKC2-DMA), (3-o-[2&#x2033;-(methoxypolyethyleneglycol 2000) succinoyl]-1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycol (PEG-S-DMG), and R-3-[(o-methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)2000) carbamoyl]-1,2-dimyristyloxlpropyl-3-amine (PEG-C-DOMG) may be provided by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals (Vancouver, Canada) or synthesized.

When required, 0.2% SP-DiOC18 (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) may be incorporated to assess cellular uptake, intracellular delivery, and biodistribution. Encapsulation may be performed by dissolving lipid mixtures comprised of cationic lipid:DSPC:cholesterol:PEG-c-DOMG (40:10:40:10 molar ratio) in ethanol to a final lipid concentration of 10 mmol/l. This ethanol solution of lipid may be added drop-wise to 50 mmol/l citrate, pH 4.0 to form multilamellar vesicles to produce a final concentration of 30% ethanol vol/vol. Large unilamellar vesicles may be formed following extrusion of multilamellar vesicles through two stacked 80 nm Nuclepore polycarbonate filters using the Extruder (Northern Lipids, Vancouver, Canada). Encapsulation may be achieved by adding RNA dissolved at 2 mg/ml in 50 mmol/l citrate, pH 4.0 containing 30% ethanol vol/vol drop-wise to extruded preformed large unilamellar vesicles and incubation at 31&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes with constant mixing to a final RNA/lipid weight ratio of 0.06/1 wt/wt. Removal of ethanol and neutralization of formulation buffer were performed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 for 16 hours using Spectra/Por 2 regenerated cellulose dialysis membranes. Particle size distribution may be determined by dynamic light scattering using a NICOMP 370 particle sizer, the vesicle/intensity modes, and Gaussian fitting (Nicomp Particle Sizing, Santa Barbara, Calif.). The particle size for all three LNP systems may be &#x2dc;70 nm in diameter. RNA encapsulation efficiency may be determined by removal of free RNA using VivaPureD MiniH columns (Sartorius Stedim Biotech) from samples collected before and after dialysis. The encapsulated RNA may be extracted from the eluted particles and quantified at 260 nm. RNA to lipid ratio was determined by measurement of cholesterol content in vesicles using the Cholesterol E enzymatic assay from Wako Chemicals USA (Richmond, Va.).

Sodium acetate may be added to the lipid premix at a molar ratio of 0.75:1 (sodium acetate:DLinKC2-DMA). The lipids may be subsequently hydrated by combining the mixture with 1.85 volumes of citrate buffer (10 mmol/l, pH 3.0) with vigorous stirring, resulting in spontaneous liposome formation in aqueous buffer containing 35% ethanol.

The electrostatic interactions between cationic polymers and nucleic acid resulted in the formation of polyplexes with average particle size distribution of about 100 nm, hence referred to here as nanoplexes. The DOTA-siRNA of Bartlett et al. was synthesized as follows: 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid mono(N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (DOTA-NHSester) was ordered from Macrocyclics (Dallas, Tex.). The amine modified RNA sense strand with a 100-fold molar excess of DOTA-NHS-ester in carbonate buffer (pH 9) was added to a microcentrifuge tube. The contents were reacted by stirring for 4 h at room temperature. The DOTA-RNAsense conjugate was ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in water, and annealed to the unmodified antisense strand to yield DOTA-siRNA. All liquids were pretreated with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) to remove trace metal contaminants. Tf-targeted and nontargeted siRNA particles may be formed by using cyclodextrin-containing polycations. Typically, particles were formed in water at a charge ratio of 3 (+/&#x2212;) and an siRNA concentration of 0.5 g/liter. One percent of the adamantane-PEG molecules on the surface of the targeted particles were modified with Tf (adamantane-PEG-Tf).

Patients with solid cancers refractory to standard-of-care therapies are administered doses of targeted particles on days 1, 3, 8 and 10 of a 21-day cycle by a 30-min intravenous infusion. The particles consist of a synthetic delivery system containing: (1) a linear, cyclodextrin-based polymer (CDP), (2) a human transferrin protein (TF) targeting ligand displayed on the exterior of the particle to engage TF receptors (TFR) on the surface of the cancer cells, (3) a hydrophilic polymer (polyethylene glycol (PEG) used to promote particle stability in biological fluids), and (4) siRNA designed to reduce the expression of the RRM2 (sequence used in the clinic was previously denoted siR2B+5). The TFR has long been known to be upregulated in malignant cells, and RRM2 is an established anti-cancer target. These particles (clinical version denoted as CALAA-01) have been shown to be well tolerated in multi-dosing studies in non-human primates. Although a single patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia has been administered siRNAby liposomal delivery, Davis et al.'s clinical trial is the initial human trial to systemically deliver siRNA with a targeted delivery system and to treat patients with solid cancer. To ascertain whether the targeted delivery system can provide effective delivery of functional siRNA to human tumours, Davis et al. investigated biopsies from three patients from three different dosing cohorts; patients A, B and C, all of whom had metastatic melanoma and received CALAA-01 doses of 18, 24 and 30 mg m<sup>2 </sup>siRNA, respectively.

To reduce immunogenicity, Alvarez-Erviti et al. (2011, Nat Biotechnol 29: 341) used self-derived dendritic cells for exosome production. Targeting to the brain was achieved by engineering the dendritic cells to express Lamp2b, an exosomal membrane protein, fused to the neuron-specific RVG peptide. Purified exosomes were loaded with exogenous RNA by electroporation. Intravenously injected RVG-targeted exosomes delivered GAPDH siRNA specifically to neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes in the brain, resulting in a specific gene knockdown. Pre-exposure to RVG exosomes did not attenuate knockdown, and non-specific uptake in other tissues was not observed. The therapeutic potential of exosome-mediated siRNA delivery was demonstrated by the strong mRNA (60%) and protein (62%) knockdown of BACE1, a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0375">To obtain a pool of immunologically inert exosomes, Alvarez-Erviti et al. harvested bone marrow from inbred C57BL/6 mice with a homogenous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype. As immature dendritic cells produce large quantities of exosomes devoid of T-cell activators such as MHC-II and CD86, Alvarez-Erviti et al. selected for dendritic cells with granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for 7 d. Exosomes were purified from the culture supernatant the following day using well-established ultracentrifugation protocols. The exosomes produced were physically homogenous, with a size distribution peaking at 80 nm in diameter as determined by particle tracking analysis (NTA) and electron microscopy.

The amount of encapsulated RNA was assayed after ultracentrifugation and lysis of exosomes.

Cortical tissue samples were analyzed 3 d after administration and a significant protein knockdown (45%, P&#x3c;0.05, versus 62%, P&#x3c;0.01) in both siRNA-RVG-9R-treated and siRNARVG exosome-treated mice was observed, resulting from a significant decrease in BACE1 mRNA levels (66% [+ or &#x2212;] 15%, P&#x3c;0.001 and 61% [+ or &#x2212;] 13% respectively, P&#x3c;0.01).

Following exosome treatment, nonsignificant changes in all cytokines were registered similar to siRNA-transfection reagent treatment in contrast to siRNA-RVG-9R, which potently stimulated IL-6 secretion, confirming the immunologically inert profile of the exosome treatment. Given that exosomes encapsulate only 20% of siRNA, delivery with RVG-exosome appears to be more efficient than RVG-9R delivery as comparable mRNA knockdown and greater protein knockdown was achieved with fivefold less siRNA without the corresponding level of immune stimulation.

The daily treatment may be over about three days and then weekly for about five weeks. In another embodiment, a specific CRISPR Cas encapsulated SNALP) administered by intravenous injection to at doses of about 1 or 2.5 mg/kg are also contemplated (see, e.g., Zimmerman et al., Nature Letters, Vol. 441, 4 May 2006).

The stable nucleic acid lipid particle (SNALP) is comprised of four different lipids an ionizable lipid (DLinDMA) that is cationic at low pH, a neutral helper lipid, cholesterol, and a diffusible polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid. The particle is approximately 80 nm in diameter and is charge-neutral at physiologic pH. During formulation, the ionizable lipid serves to condense lipid with the anionic RNA during particle formation. When positively charged under increasingly acidic endosomal conditions, the ionizable lipid also mediates the fusion of SNALP with the endosomal membrane enabling release of RNA into the cytoplasm. The PEG-lipid stabilizes the particle and reduces aggregation during formulation, and subsequently provides a neutral hydrophilic exterior that improves pharmacokinetic properties.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0392">To date, two clinical programs have been initiated using SNALP formulations with RNA. Tekmira Pharmaceuticals recently completed a phase I single-dose study of SNALP-ApoB in adult volunteers with elevated LDL cholesterol. ApoB is predominantly expressed in the liver and jejunum and is essential for the assembly and secretion of VLDL and LDL. Seventeen subjects received a single dose of SNALP-ApoB (dose escalation across 7 dose levels). There was no evidence of liver toxicity (anticipated as the potential dose-limiting toxicity based on preclinical studies). One (of two) subjects at the highest dose experienced flu-like symptoms consistent with immune system stimulation, and the decision was made to conclude the trial.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0393">Alnylam Pharmaceuticals has similarly advanced ALN-TTR01, which employs the SNALP technology described above and targets hepatocyte production of both mutant and wild-type TTR to treat TTR amyloidosis (ATTR). Three ATTR syndromes have been described: familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC) both caused by autosomal dominant mutations in TTR; and senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) cause by wildtype TTR. A placebo-controlled, single dose-escalation phase I trial of ALN-TTR01 was recently completed in patients with ATTR. ALN-TTR01 was administered as a 15-minute IV infusion to 31 patients (23 with study drug and 8 with placebo) within a dose range of 0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg (based on siRNA). Treatment was well tolerated with no significant increases in liver function tests. Infusion-related reactions were noted in 3 of 23 patients at &#x3e;0.4 mg/kg; all responded to slowing of the infusion rate and all continued on study. Minimal and transient elevations of serum cytokines IL-6, IP-10 and IL-Ira were noted in two patients at the highest dose of 1 mg/kg (as anticipated from preclinical and NHP studies). Lowering of serum TTR, the expected pharmacodynamics effect of ALN-TTR01, was observed at 1 mg/kg.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0394">In yet another embodiment, a SNALP may be made by solubilizing a cationic lipid, DSPC, cholesterol and PEG-lipid e.g., in ethanol, e.g., at a molar ratio of 40:10:40:10, respectively (see, Semple et al., Nature Niotechnology, Volume 28 Number 2 Feb. 2010, pp. 172-177). The lipid mixture was added to an aqueous buffer (50 mM citrate, pH 4) with mixing to a final ethanol and lipid concentration of 30% (vol/vol) and 6.1 mg/ml, respectively, and allowed to equilibrate at 22&#xb0; C. for 2 min before extrusion. The hydrated lipids were extruded through two stacked 80 nm pore-sized filters (Nuclepore) at 22&#xb0; C. using a Lipex Extruder (Northern Lipids) until a vesicle diameter of 70-90 nm, as determined by dynamic light scattering analysis, was obtained. This generally required 1-3 passes. The siRNA (solubilized in a 50 mM citrate, pH 4 aqueous solution containing 30% ethanol) was added to the pre-equilibrated (35&#xb0; C.) vesicles at a rate of &#x2dc;5 ml/min with mixing. After a final target siRNA/lipid ratio of 0.06 (wt/wt) was reached, the mixture was incubated for a further 30 min at 35&#xb0; C. to allow vesicle reorganization and encapsulation of the siRNA. The ethanol was then removed and the external buffer replaced with PBS (155 mM NaCl, 3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.5) by either dialysis or tangential flow diafiltration. siRNA were encapsulated in SNALP using a controlled step-wise dilution method process. The lipid constituents of KC2-SNALP were DLin-KC2-DMA (cationic lipid), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC; Avanti Polar Lipids), synthetic cholesterol (Sigma) and PEG-C-DMA used at a molar ratio of 57.1:7.1:34.3:1.4. Upon formation of the loaded particles, SNALP were dialyzed against PBS and filter sterilized through a 0.2 m filter before use. Mean particle sizes were 75-85 nm and 90-95% of the siRNA was encapsulated within the lipid particles. The final siRNA/lipid ratio in formulations used for in vivo testing was &#x2dc;0.15 (wt/wt). LNP-siRNA systems containing Factor VII siRNA were diluted to the appropriate concentrations in sterile PBS immediately before use and the formulations were administered intravenously through the lateral tail vein in a total volume of 10 ml/kg.

The dendrimers are suitable for targeting the delivery of the bioactive molecules to, for example, the liver, spleen, lung, kidney or heart (or even the brain). Dendrimers are synthetic 3-dimensional macromolecules that are prepared in a step-wise fashion from simple branched monomer units, the nature and functionality of which can be easily controlled and varied. Dendrimers are synthesised from the repeated addition of building blocks to a multifunctional core (divergent approach to synthesis), or towards a multifunctional core (convergent approach to synthesis) and each addition of a 3-dimensional shell of building blocks leads to the formation of a higher generation of the dendrimers. Polypropylenimine dendrimers start from a diaminobutane core to which is added twice the number of amino groups by a double Michael addition of acrylonitrile to the primary amines followed by the hydrogenation of the nitriles. This results in a doubling of the amino groups. Polypropylenimine dendrimers contain 100% protonable nitrogens and up to 64 terminal amino groups (generation 5, DAB 64). Protonable groups are usually amine groups which are able to accept protons at neutral pH. The use of dendrimers as gene delivery agents has largely focused on the use of the polyamidoamine and phosphorous containing compounds with a mixture of amine/amide or N&#x2014;P(O<sub>2</sub>)S as the conjugating units respectively with no work being reported on the use of the lower generation polypropylenimine dendrimers for gene delivery. Polypropylenimine dendrimers have also been studied as pH sensitive controlled release systems for drug delivery and for their encapsulation of guest molecules when chemically modified by peripheral amino acid groups. The cytotoxicity and interaction of polypropylenimine dendrimers with DNA as well as the transfection efficacy of DAB 64 has also been studied.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0402">US Patent Publication No. 20050019923 is based upon the observation that, contrary to earlier reports, cationic dendrimers, such as polypropylenimine dendrimers, display suitable properties, such as specific targeting and low toxicity, for use in the targeted delivery of bioactive molecules, such as genetic material. In addition, derivatives of the cationic dendrimer also display suitable properties for the targeted delivery of bioactive molecules.

Both supernegatively and superpositively charged proteins exhibit a remarkable ability to withstand thermally or chemically induced aggregation. Superpositively charged proteins are also able to penetrate mammalian cells. Associating cargo with these proteins, such as plasmid DNA, RNA, or other proteins, can enable the functional delivery of these macromolecules into mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo.

CPPs are short peptides that facilitate cellular uptake of various molecular cargo (from nanosize particles to small chemical molecules and large fragments of DNA). The term &#x201c;cargo&#x201d; as used herein includes but is not limited to the group consisting of therapeutic agents, diagnostic probes, peptides, nucleic acids, antisense oligonucleotides, plasmids, proteins, particles, liposomes, chromophores, small molecules and radioactive materials. In aspects of the invention, the cargo may also comprise any component of the DNA targeting agent according to the invention as described herein, such as by means of example CRISPR Cas system or the entire functional CRISPR Cas system. Aspects of the present invention further provide methods for delivering a desired cargo into a subject comprising: (a) preparing a complex comprising the cell penetrating peptide of the present invention and a desired cargo, and (b) orally, intraarticularly, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intrarterially, intranasally, intraparenchymally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously, dermally, intrarectally, or topically administering the complex to a subject. The cargo is associated with the peptides either through chemical linkage via covalent bonds or through non-covalent interactions.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0407">The function of the CPPs are to deliver the cargo into cells, a process that commonly occurs through endocytosis with the cargo delivered to the endosomes of living mammalian cells. Cell-penetrating peptides are of different sizes, amino acid sequences, and charges but all CPPs have one distinct characteristic, which is the ability to translocate the plasma membrane and facilitate the delivery of various molecular cargoes to the cytoplasm or an organelle. CPP translocation may be classified into three main entry mechanisms: direct penetration in the membrane, endocytosis-mediated entry, and translocation through the formation of a transitory structure. CPPs have found numerous applications in medicine as drug delivery agents in the treatment of different diseases including cancer and virus inhibitors, as well as contrast agents for cell labeling. Examples of the latter include acting as a carrier for GFP, MRI contrast agents, or quantum dots. CPPs hold great potential as in vitro and in vivo delivery vectors for use in research and medicine. CPPs typically have an amino acid composition that either contains a high relative abundance of positively charged amino acids such as lysine or arginine or has sequences that contain an alternating pattern of polar/charged amino acids and non-polar, hydrophobic amino acids. These two types of structures are referred to as polycationic or amphipathic, respectively. A third class of CPPs are the hydrophobic peptides, containing only apolar residues, with low net charge or have hydrophobic amino acid groups that are crucial for cellular uptake. One of the initial CPPs discovered was the transactivating transcriptional activator (Tat) from Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) which was found to be efficiently taken up from the surrounding media by numerous cell types in culture. Since then, the number of known CPPs has expanded considerably and small molecule synthetic analogues with more effective protein transduction properties have been generated. CPPs include but are not limited to Penetratin, Tat (48-60), Transportan, and (R-AhX-R4) (Ahx=aminohexanoyl).</p><p id="p-0317" num="0408">U.S. Pat.

Combinations of different polymers with different release mechanisms may also optionally be used. The concentration gradient at the surface is preferably maintained effectively constant during a significant period of the total drug releasing period, and therefore the diffusion rate is effectively constant (termed &#x201c;zero mode&#x201d; diffusion).

Indeed, sustained expression would be undesirable in case of off-target effects at unintended genomic sites, etc. Thus time-limited expression would be useful. Inducible expression offers one approach, but in addition Applicants have engineered a Self-Inactivating CRISPR-Cas9 system that relies on the use of a non-coding guide target sequence within the CRISPR vector itself. Thus, after expression begins, the CRISPR system will lead to its own destruction, but before destruction is complete it will have time to edit the genomic copies of the target gene (which, with a normal point mutation in a diploid cell, requires at most two edits). Simply, the self inactivating CRISPR-Cas system includes additional RNA (i.e., guide RNA) that targets the coding sequence for the CRISPR enzyme itself or that targets one or more non-coding guide target sequences complementary to unique sequences present in one or more of the following:</p><p id="p-0351" num="0000">(a) within the promoter driving expression of the non-coding RNA elements,<br/>(b) within the promoter driving expression of the Cas9 gene,<br/>(c) within 100 bp of the ATG translational start codon in the Cas9 coding sequence,<br/>(d) within the inverted terminal repeat (iTR) of a viral delivery vector, e.g., in the AAV genome.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0442">Furthermore, that RNA can be delivered via a vector, e.g., a separate vector or the same vector that is encoding the CRISPR complex. When provided by a separate vector, the CRISPR RNA that targets Cas expression can be administered sequentially or simultaneously. When administered sequentially, the CRISPR RNA that targets Cas expression is to be delivered after the CRISPR RNA that is intended for e.g. gene editing or gene engineering. This period may be a period of minutes (e.g. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes). This period may be a period of hours (e.g. 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours). This period may be a period of days (e.g. 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 7 days). This period may be a period of weeks (e.g. 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks). This period may be a period of months (e.g. 2 months, 4 months, 8 months, 12 months). This period may be a period of years (2 years, 3 years, 4 years). In this fashion, the Cas enzyme associates with a first gRNA/chiRNA capable of hybridizing to a first target, such as a genomic locus or loci of interest and undertakes the function(s) desired of the CRISPR-Cas system (e.g., gene engineering); and subsequently the Cas enzyme may then associate with the second gRNA/chiRNA capable of hybridizing to the sequence comprising at least part of the Cas or CRISPR cassette. Where the gRNA/chiRNA targets the sequences encoding expression of the Cas protein, the enzyme becomes impeded and the system becomes self inactivating. In the same manner, CRISPR RNA that targets Cas expression applied via, for example liposome, lipofection, nanoparticles, microvesicles as explained herein, may be administered sequentially or simultaneously. Similarly, self-inactivation may be used for inactivation of one or more guide RNA used to target one or more targets.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0443">In some aspects, a single gRNA is provided that is capable of hybridization to a sequence downstream of a CRISPR enzyme start codon, whereby after a period of time there is a loss of the CRISPR enzyme expression. In some aspects, one or more gRNA(s) are provided that are capable of hybridization to one or more coding or non-coding regions of the polynucleotide encoding the CRISPR-Cas system, whereby after a period of time there is a inactivation of one or more, or in some cases all, of the CRISPR-Cas system. In some aspects of the system, and not to be limited by theory, the cell may comprise a plurality of CRISPR-Cas complexes, wherein a first subset of CRISPR complexes comprise a first chiRNA capable of targeting a genomic locus or loci to be edited, and a second subset of CRISPR complexes comprise at least one second chiRNA capable of targeting the polynucleotide encoding the CRISPR-Cas system, wherein the first subset of CRISPR-Cas complexes mediate editing of the targeted genomic locus or loci and the second subset of CRISPR complexes eventually inactivate the CRISPR-Cas system, thereby inactivating further CRISPR-Cas expression in the cell.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0444">Thus the invention provides a CRISPR-Cas system comprising one or more vectors for delivery to a eukaryotic cell, wherein the vector(s) encode(s): (i) a CRISPR enzyme; (ii) a first guide RNA capable of hybridizing to a target sequence in the cell; (iii) a second guide RNA capable of hybridizing to one or more target sequence(s) in the vector which encodes the CRISPR enzyme; (iv) at least one tracr mate sequence; and (v) at least one tracr sequence, The first and second complexes can use the same tracr and tracr mate, thus differing only by the guide sequence, wherein, when expressed within the cell: the first guide RNA directs sequence-specific binding of a first CRISPR complex to the target sequence in the cell; the second guide RNA directs sequence-specific binding of a second CRISPR complex to the target sequence in the vector which encodes the CRISPR enzyme; the CRISPR complexes comprise (a) a tracr mate sequence hybridised to a tracr sequence and (b) a CRISPR enzyme bound to a guide RNA, such that a guide RNA can hybridize to its target sequence; and the second CRISPR complex inactivates the CRISPR-Cas system to prevent continued expression of the CRISPR enzyme by the cell.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0445">Further characteristics of the vector(s), the encoded enzyme, the guide sequences, etc. are disclosed elsewhere herein. For instance, one or both of the guide sequence(s) can be part of a chiRNA sequence which provides the guide, tracr mate and tracr sequences within a single RNA, such that the system can encode (i) a CRISPR enzyme; (ii) a first chiRNA comprising a sequence capable of hybridizing to a first target sequence in the cell, a first tracr mate sequence, and a first tracr sequence; (iii) a second guide RNA capable of hybridizing to the vector which encodes the CRISPR enzyme, a second tracr mate sequence, and a second tracr sequence. Similarly, the enzyme can include one or more NLS, etc.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0446">The various coding sequences (CRISPR enzyme, guide RNAs, tracr and tracr mate) can be included on a single vector or on multiple vectors. For instance, it is possible to encode the enzyme on one vector and the various RNA sequences on another vector, or to encode the enzyme and one chiRNA on one vector, and the remaining chiRNA on another vector, or any other permutation. In general, a system using a total of one or two different vectors is preferred.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0447">Where multiple vectors are used, it is possible to deliver them in unequal numbers, and ideally with an excess of a vector which encodes the first guide RNA relative to the second guide RNA, thereby assisting in delaying final inactivation of the CRISPR system until genome editing has had a chance to occur.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0448">The first guide RNA can target any target sequence of interest within a genome, as described elsewhere herein. The second guide RNA targets a sequence within the vector which encodes the CRISPR Cas9 enzyme, and thereby inactivates the enzyme's expression from that vector. Thus the target sequence in the vector must be capable of inactivating expression. Suitable target sequences can be, for instance, near to or within the translational start codon for the Cas9 coding sequence, in a non-coding sequence in the promoter driving expression of the non-coding RNA elements, within the promoter driving expression of the Cas9 gene, within 100 bp of the ATG translational start codon in the Cas9 coding sequence, and/or within the inverted terminal repeat (iTR) of a viral delivery vector, e.g., in the AAV genome. A double stranded break near this region can induce a frame shift in the Cas9 coding sequence, causing a loss of protein expression. An alternative target sequence for the &#x201c;self-inactivating&#x201d; guide RNA would aim to edit/inactivate regulatory regions/sequences needed for the expression of the CRISPR-Cas9 system or for the stability of the vector. For instance, if the promoter for the Cas9 coding sequence is disrupted then transcription can be inhibited or prevented. Similarly, if a vector includes sequences for replication, maintenance or stability then it is possible to target these. For instance, in a AAV vector a useful target sequence is within the iTR. Other useful sequences to target can be promoter sequences, polyadenlyation sites, etc.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0449">Furthermore, if the guide RNAs are expressed in array format, the &#x201c;self-inactivating&#x201d; guide RNAs that target both promoters simultaneously will result in the excision of the intervening nucleotides from within the CRISPR-Cas expression construct, effectively leading to its complete inactivation. Similarly, excision of the intervening nucleotides will result where the guide RNAs target both ITRs, or targets two or more other CRISPR-Cas components simultaneously. Self-inactivation as explained herein is applicable, in general, with CRISPR-Cas9 systems in order to provide regulation of the CRISPR-Cas9. For example, self-inactivation as explained herein may be applied to the CRISPR repair of mutations, for example expansion disorders, as explained herein. As a result of this self-inactivation, CRISPR repair is only transiently active.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0450">Addition of non-targeting nucleotides to the 5&#x2032; end (e.g. 1-10 nucleotides, preferably 1-5 nucleotides) of the &#x201c;self-inactivating&#x201d; guide RNA can be used to delay its processing and/or modify its efficiency as a means of ensuring editing at the targeted genomic locus prior to CRISPR-Cas9 shutdown.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0451">In one aspect of the self-inactivating AAV-CRISPR-Cas9 system, plasmids that co-express one or more sgRNA targeting genomic sequences of interest (e.g. 1-2, 1-5, 1-10, 1-15, 1-20, 1-30) may be established with &#x201c;self-inactivating&#x201d; sgRNAs that target an SpCas9 sequence at or near the engineered ATG start site (e.g. within 5 nucleotides, within 15 nucleotides, within 30 nucleotides, within 50 nucleotides, within 100 nucleotides). A regulatory sequence in the U6 promoter region can also be targeted with an sgRNA. The U6-driven sgRNAs may be designed in an array format such that multiple sgRNA sequences can be simultaneously released. When first delivered into target tissue/cells (left cell) sgRNAs begin to accumulate while Cas9 levels rise in the nucleus. Cas9 complexes with all of the sgRNAs to mediate genome editing and self-inactivation of the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0452">One aspect of a self-inactivating CRISPR-Cas9 system is expression of singly or in tandam array format from 1 up to 4 or more different guide sequences; e.g. up to about 20 or about 30 guides sequences. Each individual self inactivating guide sequence may target a different target. Such may be processed from, e.g. one chimeric pol3 transcript. Pol3 promoters such as U6 or H1 promoters may be used. Pol2 promoters such as those mentioned throughout herein. Inverted terminal repeat (iTR) sequences may flank the Pol3 promoter-sgRNA(s)-Pol2 promoter-Cas9.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0453">One aspect of a chimeric, tandem array transcript is that one or more guide(s) edit the one or more target(s) while one or more self inactivating guides inactivate the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Thus, for example, the described CRISPR-Cas9 system for repairing expansion disorders may be directly combined with the self-inactivating CRISPR-Cas9 system described herein. Such a system may, for example, have two guides directed to the target region for repair as well as at least a third guide directed to self-inactivation of the CRISPR-Cas9.

The DNA binding domain comprises several repeats of TALE monomers and this may be represented as (X1-11-(X12X13)-X14-33 or 34 or 35)z, where in an advantageous embodiment, z is at least 5 to 40. In a further advantageous embodiment, z is at least 10 to 26.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0458">The TALE monomers have a nucleotide binding affinity that is determined by the identity of the amino acids in its RVD. For example, polypeptide monomers with an RVD of NI preferentially bind to adenine (A), monomers with an RVD of NG preferentially bind to thymine (T), monomers with an RVD of HD preferentially bind to cytosine (C) and monomers with an RVD of NN preferentially bind to both adenine (A) and guanine (G). In yet another embodiment of the invention, monomers with an RVD of IG preferentially bind to T. Thus, the number and order of the polypeptide monomer repeats in the nucleic acid binding domain of a TALE determines its nucleic acid target specificity. In still further embodiments of the invention, monomers with an RVD of NS recognize all four base pairs and may bind to A, T, G or C. The structure and function of TALEs is further described in, for example, Moscou et al., Science 326:1501 (2009); Boch et al., Science 326:1509-1512 (2009); and Zhang et al., Nature Biotechnology 29:149-153 (2011), each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0459">The polypeptides used in methods of the invention are isolated, non-naturally occurring, recombinant or engineered nucleic acid-binding proteins that have nucleic acid or DNA binding regions containing polypeptide monomer repeats that are designed to target specific nucleic acid sequences.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0460">As described herein, polypeptide monomers having an RVD of HN or NH preferentially bind to guanine and thereby allow the generation of TALE polypeptides with high binding specificity for guanine containing target nucleic acid sequences. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, polypeptide monomers having RVDs RN, NN, NK, SN, NH, KN, HN, NQ, HH, RG, KH, RH and SS preferentially bind to guanine. In a much more advantageous embodiment of the invention, polypeptide monomers having RVDs RN, NK, NQ, HH, KH, RH, SS and SN preferentially bind to guanine and thereby allow the generation of TALE polypeptides with high binding specificity for guanine containing target nucleic acid sequences. In an even more advantageous embodiment of the invention, polypeptide monomers having RVDs HH, KH, NH, NK, NQ, RH, RN and SS preferentially bind to guanine and thereby allow the generation of TALE polypeptides with high binding specificity for guanine containing target nucleic acid sequences. In a further advantageous embodiment, the RVDs that have high binding specificity for guanine are RN, NH RH and KH. Furthermore, polypeptide monomers having an RVD of NV preferentially bind to adenine and guanine. In more preferred embodiments of the invention, monomers having RVDs of H*, HA, KA, N*, NA, NC, NS, RA, and S* bind to adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine with comparable affinity.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0461">The predetermined N-terminal to C-terminal order of the one or more polypeptide monomers of the nucleic acid or DNA binding domain determines the corresponding predetermined target nucleic acid sequence to which the polypeptides of the invention will bind. As used herein the monomers and at least one or more half monomers are &#x201c;specifically ordered to target&#x201d; the genomic locus or gene of interest. In plant genomes, the natural TALE-binding sites always begin with a thymine (T), which may be specified by a cryptic signal within the non-repetitive N-terminus of the TALE polypeptide; in some cases this region may be referred to as repeat 0. In animal genomes, TALE binding sites do not necessarily have to begin with a thymine (T) and polypeptides of the invention may target DNA sequences that begin with T, A, G or C. The tandem repeat of TALE monomers always ends with a half-length repeat or a stretch of sequence that may share identity with only the first 20 amino acids of a repetitive full length TALE monomer and this half repeat may be referred to as a half-monomer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). Therefore, it follows that the length of the nucleic acid or DNA being targeted is equal to the number of full monomers plus two.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0462">As described in Zhang et al., Nature Biotechnology 29:149-153 (2011), TALE polypeptide binding efficiency may be increased by including amino acid sequences from the &#x201c;capping regions&#x201d; that are directly N-terminal or C-terminal of the DNA binding region of naturally occurring TALEs into the engineered TALEs at positions N-terminal or C-terminal of the engineered TALE DNA binding region. Thus, in certain embodiments, the TALE polypeptides described herein further comprise an N-terminal capping region and/or a C-terminal capping region.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0000"><tables

The terms &#x201c;effector domain&#x201d; or &#x201c;regulatory and functional domain&#x201d; refer to a polypeptide sequence that has an activity other than binding to the nucleic acid sequence recognized by the nucleic acid binding domain. By combining a nucleic acid binding domain with one or more effector domains, the polypeptides of the invention may be used to target the one or more functions or activities mediated by the effector domain to a particular target DNA sequence to which the nucleic acid binding domain specifically binds.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0471">In some embodiments of the TALE polypeptides described herein, the activity mediated by the effector domain is a biological activity. For example, in some embodiments the effector domain is a transcriptional inhibitor (i.e., a repressor domain), such as an mSin interaction domain (SID). SID4&#xd7; domain or a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) or fragments of the KRAB domain. In some embodiments the effector domain is an enhancer of transcription (i.e. an activation domain), such as the VP16, VP64 or p65 activation domain. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid binding is linked, for example, with an effector domain that includes but is not limited to a transposase, integrase, recombinase, resolvase, invertase, protease, DNA methyltransferase, DNA demethylase, histone acetylase, histone deacetylase, nuclease, transcriptional repressor, transcriptional activator, transcription factor recruiting, protein nuclear-localization signal or cellular uptake signal.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0472">In some embodiments, the effector domain is a protein domain which exhibits activities which include but are not limited to transposase activity, integrase activity, recombinase activity, resolvase activity, invertase activity, protease activity, DNA methyltransferase activity, DNA demethylase activity, histone acetylase activity, histone deacetylase activity, nuclease activity, nuclear-localization signaling activity, transcriptional repressor activity, transcriptional activator activity, transcription factor recruiting activity, or cellular uptake signaling activity. Other preferred embodiments of the invention may include any combination the activities described herein.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0473">Applicants have previously developed methods and tools for genome-scale screening of perturbations in single cells using CRISPR-Cas9, herein referred to as perturb-seq (see e.g., Dixit et al., &#x201c;Perturb-Seq: Dissecting Molecular Circuits with Scalable Single-Cell RNA Profiling of Pooled Genetic Screens&#x201d; 2016, Cell 167, 1853-1866; and Adamson et al., &#x201c;A Multiplexed Single-Cell CRISPR Screening Platform Enables Systematic Dissection of the Unfolded Protein Response&#x201d; 2016, Cell 167, 1867-1882). The present invention is compatible with perturb-seq, such that signature genes may be perturbed and the perturbation may be identified and assigned to the proteomic and gene expression readouts of single cells.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0474">The perturbation methods and tools allow reconstructing of a cellular network or circuit. In one embodiment, the method comprises (1) introducing single-order or combinatorial perturbations to a population of cells, (2) measuring genomic, genetic, proteomic, epigenetic and/or phenotypic differences in single cells and (3) assigning a perturbation(s) to the single cells. Not being bound by a theory, a perturbation may be linked to a phenotypic change, preferably changes in gene or protein expression. In preferred embodiments, measured differences that are relevant to the perturbations are determined by applying a model accounting for co-variates to the measured differences. The model may include the capture rate of measured signals, whether the perturbation actually perturbed the cell (phenotypic impact), the presence of subpopulations of either different cells or cell states, and/or analysis of matched cells without any perturbation. In certain embodiments, the measuring of phenotypic differences and assigning a perturbation to a single cell is determined by performing single cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In preferred embodiments, the single cell RNA-seq is performed by Drop-seq, as described herein. In certain embodiments, unique barcodes are used to perform Perturb-seq. In certain embodiments, a guide RNA is detected by RNA-seq using a transcript expressed from a vector encoding the guide RNA. The transcript may include a unique barcode specific to the guide RNA. Not being bound by a theory, a guide RNA and guide RNA barcode is expressed from the same vector and the barcode may be detected by RNA-seq. Not being bound by a theory, detection of a guide RNA barcode is more reliable than detecting a guide RNA sequence and reduces the chance of false guide RNA assignment. Thus, a perturbation may be assigned to a single cell by detection of a guide RNA barcode in the cell. In certain embodiments, a cell barcode is added to the RNA in single cells, such that the RNA may be assigned to a single cell. Generating cell barcodes is described herein for Drop-seq methods. In certain embodiments, a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) is added to each individual transcript and protein capture oligonucleotide. Not being bound by a theory, the UMI allows for determining the capture rate of measured signals, or preferably the binding events or the number of transcripts captured. Not being bound by a theory, the data is more significant if the signal observed in is derived from more than one protein binding event or transcript. In preferred embodiments, Perturb-seq is performed using a guide RNA barcode expressed as a polyadenylated transcript, a cell barcode, and a UMI.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0475">Perturb-seq combines emerging technologies in the field of genome engineering, and single-cell analysis, in particular the CRISPR-Cas9 system and droplet single-cell sequencing analysis. In certain embodiments, a CRISPR system is used to create an INDEL at a target gene. In other embodiments, epigenetic screening is performed by applying CRISPRa/i technology. Numerous genetic variants associated with disease phenotypes are found to be in non-coding region of the genome, and frequently coincide with transcription factor (TF) binding sites and non-coding RNA genes. Not being bound by a theory, CRISPRa/i approaches may be used to achieve a more thorough and precise understanding of the implication of epigenetic regulation.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0476">In certain embodiments, other CRISPR-based perturbations are readily compatible with Perturb-seq, including alternative editors such as CRISPR/Cpf1. In certain embodiments, Perturb-seq uses Cpf1 as the CRISPR enzyme for introducing perturbations. Not being bound by a theory, Cpf1 does not require Tracr RNA and is a smaller enzyme, thus allowing higher combinatorial perturbations to be tested.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0477">The cell(s) may comprise a cell in a model non-human organism, a model non-human mammal that expresses a Cas protein, a mouse that expresses a Cas protein, a mouse that expresses Cpf1, a cell in vivo or a cell ex vivo or a cell in vitro. The cell(s) may also comprise a human cell.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0478">In one embodiment, CRISPR/Cas9 may be used to perturb protein-coding genes or non-protein-coding DNA. CRISPR/Cas9 may be used to knockout protein-coding genes by frameshifts, point mutations, inserts, or deletions. An extensive toolbox may be used for efficient and specific CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout as described herein, including a double-nicking CRISPR to efficiently modify both alleles of a target gene or multiple target loci and a smaller Cas9 protein for delivery on smaller vectors (Ran, F. A., et al., In vivo genome editing using <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>Cas9. Nature. 520, 186-191 (2015)). A genome-wide sgRNA mouse library (10 sgRNAs/gene) may also be used in a mouse that expresses a Cas9 protein.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0479">In one embodiment, a CRISPR system may be used to activate gene transcription. A nuclease-dead RNA-guided DNA binding domain, dCas9, tethered to transcriptional repressor domains that promote epigenetic silencing (e.g., KRAB) may be used for &#x201c;CRISPRi&#x201d; that represses transcription. To use dCas9 as an activator (CRISPRa), a guide RNA is engineered to carry RNA binding motifs (e.g., MS2) that recruit effector domains fused to RNA-motif binding proteins, increasing transcription. A key dendritic cell molecule, p65, may be used as a signal amplifier, but is not required.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0480">In one embodiment, perturbation is by deletion of regulatory elements. Non-coding elements may be targeted by using pairs of guide RNAs to delete regions of a defined size, and by tiling deletions covering sets of regions in pools.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0481">In one embodiment, perturbation of genes is by RNAi. The RNAi may be shRNA's targeting genes. The shRNA's may be delivered by any methods known in the art. In one embodiment, the shRNA's may be delivered by a viral vector. The viral vector may be a lentivirus, adenovirus, or adeno associated virus.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0482">Applicants have developed and optimized methods and conditions for delivery of a CRISPR system to primary mouse T-cells. Applicants have achieved over 80% transduction efficiency with <i>Lenti</i>-CRISPR constructs in CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Despite success with lentiviral delivery, recent work by Hendel et al, (Nature Biotechnology 33, 985-989 (2015) doi:10.1038/nbt.3290) showed the efficiency of editing human T-cells with chemically modified RNA, and direct RNA delivery to T-cells via electroporation. In certain embodiments, perturbation in mouse primary T-cells may use these methods.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0483">In certain embodiments, whole genome screens can be used for understanding the phenotypic readout of perturbing potential target genes. In preferred embodiments, perturbations target expressed genes as defined by RNA-seq using a focused sgRNA library. Libraries may be focused on expressed genes in specific networks or pathways. In other preferred embodiments, regulatory drivers are perturbed. Applicants can use gene expression profiling data to define the target of interest and perform follow-up single-cell and population RNA-seq analysis. Not being bound by a theory, this approach will accelerate the development of therapeutics for human disorders, in particular gliomas.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0484">The practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of immunology, biochemistry, chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, genomics and recombinant DNA, which are within the skill of the art.

Second, Applicants classified cells as malignant, non-malignant and borderline based on the extent and profile of CNVs. Applicants scored each cell for the extent of CNV signal, defined as the sum of squares of CNV values across the genome, and for the correlation between the CNV profile of each cell with the average CNV profile of all cells from the corresponding tumor that are classified by expression as malignant. Applicants defined malignant cells as those with CNV signal above 0.05 and CNV correlation above 0.5 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>); non-malignant as those that satisfy neither of these thresholds; and borderline as those that satisfy only one threshold. Finally, Applicants classified cells as oligodendrocytes or microglia/macrophages if they were defined as non-malignant by CNV and as the corresponding expression cluster; and Applicants classified cells as malignant if they were classified as such either in both expression and CNV analysis or in one of those analyses but as borderline in the other analysis.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="2">CNV Estimation</heading><p id="p-0420" num="0507">Initial CNVs (CNV<sub>0</sub>) were estimated by sorting the analyzed genes by their chromosomal location and applying a moving average to the relative expression values, with a sliding window of 100 genes within each chromosome, as previously described herein. To avoid considerable impact of any particular gene on the moving average, Applicants limited the relative expression values to [&#x2212;3,3] by replacing all values above 3 by a ceiling of 3, and replacing values below &#x2212;3 by a floor of &#x2212;3. This was performed only in the context of CNV estimation. For visualization purposes, in order to include the two chromosomes with fewest analyzed genes (chromosome 18 and 21 with 105 and 75 genes, respectively) Applicants extended the moving average to include up to 50 genes from the flanking chromosomes (e.g. the first window in chromosome 18 consisted of the last 50 genes of chromosome 17 and the first 50 genes of chromosome 18, while the 51 through 56 windows in that chromosome consisted only of chromosome 18 genes). This initial analysis is based on the average expression of genes in each cell compared to the other cells and therefore does not have a proper reference to define the baseline. However, Applicants detected a cluster of cells that have higher values at chromosome 1p and 19q, which Applicants know are deleted in three oligodendroglioma tumors, and that have consistent &#x201c;CNV patterns&#x201d; across the genome despite the fact that they originate from all three tumors. Applicants thus defined the gene expression clusters annotated as oligodendrocytes and microglia/macrophages by gene expression as the nonmalignant cells, and used the average CNV estimate at each gene across those cells as the baseline. As the non-malignant cells include both microglia/macrophages and oligodendrocytes, which differ in gene expression patterns and therefore also in expression-based CNV estimates, Applicants defined two baselines, as the average of all microglia and the average of all oligodendrocytes, and based on these the maximal (BaseMax) and minimal (BaseMin) baseline at each window. The final CNV estimate of cell i at position j was defined as:</p><p id="p-0421" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>CNV</mi>    <mi>f</mi>   </msub>   <mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>i</mi>    <mo>,</mo>    <mi>j</mi>   </mrow>   <mo>)</mo>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mo>{</mo>   <mtable>    <mtr>     <mtd>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <msub>          <mi>CNV</mi>          <mn>0</mn>         </msub>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>i</mi>          <mo>,</mo>          <mi>j</mi>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mo>-</mo>        <mrow>         <mi>BaseMax</mi>         <mo>&#x2061;</mo>         <mo>(</mo>         <mi>j</mi>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>       </mrow>       <mtext>&#x205f;</mtext>       <mo>,</mo>      </mrow>     </mtd>     <mtd>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>if</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>   </mtext>        <mrow>         <msub>          <mi>CNV</mi>          <mn>0</mn>         </msub>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>i</mi>          <mo>,</mo>          <mi>j</mi>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x3e;</mo>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>BaseMax</mi>         <mo>&#x2061;</mo>         <mo>(</mo>         <mi>j</mi>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mo>+</mo>        <mn>0.2</mn>       </mrow>      </mrow>     </mtd>    </mtr>    <mtr>     <mtd>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <msub>          <mi>CNV</mi>          <mn>0</mn>         </msub>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>i</mi>          <mo>,</mo>          <mi>j</mi>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mo>-</mo>        <mrow>         <mi>BaseMin</mi>         <mo>&#x2061;</mo>         <mo>(</mo>         <mi>j</mi>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>       </mrow>       <mo>,</mo>      </mrow>     </mtd>     <mtd>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>if</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mtext>   </mtext>        <msub>         <mi>CNV</mi>         <mn>0</mn>        </msub>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mrow>         <mo>(</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>i</mi>          <mo>,</mo>          <mi>j</mi>         </mrow>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x3c;</mo>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>BaseMax</mi>         <mo>&#x2061;</mo>         <mo>(</mo>         <mi>j</mi>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mo>-</mo>        <mn>0.2</mn>       </mrow>      </mrow>     </mtd>    </mtr>    <mtr>     <mtd>      <mrow>       <mn>0</mn>       <mo>,</mo>      </mrow>     </mtd>     <mtd>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>if</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mtext>   </mtext>         <mrow>          <mi>BaseMin</mi>          <mo>&#x2061;</mo>          <mo>(</mo>          <mi>j</mi>          <mo>)</mo>         </mrow>        </mrow>        <mo>-</mo>        <mn>0.2</mn>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x3c;</mo>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>CNV</mi>         <mn>0</mn>        </msub>        <mo>(</mo>        <mrow>         <mi>i</mi>         <mo>,</mo>         <mi>j</mi>        </mrow>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x3c;</mo>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>BaseMin</mi>         <mo>&#x2061;</mo>         <mo>(</mo>         <mi>j</mi>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mo>+</mo>        <mn>0.2</mn>       </mrow>      </mrow>     </mtd>    </mtr>   </mtable>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0422" num="0508">Single Cell Comparison of IDH-A and IDH-O Malignant Cells</p><p id="p-0423" num="0509">Applicants compared the average relative expression of each gene between all malignant IDH-A and IDH-O cells and defined a fold-change difference. To assign a P-value, Applicants shuffled the assignments of cells to tumor types 10,000 times and counted the fraction of times where an equal or larger difference is obtained for subsets of cells of the same size as the IDH-O and IDHO cells. Applicants then defined differentially expressed genes as those with fold-change of 2 and P&#x3c;0.01. The extent to which differential expression in single cell analysis recapitulates the differences observed in bulk analysis depends on the choice of specific thresholds, and therefore Applicants examined these fractions with a range of thresholds (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0032" level="2">Principal Component Analysis</heading><p id="p-0424" num="0510">Applicants performed principal component analysis (PCA) for the relative expression values of all malignant cells (as defined by CNV analysis). The covariance matrix used for PCA was generated using an approach previously outlined (61) to decrease the weight of less reliable &#x201c;missing&#x201d; values in the data. Due to the limited sensitivity of single cell RNA-seq, many genes are not detected in individual cells despite being expressed. This is particularly pronounced for genes that are more lowly expressed, and for cells that have lower library complexity (i.e., for which relatively fewer genes are detected), and results in non-random patterns in the data, whereby cells may cluster based on their complexity and genes may cluster based on their expression levels, rather than &#x201c;true&#x201d; co-variation. To mitigate this effect, Applicants assigned weights to missing values, such that the weight of E<sub>i,j </sub>is proportional to the expectation that gene i will be detected in cell j given the average expression of gene i and the total complexity (number of detected genes) of cell j.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0511">To further verify that the PCA results are not driven by library complexity Applicants compared the PCA results to those of shuffled data. Applicants iteratively swapped the expression of individual genes between pairs of cells with similar complexities, swapping each gene in each cell at least once. In that way Applicants shuffled the data and removed the biological clustering, but maintained the distribution of complexities across cells, as well as the distribution of expression levels for each gene. PCA over the shuffled data defined the complexity-based effect, as evident by a Pearson correlation of 0.96 between the PC1 cell scores and their complexities (in the original data this correlation is only 0.41). Applicants then compared PC1 gene scores between the original and the shuffled data (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b>D</figref>). While PC1 gene scores of most genes are comparable between the two analyses, the loadings of the oligo and astro gene-sets were highly affected. Oligo genes were originally associated with highly positive PC1 scores, and their scores are significantly decreased upon shuffling (97% of the oligodendroglial genes were among the 5% genes with the most decreased loadings, P&#x3c;10<sup>&#x2212;32</sup>); similarly, astrocytic genes were originally associated with negative PC1 scores, and their scores are significantly increased upon shuffling (all astrocytic genes were among the 5% genes with most increased loadings, P&#x3c;10<sup>&#x2212;32</sup>). As a result, none of the genes with highest and lowest PC1 scores (after shuffling) overlap with our oligodendroglial and astrocytic gene-sets. Thus, complexity does not account for the association of PC1 with the differentiation programs. Similarly, complexity clearly does not account for the PC2/3 stemness program, as PC2 cell scores are positively correlated with complexity (R=0.27), while PC3 cell scores are negatively correlated with complexity (R=&#x2212;0.24) and stemness genes were defined as those associated with both PC2 and PC3.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0512">PC1-Associated Genes and Lineage Scores</p><p id="p-0427" num="0513">The top correlated genes with PC1 scores (across all tumor cells) were defined as PC1-associated genes. Applicants focused on the genes with an absolute correlation value above 0.35, but note that other thresholds gave similar results (not shown). Of those genes, the subset that was differentially expressed by at least 3-fold between OC and AC mouse cells (97), and for which the two comparisons were consistent (i.e., PC1-positively correlated genes with higher OC expression, and PC1-negatively correlated genes with higher AC expression) were defined as the OC and AC lineage gene-sets. Lineage scores were then calculated as the average relative expression of the lineage gene-set minus the average relative expression of a control gene-set, i.e. Lin<sub>i,j</sub>=average[Er(G<sub>j,i</sub>)]&#x2212;average[Er(G<sub>j</sub><sup>cont</sup>,i)], where Lin<sub>i,j </sub>is the score of cell i to lineage j, G<sub>j </sub>is the gene-set for lineage j and G<sub>j</sub><sup>cont </sup>is a control gene-set for lineage j. The control gene-set was defined by first binning all 8008 analyzed genes into 25 bins of aggregate expression levels and then, for each gene in the lineage gene-set, randomly select 100 genes from the same expression bin. In this way, the control gene-set has a comparable distribution of expression levels to that of the lineage gene-set and the control gene set is 100-fold larger, such that its average expression is analogous to averaging over 100 randomly-selected gene-sets of the same size as the lineage gene-set.

Second, Applicants assigned negative scores to the cells with higher AC than OC scores (i.e. a cell with AC and OC scores of 0.1 and 1, respectively would be assigned a lineage score of &#x2212;1 while a cell with AC and OC scores of 1 and 0.1 would be assigned a lineage score of 1).</p><p id="p-0428" num="0514">PC2 3-Associated Genes and Stemness Scores</p><p id="p-0429" num="0515">Both PC2 and PC3 were associated with intermediate values of PC1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>) and therefore with presumably less differentiated cells, and Applicants considered their sum as a potential stemness program.

Applicants note that the expression programs are continuous and thus it is difficult to assign all cells to discrete subpopulations. Nevertheless, most cells are highly biased towards one of the three states, and the overall estimates are consistent between analysis of single cell RNA-seq data and tissue staining experiments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b>F</figref>, Table 4). Furthermore, very few cells (&#x2dc;1% on average, and 5% at most) scored for two programs simultaneously (with the same threshold of 0.5 and no additional criteria, Table 4), with an average frequency of &#x2dc;1% of and a maximal frequency of &#x2dc;5% cells across the different combinations of programs and different tumors.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="2">Definition of Cell Type-Specific Gene-Sets</heading><p id="p-0433" num="0518">Applicants defined astrocytic-specific, oligodendrocytic-specific, neuron-specific and endothelial specific gene-sets using RNA-seq data from sorted cell types from mouse brain (97).

The immediate impact of the co-deletion is reduction in the expression of all genes on the corresponding chromosome arms. Additional effects could reflect trans-effects, e.g. due to reduced expression of regulators on these chromosomes; while these effects are generally difficult to infer, one of the regulators on these chromosomes is CIC, which is further mutated (i.e. causing loss-of-function of the second allele) in most IDH-O tumors, and thus reduced CIC activity is a universal feature of IDH-O that is driven by both co-deletion and additional loss of function mutations. To infer the effects of reduced CIC activity, Applicants combined the results of two analyses. First, Applicants identified a subclonal CIC mutation in the oligodendroglioma MGH53, as described herein, and defined subsets of mutant cells and wild-type cells by single cell analysis, thus enabling a direct comparison and identification of differentially expressed genes within the same tumor. Second, Applicants compared the expression of all IDH-O TCGA tumors with a CIC mutation to those without CIC mutations and identified differentially expressed genes that are either activated or repressed by CIC, using a fold-change threshold of 2 and a t-test p-value of 0.01. Applicants combined the results of these two analyses to define putative sets of CIC repressed and activated genes.

However, this consistency is partial, reflecting the differences between differentiation programs as measured in mice (97) and as Applicants observe in IDH-A and IDH-O tumors. To refine the definition of these expression programs in the context of IDH-A, Applicants first scored each cell based on the expression of the above gene-sets to define initial astrocytic and oligodendrocytic scores (SC<sub>astro </sub>and SC<sub>oligo</sub>). Applicants then calculated the correlation of each gene with SC<sub>astro</sub>-SC<sub>oligo </sub>across all malignant IDH-A cells. The 50 genes with highest and 50 genes with lowest correlations were then used to define the refined astrocytic and oligodendrocytic scores (SC<sup>ref</sup><sub>astro </sub>and SC<sup>ref</sup><sub>oligo</sub>), which were used in all subsequent analyses. Thus, genes associated with glial differentiation that do not correlate with the program in the tumor cells were removed, while other genes which are not known to be involved in glial differentiation, but are co-expressed with the glial programs, are added, resulting in gene-sets which are coherently expressed across tumor cells but maintain high similarity to developmental glial expression programs. Applicants then scaled these scores to the range [0 1], by subtracting the minimal score and dividing by the range of scores.

Applicants thus defined a core set of 43 G1/S and 55 G2/M genes that included those genes that were detected in the corresponding expression clusters in all four datasets from the three studies described above (Table 2). As expected, the genes in each of those expression programs were highly co-regulated in a small fraction of the oligodendroglioma cells, such that some cells expressed only the G1/S or the G2/M programs and other cells expressed both programs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>). Plotting the average expression of these programs revealed an approximate circle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref>), which Applicants speculate describes the progression along the cell cycle.

In each tumor, Applicants compared the average relative expression of each gene between undifferentiated cells (differentiation score below 0.25) and differentiated cells (differentiation score above 0.4), separated into those with a higher astrocytic or a higher oligodendrocytic score. This resulted in two values of fold-change (undif vs. astro-like and vs. oligo-like) and two corresponding P-values, which were calculated by shuffling cell identities 10,000 times. Significant genes were defined in each tumor as those with a fold-change above 1.5 and a P-value below 0.05; Applicants used these lenient criteria within each tumor due to the limited number of undifferentiated cells, but then focused on genes that were significant across multiple tumors. A control analysis after shuffling cell identities within each tumor led to genes that were significant in one or at most two tumors, and thus Applicants used a threshold of significance in three tumors. Ninety genes satisfied this criterion. To restrict those genes to a subset of coherently regulated genes that may reflect a stemness program, Applicants hierarchically clustered the genes in IDH-A and in IDH-O using 1-R, where R is a Pearson correlation coefficient across all undifferentiated cells in the corresponding tumor type. In both IDH-A and IDH-O Applicants observed one dominant cluster; Applicants defined that cluster as the largest cluster when cutting the hierarchical clustering tree at a correlation of R=0.4.

PC1 genes were defined as those with a Pearson correlation above 0.3 (PC1-high genes) or below &#x2212;0.3 (PC1-low genes). Applicants then examined the expression of the mouse orthologs of those genes in mouse microglia and macrophages (130); since multiple types of macrophages were previously profiled Applicants considered the maximal expression and the average expression of each gene across those macrophage subtypes. Applicants then defined microglia-specific genes as those with at least a 5- fold higher expression in microglia than the maximal macrophage expression, and macrophage specific genes as those with at least a 5-fold higher maximal macrophage expression than microglia expression, as well as at least a 2-fold higher average macrophage expression than microglia expression. Applicants focused on the genes that were defined as both microglia-specific and PC1-high (CX3CR1, P2RY12, P2RY13 and SELPLG), and on genes defined as both macrophage-specific and PC1-low (e.g., CD163, CD74, TGFBI, IFITM2, IFITM3, F13A1, NPC2, TAGLN2 and FTH1); the average relative expression of those genes defined the microglia-specific and macrophage-specific scores, and their difference defined the macrophage vs. microglia score, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="2">Analysis of Whole-Exome DNA Sequencing Data</heading><p id="p-0441" num="0526">Output from Illumina software was processed by the Picard processing pipeline to yield BAM files containing aligned reads (bwa version 0.5.9, to the NCBI Human Reference Genome Build hg19) with well-calibrated quality scores (52, 53). Sample contamination by DNA originating from a different individual was assessed using ContEst57 (121). Somatic single nucleotide variations (sSNVs) were then detected using MuTect (55). Following this standard procedure, Applicants filter sSNVs by (1) removing potential DNA oxidation artifacts (122); (2) removing events seen in sequencing data of a large panel of &#x2dc;8,000 TCGA normal samples; (3) realigning identified sSNVs with NovoAlign (www.novocraft.com) and performing an additional iteration of MuTect with the newly aligned BAM files. sSNVs were finally annotated using Oncotator<sup>60</sup>. Sample purity and ploidy, as well as Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF) of identified sSNVs were determined by ABSOLUTE (35). Genome-wide copy-ratio profiles were inferred using CapSeg. Read depth at capture targets in tumor samples was calibrated to estimate copy ratio using the depths observed in a panel of normal genomes.

Bioinformatics 25; 2078-2079 (2009)). The fraction of cells in which Applicants identified these mutations was, on average, only 1.3% of the expected fraction estimated by ABSOLUTE. This low sensitivity primarily reflects the low coverage of the RNA-seq reads over the transcriptome of single cells. Accordingly, sensitivity was correlated with the expression levels of the genes that harbor the mutations, and reached 20.4% for the top 10% most highly expressed genes. Sensitivity was also affected by heterozygosity and allele-specific expression, since in some heterozygote mutant cells Applicants might only sequence the wild-type allele.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0528">Applicants used a targeted sequencing approach to increase our sensitivity for three specific mutations in MGH54 which were identified by WES but detected in very few cells by single cell RNA-seq. Applicants designed primers flanking these three mutations (in ZEB2, EEF1B2 and DNAJC4), PCR-amplified single cell cDNAs (frozen stocks of product from the pre-amplification reaction of the Smart-seq2 protocol) and sequenced the amplified material. This approach was applied for 1056 cells from MGH54. Mutant cells were defined as those with at least 50 reads that mapped to the mutant allele as defined by WES, and for which the fraction of mutant reads was at least 20% of all reads and 5-fold higher than the overall rate of mutant reads (in order to exclude a low rate of mutant reads due to PCR or sequencing errors). The mutations detected by this criteria were highly consistent with those identified from single cell RNA-seq (P&#x3c;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>, hypergeometric test) and uncovered 19 additional mutant calls (three for ZEB2, three for EEF1B2 and 13 for DNAJC4).</p><p id="p-0444" num="0529">Applicants next focused on the 23 subclonal mutations for which (1) the estimated clonal fraction by ABSOLUTE was at most 60%; (2) at least three cells were identified as harboring the mutation; and (3) at least one cell was identified as having a wild-type allele of the mutant gene. For each of those 19 mutations Applicants plotted the lineage and stemness scores of all mutant cells to examine their distribution of expression states (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>).

This approach focuses on the exact genomic context of the real mutations to obtain a reliable estimate of the false positive rate. This estimate is half the number of false mutations divided by the number of expected mutations (given 4 bases, one of which is the WT, there are two type of &#x201c;false mutations&#x201d; but only one type of &#x201c;expected mutations&#x201d;). The result of this analysis was an estimated false positive rate of 0.85%, suggesting that the confidence of each detected mutation is higher than 99%. Accordingly, even in the most extreme case (e.g. ZEB2) where only a single mutant cell is detected in one of the compartments of the hierarchy, Applicants still have a 99% confidence that the mutation is represented in that compartment.</p><p id="p-0446" num="0000">Mutation-Detecting qPCR and Analysis of CIC Mutations</p><p id="p-0447" num="0531">To detect CIC mutations in single cells from MGH53, Applicants performed qPCR using SuperSelective PCR primers, which are highly specific to single base changes due to a loop-out sequence adjacent to the mutant base (legacy.labroots.com/user/webinars/details/id/95).

First, by qPCR on artificial templates differing by only the mutant base. Second, by qPCR on cDNA of single MGH53 tumor cells for which RNA-seq already detected mutant or wild-type reads. These positive control reactions were highly consistent between duplicates and with the mutation status as inferred from RNA-seq: qPCR identified 7 out of 7 mutant cells and 12 out of 15 wild-type cells while the remaining three cells had no qPCR signal, and therefore all qPCR signal was consistent with RNA-seq data. Applicants also took advantage of the fact that CIC is located on chr19q which is deleted in MGH53 cancer cells and therefore each cell only contains one CIC allele (loss-of-heterozygosity, LOH). Thus, in a single MGH53 cancer cell, Applicants expect evidence of either mutant or wild-type CIC, but not both. Indeed, all cells with a signal in the positive control assay showed difference in Ct of at least 5 between mutant and wild-type reactions, consistent with LOH.</p><p id="p-0450" num="0533">cDNA was taken from frozen stocks of product from the preamplification reaction of the Smartseq2 protocol. 1 &#x3bc;l from each well of cDNA was used as template for a second round of Smartseq2 preamplification and bead purification in order to increase overall signal downstream. qPCR was performed with the Fast Plus EvaGreen qPCR Master Mix Low Rox (Biotium 31014-1) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the sole modification of adding EDTA to a final reaction concentration of 1.6 mM to enhance primer selectivity.

Of these, 61 cells had signal in both replicates for either mutant or wild type primers, but never for both.

To further filter the list of differentially expressed genes Applicants also compared the CIC mutant cells to the 671 unresolved cells (in which Applicants did not detect signal for either mutant or wild-type alleles by qPCR and by RNA-seq). Since the fraction of CIC mutants was estimated as 30% by ABSOLUTE Applicants expect the unresolved cells to be a mixture of &#x2dc;third CIC-mutants and &#x2dc;2/3 CIC-wild type cells, and thus CIC-regulated genes should also differ between this mixture and the CIC mutants but to a lower extent; Applicants used a threshold of 1.5-fold difference between the average expression in CIC mutants and in unresolved cells. The resulting set of differentially expressed genes is given in Table 6. Applicants simulated this analysis with 1,000 randomly selected sets of cells (to replace the CIC mutant and CIC wild-type cells) and found an average of only five upregulated genes by the same criteria, suggesting FDR&#x3c;0.1 for the genes upregulated by CIC mutation.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="1">Example 2: Decoupling Genetic, Developmental and Micro-Environmental Programs in IDH-Mutant Gliomas Through Single-Cell RNA-Seq</heading><p id="p-0453" num="0536">Applicants reasoned that scRNA-seq of a limited number of representative tumors could be combined with existing bulk data from large cohorts to decouple these distinct effects, and sought to apply this approach to understand the differences between two types of diffuse gliomas. In adults, diffuse gliomas are classified into three main categories based on integrated genetic and histologic criteria: IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and aggressive form of the disease, while mutations in IDH1/2 define two major classes of gliomas: astrocytoma (IDH-A) and oligodendroglioma (IDH-O) (98). IDH-A and IDH-O are two distinct tumor types that differ in their genetics, histopathology and prognosis. Genetically, IDH-A are characterized by TP53 and ATRX mutations, while IDH-O are characterized by mutations in TERT promoter and loss of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, defining a robust genetic separation into two disease entities (112). In histopathology, IDH-A and IDH-O are distinct and thought to predominantly recapitulate astrocytic and oligodendrocytic lineage differentiation, respectively. The notion that lineages differ between astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, as implied by their names, originates from distinct morphology and tissue staining. However, expression of both oligodendroglial (e.g., OLIG2) and astrocytic (e.g., GFAP) markers can be readily identified in both diseases (98), mixtures of cells with histological features of neoplastic astrocytic and oligodendroglial cells are frequently observed within individual tumors, and cellular morphologies are only partially reminiscent of distinct glial cells, thus questioning the hypothesis of distinct lineages. Two models may explain morphological differences in IDH-mutant gliomas: in one model, distinct glial cells or glial progenitor cells give rise to different types of gliomas; in another model, all IDH-mutant gliomas originate from the same progenitors, but distinct signature genetic events give rise to two different classes of tumors of different morphology (127).</p><p id="p-0454" num="0537">Applicants first sought to classify single cells into malignant and non-malignant. While genetic mutations may be used for such classification, mutation calling from scRNA-seq has limited sensitivity and specificity and combined single-cell DNA and RNA profiling is not yet scalable to thousands of cells (135, 136). Applicants thus combined two complementary approaches. First, gene expression clustering separated cells into three groups, consistent with programs of glioma cells, immune cells and oligodendrocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Second, since glioma cells frequently harbor large-scale chromosomal aberrations (112), Applicants estimated copy number variations (CNVs) from the average expression of genes in large chromosomal regions within each cell (69), and validated some of our predictions by whole exome sequencing and DNA FISH (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>; SOM). Expression-based and CNV-based classifications were highly consistent with one another, and Applicants used both criteria to identify 5,097 malignant cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The classification scheme was further validated by IDH mutations whose detection, while technically limited in scRNA-seq data, was highly specific to cells classified as malignant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>; P&#x3c;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>, hypergeometric test). Applicants then directly compared the IDH-A malignant cells to 4,044 malignant cells that Applicants recently profiled from six IDH-O tumors (137) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0455" num="0538">Surprisingly, only approximately half of the genes that were differentially expressed based on bulk TCGA samples were also differentially expressed between the single malignant cells of the two tumor types (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), suggesting that the remaining differentially expressed genes may reflect differences in the TME rather than differences in the expression programs of malignant cells. Indeed, most of the remaining expression differences between bulk samples involved either microglia/macrophage-specific genes or neuron-specific genes (SOM), which were preferentially expressed in bulk IDH-A or IDH-O samples, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C-E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). Differential expression between IDH-A and IDH-O was highly consistent both when considering microglia/macrophage-specific genes and when considering neuron-specific genes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>), allowing for the estimation of the relative abundance of microglia/macrophages and neuronal cells in each of the bulk tumors, based on the average expression of these two signatures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>). Thus, IDH-A tumors are associated with more microglia/macrophages and less neuronal cells than IDH-O tumors, with only few exceptions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>). Importantly, these differences are observed also between IDH-A and IDH-O tumors of the same clinical grade (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0456" num="0539">Next, Applicants focused on the expression differences between IDH-A and IDH-O that are significant both when comparing bulk samples and between single malignant cells of the two tumor types (SOM). Applicants reasoned that genetic differences might determine at least some of these differences and indeed observed that most genes with higher expression in single malignant cells in IDH-A are located on chromosomes 1p and 19q, which are co-deleted in IDH-O (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>). Loss-of-function of the transcriptional repressor CIC, another genetic event specific to IDH-O, accounted for an additional &#x2dc;10% of the expression differences (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>), as inferred from a CIC expression signature Applicants defined from analysis of single cells and bulk samples (SOM) (137, 116). Applicants also found a limited, yet significant, enrichment (P=0.018, hypergeometric test) of p53 targets among genes more highly expressed in IDH-O tumors, consistent with a mutated TP53 in IDH-A. Since the effects of TP53 mutations are context-specific, and since Applicants were unable to define the expression signature for ATRX mutations, Applicants expect that genetic mutations further contribute to the remaining differences. Taken together, these results suggest that differences between bulk TCGA expression signatures of IDH-A and IDH-O primarily reflect genetic influences (in the malignant cells) and TME composition.</p><p id="p-0457" num="0540">IDH-A and IDH-O are thought to primarily recapitulate the astrocytic and oligodendrocytic glial lineages, respectively (98). However, the results above demonstrate that most differences between IDH-A and IDH-O may be accounted by genetics and TME, and question the hypothesis of distinct lineages. Indeed, Applicants found only very limited differences in the expression of astrocyte-specific and oligodendrocyte-specific genes between IDH-A and IDH-O, either in bulk or in single cells profiles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Instead, the expression of these glial lineage genes varied substantially across the cells within each of the IDH-A tumors. After subtracting inter-tumor differences (SOM), principal component analysis (PCA) across all IDH-A cells demonstrated that PC1 and PC2 are associated with astrocyte-specific (PC1/2-high) and oligodendrocyte-specific (PC1/2-low) genes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>; P&#x3c;10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>, hypergeometric test). In a recent study (137), Applicants identified astrocyte specific and oligodendrocyte specific signatures (Table 2). Applicants refined the sets of glial lineage genes using the scRNA-seq data to define astrocyte-like and oligodendrocyte-like expression programs which co-vary across IDH-A cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>; SOM). These expression programs were not accounted for by inter-tumor differences, or by technical and batch effects (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>,B and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>), were reproduced in analysis of an additional 3,538 cells from two IDH-A tumors using a different protocol of single cell RNA-seq (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>), and were co-expressed also among IDH-O cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). Applicants scored individual cells in each tumor type for expression of these programs, and classified cells into those with preferential expression of each program, as well as into intermediate cellular states (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). All tumors had a wide distribution of cellular states, yet there were more IDH-A cells in intermediate states (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>). Interestingly, the distribution of single cell profiles from IDH-wildtype GBMs was drastically different, with a bias towards the astrocytic program, supporting the notion that the cellular architecture Applicants uncover in IDH-A and IDH-O is specific to IDH-mutant tumors and is not shared across all diffuse gliomas (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0458" num="0541">Since IDH-A and IDH-O contain diverse subpopulations with respect to glial differentiation programs, Applicants next investigated whether the 192 genes differentially expressed between the malignant compartments of IDH-A and IDH-O (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>) are shared across all malignant cells or whether they are specific to certain subpopulations. As expected, expression differences that could be accounted for by genetic influences (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>) were shared across all cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>). However, differences between IDH-A and IDH-O in the expression of the remaining (&#x201c;non-genetic&#x201d;) 83 differentially expressed genes were most pronounced when comparing the more differentiated cells. In particular, when Applicants scored each malignant cell for its degree of differentiation (i.e., maximal expression of oligodendrocyte-like and astrocyte-like programs), &#x201c;non-genetic&#x201d; expression differences between IDH-A and IDH-O are almost completely abolished among the most undifferentiated cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>). These results suggest that while the glial lineages are shared between IDH-A and IDH-O, some differences between these tumor types may be acquired during differentiation. Accordingly, undifferentiated cells from these tumor types might be functionally highly similar.</p><p id="p-0459" num="0542">Taken together, the data supports a model in which malignant cells in IDH-A and IDH-O (but not in IDH-wild-type tumors) share similar cellular lineages, but differ primarily by genetics. To further test this hypothesis, Applicants analyzed DNA bulk methylation patterns, as DNA methylation may preserve epigenetic signatures of the cell-of-origin that are not evident by gene expression analysis. Applicants found high similarity in DNA methylation between IDH-A and IDH-O compared to both IDH-wildtype gliomas and to IDH-mutant non-glioma tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). While DNA methylation is highly influenced by the IDH mutation, this high similarity is consistent with a shared histogenesis of IDH-A and IDH-O.</p><p id="p-0460" num="0543">The high degree of expression similarity between undifferentiated cells in IDH-A and IDH-O and the possibility that these might reflect stem/progenitor cells prompted the Applicants to further investigate their programs. In a recent study (137), Applicants identified cancer stem-like cells in IDH-O that display neural stem/progenitor programs and are highly enriched in cell cycle programs (Table 1). Generalizing this finding across all IDH-mutant gliomas classes, Applicants identified cycling cells based on expression of consensus cell cycle signatures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, SOM) (137, 124), and found that in both IDH-A and IDH-O only a small proportion of cells are proliferating (&#x2dc;4% on average in this cohort), and that there is an inverse correlation between proliferation and differentiation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). Remarkably, the fraction of cycling cells for a given state of differentiation is highly similar between IDH-A and IDH-O (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). This strongly supports a model in which proliferation and cell identity are tightly coupled in IDH-mutant tumors.</p><p id="p-0461" num="0544">Applicants derived a gene signature of the undifferentiated cells (excluding cycling cells) across the IDH-A and IDH-O tumors. Ninety genes were enriched within undifferentiated cells of at least three distinct tumors and were examined further for their co-expression among undifferentiated IDH-A and IDH-O cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). Applicants defined the subset of genes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>) that are both enriched and co-expressed in undifferentiated cells of both IDH-A and IDH-O as a putative glioma stemness program. Indeed, this program includes neurodevelopmental transcription factors (e.g., SOX4, SOX11 and TCF4) and is highly consistent with the expression program of human neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and with a program Applicants highlighted in IDH-O (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Applicants validated this tumor architecture in IDH-A tissues in a validation group of fourteen additional cases, showing in each tumor: (i) two lineages of glial differentiation, (ii) mutually exclusive expression of cycling (by Ki-67 staining) and differentiation (by ApoE expression) markers, and (iii) co-expression of cycling (Ki-67) and putative stem cell (SOX4) markers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>). This architecture has also been validated in a cohort of sixteen IDH-O (137).</p><p id="p-0462" num="0545">While IDH-A and IDH-O share the same lineage programs, these analyses reveal three inter-related differences: (1) the overall fraction of cycling cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>), and (2) of undifferentiated cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) are higher in our IDH-A cases; and (3) the two lineage scores are inversely related in IDH-O, consistent with a differentiation process in which one lineage represses the other, while such a relationship is not observed in IDH-A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D-E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0463" num="0546">Notably, all three aspects also vary significantly within the IDH-A tumors and partially correlate with tumor grade, such that higher grade tumors tend to have more cycling and undifferentiated cells and a more limited association between lineage programs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A-B</figref>). This provides a molecular fingerprint for tumor progression, as IDH-A tumors often begin as grade II lesions and gradually progress to grade III and IV. Applicants validated the correlation between the frequency of cycling cells (as reflected by the cell cycle program) with grade in analysis of TCGA bulk samples (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0464" num="0547">Next, Applicants hypothesized that the observed fingerprint of tumor grade-associated changes might also be reflected in clonal evolution, whereby genetically distinct subclones within the same tumor vary in their frequency of cycling and undifferentiated cells, and that selection favors the more aggressive subclones which tends to be enriched for proliferation and depleted for differentiation. To study genetic intra-tumoral heterogeneity, Applicants examined the CNVs inferred from single cell expression profiles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>), and predicted subclones in three of our tumors, MGH44, MGH57, and MGH103 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>, <b>15</b></figref>). In each of these cases, while the overall tumor architecture was preserved, Applicants also observed variability either in the fraction of cycling cells or in differentiation patterns. Overall, these cases together with two IDH-O cases (137), demonstrate that patterns of differentiation and proliferation can be partially modulated by genetics and be subjected to selection.</p><p id="p-0465" num="0548">Finally, Applicants analyzed the diversity of microglia/macrophage cells, the predominant subset of non-malignant cells in the TME (n=1,043 in IDH-A and 246 in IDH-O) using PCA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). The second PC (PC2) reflected an inflammatory program consisting of cytokines (IL1, IL8, TNF), chemokines (CCL3, CCL4), NF<sub>K</sub>B-related genes (REL, NFKBIA, NFKBIZ) and immediate early genes (JUNB, FOSB, EGR3, IER3, ATF3). The program was active in most non-tumoral cells across IDH-A and IDH-O tumors and is highly similar to our previously reported program in IDH-O (137). PC1 highlighted two mutually opposing programs, which were highly consistent with microglia (PC1-high) and macrophage (PC1-low) expression programs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). Top PC1-high genes included well-known microglia markers, such as CX3CR1, P2RY12 and P2RY13 (129), whereas CD163, TGFBI and F13A1 were among the PC1-low genes and are more highly expressed in diverse macrophage populations than in microglia (130) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). Thus, PC1 may correspond to the differences between brain-resident microglia, and infiltrating macrophages that reach the tumor through the circulation and must pass through the blood-brain barrier.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0549">However, scoring cells by the relative expression of microglia-specific to macrophage-specific genes revealed a continuum, rather than a bimodal distribution (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>), which is difficult to account for by a simple model of two populations (microglia and macrophages) and suggests additional influences on these expression programs. Accordingly, when Applicants performed RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) for CX3CR1 and CD163, Applicants observed some cells that co-express microglia and macrophage programs in tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>). Furthermore, even the top macrophage-like cells in gliomas have lower macrophage scores compared to macrophages from melanoma tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>) (126). Thus, the glioma microenvironment might have altered the expression profiles of macrophages, thereby decreasing their difference from microglia. Moreover, microglia/macrophages from each individual tumor had a limited range of scores, with some tumors biased towards macrophage-like (e.g. MGH42) and other towards microglia-like cells (e.g. MGH56) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>). This indicates that specific properties of the microenvironment of each tumor may be dominant over the immune cell-of-origin with respect to macrophage-like and microglia-like expression states, consistent with recent studies (129).</p><p id="p-0467" num="0550">This observed inter-tumor variability in macrophage/microglia states correlated with grade, such that cells from higher-grade tumors were preferentially associated with macrophage-like expression states. Applicants validated this association by comparing the expression of macrophage-specific and microglia-specific genes across grades in bulk TCGA IDH-A and IDH-O tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>) and by RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) for CX3CR1 and CD163 in the cohort described herein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>). These results suggest that early in their development, gliomas primarily contain brain-resident microglia-like cells, while macrophage-like programs are associated with higher grades, possibly coinciding with other grade-associated changes, such as increased angiogenesis and alterations of the blood brain barrier.</p><p id="p-0468" num="0551">Accordingly, this effect may parallel changes in tumor vascularity. Applicants derived a signature of endothelial-specific genes (SOM) and used their average expression to estimate the abundance of endothelial cells in each bulk tumor. This endothelial signature is correlated with the macrophage-specific, but not with microglia-specific, programs across IDH-O and IDH-A tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>). Moreover, the endothelial signature increases with tumor grade, paralleling changes in the macrophage-specific, but not microglia-specific, expression programs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>). While the endothelial program correlates with variability in the macrophage-like expression program between cells it does not account for the variability in the overall proportion of microglia and macrophages. IDH-A tumors have a considerably higher proportion of microglia+macrophage cells than IDH-O tumors, as noted above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), and this difference is not accounted for by endothelial cells or by grade (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0469" num="0552">To search for additional mechanisms that might regulate infiltration of macrophage/microglia cells into the tumor Applicants searched for genes that are not expressed by macrophage/microglia, but are correlated with the inferred abundance of macrophage/microglia cells across bulk tumor samples. Applicants found 24 genes which are correlated both with microglia and with macrophage expression across IDH-A tumors, and separately, across IDH-O tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>, left). Although these analyses were performed within a tumor type and thus were not directly influenced by differences between IDH-A and IDH-O, these genes were preferentially expressed in IDH-A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>, right), consistent with the increased macrophage/microglia signatures in IDH-A. While Applicants cannot determine if these association are causal (i.e., Applicants cannot distinguish whether these genes influence, or are influenced by, immune infiltration, or whether both are affected by a third hidden factor), the ability of this expression program to predict the extent of macrophage/microglia infiltration across tumors and tumor types (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>G</figref>) suggests interactions between immune infiltration and other cells in the tumor. Interestingly, three of those genes were components of the complement system, as Applicants recently observed in melanoma (126). Taken together, our observations (i) define for the first time microglia and macrophage programs in gliomas at single-cell resolution, (ii) associate the macrophage, but not the microglia program, with clinical grade and increased vascularity, (iii) highlight a continuity in transcriptional programs of microglia/macrophage in tumors (rather than a bimodal distribution), suggesting plasticity of cellular states, (iv) reveal an overall increase in microglia/macrophage infiltration in IDH-A compared to IDH-O, and (v) define a tumor expression signature associated with increased microglia/macrophage infiltration.</p><p id="p-0470" num="0553">In conclusion, the results described herein provide a general framework to decouple genetic, TME and lineage influences in cancer, combining single-cell analysis of a limited set of representative tumors with bulk samples collected for larger cohorts, such as those from TCGA. In IDH-mutant gliomas, this approach uncovers shared developmental lineages in IDH-A and IDH-O, suggesting that IDH-mutant gliomas are primarily composed of three subpopulations of cells including non-proliferating differentiated cells of two glial lineages, and proliferative undifferentiated cells that resemble neural stem/progenitor cells. The shared lineages and developmental hierarchies suggest a common progenitor for all IDH-mutant gliomas with NSC/NPC-like programs, shedding light on a longstanding debate in gliomagenesis (131).</p><p id="p-0471" num="0554">This study, as described herein, represents a shift in our understanding of the histogenesis of glial tumors and supports a model where, from a glial lineage perspective, IDH-mutant gliomas subclasses share lineages and differ primarily by genetic mutations and TME composition; all IDH-mutant glioma Applicants examined at single cell resolution, including 10 IDH-A and 6 IDH-O tumors by genetics and histopathology, contained mixed glial lineages and shared a developmental architecture. While the cohort is fairly limited, the cases have had little selection bias (consecutive cases operated at MGH), and the observations have been validated in larger cohorts by tissue staining and by analysis of the TCGA datasets.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0555">Given the similar developmental architecture of IDH-A and IDH-O, the morphological differences between these two entities might be linked to genetic differences between IDH-A and IDH-O and to TME composition. Accordingly, at least two genes involved in cytoskeleton and cell shape are downregulated by IDH-O-specific mutations. (I) glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker commonly used to assess lineages in histopathology, is regulated by CIC (137) and thus more highly expressed in IDH-A than IDH-O. (II) RHOC, encoding RhoC GTPase, a well-known regulator of cell shape and motility (138, 139) is located on chromosome arm 1p and therefore more highly expressed in IDH-A. Thus, signature genetic events might influence the morphology of cancer cells and underlie at least some of the histopathologic differences.</p><p id="p-0473" num="0556">Interestingly, Applicants also found a considerable difference in the TME composition of IDH-mutant gliomas, whereby IDH-A is enriched with microglia/macrophages signatures. These differences in TME composition may also at least in part be driven by genetic influences. For example, TP53 (mutated only in IDH-A) has been implicated with effects on inflammation and immune infiltration (140).</p><p id="p-0474" num="0557">While the data supports a shared architecture for all IDH-mutant gliomas, the cellular composition in other diffuse gliomas might differ; indeed, Applicants were not able to clearly identify a similar architecture in IDH-wildtype GBM; as much of the literature on cellular lineages in gliomas preceded the discovery of the IDH1/2 mutations, IDH-wildtype GBM might have confounded lineages in those studies. By analyzing for the first time IDH-mutant gliomas of different clinical grades (spanning II-IV) at single cell resolution, Applicants identified a potential molecular fingerprint of tumor progression, with support in TCGA datasets; these analyses suggest that high-grade lesions show increased proliferation, larger pools of undifferentiated cells, partially aberrant differentiation programs and increased infiltration by macrophages over resident microglia. Finally, from a therapeutic standpoint, the data shows for the first time that triggering cellular differentiation or targeting a specific stem cell phenotype with immunotherapies can be used for the treatment of these currently incurable malignancies.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="1">Example 3</heading><p id="p-0475" num="0558">The data described herein characterizing oligodendrogliomas is described in further detail below. Using human oligodendrogliomas as a model, Applicants profiled 4,347 single cells from six patient tumors by RNA-seq, reconstructed their transcriptional architecture and related it to genetic mutations. Application of larger scale single-cell profiling in grade II lesions may more definitively unmask developmental hierarchies in brain tumors, because low-grade gliomas are typically well differentiated and driven by a limited number of genetic events. To further limit inter-tumoral heterogeneity, Applicants focused on oligodendroglioma, a major glioma class that remains incurable (91) and is characterized by signature mutations in IDH1/2 and co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q. Applicants studied six grade II oligodendrogliomas where IDH1 R132H mutation (or IDH2 R172K mutation) and chromosome 1p/19q co-deletion were confirmed and that had not received pre-operative chemotherapy or radiation (Table 1; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>) (92).</p><p id="p-0476" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00005" num="00005"><table frame="none" colsep="0"

Three tumors were analyzed more deeply (MGH36, 53, 54; 791-1,229 cells per tumor that passed our quality controls) and three tumors (MGH60, 93 and 97) were profiled at medium depth (430-598 cells).</p><p id="p-0478" num="0560">Applicants distinguished malignant from possible non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment, by estimating chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) from the average expression of genes in large chromosomal regions within each cell (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>; Methods) (15). Each tumor contained a large majority of malignant cells with deletions of chromosomes 1p and 19q, the hallmarks of oligodendroglioma, as well as in some cases additional tumor-specific CNVs, which were validated by FISH and by DNA whole-exome sequencing (WES) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>28</b></figref>). In two tumors (MGH36, MGH97), CNV analysis pointed to the existence of two clones (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>,C) whereby Clone 2 harbored all the CNVs present in Clone 1, as well as additional CNVs, suggesting that Clone 2 was in each case derived through subsequent tumor evolution.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0561">Another 304 cells across the six tumors lacked any detectable CNVs, and clustered by gene expression into two subsets, which differed markedly from the malignant cells and expressed microglia and mature oligodendrocyte markers, respectively, consistent with being non-malignant cell types (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>). Applicants detected significant variability between the microglia cells, in which a set of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1A/B, IL8 and TNF), chemokines (CCL3/4) and early response genes were coordinately expressed by &#x2dc;80% of the microglia (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>). This expression program differs from canonical macrophage M1/M2 responses (94) and therefore suggests an unknown microglia expression program that appears to be glioma-specific.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0562">Applicants examined the heterogeneity of the cancer cells from the three tumors for which Applicants analyzed the largest cell numbers by a combined principal component analysis (PCA), while controlling for data quality per transcript and per cell and inter-tumor heterogeneity (Methods). Applicants identified two prominent groups of cells, corresponding to low and high PC1 scores (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>D</figref>) and expressing distinct lineage markers of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively. These results were highly consistent across all six tumors, and were not simply accounted for by technical and batch effects (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> and Note 1). Specifically, in each tumor, cells with high PC1 scores were strongly associated with high expression of 137 genes, including markers of oligodendroglial lineage (e.g., OLIG1/2, OMG), and with low expression of 128 genes, including markers of astrocytic lineage (e.g., APOE, ALDOC, SOX9) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>E</figref>, Table 2) (95). Cells with low PC1 scores had the opposite pattern of expression.

values of PC1 (shown both for PC2+PC3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>D</figref>), (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>C</figref>) and separately for PC2 and for PC3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>)), indicating a lack of differentiation and prompting us to explore additional programs. (As for PC11, these patterns were not the result of technical or batch effects; Note 1). 63 genes were associated with both PC2 and PC3 (Table 2). Several lines of evidence indicate that this represents a &#x201c;stemnness&#x201d; program. First, among the 20 highest-ranking genes associated with PC2/3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>) were SOX4, SOX11 and SOX2, neurodevelopmental transcription factors critical to neural stem cells and self-renewal of glioma stem cells (99-101). Additional genes with important roles in neurogenesis and in the CSC program of gliomas included the transcription factors NFIB and ASCL1, the chromatin remodeler CHD7, the cell surface protein CD24, and BOC and TCF4, which function in signaling pathways central to stem cell maintenance (74, 15, 99-104). Similar results were obtained by hierarchical clustering, showing a distinct cluster of cells that preferentially express these PC2/3-associated stemness regulators (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>). Second, several genes of this oligodendroglioma &#x201c;stemness&#x201d; program were previously identified by our study on single cell RNA-seq in primary human glioblastoma CSC (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>A</figref>, P=1.5*10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>for the overlap between the two stemness programs, hypergeometric test), albeit each program also contains specific regulators, such as CD24 which emerged as the top cell surface marker in the oligodendroglioma program. Third, analysis of the human brain transcriptome dataset from the Allen Brain Atlas showed that the expression of PC2/3-associated regulators was highest in early prenatal human brain samples and dropped significantly after birth, in childhood and adult samples, further indicating a role in neural development (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>, P=8*10<sup>18 </sup>for the enrichment of PC2/3-associated genes in prenatal vs. adult samples, t-test) (105). This pattern was particularly pronounced for SOX4 and for SOX11, which was the gene most significantly enriched in prenatal samples across the human genome (P=4*10<sup>&#x2212;50</sup>, t-test), while an opposite pattern was found for AC and OC lineage genes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>). Similarly, interrogating a recently published study of single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the human brain, Applicants identified several PC2/3-associated genes as preferentially expressed in single-cells in fetal human brain, while Applicants did not identify any adult human brain cell type expressing this signature (P=0.006 for enrichment of PC2/3-associated genes in the fetal vs. adult programs, hypergeometric test) (106). Based on these four lines of evidence, cells with intermediate PC1 values were thus separated into &#x201c;undifferentiated&#x201d; (low PC2/3) and &#x201c;stem/progenitors&#x201d; (high PC2/3) cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0484" num="0565">Oligodendrogliomas are often thought to arise from transformation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) (108), raising the possibility that the &#x201c;stem/progenitors&#x201d; PC2/3 genes may reflect an OPC-like program. However, the PC2/3-associated genes were not preferentially expressed in OPCs; instead, these genes were preferentially expressed in cells of neuronal lineage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>) (97, 123). Thus, although oligodendroglioma display only glial differentiation (both molecularly and histologically) and are thought to be derived from glial precursors, they may harbor rare cells that resemble primitive neural stem/progenitor cells that are normally tri-potent, capable of producing both glial lineages as well as neurons; genetic mutations may skew these tri-potent cancer cells towards generating glia (109,110). Consistent with this possibility, most PC2/3-associated genes, including SOX4 and SOX11, were upregulated upon activation of tri-potent mice neural stem cell (111) (NSCs) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref>; P=3*10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>, t-test).</p><p id="p-0485" num="0566">To further test the hypothesis that the stemness program is closely associated with tri-potent stem/progenitor cells, Applicants profiled by single-cell RNA-seq human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) isolated from fetal brain at 19 weeks of gestation and that can be differentiated into astrocytic, oligodendrocytic and neuronal lineages (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A-D</figref>). While Applicants observed variation in the expression programs of these NPCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>E-F</figref>), unbiased PCA of the single cell NPC profiles identified a program highly similar to the PC2/3-associated program of tumor cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>C</figref>, Table 3; P=2*10<sup>&#x2212;35</sup>, t-test). Thus, a common program is shared by subsets of our putative oligodendroglioma stem cells and normal NPCs and NSCs. Taken together, the analysis revealed three main expression patterns that recapitulate oligodendrocytic and astrocytic differentiation (PC1 high and low, respectively) and stem/progenitor programs of early neural development (PC2/3 high).</p><p id="p-0486" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00007" num="00007"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0"

defined an OC vs. AC lineage score and a sternness vs. differentiation score (Methods). Plotting these two scores across the cells of all three tumors together revealed a striking similarity to normal cellular hierarchies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>D</figref>), with a transition from a stem/progenitor program branching into differentiation along two glial lineages. Importantly, the same architecture was observed in each of the six tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>). Statistical analysis of the variation in lineage score compared to expected technical noise suggests that the transition involves intermediate states for each lineage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>), but the exact number of states and whether they are discrete or form a more continuous trajectory is difficult to determine due to technical limitations associated with noise in single cell RNA-seq data (Note 2).</p><p id="p-0488" num="0568">Applicants validated the generality of these findings in two ways. First, Applicants observed the same architecture when Applicants independently profiled one of the tumors (MGH60) with a different method for single cell RNA-seq (Methods; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>). Second, Applicants confirmed these patterns in tumors by both RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry with markers of AC (GFAP and APOE), OC (OLIG2, OMG) and stem/progenitor cells (SOX4, CCND2) performed in each of the original 6 tumors and in a validation cohort of ten additional tumors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>F</figref>,G, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> and Table 4).</p><p id="p-0489" num="0569">This architecture suggests a developmental hierarchy in which tumor stem/progenitor cells give rise to differentiated progeny. To assess how patterns of tumor proliferation and self-renewal may relate to the developmental hierarchy, Applicants next scored each cell for the expression of consensus gene sets for the G1/S phases and the G2/M phases, which Applicants defined based on consistent association with those phases across multiple datasets (Methods) (16, 124) Applicants found that only a small proportion of cells in each tumor (1.5-8%) are proliferating (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>-<b>34</b></figref>). The fraction of proliferating cells Applicants identified by expression program is within the expected range for oligodendrogliomas and comparable to the percentage of cycling cells identified by Ki-67 staining in these tumors, with the caveat that proliferation can vary substantially between different regions of the same tumor (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>). Applicants further distinguished cycling cells by their G1/S and G2/M scores, to identify four distinct cell cycle phases (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0490" num="0570">Strikingly, almost all cycling cancer cells were confined to the stem/progenitor and undifferentiated compartment of the tumor (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>,C, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>A</figref>,B), suggesting that this represents the compartment responsible for the growth of oligodendrogliomas in humans. Several lines of evidence support the finding that stem/progenitor and undifferentiated cells account for tumor proliferation. First, Applicants validated the co-expression of a stem/progenitor marker (SOX4) and the cell proliferation marker (Ki67) in tissue staining across 14 patients, as well as a negative correlation for cycling and glial differentiation markers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> and Table 4). Second, there is a strong correlation between our cell-cycle signature and our stem/progenitor signature across 69 bulk oligodendroglioma samples in the TCGA dataset (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>E</figref>) (112). Finally, the enrichment of cell cycle among stem/progenitor and undifferentiated cells was even more striking for cells inferred to be in G2/M phases compared to those in the G1 phase (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>C</figref>), possibly reflecting the short G1 phase observed in tissue and embryonic stem cells (113).</p><p id="p-0491" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00008"

frequency of cycling cells was low (&#x2dc;10%) even among stem/progenitors. Because cycling cells are a minority even among stem/progenitor cells, the PC2/3 stem/progenitor program did not include a signature for cell cycle. The notable exception is CCND2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>), a gene which plays a major role in controlling the cell cycle and was previously associated with self-renewal of glioma CSC (114). Interestingly, CCND2 was highly expressed both in cycling cells as well in non-cycling stem/progenitor cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b>A</figref>,B), consistent with previous work that implicated it in priming cells to enter the cell cycle (113). Stem/progenitor tumor cells preferentially express CCND2, whereas differentiated tumor cells express CCND1 and CCND3, mirroring the high expression of CCND2 in early neurodevelopment, which is later replaced by CCND1 and CCND3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b>C</figref>). CCND2 was also upregulated in activated mouse NSCs prior to entering the cell cycle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b>D</figref>). Taken together, these results indicate a role of CCND2 in both normal and malignant neural stem cell programs.</p><p id="p-0493" num="0572">Finally, Applicants explored the role of genetic events in shaping the cellular identity, devising two approaches to obtain genetic information from single cell RNA-seq and classify cells into tumor subclones. In the first approach, Applicants used the CNV inference (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>,C) of each cell to relate its genetic state with its transcriptional profile. In this approach, Applicants can ascertain the CNV features for every cell, but the number of genetic features is small (few CNVs). In the second approach, Applicants identified subclonal point mutations from bulk DNA whole-exome sequencing, using the ABSOLUTE method (35), and then searched for these mutations in the RNA-seq reads of individual cells (Methods). This approach assesses a larger number of mutations, but its sensitivity is limited by RNA-seq coverage, heterozygosity and allele-specific expression, such that Applicants could only ascertain (observe) mutations in a small fraction of cells compared to the expected subclonal fraction (Methods). Applicants performed whole-exome sequencing from bulk tumors and matched blood, identified tumor-specific single-point mutations (Table 5) and mapped them to our single profiled cells based on RNA-seq reads that harbored these exact mutations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>C</figref>). However, the confidence of the ascertained mutations is illustrated by a low estimated false positive rate (&#x3c;1%) (Methods) and by validation of a subset of mutations by qPCR (below) and targeted sequencing (Methods). The genetic information obtained with these two approaches is partial and is not sufficient to reconstruct a full phylogenetic tree. However, Applicants reasoned that it is sufficient to test if each subclonal genetic feature is restricted to a certain developmental state or if alternatively, according to the model of non-genetically-driven hierarchy, subclones span distinct developmental states (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0494" num="0573">Applicants observed the same 3 sub-population architecture within distinct CNV sub-clones in MGH36 and in MGH97 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>C</figref>), with cycling stem/progenitor cells and two lineages of differentiated non-cycling cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>,B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref>). This suggests that distinct CNV profiles do not dictate a specific cellular state, and rather that developmental programs are over-imposed over CNV clones. Similarly, examining the distribution of transcriptional states for cells that harbor subclonal point mutations, Applicants found that 23 subclonal point mutations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>C</figref>,D and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>) and a subclonal loss-of-heterozygosity event (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>) are not significantly restricted to particular developmental states and often span all three states. In particular, these include multiple cases with low subclonal fraction (&#x3c;12% based on ABSOLUTE) that nevertheless span all three compartments in the transcriptional hierarchy (e.g., point mutations in ZEB2, EEF1B2, FTH1, FRG1B, and CNV clone 1 in MGH36). Regardless of whether a mutation has low fraction because it arose early (and did not rise in frequency) or late (and is thus a minor deep branch), the fact that it spans all compartments strongly argues against a genetic explanation.</p><p id="p-0495" num="0574">Thus, our approach, applied across CNVs and multiple point mutations provides many examples of distinct genetic subclones that span the developmental hierarchy. This indicates that oligodendroglioma's developmental hierarchy is largely maintained during genetic evolution. The presence of a similar hierarchy in each of the tumors examined and across multiple subclones within each tumor, together with the lack of shared subclonal mutations across these oligodendrogliomas, strongly argues that the hierarchy is not driven by genetics.</p><p id="p-0496" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="441pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 5</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Mutations identified by DNA whole exome sequencing of tumor tissue and matched</entry></row><row><entry>blood, their ABSOLUTE-estimated clonal fraction</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>cancer cell</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>fraction</entry><entry>Variant_</entry><entry>Reference_</entry><entry>Alternative_</entry><entry>cDNA_</entry><entry>Protein_</entry></row><row><entry>Hugo_Symbol</entry><entry>Chromosome</entry><entry>position</entry><entry>(ABSOLUTE)</entry><entry>Classification</entry><entry>Allele</entry><entry>Allele</entry><entry>Change</entry><entry>Change</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="441pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>MGH53</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>DDX11L1</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>15906</entry><entry>0.28</entry><entry>RNA</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>G</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>DDX11L1</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>15922</entry><entry>0.21</entry><entry>RNA</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>G</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>PLCH2</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>2435349</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>Intron</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>C</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>PLCH2</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>2435352</entry><entry>0.89</entry><entry>Intron</entry><entry>T</entry><entry>C</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>PLCH2</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>2435357</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>Intron</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>C</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>NBPF1</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>16892724</entry><entry>0.04</entry><entry>Intron</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>T</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Unknown</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>16974745</entry><entry>0.08</entry><entry>IGR</entry><entry>G</entry><entry>A</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>ZNF362</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>33747370</entry><entry>0.96</entry><entry>Missense_Mutation</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>G</entry><entry>c.866A &#x3e;

While most subclonal mutations were of unknown functional relevance, Applicants were intrigued by the identification of a subclonal CIC mutation in MGH53 (&#x2dc;30% frequency by ABSOLUTE). CIC is a known tumor suppressor in oligodendroglioma (115), and this missense p.R1515C mutation, also observed in four patients in the TCGA cohort (112) (the second most common across 66 patients with any CIC mutation). CIC is haploid (as it is coded on chromosome 19q) and thus allows us to ascertain both mutant and WT status. Because RNA-seq reads detected the CIC mutation in only 7 of MGH53 cells, Applicants tested its presence in additional cells using a mutation-sensitive qPCR approach and were able to ascertain 28 CIC mutant cells (including validation of all 7 cells detected by RNA-seq reads) and 27 CIC wild-type MGH53 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>D</figref>). Importantly, Applicants identified a signature of expression changes between the CIC mutant and WT cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>E</figref>, Table 6), including increased expression of the transcription factors ETV1 and ETV5, which were recently shown to be regulated by CIC (116). Despite these specific transcriptional changes that accompany tumor progression, both CIC mutant and CIC wild-type cells spanned all the tumors' subpopulations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.

subclonal mutations span the cellular hierarchy defined by expression profiles and strongly argue that this hierarchy reflects non-genetic states. Similar results were also obtained for analysis of a loss-of-heterozygosity event in MGH54 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>). While our genetic analysis does not cover all possible mutations due to technical limitations, Applicants note that the alternative model of genetically-driven hierarchy would predict that all subclonal mutations should conform to a global phylogenetic structure that distinguishes between tumor compartments, and is thus highly inconsistent with our results (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>). Interestingly, Applicants also identified down-regulation of GFAP in CIC mutant cells, possibly contributing to the weaker GFAP expression in oligodendrogliomas than astrocytomas (95). Despite these specific transcriptional changes, both CIC mutant and CIC wild-type cells spanned all the tumors' subpopulations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>D</figref>), further indicating that the tumor hierarchy is maintained during clonal evolution.</p><p id="p-0500" num="0577">While genetic events do not appear to define the hierarchy, they may nevertheless influence it. The two clones detected in MGH36 and MGH97 each included cells from all three compartments of the cellular hierarchy, yet they differed in their relative distributions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>,B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref>). Clone 1 of MGH36 displayed higher frequency of stem/progenitors (P=4*10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup>, Fisher's exact test) while clone 2 displayed higher frequency of AC-like cells (P=2*10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup>). Similarly, clone 2 of MGH97 contained higher frequency of stem/progenitors (P&#x3c;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>) suggesting that genetic evolution may have modulated the patterns of self-renewal and differentiation in these tumors. Furthermore, the frequencies of cycling cells were higher in clone 1 of MGH36 and in clone 2 of MGH97, consistent with their increased frequencies of stem/progenitors. In MGH36 Applicants also observed rare OC-like cells in the G1/S phases exclusively in clone 2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref>). Thus, the coupling between cell cycle and stemness may also be partially affected by genetic events.</p><p id="p-0501" num="0578">In conclusion, this large-scale analysis of single-cell composition in grade II gliomas uncovers a developmental hierarchy shared across multiple oligodendrogliomas and multiple genetic subclones, indicating a model of tumorigenesis where a subpopulation of stem/progenitor cells propagates these tumors in humans, while accruing new mutations, as well as giving rise to differentiated and non-cycling cells of two distinct glial lineages with similar genotypes. Indeed, this hierarchy is recapitulated in clones that are genetically distinguishable in our data, such as in CIC wild-type vs. mutant cells. Interestingly, our single-cell data indicate that oligodendroglioma stem/progenitor cells resemble a primitive tri-potent neural cell type, such as NSC or NPC, more so than a more committed glial progenitor like an OPC(108, 117).</p><p id="p-0502" num="0579">One limitation of studying low-grade oligodendrogliomas is that Applicants could neither perform functional validation of tumoral lineages nor test the capacity of different populations to initiate tumors in animals, since human grade II oligodendrogliomas do not grow in mouse xenograft assays, and even in-vitro models are sparse and maintain only limited similarity to cancer cells in situ. Yet our approach and analyses highlight the key role of single cell genomics as a tool for unbiased analysis of single-cell states directly in patient tumors, without confounding factors such as xenogeneic milieu and conditions that are drastically different from the native environment (72). Outlining genetic from non-genetic influences&#x2014;albeit with limitations in sensitivity due to single cell RNA-Seq&#x2014;allows us to present an integrated model of how diverse genetic clones, each with their own developmental hierarchy, coordinate tumor maintenance and evolution in humans, unifying the cancer stem cell and the genetic models of cancer in this clinical context (72) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0503" num="0580">The results described herein highlight a subpopulation of undifferentiated cells that possess stem cell transcriptional signatures and also show enriched proliferative potential. Thus, the most primitive and undifferentiated population of cancer cells are the main source of proliferating cells in patients with oligodendroglioma. This might explain the relative clinical sensitivity of these tumors to treatments that selectively kill proliferating cells such as radiochemotherapies (118). At least early in their pathogenesis these tumors may maintain hierarchies from normal development with stem cells that robustly follow differentiation programs, leaving oligodendroglioma stem cells as the only cycling populations. This architecture might differ in other brain tumors and in higher-grade lesions where differentiation might be compromised. By providing the genome-wide transcriptional signature of cancer stem/progenitor cells in oligodendroglioma, this work delineates cellular programs that represent valuable targets to impact tumor growth. The verticality of the observed hierarchy indicates that, in this clinical context, triggering cells to differentiate along one of two glial axes may yield therapeutic benefit. It is postulated that further studies, deploying large-scale single-cell profiling technologies in genetically defined human malignancies will demonstrate the generality of our findings and investigate opportunities for clinical translation.</p><p id="p-0504" num="0581">Note 1. Accounting for the impact of technical and batch effects. Applicants used several approaches to ascertain that our transcriptional signatures are observed independently of technical effects. First, different batches are indistinguishable with respect to the expression hierarchy, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>B</figref>. Second, to minimize the impact of technical effects, namely the differences in complexity (e.g. the number of genes detected per cell), Applicants use a weighted version of principal component analysis as described in Methods. Third, the biological clusters Applicants describe are not driven by complexity. As described in Methods, Applicants performed control PCA on shuffled data. Comparison of the PCA on the original and shuffled data (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>D</figref>) shows that the OC-like and AC-like genes used in our analysis lose their association with PC1 in the shuffled data, indicating that their patterns are not driven by complexity. Similarly, complexity does not account for the PC2/3 stemness program, as PC2 cell scores are positively correlated with complexity (R=0.27), while PC3 cell scores are negatively correlated with complexity (R=&#x2212;0.24) and stemness genes were defined as those correlated with both PC2 and PC3.</p><p id="p-0505" num="0582">Note 2. Assessing the presence of intermediate differentiation states. Technical noise is not expected to distinguish functionally-related from functionally-unrelated sets of genes. Within a given cell, the level of each gene can be over-estimated or under-estimated due to the capture of only a subset of transcripts and their potentially biased amplification; but there is no reason to expect that two functionally related genes will have the same pattern, i.e., commonly over-estimated or commonly under-estimated, except as correlated to their global expression levels. That is, the exception is if the two genes are both highly expressed or both lowly expressed and thus could be commonly affected by the &#x201c;complexity&#x201d; of single cell libraries, such that two lowly expressed genes tend to be undetected in cells with a lower overall number of detected genes. However, this does not affect our lineage scores, both because the set of AC and OC genes are not associated with very different overall expression levels, and because Applicants use &#x201c;control&#x201d; gene-sets with comparable expression levels when defining lineage scores. In each of the three tumors that Applicants profiled at high depth, and within each of the two lineages Applicants find significant co-expression patterns that suggest distinct differentiation states (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref>). For example, within the AC lineage, Applicants find significant co-expression patterns in the range of 0.5 to 1, as well as within the range of 1 to 2. However, in more limited ranges Applicants typically do not detect significant co-expression patterns (e.g., in the range 1.5 to 2, Applicants detect significant co-expression only in one of the three tumors). Applicants conclude that cells likely exist in distinct stages of differentiation although the number of distinct states may be limited.</p><heading id="h-0045" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0506" num="0000"><ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0583">1.
