For example, in commercial cellular applications, rapid increases in a number of end-users and complexity of mobile applications of recent decades have demanded a wireless communications solution that provides low latency while achieving high instantaneous data rates in a complicated physical environment with an unknown (a priori) number of users with unknown locations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One solution to increase data rates includes moving to higher carrier frequencies, e.g., including millimeter wave frequencies operating at K-band and above, in which traditional narrowband designs lead to high absolute operating bandwidths. However, any move to such extreme frequencies does not come without cost. One such approach, termed 5G New Radio (NR) marks a paradigm shift from omnidirectional to directive communications as higher-gain antennas are required to maintain a constant-power link as the carrier frequency increases. Such requirements of high gain are a consequence of the Friis equation, which states that, for given antenna gain on transmit and receive, the receive power is inversely proportional to the square of the operating frequency. The current solution to this spatially-multiplexed paradigm is a phased array.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings

communications systems in general, and to next-generation wireless communications systems with high-dimensional, low-resolution architectures for power-efficient wireless communications in particular. Other embodiments are described in the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">One or more aspects of the subject disclosure include a receiver device that includes A radio receiver, including a local oscillator (LO) adapted to provide an LO signal. The LO generates a prominent LO frequency that approximates a carrier frequency of a received RF signal, the received RF signal having a carrier wave component operating at the carrier frequency within a millimeter wave spectrum and an information component, wherein the information component is based on a phase shift keying (PSK) modulation of the carrier wave component. The receiver device also includes an RF signal combiner that includes a first RF input port adapted to accept the received RF signal, a second RF input port coupled to the LO and a baseband output port. The signal combiner is adapted to combine, without multiplication, the RF signal and the LO signal to obtain a first combined output signal. In at least some embodiments, the receiver device includes a non-linear energy detector in communication with the baseband output port and adapted to generate a detected baseband signal based on the first combined output signal. An amplitude of the detected baseband signal corresponds to an in-phase portion of the RF signal, which conveys information of the information component.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">One or more aspects of the subject disclosure include a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radio, including an LO adapted to provide an LO signal that includes an LO frequency that approximates a carrier frequency of a received wireless MIMO signal. The received MIMO signal has a carrier wave component operating at the carrier frequency within a millimeter wave spectrum and an information component, wherein the information component is based on a PSK modulation of the carrier wave component. The MIMO radio further includes multiple radio modules, each adapted to provide a respective low-resolution output signal responsive to the received wireless MIMO signal. Each of the radio modules includes a respective RF signal combiner that includes a first RF input port adapted to accept a respective received RF signal responsive to the received wireless MIMO signal received via the wireless channel. Each of the radio modules further includes a second RF input port coupled to the LO and an output port. The signal combiner is adapted to combine, without multiplication, the RF signal and the LO signal to obtain a respective combined output signal. Each of the radio modules further includes a respective envelope detector communicatively coupled to the respective baseband output port. The respective envelope detector is adapted to detect, via the respective combined output signal, information modulated onto the received wireless MIMO signal prior to transmission via the wireless channel, to obtain a respective detected baseband signal. An amplitude of the respective detected baseband signal corresponds to an in-phase portion of the RF signal. The MIMO radio further includes a digital processor communicatively coupled to the plurality of radio modules and adapted to determine an estimate of the information modulated onto the received wireless MIMO signal prior to transmission according to the respective digital signal of each of the plurality of radio modules.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">One or more aspects of the subject disclosure include a process that includes receiving an RF signal to obtain a received RF signal having a carrier wave component operating at a carrier frequency within a millimeter wave spectrum and an information component based on a PSK modulation of the carrier wave component. The process further includes obtaining an LO signal including an LO frequency, wherein the LO frequency approximates the carrier frequency, and combining, without multiplication, the received RF signal and the LO signal to obtain a first combined output signal. The in-phase portion of the first output signal is detected from the first combined output signal via a non-linear energy detector to obtain a first detected signal. An amplitude of the first output signal corresponds to an in-phase portion of the RF signal, wherein the first output signal comprises information of the information component.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">High-resolution, high peak-to-average-power communication modulation formats such as OFDM (LTE) have traditionally required both the base station (BS) and user equipment (BE) to maintain a high degree of linearity. An imposition of such linearity requirements, however, limits efficiencies and indirectly a maximum practical power output of a transmitter. Such linearity requirements have also necessitated any mixing circuits as may be used in either transmit or receive operation, to incorporate high-powered local oscillators. Linearity in gain stages and low noise amplifiers is also paramount. This ultimately results in a system with inefficient amplification and high-power requirements. In a massive MIMO deployment scenario, the power consumption of the transceiver system scales roughly linearly with the number of transmitter/receiver (Tx/Rx) elements, which can prove impractical for systems employing high peak-to-average power ratio modulations requiring traditional highly-linear design. This downside is further compounded in the phased array system, which employs high-resolution complex amplitude control, typically in the RF chain, to achieve beamforming at the expense of power consumption and efficiency.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The example embodiments disclosed herein use low-resolution, e.g., single-bit or perhaps a few bit, transmitters and/or receivers and/or transceivers as means of relaxing the linearity and power requirements of next-generation wireless communications. An easily replicable, low power, low cost, RF-in, bits-out one-bit receiver cell forms the basic building block of a nonlinear MIMO cellular system. This transceiver architecture enables simple beamforming in the digital domain.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The devices, systems and techniques disclosed herein may be applicable to any wireless communications application, but are particularly suitable for high-frequency cellular communications operating at frequencies within K-band and above K-band, at which the propagation characteristics of microwave and millimeter-wave signals typically rely on high-gain antennas and encourage spatial multiplexing. The inherent spectral inefficiency of low-resolution modulation schemes becomes less of a concern when fewer end users are sharing identical space-bandwidth. Additionally, as the carrier frequency increases, solid-state amplifiers are less able to provide gain due to transistor parasitics, which result in a finite maximum operating frequency that further increases complexity and power consumption for a given output power. At least one counterintuitive technique disclosed herein is to operate one or more RF signal processing devices, such as LOs, signal combiners, square law detectors and/or transistor amplifiers in their most efficient nonlinear regime to reduce power consumption.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The illustrative examples provided herein include ultra-low-power, low-complexity, scalable radio receivers, such as the example MIMO radio cells. These radio cells exploit nonlinearities in their devices and/or circuits to obtain very low power consumption and ease of fabrication in a variety of technologies for wide bandwidths and at very high carrier frequencies. Such radio cell may include a receiver or a transmitter or receiver and transmitter. In at least some embodiments, the radio cell is configured to demodulate or to modulate or to modulate and demodulate a single bit, or perhaps a few bits, e.g., two bits per symbol. If more bits are used, then it is possible to modulate the carrier's amplitude (in addition to the phase modulation already mentioned) to achieve low-resolution complex (I/Q) modulation. At least some of the illustrative example radio cells disclosed herein include energy detectors, such as envelope detectors and/or square law detectors that utilize detection directly from a received RF carrier, without requiring down-conversion and/or the use of mixers and/or local oscillators, such as U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/988,103, entitled &#x201c;Ultra-Low-Power Millimeter-Wave to Baseband Receiver Module for Scalable Massive MIMO,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other illustrative example radio cells disclosed herein include signal combiners adapted to convert phase modulated signals, e.g., PSK signals, to amplitude modulated signals, e.g., pulse amplitude modulated signals suitable for detection by energy detectors, such as the aforementioned envelope detectors and/or square law detectors. Beneficially, such single-bit receivers and/or transmitters and/or transceivers relax linearity and power requirements of next-generation wireless communications. The simple radio cells disclosed herein are low power, low cost, easily replicable RF-in, bits-out, low-bit receivers, e.g., one-bit receivers, that form basic building block of a nonlinear MIMO cellular system. It is understood that, without limitation, such transceiver architectures enable simple beamforming in the digital domain.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a block diagram is shown illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a communications network <b>100</b> in accordance with various aspects described herein. For example, communications network <b>100</b> can facilitate in whole or in part receiving, by a first radio module at a first location, a wireless MIMO signal, to obtain a first received RF signal. The wireless MIMO signal includes information originating at a remote MIMO transmitter and conveyed via a wireless channel. An envelope of the first received RF signal is detected by the first radio module without requiring a local oscillator, to obtain a first detected baseband signal. The first detected baseband signal is compared to a reference value to obtain a first digital signal that is provided to a digital processor. The digital processor also obtains a second digital signal from a second radio module receiving the wireless MIMO signal at a second location and determines an estimate of the information originating at the remote MIMO transmitter according to the first and second digital signals.

Wireless communication signals propagate between the transmitter portion <b>201</b> and the receiver portion <b>202</b> via a wireless channel <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The example nonlinear receiver portion <b>202</b> uses an RF-in, bits-out approach that is well-suited for a low-cost, low-power solution to the scaling problem that arises in massive MIMO. The receiver portion <b>202</b> may include one or more highly efficient antenna-coupled nonlinear amplifiers and one or more low-power RF signal processing elements that may include detector elements. Low-power RF signal processing elements may include, without limitation, power dividing/summing devices, such as Wilkinson power dividers, local oscillators operating at low power and/or nonlinear rectifying elements, e.g., diodes, that facilitate a direct-to-baseband demodulator, sometimes referred to as an on-off-keying (OOK) demodulator. The low-powered LO, when applied to a mixer, is sometimes referred to as a starved mixer. By combining a received PSK-modulated RF signal with an LO signal operating at the RF carrier, the PSK signal can be converted to one or more PAM signals, e.g., I and/or I and Q PAM signals. The resulting PAM signals are provided to a detector element to obtain baseband output signals. In at least some embodiments, baseband signals can be digitized, e.g., using a comparator that may be configured with a fixed and/or an adjustable threshold upon which comparisons are determined.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is understood that in at least some embodiments baseband processing may occur prior to digitization. For example, one or more of gain, filtering and/or attenuation may be applied to one or more of the baseband signals. Filtering may include passive filtering and/or active filtering. In a massive MIMO deployment, the digital outputs of each nonlinear receiver chain may be further processed in a digital domain to achieve an enhanced, and ideally a maximum channel capacity. In a full-rank channel, capacity saturates with the number of transmitters, assuming more receivers than transmitters, one-bit-per-transmitter as the signal to noise ratio increases. Consequently, more than one bit-per-channel use may be achieved as a number of transmitter and receiver chains increase; this is exemplified by the trivial case of M single-input-single-output (SISO) channels with one transmitter and one receiver, which can achieve M bits-per-channel use.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although the illustrative examples disclosed herein refer to envelope detection or OOK, it is understood that other communication techniques may be used.

It is understood that some embodiments may not require a separate antenna coupler <b>213</b>. Alternatively or in addition, at least some embodiments may not require an amplifier <b>214</b>. Depending on the desired degree of baseband analog processing, some embodiments may not require the baseband amplifier <b>216</b>. For example, a minimal MIMO radio module may include an antenna <b>211</b>, an RF signal processing/detection module <b>215</b> and a 1-bit ADC, without necessarily requiring one or more of the antenna coupler <b>213</b> or the RF amplifier <b>214</b> and baseband amplifier <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In at least some embodiments, the RF signal processing/detection module <b>215</b> receives an LO signal to facilitate detection of PSK and DPSK signals. In some embodiments, the MIMO radio cell <b>210</b> includes an LO <b>209</b> (shown in phantom) that provides an LO signal operating at a carrier wave frequency of the received RF signals. The LO <b>209</b> is operated in a low-power configuration, resulting in a so-called &#x201c;starved&#x201d; mixer, in which the LO signal level biases a nonlinear element such as a diode well below the threshold voltage/built-in potential., e.g., a diode, of a mixer and/or a signal detector to which the LO signal may be applied. In some embodiments, the LO <b>209</b> is integral to the RF signal processing/detection module <b>215</b>. Alternatively or in addition, the LO <b>209</b> may be separate from the RF signal processing/detection module <b>215</b>, but integral to the MIMO radio cell <b>210</b>. It is envisioned that in at least some embodiments, a single LO module <b>209</b> may supply an LO signal to more than one such RF signal processing/detection modules <b>215</b> and/or to more than one MIMO radio cells <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the LO <b>209</b> may be phase locked to the received RF signal, e.g., using feedback control, such as a phase locked loop (PLL). Alternatively or in addition, the LO <b>209</b> may operate without necessarily being phase locked to the RF signal, e.g., without an application of feedback control to further simplify the radio architecture.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Due to the very large bandwidths available in millimeter wave spectrum, digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and ADCs must work at very high sampling rates. Since their power consumption scales approximately linearly in the sampling rate and exponentially in the number of bits per sample, only very few data converters are employed in state-of-the-art systems and a base station with hundreds of antenna elements may only have a handful of data converters. Unlike fully analog beamforming systems, where phase and amplitude can individually be controlled per antenna element, limiting the number of data converters compromises robustness and mobility rendering millimeter wave spectrum less attractive for new use cases such as ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Such simplified, or minimal complexity MIMO radio cells <b>210</b> offer several advantages. For example, a minimally complex module or cell may occupy a relatively small area of a MIMO receiver portion <b>202</b>. Space savings may be advantageous for mobile device applications, e.g., for a mobile phone, a tablet, a PC, for appliance applications, such as smart TVs, and/or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, e.g., home appliances, printers, security system components, surveillance cameras, residential controllers, personal assistants, cloud-based voice service appliances, and the like. In the illustrative example, the dipole antenna <b>218</b> has a maximum dimension determined by its length, L. The example MIMO radio cell <b>210</b> occupies an area defined by the dipole antenna length L, and a module width, W. In at least some embodiments (possibly with a LO generated elsewhere), the width W is less than the length L, i.e., W&#x3c;L, such that an area occupied by the module is less than a square of the maximum antenna dimension, i.e., A=L&#xd7;W&#x2264;L<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Dimensions of an antenna, such as the example dipole antenna <b>218</b>, which happens to be a bowtie type of dipole antenna adapted to provide a relatively wide operational bandwidth, may be determined from an antenna calculator. For example, a length L may be determined according to: L=0.75 &#x212b;. Likewise, a width w may be determined according to w=0.25 &#x212b;. For example, the MIMO radio cell <b>210</b> configured to operate in the Ka band, having a frequency between about 26.5-40 GHz, and a corresponding free-space wavelength between about 11.1 and 7.5 mm. Assuming operation at a center frequency of about 33 GHz, the free-space wavelength is about 9.1 mm, may have a length L&#x2248;6.8 mm and a width w&#x2248;2.3 mm. Accordingly, an area occupied by a Ka band MIMO radio may be less than about 7 mm&#xd7;7 mm&#x2248;50 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Other advantages of simplified, or minimal complexity MIMO radio cells <b>210</b> include relatively low power requirements and relatively low thermal load. According to the examples disclosed herein, the MIMO radio cells <b>210</b> use simple energy detectors, such as envelope detectors, or square law detectors. Such simple detectors may operate on the received RF signal directly without requiring any local operator and/or mixing to obtain an intermediate frequency between RF and baseband, as would be typical for millimeter wave digital communication systems. Rather the simple detectors may obtain a baseband signal directly from the RF signal according to an envelope of the RF signal and/or from a PSK and/or DPSK type receiver employing a low powered LO in combination with a nonlinear device providing a mixing of the RF and the LO. Moreover, the low-resolution, e.g., single-bit, ADC may be operated in a nonlinear region, e.g., using a simple comparator circuit, without requiring high-resolution, linear ADCs, as would be typical for millimeter wave digital communication systems. Still further, should signal amplification be used, e.g., providing an LNA <b>214</b> between the antenna <b>218</b> and the RF processing/detection module <b>215</b>, the LNA <b>214</b> does not need to be operated in a linear region. As the low-resolution ADC solution relies upon a simple comparator circuit <b>217</b>, linearity of the received signal does not need to be preserved. Accordingly, the amplifier, e.g., LNA <b>214</b>, may be operated in a nonlinear region, e.g., in saturation. As is true with operation of the low-power LO <b>209</b>, it is understood that operation of an amplifier, e.g., LNA <b>214</b>, without regard to preserving linearity, e.g., in saturation, may be accomplished a substantially less power dissipation that would be required for linear operation. Likewise, operating the minimal complexity MIMO radio cell <b>210</b> requires relatively low power, certainly much less than traditional digital communication receivers operating in comparable wavelengths. Consumption of less power results in generation of less of a thermal load, e.g., according to component inefficiencies, power requirements and/or circuital resistive losses.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Beneficially, the factors contributing to smaller, simpler and cooler MIMO receiver modules also reduce initial costs as well as operational costs, e.g., lower power consumption and cooling. The reduced module size and reduced thermal load further allows more MIMO receiver modules to be used in the same space than would otherwise be possible with traditional MIMO receivers employing higher-resolution ADCs, and/or LNAs operating in their linear regions, digital receivers and/or detectors employing traditional LO-mixer combinations, e.g., not starved, but rather operating in a linear region. The reduced cost, thermal load and size permit larger numbers to be used within the same footprint, which is well adapted for massively MIMO systems. It is envisioned that massively MIMO systems may employ scores, if not hundreds, or even more MIMO receiver modules.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The example MIMO radio cell <b>210</b> includes a dipole antenna <b>218</b>&#x2014;in this instance, a bowtie antenna <b>218</b>. It is understood that in general the antenna <b>211</b> may include a balanced structure, such as a dipole, an unbalanced structure, such as a monopole, and/or a patch. The antenna may be a resonant structure, such as the example dipole antenna <b>218</b>, having a length L that approximates one-half of an operating wavelength (&#x3bb;), i.e., L&#x2248;&#x3bb;/2. Without limitation, the antenna <b>211</b> may include an electric-field sensing element, a magnetic-field sensing element, or a combination of both an electric-field and a magnetic-field sensing elements. By way of non-limiting example, it is understood that antenna <b>211</b> may include a wire structure, such as a dipole, a monopole, or a loop. It is understood that a loop antenna <b>211</b> may be configured according to varying geometries, e.g., a circular loop, an elliptical loop, a square loop, and a rectangular loop. A wire structure antenna <b>211</b> may be free-standing, e.g., formed from a rigid conductor and/or formed on a substrate <b>219</b> and/or similar supporting structure. The antenna <b>211</b> may be substantially omnidirectional, such as the example dipole <b>218</b> structure.

By way of example, the dipole antenna <b>218</b> may be replaced with a crossed dipole, in which two dipole antennas are positioned in an orthogonal arrangement and coupled to a common antenna terminal <b>212</b> via a phase shifting element, e.g., a 90-degree phase shifter.

For embodiments, in which a gain element, such as the example LNA <b>214</b> is included, the antenna coupler <b>213</b> may be positioned between the antenna terminal <b>212</b> and the LNA <b>214</b>. In at least some embodiments, the antennal coupler <b>213</b> is positioned at the antenna terminal <b>212</b>. The antenna coupler <b>213</b> may include a matching network, such as a conjugate matching network matching a driving point impedance of the antenna <b>211</b> to a characteristic impedance of a transmission line extending between the antenna coupler <b>213</b> and one or more of the gain element <b>214</b> and the RF processing/detection module <b>215</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Alternatively or in addition, the antenna coupler <b>213</b> includes a balun. The balun is adapted to facilitate a coupling of a balanced structure, such as the example dipole antenna <b>218</b> and an unbalanced structure, such as an unbalanced transmission line. Baluns can facilitate operation of a balanced device, such as the example dipole antenna <b>218</b> by promoting a substantially symmetric current distribution between each half of the dipole antenna <b>218</b>. Baluns may include one or more of transmission lines, lumped elements, e.g., capacitors and/or inductors, including transmission line elements, e.g., &#x3bb;/4 transmission line segments, and the like. In at least some embodiments, the balun structure may include a lossy element, such as a ferrite element and/or RF chokes adapted to absorb and/or otherwise prevent propagation of unbalanced currents.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In at least some embodiments, the MIMO radio cell <b>210</b> includes one or more filters. Filters may include, without limitation, high-pass filters, low-pass filters and band-pass filters. In at least some embodiments, filters may be analog filters, e.g., constructed according to lumped resistor and/or inductor and/or capacitor components. Alternatively or in addition, analog filters may utilize one or more waveguide segments, such as waveguide lengths, shorted waveguide stubs and/or open waveguide stubs positioned at predetermined lengths along a waveguide, and the like. One or more filters may be provided, for example, at one or more of the antenna terminal <b>212</b>, the antenna coupler <b>213</b>, an input of the LNA <b>214</b>, and output of the LNA, an input of the RF processing/detection module <b>215</b> and/or at the output of the RF processing/detection module <b>215</b>, and/or the output of a baseband processing stage, such as the example baseband amplifier <b>216</b>. In some embodiments the filters may be high-pass filters adapted to block DC currents. Alternatively or in addition, the filters may be low-pass filters adapted to pass baseband currents.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The RF processing/detection module <b>215</b> may include any device having a non-linear characteristic curve, e.g., a non-linear current-voltage (I-V) curve. Examples include, without limitation, a diode, a transistor, e.g., a transistor wired in a diode configuration. In practical applications, parasitic values of the detector may be selected to ensure minimal signal degradation resulting from operation of the detector device at the frequencies of operation, e.g., at the RF the carrier frequency and/or the baseband frequency.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the MIMO receive cell <b>210</b> may include a baseband amplifier <b>216</b> designed to amplify the baseband signal from the output of an envelope detector of the RF processing/detection module <b>215</b> to a suitable voltage/current/power level as required by comparator ADC <b>217</b>. The amplifier <b>216</b> may also act as an impedance-transforming buffer stage between the RF processing/detection module <b>215</b> and comparator <b>217</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The comparator may include any suitable device to provide a stable binary output according to a comparison of an input baseband signal to a reference value. For example, the reference value may be a reference voltage. A value of the reference voltage may be selected to serve as a decision between a binary 1 or a binary 0. For example, if an expected voltage of a received baseband signal is expected to be 0 and 10 microvolts, a threshold value may be selected as &#xbd; the maximum value, i.e., about 5 microvolts. In at least some embodiments, the threshold voltage is determined according to a minimum signal level, e.g., a system noise floor, in which a received voltage above a predetermined value above the noise floor may represent a binary 1. In some embodiments, the threshold value is fixed. Alternatively or in addition, the threshold value may be variable, e.g., according to signal conditions, noise, conditions, a calibration value, and so on.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As an example, assume a simplified passive embodiment of receiver MIMO <b>210</b> that omits amplifiers <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>. Further assume that the system is impedance matched and the noise seen at the comparator is solely due to thermal noise generated in the envelope detector. It is well-known that thermal noise in passive systems exhibits a flat spectral power density of &#x2212;174 dBm/Hz. If the system bandwidth is 1 GHz, the corresponding noise power is &#x2212;84 dBm. Suppose that the input power to the system is &#x2212;50 dBm (for signal symbol <b>1</b>) and the aggregate loss from antenna <b>218</b>, coupler and/or filter <b>213</b>, amplifier <b>214</b>, and RF processing/detection module <b>215</b> is 20 dB. This corresponds to an output power of approximately &#x2212;70 dBm at the input comparator <b>217</b>. Since the SNR is relatively high (14 dB), one-half the signal voltage at comparator <b>217</b> will approximately lie halfway between the noise floor voltage and signal on-state. From a voltage standpoint, halving the voltage reduces power by one-fourth, which corresponds to a threshold power of &#x2212;76 dBm. Assuming a 50-Ohm input impedance, this corresponds to a threshold voltage of approximately 35 &#x3bc;V. In the event that the comparator hardware <b>217</b> is unable to detect voltage differences this low, because of, e.g., built-in hysteresis, it will be of benefit to instate baseband amplifier <b>216</b> to accommodate lower input power operation. One potential strategy for adjusting the threshold is feedback based on individual digital outputs, i.e., if the comparator <b>217</b> is outputting all binary 1's, the comparator threshold may be set too low and should be increased.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">If a pre-amplifier at millimeter-wave is included, then the link budget would improve significantly due to the square-law device. That is, if the power incident upon the receive cell is &#x2212;70 dBm and the millimeter-wave LNA gain is 30 dB, with a diode responsivity of 10 kV/W this corresponds to a 1 mV baseband output voltage. Even this is likely too low to pass along to a standard CMOS threshold detector which would have noise and hysteresis. Therefore a baseband voltage amplifier with e.g., 10V/V gain might be used. The baseband amplifier would have high input impedance (e.g., greater than the diode video resistance over the channel bandwidth of &#x2dc;1 GHz, as an example). It would also have relatively low output resistance in order to pass a multi-GHz signal across the input capacitance of a CMOS threshold detector IC (perhaps 500 ohms output resistance or less).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a MIMO radio module <b>220</b> functioning within the communication network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the MIMO communication system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> in accordance with various aspects described herein.

It is understood that in some applications, the MIMO radio module <b>230</b> may include an OOK receiver and/or a combination of different types of receivers that may be interconnected to a common and/or different antennas. The example MIMO radio module <b>230</b> includes a substrate <b>231</b> upon which the antenna cells and baseband distribution network are formed. The illustrative radio module <b>230</b> includes four radio cells <b>232</b>, four connectors <b>234</b> and a baseband distribution network <b>233</b>. Each radio cell <b>232</b> is in communication with a respective one of the connectors <b>234</b> via the RF distribution network <b>233</b>. In operation, each radio cell <b>232</b> receives a wireless MIMO signal, detects bandpass information modulated onto the wireless MIMO signal at a remote MIMO transmitter, e.g., using OOK, PSK and/or DPSK modulation, and generates a detected baseband signal representative of the modulated RF signal. The analog signal is passed to a signal combiner, which then passes to an ADC, e.g., a comparator, then in at least some embodiments to a digital processing unit (not shown) to determine an estimate of the transmitted information originating at the MIMO transmitter. This present example embodiment may be considered a limited implementation of the MIMO receiver <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), comprising an antenna <b>236</b>, an antenna coupling/matching network <b>237</b> at antenna terminal, an RF LNA, an RF signal processing/detection module and an envelope detector.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A first inset illustrates in more detail one of the MIMO radio cells <b>232</b>&#x2032;.

A more detailed illustration of the example antenna coupler is provided in a second inset <b>237</b>&#x2032;. The antenna coupler <b>237</b>&#x2032; includes a capacitive arrangement adapted to block a transfer of low frequencies, e.g., DC, between the dipole antenna <b>236</b> and the RF signal processing/detection circuit <b>238</b>.

The example radio module <b>249</b> includes an antenna <b>241</b>, a power divider/combiner <b>242</b>, an LO <b>243</b> and a diode <b>245</b>. The power combiner <b>242</b> includes three ports: two input ports <b>276</b><i>a</i>, <b>276</b><i>b </i>and one output port <b>277</b>.

One such class of power combiner circuits are referred to as Wilkinson power dividers. A Wilkinson power divider may use passive components, e.g., lumped elements and/or waveguide segments to achieve the signal combining. Beneficially, such devices may exhibit reciprocal functionality in that it operates as a power combiner in one direction, and a power divider in another direction. According to the illustrative example, RF signals presented at the two input ports are summed in a power sense to obtain an output provided the output port <b>277</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">According to the illustrative radio module <b>249</b>, the first input port <b>276</b><i>a </i>is communicatively coupled to the antenna <b>241</b>, such that a received RF signal is presented at the first input port <b>276</b><i>a </i>of the power combiner <b>242</b>.

In a simple example, the received RF signal is a binary PSK (BPSK) modulated RF carrier wave operating at a stable carrier frequency f<sub>c</sub>.

This infrastructure can include several types of substrates. The most typical type of substrate being servers that support Network Function Virtualization (NFV), followed by packet forwarding capabilities based on generic computing resources, with specialized network technologies brought to bear when general purpose processors or general purpose integrated circuit devices offered by merchants (referred to herein as merchant silicon) are not appropriate.

Wi-Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices, e.g., computers, to send and receive data indoors and out; anywhere within the range of a base station. Wi-Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 (a, b, g, n, ac, ag, etc.) to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wired networks (which can use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet). Wi-Fi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands for example or with products that contain both bands (dual band), so the networks can provide real-world performance similar to the basic 10 BaseT or 100 BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an embodiment <b>500</b> of a mobile network platform <b>510</b> is shown that is an example of network elements <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, and/or VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. For example, platform <b>510</b> can facilitate in whole or in part receiving, by a first radio module at a first location, a wireless MIMO signal, to obtain a first received RF signal.

In one or more embodiments, the mobile network platform <b>510</b> can generate and receive signals transmitted and received by base stations or access points such as base station or access point <b>122</b>. Generally, mobile network platform <b>510</b> can comprise components, e.g., nodes, gateways, interfaces, servers, or disparate platforms, that facilitate both packet-switched (PS) (e.g., internet protocol (IP), frame relay, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)) and circuit-switched (CS) traffic (e.g., voice and data), as well as control generation for networked wireless telecommunication. As a non-limiting example, mobile network platform <b>510</b> can be included in telecommunications carrier networks and can be considered carrier-side components as discussed elsewhere herein. Mobile network platform <b>510</b> comprises CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> which can interface CS traffic received from legacy networks like telephony network(s) <b>540</b> (e.g., public switched telephone network (PSTN), or public land mobile network (PLMN)) or a signaling system #7 (SS7) network <b>560</b>.

Additionally, CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> can access mobility, or roaming, data generated through SS7 network <b>560</b>; for instance, mobility data stored in a visited location register (VLR), which can reside in memory <b>530</b>. Moreover, CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> interfaces CS-based traffic and signaling and PS gateway node(s) <b>518</b>. As an example, in a 3GPP UMTS network, CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> can be realized at least in part in gateway GPRS support node(s) (GGSN).

The embodiments (e.g., in connection with automatically identifying acquired cell sites that provide a maximum value/benefit after addition to an existing communication network) can employ various AI-based schemes for carrying out various embodiments thereof. Moreover, the classifier can be employed to determine a ranking or priority of each cell site of the acquired network. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, . . . , xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x)=confidence (class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to determine or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs, which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches comprise, e.g., na&#xef;ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">As will be readily appreciated, one or more of the embodiments can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., via a generic training data) as well as implicitly trained (e.g., via observing UE behavior, operator preferences, historical information, receiving extrinsic information). For example, SVMs can be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, the classifier(s) can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions, including but not limited to determining according to predetermined criteria which of the acquired cell sites will benefit a maximum number of subscribers and/or which of the acquired cell sites will add minimum value to the existing communication network coverage, etc.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">As used in some contexts in this application, in some embodiments, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;system&#x201d; and the like are intended to refer to, or comprise, a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities, wherein the entity can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution.
