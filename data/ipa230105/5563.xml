an information handling system, and in particular, temperature management of memory elements of the information handling system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The effect of temperature, especially at sub-zero conditions, has a huge impact on memory element operations. Memory elements can compose of multiple layers of dense metal interconnects. The velocity of electron movement varies drastically under different temperatures. As the temperature decreases, so does the effective resistance of the interconnects. At this level, all digital signals behave like analog signals and some signals can go faster than others. This can cause internal race conditions, where a signal arrives sooner than it was supposed to, which then causes incorrect/invalid transitions/transactions (data integrity problem).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in a method of managing a temperature of a memory element of an information handling system, the method including: identifying a lower temperature boundary of the memory element; determining an initial temperature of the memory element; determining whether the initial temperature is less than the lower temperature boundary; in response to determining that the initial temperature is less than the lower temperature boundary: performing a series of repeated burst refresh operations at the memory element; after performing the series of repeated burst refreshes operations, determining an updated temperature of memory element; determining whether the updated temperature is less than the lower temperature boundary; and in response to determining that the updated temperature is greater than the lower temperature boundary, performing a normal boot of the memory element.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other embodiments of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These and other embodiments may each optionally include one or more of the following features.

When the temperature management computing module <b>210</b> determines that the initial temperature of the memory element <b>215</b> is greater than the lower temperature boundary, the memory element <b>215</b> can operate normally and therefore perform a normal boot (<b>307</b>).
