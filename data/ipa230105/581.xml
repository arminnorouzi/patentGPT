More specifically, the present disclosure is directed to single-use medical devices that, when subjected to autoclave processing for potential reuse, deform, destruct and/or provide a visual indication that the devices are not reusable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Historically, medical devices, such as those utilized in surgery (e.g., scalpels, forceps, spreaders, scrapers, etc.) were reusable. That is, the devices were intended to be re-sterilized/decontaminated and reused after a medical procedure. Such re-sterilization has advanced over time from simply immersing the devices or tools in alcohol to the current practice of autoclave sterilization. In the latter regard, medical devices are inserted into an autoclave chamber where they are subjected to elevated temperatures, pressures and, commonly, steam. By way of example, many autoclaves used for sterilizing medical devices subject those devices to pressurized saturated steam at approximately 121&#xb0; C. (250&#xb0; F.) for around 15-20 minutes depending on the size of the load and the contents.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While autoclave sterilization is an industry accepted means for cleaning reusable medical devices, the process is not always one-hundred percent effective. That is, in some cases bacteria, pathogens or other contaminants survive the autoclave process. This is more common for devices that have internal passageways where such contaminants may be partially protected during the autoclave process. The inability to fully sterilize reusable devices can result in infection risks, when utilized with subsequent patients. Accordingly, there has been an ongoing shift in the medical field to single-use medical devices. Such devices are designed to be utilized once in a hospital or clinic and then disposed. In this regard, single-use devices are often delivered in sterilized packages, which are opened shortly before or during a medical procedure. In such an arrangement, no sterilization is required before use. Such single-use devices are intended to eliminate re-sterilization problems sometimes encountered by reusable medical devices. To ensure the single-use devices are not reused, manufacturers often put a single-use labels and warnings on the packaging and/or ISO symbols on the medical device itself alerting medical professionals that the device should be disposed after use.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present inventor(s) has recognized that many single use devices (SUDs) are erroneously reused. By way of example, during surgery, it is common for all devices or tools used during surgery be placed in a bucket or tray after use. In many instances, reusable devices and SUDs may be comingled. If SUDs are comingled with reusable devices, the SUDs may be erroneously re-sterilized in an autoclave and reused. Further, SUDs may be purposely re-sterilized as a cost saving measure. However, as SUDs are not designed for reuse, operating parts of re-sterilized SUDS can be dull, loose, bent or otherwise out of calibration after autoclaving. The presented systems and methods prevent such unintentional or other off-label reuse of SUDS on patients.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an arrangement, a destruct element (e.g., thermally deformable element) is incorporated into a SUD that deforms during autoclaving. Most commonly, at least a portion of the destruct element has a melting point below an autoclaving process temperature. That is, the destruct element has a low melting point of less than about 250&#xb0; F., less than about 230&#xb0; F. or even less than about 180&#xb0; F. When subjected to autoclave processing temperatures, the destruct element deforms. Such deformation may provide a visual and/or tactile indication that the device is damaged and not intended for reuse. Size shape and color of the destruct element may be chosen to improve visual discernability. In some arrangements, deformation of the destruct element may prevent operation of a functioning or moving component(s) of the SUD. In any arrangement, a subsequent user of the device has in indication that the SUD has been unintentionally autoclaved in an off-label attempt to sterilize the SUD and that the SUD should not be utilized with a patient.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, a destruct element is disposed on a handle of a SUD. In such an embodiment, the destruct element may provide a visual or tactile indication that the SUD has improperly been exposed to an autoclave process.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, one or more destruct elements form or are disposed against a moving element of a SUD. Such SUDS may include, without limitation, retractable surgical knives and swiveling awls. In such embodiments, the destruct element(s) may prevent ordinary movement of the SUD once the SUD has been exposed to an autoclave process.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing and other aspects, features, details, utilities, and advantages of the present disclosure will be apparent from reading the following description and claims, and from reviewing the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate perspective and exploded perspective views, respectively of a single use medical device with a destruct element in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate side views of the single use medical device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> before and after an autoclaving process.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a perspective view of another single use medical device with a destruct element in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a top view of a handle of the single use medical device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the handle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> illustrates a close-up cross-sectional view of an actuator assembly of the single use medical device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates another single use medical device with a destruct element in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates the destruct element of the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> after autoclaving.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate another single use medical device with a destruct element in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrate another single use medical device with a destruct element in accordance with the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, which at least assist in illustrating the various pertinent features of the presented inventions. The following description is presented for purposes of illustration and description and is not intended to limit the inventions to the forms disclosed herein. Consequently, variations and modifications commensurate with the following teachings, and skill and knowledge of the relevant art, are within the scope of the presented inventions. The embodiments described herein are further intended to explain the best modes known of practicing the inventions and to enable others skilled in the art to utilize the inventions in such, or other embodiments and with various modifications required by the particular application(s) or use(s) of the presented inventions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Broadly, the present disclosure is directed to single-use medical devices (SUDS) that are configured to deform (e.g., destruct) if re-sterilized in an autoclave process. Generally, each SUD includes a destruct element (e.g., thermally deformable element) that deforms in response to elevated temperatures present during autoclaving. Typically, at least a portion of the destruct element is formed of a material having a melting point below an autoclaving process temperature. That is, at least a portion the destruct element is made of a material having a melting point of less than about 250&#xb0; F., less than about 230&#xb0; F. or even less than about 180&#xb0; F. When subjected to elevated temperature, during an autoclave processing, the destruct element deforms. Preferably, the destruct element grossly deforms. In this regard, materials having a melting point that is significantly less than the autoclaving temperature (e.g., at least 20&#xb0; F.) may be preferred. However, this is not a requirement. Such deformation may provide a visual indication that the device is damaged and should not be used with a patient. In some arrangements, such deformation may prevent operation of a functioning or moving component(s) of the SUD. In any arrangement, a subsequent user of the device has an indication that the SUD has been unintentionally autoclaved in an off-label attempt to sterilize the SUD and that the SUD should not be utilized with a patient.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate perspective and exploded perspective views, respectively, of one embodiment of a handle <b>12</b> of a single use medical device or SUD <b>10</b> that includes a destruct element <b>20</b>. The illustrated SUD <b>10</b> does not include a medical implement which may be inserted within a cylindrical recess/aperture <b>14</b> formed within a forward/distal end of the handle <b>12</b> or otherwise attached to the handle. As will be appreciated, such a handle <b>12</b> could be utilized to support a variety of medical implements including, without limitation, retractors, scrapers, etc. Further, the handles of various differently configured SUDS provide a convenient location for incorporating a destruct element as discussed herein. Though presented in an embodiment as incorporating a destruct element on or within a handle of a SUD, the present disclosure is not limited to this location and destruct elements may be incorporated on other portions of a SUD. In the illustrated embodiment, the handle <b>12</b> includes a cylindrical recess <b>16</b> formed within its rearward/proximal end. In this embodiment, the destruct element <b>20</b> is formed with a mating cylindrical end <b>22</b> that fits within the cylindrical recess <b>16</b>. When attached to the handle <b>12</b>, the destruct element <b>20</b> may form a smooth uniform cap (e.g., generally hemispherical, domed, cylindrical, etc.) on the rearward end of the handle <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate side views of the handle <b>12</b> before and after autoclaving, respectively. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, prior to autoclaving, the destruct element <b>20</b> may have a uniform shape on the proximal end of the handle <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a deformed destruct element <b>20</b> on the proximal end of the handle <b>1</b>. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates the destruct element <b>20</b> after an elevated temperature is applied during an autoclaving process. As illustrated, the destruct element <b>20</b> at least partially deforms when exposed to temperatures above its melting point. In contrast, the handle <b>12</b> may be formed of a material having a melting point above autoclaving temperatures. Accordingly, the handle <b>12</b> may not experience deformation during the autoclaving process. Likewise, a medical implement attached to the handle (e.g., a metallic implement) would not experience deformation during the autoclaving process. However, due to the deformation of the destruct element <b>20</b>, a subsequent user of the SUD <b>10</b> would have at least a visual indication that the SUD <b>10</b> is damaged and should not be re-used.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view of an exemplary single-use retractable surgical knife <b>30</b>. The retractable surgical knife <b>30</b> is a SUD that incorporates one or more destruct elements. In the illustrated embodiment, one or more destruct elements may prevent movement of a component of the SUD after exposure to autoclaving temperatures. As illustrated, the knife <b>30</b> includes a blade <b>32</b> attached to a distal end of a blade shaft <b>34</b>. The rearward/proximal end of the blade shaft <b>34</b> connects to a slider <b>36</b>, which can slide linearly within an interior of a handle <b>38</b> of the knife <b>30</b>. When assembled, the blade shaft <b>34</b> is disposed within the interior of a hollow shaft <b>40</b>, which connects to a distal end of the handle <b>38</b>. Advancement of the slider <b>36</b> toward the forward or distal end of the handle <b>38</b> advances the blade shaft <b>34</b> such that blade <b>32</b> extends beyond the distal end of the hollow shaft <b>40</b>. Likewise, retraction of the slider <b>36</b> toward the rearward or proximal end of the handle <b>38</b> retracts the blade shaft <b>34</b> such that the blade <b>32</b> is disposed within an interior of the hollow shaft <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates a top view of the handle <b>38</b> and a cross-sectional view of the handle taken along a centerline plane A-A&#x2032; of the handle, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> illustrates an expanded view of a portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. As variously illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref>, a thumb actuator <b>42</b> connects to the slider <b>36</b>, when the slider <b>36</b> is disposed within the interior of the handle <b>38</b>. A user can manipulate the thumb actuator <b>42</b> to advance or retract the slider <b>36</b> and thereby advance or retract the blade <b>32</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, studs <b>44</b> on the bottom of the thumb actuator <b>42</b> extend through a slot <b>46</b> in a sidewall of the handle <b>38</b> to engage the slider <b>36</b>. More specifically, the studs <b>44</b> extend through the slot and engage mating openings <b>37</b> formed into the sider <b>36</b>. In addition, a biasing pin <b>48</b> has a lower end disposed in an opening <b>39</b> in the slider <b>36</b> and an upper end that engages a bottom surface of the thumb actuator <b>42</b>. A spring <b>50</b> is disposed in the opening <b>39</b> below a central collar of the biasing pin <b>48</b> and a lower end of the opening in the slider. Collectively, the biasing pin <b>48</b> and spring <b>50</b> require a user to depress the thumb actuator <b>42</b> prior to advancing or retracting the slider <b>36</b>. However, it will be appreciated that a simple friction slider could be utilized. In addition to the above-noted components, the exemplary knife also includes a distal ferrule <b>52</b> on a forward end of the handle <b>38</b>, which connects the hollow shaft <b>40</b> to the handle <b>38</b>, and a rearward ferrule or cap <b>54</b> one a rearward end of the handle <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated embodiment of the retractable surgical knife <b>30</b>, various components may be thermally deformable elements (e.g., destruct elements). For instance, the slider <b>36</b>, thumb actuator <b>42</b> and/or the biasing pin <b>48</b> may be formed of a material having a low melting point (e.g., below an autoclaving temperature). Accordingly, when subjected to elevated temperatures during autoclaving that exceed the melting point of these component, the components may deform. In the case of the slider <b>36</b>, thumb actuator <b>42</b> and biasing pin <b>48</b>, such deformation may prevent operation of the retractable knife <b>30</b>. That is, such deformation may prevent the advancement and retraction of the blade <b>32</b> rendering the retractable knife <b>30</b> inoperable. For instance, the slider <b>36</b> may be a thermally deformable element that may melt to and, for example, adhere to the interior of the handle <b>38</b> preventing movement of the blade <b>32</b> once the slider <b>36</b> has re-solidified (e.g., after cooling). Likewise, additional thermally deformable components may melt and adhere to adjacent components. For instance, the actuator <b>42</b> may melt and adhere to the handle <b>38</b> and the biasing pin <b>48</b> may melt into and adhere with the spring <b>50</b>. Stated otherwise, one or more components may at least partially melt together and/or adhere to adjacent components preventing subsequent movement. In addition, the knife <b>30</b> may include one or more destruct elements that provide a visual indication that the knife has been re-sterilized. For instance, the distal ferrule <b>52</b> and/or the proximal ferrule/cap <b>54</b> may be formed of a low melting point material that deform during an autoclaving process like the destruct element discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrate another embodiment of a handle <b>62</b> of a SUD <b>60</b>, which may support any of a variety of medical implements. As above, such a medical implement may be inserted within a cylindrical recess/aperture <b>64</b> formed within a forward or distal end of the handle <b>62</b> or otherwise attached to the handle. In this embodiment, the SUD <b>60</b> includes two side plates <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>(hereafter <b>66</b> unless specifically referenced), which are destruct elements. The plates <b>66</b> are formed of a material having a low melting point (e.g., below an autoclaving temperature). As illustrated, the side plates <b>66</b> may be attached to the handle <b>62</b> utilizing, for example, screws. However, other fasteners may be utilized. To ensure that the side plates <b>66</b> (e.g., destruct elements) deform during an autoclaving process, one or more biasing elements <b>70</b> (e.g., springs) are secured below the plates <b>66</b>, when the plates are attached to the handle <b>62</b>. As illustrated, the biasing elements <b>70</b> are coil springs (e.g., compression springs). However, other biasing elements may be utilized (leaf springs, torsion springs, elastomeric blocks, etc.). The biasing elements are partially disposed within recessed openings <b>68</b> formed in the handle <b>62</b>. The biasing elements <b>70</b> are compressed when the plates <b>66</b> are attached to the handle (not shown). The biasing elements <b>70</b> apply an expansive force between the handle <b>62</b> and a bottom surface of the plate <b>66</b>, when the plate is affixed to the handle <b>62</b>. Prior to experiencing elevated temperatures, the side plates <b>66</b> have sufficient rigidity to maintain compression of the biasing elements <b>70</b>. Once exposed to elevated temperatures during autoclaving (e.g., temperatures above the melting point of the plates <b>66</b>), the biasing elements <b>70</b> may deform the plates <b>66</b> (e.g., destruct elements) or even protrude through the surface of the plates <b>66</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. In either arrangement, a user grasping the handle <b>62</b> will have a tactile indication as well as a visual indication that the SUD <b>60</b> should not be utilized.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Though discussed above as utilizing a destruct element that deforms in response to elevated temperatures, it will be appreciated that the destruct element may be any component that provides an indication that the SUD should not be reused after exposure to elevated temperatures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate one embodiment of a SUD <b>80</b> that utilizes a heat sensitive pop-up indicator <b>90</b> as a destruct element. The SUD <b>80</b> is again illustrated as a handle <b>82</b> that may support any of a variety of medical implements. In this embodiment, the pop-up indicator <b>90</b> is at least partially disposed in a recessed opening <b>86</b> formed in the proximal end of the handle <b>82</b>. The pop-up indicator has a biasing pin <b>92</b> that includes a lower end disposed within the recessed opening and an upper end, which in the illustrated embodiment, is connected to a plate <b>96</b>. The biasing pin also includes a central collar <b>94</b> having a cross-dimension (e.g., diameter) that is greater than the cross-dimension of the lower end of the pin <b>92</b>. A biasing element <b>98</b> (e.g., coil spring), is disposed between the collar <b>94</b> and the bottom end of the recessed opening <b>86</b> of the handle <b>82</b>. Prior to experiencing elevated temperatures, the lower end of the biasing pin <b>90</b> is disposed within a rigid potting material <b>100</b> and the biasing element is compressed between the collar and the bottom end of the recessed opening. The potting material <b>100</b> is made of a material having a low melting point (e.g., below an autoclaving temperature). Accordingly, upon being subjected to elevated temperatures during an autoclaving process, the potting material <b>100</b> softens or melts (e.g., deforms) releasing the lower end of the biasing pin <b>92</b>. Once the potting material softens or melts, the compressed spring <b>98</b> expands and lifts the plate <b>96</b> above the proximal surface of the handle <b>82</b>. As above, this provides a visual indication that the SUD should not be re-used. Though illustrated as being placed in the rearward end of the handle, it will be appreciated that the pop-up indicator could be placed at other locations including locations where a user grips the handle <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrate another SUD <b>120</b> in accordance with the present disclosure. In the illustrated embodiment, the SUD <b>120</b> is a medical awl having a moveable or swivel end. As illustrated, the SUD <b>120</b> includes a handle or shaft <b>122</b> a user may grasp to position an awl <b>132</b> connected to a forward or distal end of the shaft <b>122</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the awl <b>132</b> attaches to the shaft via a housing <b>130</b> that that engages a hemispherical ball <b>124</b> that is attachable to the distal end of the shaft <b>122</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the housing <b>130</b> is a generally cylindrical and at least partially hollow element that receives a rearward or proximal end of the awl <b>132</b> within its forward or distal end. A first pin <b>131</b> may be utilized to connect the awl <b>132</b> to the housing <b>130</b>. Other connection mechanisms are possible. A rearward or proximal end of the housing <b>130</b> includes an opening (not shown) that is sized to receive the ball <b>124</b> connected to the distal end of the shaft <b>122</b>. Once the ball <b>124</b> is disposed within the housing <b>130</b>, a second pin <b>129</b> passes through the housing <b>130</b> and through an aperture <b>123</b> extending through the ball <b>124</b> to movably connect the housing <b>130</b> and awl <b>132</b> to the shaft <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The aperture <b>123</b> extending through the ball <b>124</b> is elongated, which allows the housing <b>130</b> and attached awl <b>132</b> to pivot about the end of the shaft <b>122</b> in at least first and second axes. A friction bearing <b>126</b> (hereafter &#x201c;bearing&#x201d;) and spring <b>128</b> provide friction between the housing <b>130</b> and the ball <b>124</b>. More specifically, when assembled, the spring <b>128</b> and a generally cylindrical bearing <b>126</b> are disposed within the housing <b>130</b> such that a proximal end of the bearing <b>126</b> is compressed against an outside surface of the ball <b>124</b> by the spring <b>128</b>, which is itself compressed between a distal end of the bearing <b>126</b> and an inside surface (not shown) of the housing <b>130</b>. Once assembled, the friction of the bearing <b>126</b> on the outside surface of the ball <b>124</b> provides resistance to movement, which allows positioning the awl <b>132</b> at a desired angle.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The bearing <b>126</b> is a thermally deformable destruct element in accordance with the present disclosure. That is, the bearing <b>126</b> has a low melting point of less than about 250&#xb0; F., less than about 230&#xb0; F. or even less than about 180&#xb0; F. When subjected to autoclave processing temperatures, the bearing (e.g., destruct element) deforms or partially melts. Once the bearing <b>126</b> has sufficiently softened during an autoclave sanitation process, the spring <b>128</b> helps deform the bearing <b>126</b> by pushing it into the ball <b>124</b>. In response to the pressure exerted by the spring <b>128</b>, the bearing deforms into the functional swivel area (e.g., ball <b>124</b> and aperture <b>123</b>, housing <b>130</b> and pin <b>129</b>). Further, the spring <b>128</b> may become disposed within the distal end of the bearing <b>126</b>. After an autoclaving process and the bearing material has re-solidifies (e.g., once cooled), the awl SUD <b>120</b> is inoperable. This is, due to the deformation of the bearing <b>126</b> during autoclaving into the functional swivel area, the housing <b>130</b> and awl <b>132</b> retain a fixed position relative to the shaft.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As noted above, the destruct elements are made of a material having a melting point that is less than a standard medical autoclaving temperature of approximately 121&#xb0; C. or 250&#xb0; F. A variety of materials may be utilized so long as those materials can be sterilized prior to the first use of a SUD (e.g., where such sterilization is by means other than elevated temperatures). Most commonly, the destruct material is a polymer. However, this is not a requirement. In one embodiment, the destruct material is Polycaprolactone (PCL), a biodegradable polyester with a low melting point of around 140&#xb0; F. (60&#xb0; C.). In another embodiment, paraffin wax may be utilized as the destruct material. Paraffin wax has a low melting point of approximately 154&#xb0; F. In a further embodiment, the destruct material is a low-density polyethylene having a melting point of less that about 200&#xb0; F. (90&#xb0; C.). In a yet further embodiment, the destruct material is Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), which has a melting point of less than about 144&#xb0; F. (62&#xb0; C.). In various embodiments, the destruct material may be a material that acts similar to an adhesive when softened or melted. For example, various polymers may become sticky when softened/melted. Such materials tend to adhere to adjacent components when softened/melted. Once cooled (e.g., after autoclaving) such materials effectively bond to adjacent components thereby preventing movement of these components.
