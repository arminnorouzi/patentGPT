The sensor coil may include a conductive material that is placed within a magnetic field where a current is induced on the sensor coil. The measured induced current may be used to identify or determine a position of the instrument or object.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electro-magnetic field may be generated with a plurality of coils, such as three orthogonally placed coils. Various transmitter or field generation systems include the AxiEM&#x2122; electro-magnetic navigation system sold by Medtronic Navigation, Inc., having a place of business in Louisville, Colo. The AxiEM&#x2122; electro-magnetic navigation system may include a plurality of coils that are used to generate an electro-magnetic field that is sensed by a tracking device, which may be the sensor coil, to allow a navigation system, such as a StealthStation&#xae; surgical navigation system, to be used to track and/or illustrate a tracked position of an instrument.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The navigation field volume is generally positioned near the patient so that it encompasses a region of the patient in which navigation would occur. Accordingly, the transmitter coil array may be near an individual, such as a surgeon, performing a procedure</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed is a transmitting assembly, particularly a transmitting coil array (TCA) that is configured and operable to transmit a diverse magnetic field. Particularly, the TCA is configured to generate field vectors that are diverse relative to one another for providing a relatively broad distribution of measurable orientations relative to an origin or within a volume. A sensor may be affected by a field component, such as a being affected by a flux of the generated field through the sensor (generally a coil of a conductive material) that induces a current within the conductive material. The induced current is measured to determine and/or measure flux of the field and is used to calculate a position of a tracking device. Generally more than one coil is affected by the field at a given position to allow for a determination of multiple degrees of freedom (e.g. location and orientation). In various embodiments, a measurement of a flux through a coil, acting as the sensor, is equivalent to a measurement of the field component along a long axis of the coil. In various embodiments, sensors may measure other selected fields or field components. Correction due to distortion of fields, as disclosed herein, is applicable to any field measuring sensor. Herein reference to a flux measuring sensor is merely exemplary of a sensor for electro-magnetic navigation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The TCA generates a field, the field may be a time varying magnetic field, that generates a flux through the tracking device. The flux of the field through the tracking device may vary depending upon the frequency of the transmitted field, the power of the transmitted field, and the distance of the TCA from the tracking device. The presence of certain materials at the vicinity of the TCA and/or the tracking device may affect the generated field and, therefore, the sensed field. A conductive item that is positioned within the field may give rise to eddy currents that will affect the field sensed by the tracking device. If items placed in the field affect or alter the flux of the field sensed by the tracking device, the calculated position of the tracking device may be inaccurate and lead to an inaccurate position determination. Therefore, disclosed are methods of removing or accounting for the effects due to an interference or distortion caused by conductive materials.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A calculation to account for the effects of distortion in a field may include determining a sensed flux or phase at a selected frequency. In various embodiments, the calculation to remove error may be to fit measured field effects such as flux and phase, to a model and extrapolate to a measured flux and phase at a zero frequency.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein.

The tray <b>90</b> may be (or only one of) an interfering object, and is discussed herein as an example of an interfering object, and, therefore, the discussion of the tray <b>90</b> may relate to any appropriate object, unless specifically indicated otherwise. In other words, for the following discussion, the tray <b>90</b> may be referred to as an interfering member or tray for ease of the following discussion. It is understood, however, that various conductive members may be interfering members even if not specifically identified below. Further, though the following discussion is regarding an example including a single tray <b>90</b>, more than one tray may be present and/or more than one interfering object may be present.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In operation the TCA <b>40</b>, via the conductive coils <b>42</b>, may generate a magnetic field into the navigation volume <b>50</b>, as discussed above. The field generated by the TCA <b>40</b>, however, may not be entirely encompassed within the navigation volume <b>50</b> and/or elements, such as the patient support <b>26</b>, the work tray <b>90</b>, or other items, may be positioned within the navigation volume <b>50</b> and/or interfere or be affected by the field generated with the TCA <b>40</b>. When a conductive member, such as the tray <b>90</b>, is affected by the field generated by the TCA <b>40</b>, eddy currents may be produced in the tray <b>90</b>. The tray <b>90</b>, therefore, being affected by the field generated by the TCA <b>40</b>, may generate eddy currents due to the effects of the generated field. The eddy currents may then form fields, such as magnetic fields, that are in addition to those produced by the TCA <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0000">The fields produced by the tray <b>90</b> (interfering fields) may change, by superposition, the field generated by the TCA <b>40</b> alone.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">In various embodiments, the field by the TCA <b>40</b> without the tray <b>90</b>, or other interfering objects, may be referred to as a distortion free, clean, or pure field. The clean field may be calibrated, mapped, or otherwise determined (such as by measuring) to be known, such as having known field components or fluxes at known positions for navigation and tracking. These allow the clean field to be calibrated, as referred to herein. A representation of the calibrated field, such as the known components, may then be saved for later recall, such as from a memory system. In various embodiments the representation may include a look up table of known fluxes or field components and known positions relative to the TCA <b>40</b> may be generated and saved in the memory system <b>72</b>. This look up table or information may be recalled during a procedure to compare to a measured flux or field strength to determine the current position of the tracking device <b>56</b> within the field and in the navigation space <b>50</b>. It is further understood, however, that the field components may be any selected field components that are to be measured in the field and are not necessarily limited to flux. For example, a Hall effect sensor may be used to sense the field and the related undistorted sensed components may be included in the undistorted representation, such as the look-up table. As discussed herein, position of a tracked member or element, such as a sensor, may include a three dimensional (x, y, z) location alone and/or in combination with an orientation (including at least one of a yaw, pitch, or roll). Thus, position may refer to a selected degree of freedom, including at least six degrees of freedom, while position may include less degrees as well.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">The TCA <b>40</b> in generating a field may cause eddy currents to be formed in various interfering materials such as the tray <b>90</b>. The eddy currents may then generate additional magnetic fields that affect the field generated by the TCA <b>40</b>, such as adding to or subtracting from the intended or original field. As the tracked position of the tracking devices, such as the tracking device <b>56</b>, is based upon the sensed magnetic field altering the field generated by the TCA <b>40</b> may affect the determined or tracked position of the instrument <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">In various embodiments, the field generated by the TCA <b>40</b> forms or defines the navigation volume <b>50</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The navigation volume <b>50</b> may then be analyzed or premeasured to determine the field strength, including magnetic flux and phase. The measurements of the field within the navigation domain <b>50</b> may then be stored in a selected database, such as a navigation volume database stored in the navigation memory <b>72</b>, as discussed above. During a navigated procedure, the tracking device <b>56</b> may then sense the field in the navigation domain <b>50</b> and the position of the tracking device <b>56</b> may be determined with reference to the lookup table in the navigation memory <b>72</b>. In particular, for example, the sensed or measured field in the navigation domain <b>50</b> may be compared to sensed or measured field strengths and/or phase in the lookup table recalled from the navigation memory <b>72</b>. A position of the tracking device <b>56</b> may then be determined based upon a direct correlation to the lookup table and/or an interpolation between various measurements in the lookup table.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">If the field generated by the TCA <b>40</b> is distorted in any manner, such as due to the work tray <b>90</b>, the sensed field by the tracking device <b>56</b> within the navigation domain <b>50</b> may be altered from that pre-determined, measured, and saved during the calibration or setup phase. Accordingly, a distortion of the field within the navigation space <b>50</b> may alter the determined position of the tracking device <b>56</b>. It may be determined to correct for any distortion that may occur in the field in the navigation space <b>50</b> to account for distortion and determine a correct and undistorted position of the tracking device <b>56</b>. In various embodiments, correcting for the distortion may include determining a distortion free flux based on a modeled flux interpolated to zero frequency.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">It is further understood that the position of the instrument <b>16</b> (e.g. a working end or patient interacting end) may be determined due to a predetermined position of the instrument <b>16</b> relative to the tracking device <b>56</b>. For example, a predetermined geometric orientation and/or distance from the tracking device may be known, such as a tracked position of the tracking device <b>56</b>, may be correlated to the instrument <b>16</b>. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, a tracking device may be placed at the selected position of the instrument, such as a working or distal end of the instrument <b>16</b>, to track a specific portion of the instrument <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">In various embodiments, with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the navigation system <b>10</b> may generally operate as according to a flowchart <b>100</b>. The TCA <b>40</b> is powered in block <b>110</b>. In powering the TCA <b>40</b> in block <b>110</b>, the field is generated by the TCA <b>40</b> to define the navigation space <b>50</b>. A tracking device may then be moved into the field in block <b>114</b>. It is understood that moving the tracking device into the field in block <b>114</b> may be performed in any appropriate manner such as movement by the user <b>12</b>, movement by a robot, or movement under the instruction of the user <b>12</b>. It is further understood that moving the tracking device into the field in block <b>114</b> is not a requirement, but is described for clarity of the current discussion. For example, the tracking device <b>56</b> may be positioned near the patient <b>20</b> such that the tracking device <b>56</b> is within the navigation volume <b>50</b> and, therefore, movement of the tracking device <b>56</b> in the navigation volume <b>50</b> is not required.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">Nevertheless, the tracking device may then sense the field in block <b>116</b>. After sensing the field <b>116</b>, a signal may be transmitted to the navigation processor system <b>66</b> and/or the signal may be received by the navigation processor system <b>66</b> through an appropriate communication such as a wired, wireless, or other appropriate communication system. Further, as discussed above, the signal may be first transmitted to the TCA controller <b>52</b> and then relayed to the navigation processor system <b>66</b>. Nevertheless, the signal may be transmitted to the navigation processor system <b>66</b>. In various embodiments the signal may include a measurement or sensed field and the signal is based upon the sensed field in the navigation domain or volume <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">A decision block <b>120</b> may then be entered to determine whether distortion is present in the field, such as within the navigation volume <b>50</b>, based on the transmitted signal. A determination of whether distortion is present in the field may be based upon various evaluations, such as a type of distortion detected, a type of parameters of the signal received, or other appropriate determinations, as discussed further herein. In various embodiments, however, a determination that no distortion is present and a NO-path <b>124</b> may be followed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">If no distortion is determined to be present, the position of the tracking device <b>56</b> may then be determined based upon directly and with only the transmitted signal. As discussed above the navigation volume <b>50</b> may be calibrated at an appropriate time to determine positions and related sensed field strengths at the different positions. Accordingly, the determination of a position of the tracking device <b>56</b> may be based upon comparing the field strength transmitted in the signal to the lookup table, or other appropriate stored format of the field strengths, and recalling the related position. As is understood by one skilled the art, the processor system <b>66</b> may also interpolate between calibrated positions in the look up table to determine the position of the tracking device <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">The position may include both three-dimensional location and orientation in a selected number degrees of freedom (e.g. three degrees of freedom), thus, for example six degree of freedom position information may be determined. The position of the tracking device may, therefore, be recalled from the navigation memory <b>72</b> in block <b>126</b>. Moreover, the position of the instrument <b>16</b> (or portion thereof, such as a terminal end) may be recalled and/or determined based upon the tracked and determined position of the tracking device <b>56</b> and the known position of the instrument <b>16</b> relative to the tracking device <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Once the position of the tracking device is recalled in block <b>126</b>, a procedure may be navigated in block <b>130</b>. Navigation of the procedure in block <b>130</b> may include various additional steps and/or procedures such as illustrating the icon <b>16</b><i>i </i>on the display device <b>32</b> relative to the image <b>30</b>. As discussed above, the image space defined by the image <b>30</b> may be registered to the patient space, such as the navigation volume <b>50</b>, through various registration techniques such as those discussed above and known by one skilled in the art. The user <b>12</b> may then view the position of the instrument <b>16</b> by viewing the icon <b>16</b><i>i </i>relative to the image <b>30</b> to assist in performing a procedure. Procedures may include various procedures such as manipulation and movement of an implant, removal of selected tissue, movement and placement of various assembly portions for inanimate or nonliving subjects, or the like.

Upon following the YES-path <b>140</b>, it may be possible to analyze the type of distortion, prior to a determination of a sensed field with no distortion may be made in block <b>144</b>.

In various embodiments, for example, a determination of effects of magnetic fields not produced by the TCA <b>40</b> may be determined. A determination, according to the process discussed herein (i.e. Eq. 1), of a sensed magnetic field that is produced at a zero frequency transmission may be determined. The determination of the measured field at the zero frequency transmission may then be used to determine the undistorted or uninfluenced field that would be produced by the TCA <b>40</b> if an interfering object, such as the work tray <b>90</b>, did not interfere with the field transmitted by the TCA <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">Once the determination of a sensed field with no distortion is made in block <b>144</b>, a recall of the position of the tracking device based on the signal is then be made in block <b>126</b>.

Accordingly, the distortion is effectively removed due to the determination of the sensed field with no distortion in block <b>144</b>. Therefore, the removal of the distortion signal may be used to recall the determined position from the navigation memory <b>72</b> in block <b>126</b>.

The procedure may therefore be navigated in block <b>130</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0063">Turning reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the process <b>100</b> includes the block of determined sensed field with no distortion <b>144</b>. According to various embodiments, determining a sensed field with no distortion may include removing the effect of distortion from the signal based on the sensed field (e.g. flux or phase). Removing the distortion in a signal regarding the sensed field may include fitting the signal to a selected model. As discussed above the model may include solving Eq. 1 according to a selected process, as discussed further herein.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064">The block <b>144</b> may include various sub-steps or sub-routines, as discussed herein. The process in block <b>144</b> may be included, as a set of instructions, an algorithm for determining a correction in light of a distorted field. Accordingly, the method described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be understood to be a flow diagram for an algorithm for determining or correcting a signal that is based on or a result of sensing a distorted field. It is understood, however, that the determination of a sensed field with no distortion may include any appropriate means based on Eq. 1 for converting the input signal based upon sensing a field with distortion and outputting a signal accounting or moving of the distortion. Accordingly, according to various embodiments, the means for determining the sensed field with no distortion in block <b>144</b> may include the model of Eq. 1 that may model two (or more) transformers or L circuits</p><p id="p-0070" num="0065">Generally, the determination of the sensed field with no distortion in block <b>144</b>, however, may include receiving a signal of the distorted field in block <b>150</b>. Receiving the signal may include receiving a signal from a tracking device, such as the tracking device <b>56</b>, associated with the instrument <b>16</b>. The signal may be transmitted to any appropriate portion, such as directly to the navigation processing unit <b>70</b> and/or through the TCA controller <b>52</b>. Nevertheless, the determining of a sensed field flux with no distortion may include instructions that are executed by the navigation processing unit <b>70</b> and therefore the signal may be transmitted to the navigation processing unit <b>70</b> and received in block <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0066">Once the signal is received by the processing unit <b>70</b>, a distortion removal or correction means may be applied. The distortion removal or correction means may include application or performance of a set of instructions by the processing unit <b>70</b>. Further, or alternatively thereto, a hardware system or circuit (such as an application specific integrated circuit) may be provided to account or mimic the dual transformer calculation or model as discussed above in relation to Eq. 1. Accordingly a distortion correction means may include a set of instructions executed by the processing unit <b>70</b> either alone or in combination with a hardware solution that corrects for the distortion according to the model of Eq. 1.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0067">Nevertheless, the distortion correction is determined according to the method as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Once the signal is received, a determination of a flux magnitude at a first coil at a selected number of frequencies is determined in block <b>160</b>. As discussed above, the tracking device, such as the tracking device <b>56</b> may include one or a plurality of coils. As discussed herein, from the tracking device <b>56</b>, therefore, a signal from a first coil is analyzed and signals from additional coils (i.e. n+1) coil until the signal from all or a selected number of the coils is analyzed. Each of the coils may sense the field to measure a magnitude of flux of the field through the coil. The magnitude of flux as measured by the coil is included in the signal received or transmitted regarding the sensed field in block <b>118</b>. Accordingly, the determined flux magnitude of the first coil for a selected number of frequencies is made in block <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0068">Further, as discussed above, the TCA <b>40</b> may generate one or a plurality number of frequencies with each of the coils. Each of the TCA coils <b>42</b> may generate the frequencies in a selected manner, such as substantially simultaneously and/or sequentially, such as in a time differential in series. In various embodiments, four frequencies may be generated by the TCA <b>40</b>. Further, it is understood that the TCA <b>40</b> may include a plurality of conductive coils <b>42</b> therein. Each of the coils may generate fields at a selected frequency, including a selected number of frequencies, in a selected manner. Accordingly, determining a flux magnitude at a first coil at a selected number of frequencies may include determining a magnitude of flux at a plurality of frequencies.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0069">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, column <b>1</b> is the first coil (coil <b>1</b>), column <b>2</b> is the second coil (coil <b>2</b>), and column <b>3</b> is the third coil (coil <b>3</b>). In the first row in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plot of measured flux of a field for a selected number of frequencies (i.e. four frequencies are illustrated in each plot) where crosses indicate the actual measured magnitude for each of the three coils at the different selected frequencies. Although four frequencies are measured and plotted, it is understood that any selected number of frequencies may be transmitted by the TCA <b>40</b> and measured by the tracking device <b>56</b>. Moreover, it is understood that the frequencies may vary beyond those illustrated in the figures, such as lower than about 750 Hz or greater than about 8 kHz. The solid line connecting the crosses indicates a direct or straight line connection between the measured flux at the closest frequencies as plotted regarding the respective coils. The design and configuration of the coils <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> in the tracking device <b>56</b> may be configured as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0070">The phase of the field sensed by each of the coils of the tracking device <b>56</b> may also be determined in a determined field phase at first coil at a selected number of frequencies in block <b>164</b>. Again, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the second row illustrates the measured phase of the field at each of four selected frequencies at each of the three coils of the tracking device <b>56</b>. Again the crosses indicate the actual measured phase of the field at the different frequencies, as plotted in the respective graphs. The solid line connects the measured phase at the closest frequencies. The frequencies are identical or substantially to the frequencies for the selected flux magnitude as illustrated in the first row in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. It is also understood, that a different number or different range of frequencies may be transmitted by the TCA <b>40</b> and the phase measured at the selected coils relating to the selected frequencies.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0071">Accordingly, a determination of a flux magnitude and a flux frequency phase for a selected number of frequencies may be determined for a first coil, such as the first column in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. It is understood, as noted above, that a plurality of coils may be included in the tracking device <b>56</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, second and third coils may also be included in the tracking device <b>56</b>. Accordingly, in blocks <b>168</b> and <b>172</b>, respectively, a determination of a magnitude of flux at a selected additional number of coils, such as n+1 coils may be made and a determination of a phase of n+1 coils at the selected frequencies at block <b>172</b>. Blocks <b>168</b> and <b>172</b>, therefore, may be repeated for any selected number of coils. Accordingly, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, three coils may each have measured a magnitude of flux and a phase of flux for the selected number of frequencies, such as four frequencies. The measured magnitude and phase of flux may then be incorporated in the signal which is transmitted from the tracking device <b>56</b> and received into block <b>144</b>. Accordingly, the determination of a magnitude of flux and a phase of flux for each of the three coils, or any selected number of coils is made in block <b>160</b>-<b>172</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Nevertheless, it is understood by one skilled in the art, that any appropriate number of coils and/or frequencies may be measured for fitting the model as described in Eq. 1.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0072">Once a determination of the magnitude of flux and/or phase regarding the transmitted frequencies from the TCA <b>40</b> are made in blocks <b>160172</b>, a model fit may be determined in block <b>180</b>. The model fit in block <b>180</b> may be fitting the model as described by Eq. 1 to the magnitude of flux and/or phase of flux for each of the coils of the tracking device <b>56</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> the dash line illustrates the model fit to the measured magnitude and/or phase of flux.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0073">As described above the Eq. 1 includes various parameters relating to each of the frequencies. The flux at each selected frequency is the sum of various factors including the flux at a zero frequency, the parameter of flux coupling of a first RL circuit (k<sub>1</sub>), and the flux coupling of a second RL circuit (k<sub>2</sub>) plus a decay time for each of the respective circuits identified by T, where T<sub>1 </sub>relates to the first RL circuit and T<sub>2 </sub>relates to the second RL circuit along with imaginary components of the respective circuits identified by j. For four frequencies, therefore, the model is fit by selected fitting techniques, such as minimizing the square of errors, for each of the parameters k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, and T<sub>2</sub>. The parameters may be estimated or determined using the selected fit, such a minimizing errors, to best fit the model to the measured magnitude of fluxes at the different frequencies (i.e. four frequencies in the disclosed example, it is understood that more or less frequencies and different frequencies may be used and/or that more or additional parameters or parameter sets may be used to model additional RL circuits).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0074">Once the model is best fit, F<sub>0 </sub>may be estimated or extrapolated to calculate a flux at a zero frequency. The flux at a zero frequency is estimated to be the flux with no distortion due to the tray <b>90</b>. Again, although the above disclosure exemplarily refers to the single tray <b>90</b>, more than one interfering object may be present. The model, including Eq. 1, however, may still solve for the distortion as the effects are cumulative. The Eq. 1, therefore, may be used in a model to determine the flux in the navigation volume <b>50</b> regardless of the number of interfering objects. The extrapolation or solving of the model to a flux at a zero frequency is performed in block <b>184</b> and is done after fitting the model, such as estimating the parameters to a best fit, in block <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0075">After extrapolating the model to a flux at a zero frequency an output of the magnitude of the flux at the zero frequency may be made in block <b>190</b>. The output of the magnitude of flux at a zero frequency, as noted above, is determined to be the distortion free magnitude of flux measured at the tracking device <b>56</b>. Accordingly, by extrapolating the model to the zero frequency flux a determination of a distortion free field may be made and output into block <b>190</b>. In other words, correcting for the distortion may include determining a distortion free flux based on a modeled flux interpolated to zero frequency. The output in block <b>190</b> may then be used to recall the position of the tracking device in block <b>126</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0076">Further, the representation of the calibrated field that may be included as the predetermined table or calibration table may be made for a distortion free field generated by the TCA <b>40</b>. Extrapolation or matching of a measured magnitude of flux may be matched to the table recalled in block <b>126</b> to make a determination or estimation of the position of the tracking device <b>56</b>. By removing the distortion in block <b>144</b> and outputting the extrapolated zero frequency flux in block <b>190</b>, the distortion free magnitude of flux determination may be used to recall the position of the tracking device in block <b>126</b>. The procedure, therefore, may be navigated as if the tray <b>90</b> were not present to cause distortion in the field transmitted by the TCA <b>40</b>. Accordingly the tracking or navigation volume <b>50</b> may be navigated in regardless of the presence of the tray <b>90</b> or not.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0077">In various embodiments, the fit of the model, such as based on Eq. 1, may be used as a quality control and/or warning system. If the fit is not appropriate, such as within a selected threshold the user <b>12</b> may be warned (such as with a display with the display device (e.g. STOP) or a sound). A warning may also include discontinuing of the navigation, such as the display device becoming blank. Thus, the user <b>12</b> may be made aware that the fit of the model may not reach a selected threshold. Thus, the user <b>12</b> may alter the procedure, such as altering the work space near the navigation volume.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0078">A threshold may include fit errors that are calculated (e.g. a sum of squared errors) between the model and the expected or known values that are greater than a selected amount. The fit errors, therefore, are generally selected to be small. If the amount is greater than a selected amount, then a sum of errors greater than a threshold may exist.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0079">Generally, the errors that would lead to a bad fit of the model to the expected values may relate to an error or inaccurate navigated position. When an inaccurate navigated positon is determined, navigation may be halted and or a warning to the user <b>12</b> may be given. In various embodiments, the warning may be audio, visual, or some other appropriate warning or output to the user <b>12</b>. [<b>0078</b>] Also, as discussed above, the model fit need not be limited to measuring flux at a selected frequency and extrapolating flux at a zero frequency. Other selected field components may be measured and or effects, such as with a Hall effect sensor, at the tracking device. The sensor, of any appropriate type, may generate a signal based on the sensed field effect or component. The signal may be received and the model may be evaluated with selected parameters, such as based on a first, second or more circuits (such as R-L circuits). The model may be extrapolated to estimate the field component at a zero frequency and the estimation may be output. It is further understood that more than one field component may be included and/or measured. Thus, an undistorted field need not be determined based on or solely on an extrapolated flux at a zero frequency</p><p id="p-0085" num="0080">Example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope to those who are skilled in the art.
