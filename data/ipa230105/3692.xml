Dry coupled wheel probes do not require any intervening acoustical coupling substances such as gels or liquids. For this reason, they are preferable to other types of wheel probes which require an additional non-dry coupling substance.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Known ultrasonic wheel probes are employed to perform thickness measurements of surfaces of such structures being inspected. Such known wheel probes may use a piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer. However, such known wheel probes require normalization to orient the transducer within the wheel probe to cause the ultrasound from the transducer to be emitted perpendicular to the surface being inspected. Perpendicular emission is necessary since the piezoelectric transducer within the wheel probe vibrates in a linear mode to produce the ultrasonic signal in a narrow and generally linear direction which is used for the thickness measurements. Such linear mode vibrations result in inefficiencies in the thickness measurements due to occasional misdirection of the ultrasound towards the structure being measured. Hence, it is necessary to orient the ultrasonic emissions from the transducer directly towards the surface being inspected, in order to increase the efficiency of the measurement operation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an embodiment consistent with the present disclosure, an ultrasonic dry coupled wheel probe with a radial transducer emits ultrasound in substantially all radial directions, and so does not require normalization yet is efficient in directing ultrasound to a surface being inspected.

The emitted sound waves are ultrasonic waves. Each of the first and second cylindrical members is composed of a piezoelectric material. Each of the first, second, third, and fourth electroplates has an annular shape with a centrally positioned electroplate aperture and a longitudinal electroplate axis coincident with a respective longitudinal cylindrical axis of the first and second cylindrical members.

Such radial directions are radial relative to a longitudinal rotational axis of the wheel probe <b>10</b>. As compared to prior art approaches, which require accurate normalization of the transducers relative to a surface being measured, and further require that such normalization be repeatedly performed to obtain accurate measurements of structures, the arrangements of the present disclosure do not require normalization at all. Moreover, the arrangements disclosed herein are efficient in directing ultrasound to a surface being inspected.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The transducer module <b>12</b> in certain implementations is comprised of a piezoelectric material, so that the transducer module <b>12</b> receives an electrical signal, vibrates, and generates and transmits sound, such as ultrasound.

The wheel <b>16</b> is composed of rubber or other known material compositions which acoustically couples the transducer module <b>12</b> to the surface <b>20</b> in a dry coupling configuration. In this arrangement, the ultrasound <b>14</b> passes through the wheel <b>18</b> to the surface <b>20</b> with little or no loss of the ultrasonic signal.

Reflections of such ultrasound from the surface cause the piezoelectric member <b>54</b> of the receiving component <b>52</b> to vibrate, which in turn generates an electrical signal in the electroplates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> of the receiving component <b>52</b>. Such a generated electrical signal is then conveyed through the wires <b>66</b> connected to the electroplates <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> of the receiving component <b>52</b>, and thence to the measuring device. At the measuring device, subsequent signal processing can be employed to determine the characteristics of the surface or the structure being inspected. Unlike conventional approaches, however, normalization or repeated normalization confirmations are not required to ensure that the signals provided to the measuring device are, in fact, accurate measurements, due to the radial construction of the transducer module.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, a second embodiment of the present disclosure provides an ultrasonic dry coupled wheel probe <b>70</b> with a radial transducer module <b>72</b>. The wheel probe <b>70</b> is capable of rotating about the transducer module <b>72</b>, a shaft <b>78</b>, or both structures. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the probe <b>70</b> has wheel members <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> separated by a rotating acoustic barrier <b>84</b> therebetween, with the combination of elements <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> forming the wheel of the wheel probe <b>70</b> which rotates about the transducer module <b>72</b>, the shaft <b>78</b>, or both the transducer module and shaft. The wheel members <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> are composed of rubber or other known material compositions which acoustically couples the transducer module <b>72</b> to a surface of a structure being inspected in a dry coupling configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the transducer module <b>72</b> has a body <b>86</b> including a static acoustic barrier <b>88</b> between a transmitting component <b>90</b> and a receiving component <b>92</b>. The acoustic barriers <b>84</b>, <b>88</b> prevent cross-talk between the components <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>. That is, ultrasound emitted by the transmitting component <b>90</b> is prevented or minimized from being directly received by the receiving component <b>92</b>. As a consequence, the receiving component <b>92</b> only receives a reflection of the emitted ultrasound which is reflected by the surface of the structure being measured. Each of the components <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> of the transducer module <b>72</b> includes an annular piezoelectric member <b>94</b> having an outer annular electroplate <b>96</b> and a respective inner annular electroplate <b>98</b>, <b>100</b>, with each inner annular electroplate <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> being adjacent to the static acoustic barrier <b>88</b>. The outer annular electroplates <b>96</b> and the inner annular electroplates <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> form parallel discs with a central axis coincident with the central axis of the components <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the rotating wheel members <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> and the rotating acoustic barrier <b>84</b> form a rotator <b>102</b> which rotates about the transducer module <b>72</b>. In this arrangement, the transducer module <b>72</b> defines a stator <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, electrical wires <b>106</b> leading from the shaft <b>78</b> are joined to the electroplates <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> by connectors <b>108</b>, such as solder joints. A first electrical signal from a measuring device is applied to the electroplates <b>96</b> of the transmitting component <b>90</b> through the wires <b>106</b>. This first electrical signal causes the piezoelectric member <b>94</b> to vibrate and generate ultrasound radially in substantially all radial directions relative to the shaft <b>78</b>, such as towards a surface of a structure being inspected. In this embodiment, the vibrations and subsequent radially emitted ultrasound are generated by the piezoelectric member <b>94</b> which are induced indirectly by the electroplates <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> through the Poisson effect. Accordingly, the piezoelectric member <b>94</b> is excited in the axial direction by the application of the first electrical signal to the electroplates <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, and so the piezoelectric member <b>94</b> vibrates in such a way that the thickness of piezoelectric member <b>94</b> along the longitudinal axis, coincident with the shaft <b>78</b>, oscillates. When the thickness contracts, the radial diameter of the piezoelectric member <b>94</b> expands, and when the thickness expands, the radial diameter contracts. Therefore, the primary axial vibrations induce secondary radial vibrations causing ultrasound to be generated and transmitted radially through the wheel component <b>80</b>, which is composed of rubber or other dry coupling material, and which surrounds and rotates around the transmitting component <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Reflections of such ultrasound from the surface causes the piezoelectric member <b>94</b> of the receiving component <b>92</b> to vibrate, which in turn generates a second electrical signal in the electroplates <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> of the receiving component <b>92</b>. The second electrical signal is conveyed through the wires <b>106</b> connected to the electroplates <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> of the receiving component <b>92</b>, and thereafter to the measuring device for subsequent signal processing to determine the characteristics of the surface or the structure being inspected.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The embodiments of the present disclosure are probes having transducer modules that can be comprised of twin-crystal components, that is, the pair of components <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and the pair of components <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>, respectively, which form a transmitting piezoelectric crystal and a receiving piezoelectric crystal, respectively.
