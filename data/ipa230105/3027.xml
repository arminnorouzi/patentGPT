More recently, interest in applying this construction practice to sloped residential roofs, including slate, tile and/or asphalt shingle style roofs, has grown. Issues with traditional roofing panels include the fact that they can be blown off by wind and windblown rain can flow and leak between the panels. Thus, such roofing panels must be sealed along the junctions of individual panels after application, which can be done in a variety of ways including, for example, applying a roofing membrane over the panels, taping the junctions of the panels, applying a traditional shingled roof over the panels, and combinations thereof. All of these sealing options are labor intensive and subject to human error and deterioration over time. In addition, some existing roofing panels, such as used for slate or tile roofs, generally are rigid and often are subject to breakage, and further must be mounted on underling supporting substrates.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A need exists for roofing panels that, upon installation, collect and/or shed water without the need for ancillary sealing or roofing strategies, and/or which can incorporate design features that inherently provide effective watershedding at critical panel junctions while being easily installable on a roof deck. It is to the provision of such roofing panels that the present disclosure is primarily directed.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Briefly described, construction panels are constructed with integral water collection and shedding features. In embodiments, the panels can comprise roofing panels and can be installed as part of a roof structure, such as for a residential or commercial roof. The water collection and watershedding features of the panels further will be configured to align and cooperate so as to collect rainwater and shed the rainwater down the slope of and off the roof, and with the need for ancillary sealing strategies to be employed being substantially minimized or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one non-limiting, example embodiment, the panels can each include a body, having at least one watershedding feature defined along at least one of an upper surface, a lower surface, and/or one or more peripheral edge portions of the body. The at least one watershedding feature is configured to receive and direct water along a drainage path away from the base. The body of each of the panels generally will include one or more fillers, which can include recycled materials and/or inert material such as sand, perlite, sodium bentonite, asphalt, or other granular materials, mixed with at least one binder, which can include a polymer or mix of polymers. In some embodiments, the polymer material can include recycled plastic materials or plastic materials from other waste streams, as well as various binder adhesives and/or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments of the disclosure, a method of forming the panels is disclosed, wherein the filler material and binder material (which generally will be shredded or crushed, or otherwise provided as a granulate or particulate) will be combined together in a selected ratio to form a mixture that is extruded to form an extrudate. In embodiments, the extrudate can be extruded and pressed and/or cut to form panels, such as roofing panels, with watershedding features integrally formed along peripheral side portions or edged thereof. For example, the panels can be formed with an integrated drip edge, lip, trough, or other watershedding feature along one or more peripheral edges thereof, and cut to a selected length.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In still other embodiments of the method, the mixture can form a top layer of a panel, and then joined and pressed or otherwise combined and fused to a bottom layer or substrate. In further embodiments, a UV protective layer or other protective or decorative layer or coating (e.g. an impact resistant coating, etc.) also can be applied over an upper surface of the body of the panels.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In various embodiments, the watershedding features integrated with the body of each of the panels, or with one of the layers thereof, will comprise at least one of a flexible strip, a trough, or a cover strip located along adjacent peripheral edge portions of the bases of adjacent roofing panels. For example, in some embodiments, one or more peripheral edges of the panels can be formed with asymmetrical, raised or arching profiles configured to cooperatively fit and/or engage with the watershedding features of adjacent panels. The panels further can be installed in either direction and can be shifted to manage overlapping of the watershedding features, such as along the corners between adjacent panels. In some embodiments, the watershedding features also can include projections or offset protrusions or saddles along which fasteners can be placed to help secure the panels to the roof structure and provide additional wind protection.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In still other embodiments, the watershedding features of the panels can comprise a drip edge or lip seal extending along at least one side edge, with a water trough positioned to receive and direct water flows along a drainage path long a slope of the roof and away from the panels. In some embodiments, the drip edges or lip seals of adjacent panels further can be engaged in an overlapping and/or a hooked arrangement. In addition, a cover strip or capped seam can be mounted along a seam defined between adjacent panels.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further embodiment, each of the panels can include a body having watershedding features formed as rolled or sloped portions along peripheral edge portions thereof, and which will be configured to overlap with a corresponding rolled or sloped edge portion of an adjacent panel to define a headlap or sidelap seam between adjacent roofing panels. In still other embodiments, the body of each panel can be formed with a stepped or offset profile with a projecting portion along one side edge (e.g. along a lower or side edge) and a recessed area or potion along an opposing side edge (e.g. along an upper or side edge). The projecting portions will overlap corresponding recessed portions of adjacent panels, and can form headlap joints or seams along which fasteners can be applied to secure the panels to the rafters of the roof structure. Sealant materials also can be applied between the overlapping features.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some other embodiments, the body of each of the panels can be formed with an upper surface adapted to be exposed to the environment, and a lower surface having a series of grooves, recesses or valleys that form part of the watershedding features. In addition, the body of each panel can be formed with hooked peripheral edges, or can include a frame positioned about its peripheral edges, defining drip edges, troughs or other features, will be arranged along one or more of the peripheral edges of the panels, and will be configured to collect and direct water along drainage paths. A cover also can be applied over the drip edges of adjacent roofing panels.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In still another aspect, a roof system, comprises a plurality of panels configured to extend across sections of a roof; wherein each of the panels comprises a body or base having upper and lower surfaces and a plurality of peripheral edges; and at least one water shedding feature positioned adjacent at least one of the plurality of peripheral edges of the base; wherein the at least one watershedding feature of each panel is configured cooperate with a corresponding watershedding feature of an adjacent panel to reduce migration of water between the sidelap or headlap seams between the adjacent ones of the roofing panels. In some embodiments, a cover or trough further can be positioned along the sidelap or headlap seams between adjacent panels and configured to overlap the water shedding features of adjacent panels.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A method of installing roofing panels with watershedding features also is disclosed. In some aspects, the method can include arranging a plurality of roofing panels in spaced series, and coupling adjacent ones of the roofing panels along sidelap or headlap seams with the watershedding features of the roofing panels in an overlapping or engaging arrangement to collect and direct water flows along a drainage path and away from the roofing panels. In addition, the panels can be arranged in various orientations, including being arranged with their length extending in a horizontal direction, in a vertical direction, or diagonally. Other arrangements also can be used.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The foregoing and other advantages and aspects of the embodiments of the present disclosure will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following detailed description and the claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The following description is provided as an enabling teaching of embodiments of this disclosure. Those skilled in the relevant art will recognize that many changes can be made to the embodiments described, while still obtaining the beneficial results. It will also be apparent that some of the desired benefits of the embodiments described can be obtained by selecting some of the features of the embodiments without utilizing other features. Accordingly, those who work in the art will recognize that many modifications and adaptations to the embodiments described are possible and may even be desirable in certain circumstances. Thus, the following description is provided as illustrative of the principles of the embodiments of the disclosure and not in limitation thereof, since the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the claims.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The panels of the present disclosure can be used in various aspects for construction of buildings or other structures, such as for walls, roofs, etc. For purposes of illustration and not limitation, the panels are shown as roofing panels that include, in numerous embodiments, integrated features for waterproofing and shedding rainwater from sidelap seams of horizontally adjacent roofing panels and headlap seams of roofing panels in vertically adjacent courses. In embodiments, the watershedding features generally will be formed with and/or otherwise integrated as a part of the roofing panels at a manufacturing facility (prefab). The watershedding features disclosed herein also can be applied to a variety of roofing systems including, but not limited to panels, tiles, slate roofing, or metal roofing just to name a few.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The body of each panel further generally will be formed with sufficient strength or structural supporting properties so as to extend across a span or space between adjacent rafters of the roof structure on which the panels are installed. For example, in some embodiments, the panels can be configured to extend across a larger span or space, such as extending between an eave or building wall and a peak of the roof, and/or across the roof structure sufficient to reduce the number of rafters for the roof structure. The panels also can have nail sealing properties to resist or retard passage of water through fastener openings formed therethrough.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to the drawing figures, various embodiments of roofing panels according to principles of the present disclosure can be configured to be installed on a roof in a variety of configurations. For example, the roofing panels can be attached atop and extend across a span between rafters of a roof, having sufficient strength to support weight without necessarily requiring a supporting plywood roof deck therebelow. Alternatively, the panels can be formed as structural roofing panels can replace the plywood deck and at least some of the supporting rafters and trusses of a roof. For example, the roofing panels can comprise a structural insulated panel (SIP) of a configuration and/or size to extend across or along a span between one or more rafter or between a ridge or peak of the roof and an eave of the roof or a side wall of the building, sufficient to substantially eliminate rafters or reduce the number of rafters required for supplementing the structural integrity of the roof.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The use of the panels can provide numerous benefits including, but not limited to, the elimination of headlaps and consequently the need for headlap water shedding features. Horizontal seams, which may seem unsightly, also can be eliminated. Many of the sidelap water shedding feature embodiments described above may be used between horizontally adjacent panels in this embodiment. Another benefit is that these large roofing panels can be made sufficiently strong to provide their own structural support thus substantially eliminating or greatly reducing the need for trusses, rafters, and/or roof decks.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As indicated in the figures, such as, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>1</b><i>b, </i>the roofing panels <b>10</b> can comprise a body or base <b>11</b> having upper and lower surfaces <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> and a series of peripheral portions or side edges <b>14</b>. The panels <b>10</b> can be formed with various shapes or configurations. For example, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>1</b><i>b, </i>in some embodiments, the panels <b>10</b> can have substantially rectangular or square configurations, while in other embodiments, the panels can be form in triangular, hexagonal, octagonal or other shapes. In addition, in some embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>b, </i>the panels <b>10</b> also can be formed with textures, patterns, colors, tints or other selected aesthetic features <b>16</b>; for example, in some non-limiting embodiments, being formed as a slate or roman tile, or with the appearance of other roofing products.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The body <b>11</b> of each of the panels <b>10</b> generally will include one or more fillers, which can include recycled materials (e.g. recycled shingle granules or other recycled, granulated materials) and/or inert materials, mixed with at least one binder, which can include a polymer or mix of polymers. In some embodiments, the polymer material can include recycled plastic materials and/or plastic materials from other waste streams, as well as various binder adhesives and/or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, but without limitation, the filler material can include inert and recycled materials such as sand, granules, crushed, pulverized and/or shredded asphalt shingles, granules reclaimed from shingle recycling, dust byproducts, cement, aggregates, sodium bentonite, bentonite clay, rice hulls, perlite, hemp, foaming agent, cellulose, among other materials. The filler materials generally can be crushed or pulverized to a size or &#x215b;&#x2033; or less to promote flowability and mixing. Other sizes of granules or particulate fillers also can be used as needed or desired. The filler materials further can be selected to provide sufficient texture to provide a slip resistant upper surface <b>24</b> for each of the panels <b>10</b> for walking.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, the binder materials for the mixture can include various recycled polymer or plastic materials, including recycled plastics, mixed plastics, commingled plastics, unwashed plastics, plastic films, contaminated plastics. For example, in some non-limiting embodiments, recycled low density polyethylene (LDPE) films such as found in recycled grocery bags, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) films, high density polyethylene (HDPE) films, or polypropylene films can be used. In other, non-limiting embodiments, materials such as recycled agricultural films (which can include hay bale wraps, greenhouse films and/or geotextiles or geo-membranes that can have some UV protection remaining) can be used. In still further non-limiting embodiments, in place of melting polymers or plastic materials, oriented strand board binders (such as polyurea, urea formaldehyde, phenolic resins, Amino resins, or wax emulsions, etc.), or starches (e.g. dextrin), lignin's, adhesives, asphaltic binders, cement, adhesives, and/or combinations thereof, also could be used.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The granulated filler materials will be mixed with a selected binder material or a mixture of selected binder materials in a desired ratio. By way of example, and without limitation, in some aspects, a polymer or plastic material such as LDPE can be shredded or crushed and mixed with the granulated filler material in a ratio of 1:1, or 2:1, or 3:1, or 4:1 or 5:1. Other ratios of the binder materials to the filler materials also can be used.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">By way of illustration and not limitation, various achievable filler:binder ratios can be determined based upon factors such as a selection of the filler and the binder materials being used, the manufacturing process used for the selected roofing panel material and/or use thereof, the desired mechanical properties of the roofing panel material, and the cost target of the material, and/or combinations thereof. For example, samples were developed using sand and recycled polymer materials, and were developed having an approximately &#x2dc;3:1 ratio based upon manufacturing or processing. However, such a limitation may not exist for a different filler and binder material combination, which therefore may have a different ratio.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the polymer binder materials of the panels may or may not include other additives such as UV blockers, fire retardants, compatibilizers, and/or combinations thereof. Alternatively, or in addition, the upper surface of the body of each panel also can have a protective layer or coating applied thereover to provide UV protection, impact protection, cut resistance and/or other properties.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In embodiments, the thickness of the roofing panels can vary based on the structural requirements of a given installation and other factors, such as the material properties of the mixture of the filler and binder materials used. In some embodiments, the extruded portion of the panel may be between &#x215b;&#x2033; to 2,&#x2033; with additional thicknesses possible if rigid underlayers are included, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>13</b><i>b. </i>In other embodiments, the panels can have a thickness of &#x215b;&#x2033; to 1&#xbd;&#x2033;, &#x215b;&#x2033; to 1&#x2033;, &#x215b;&#x2033; to &#xbe;&#x2033;, or &#x215b;to &#xbd;&#x2033;. Other thicknesses also can be used. The sizes of the panels also could range from a small panel such as the size of a 12&#x2033;&#xd7;36&#x2033; shingle or the size of a clay tile, to a larger panel approximately 48&#x2033;&#xd7;96&#x2033;. Various other sizes and/or configurations, for example, ranging from approximately 20&#x2033;&#xd7;44&#x2033; to 50&#x2033;&#xd7;100&#x2033;, although other sizes also can be used.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>10</b><i>c, </i>the panels <b>10</b> will be formed with integrated watershedding features <b>20</b>, with the watershedding features <b>20</b> generally being located along at least one peripheral edge portion <b>11</b>A/<b>11</b>B of the body <b>11</b> of each panel <b>10</b>, and configured to direct water along at least one drainage path <b>20</b>A and away from seams or joints, such as headlap and/or sidelap joints or seams <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> formed between adjacent installed panels <b>10</b>. The watershedding features <b>20</b> of the panels <b>10</b> each further will be configured to cooperate with a corresponding watershedding feature <b>20</b> of an adjacent panel <b>10</b> to substantially seal the headlap and/or sidelap joints or seams <b>21</b>/<b>22</b> between adjacent installed panels and reduce migration of water between the adjacent installed panels.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, in some embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>2</b><i>c, </i>one or more peripheral edges <b>26</b> of the panels <b>10</b> can include a body <b>28</b> formed with asymmetrical, raised, or arching profile or shape that is configured to cooperatively fit and/or engage with corresponding or complementary shaped body <b>30</b> or other watershedding features of adjacent panels. The panels <b>10</b> further can be installed in either direction and can be shifted to manage overlapping of the watershedding features <b>20</b>, such as along the corners between adjacent panels.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>3</b><i>b, </i>the watershedding features <b>20</b>, in some embodiments, also can include projections or protrusions or saddles <b>30</b> along which fasteners <b>32</b> can be placed to help secure the panels <b>10</b> to the roof structure and provide additional wind protection. The projections <b>30</b> can be formed with or otherwise connected to the watershedding features <b>20</b> (e.g., the body <b>28</b> with the arching profile or shape), and can include a projection body <b>34</b> with a plurality of openings or apertures <b>36</b> defined therein for receiving the fasteners <b>32</b>. The fasteners <b>32</b> can include nails, screws, other fasteners, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In still other embodiments such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>5</b><i>c, </i>the watershedding features <b>20</b> of the panels <b>10</b> can comprise a drip edge or lip seal <b>40</b> extending along the at least one side edge <b>11</b>A/<b>11</b>B of their bodies <b>11</b>, with a water trough <b>42</b> positioned to receive and direct water flows along a drainage path <b>42</b>A along a slope of the roof <b>5</b> and away from the panels <b>10</b>.

Thereafter, the panels <b>10</b> are secured to the roofing substrate using fasteners <b>120</b>, such as nails, screws, etc. at least two of the four sides of the panels, such that the panels do not peel up when experiencing wind loads.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments of the disclosure, a method of forming the panels is disclosed, wherein the filler material and binder material <b>150</b> (which generally will be shredded or crushed, or otherwise provided as a granulate or particulate) will be combined together in a selected ratio to form a mixture that is extruded under heat to form an extrudate.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In embodiments, the extrudate can be extruded in the form of a panel, such as a roofing panel, with watershedding features integrally formed therewith. In other embodiments, the extrudate can be formed as a sheet that can be pressed or stamped and cut in a desired panel configuration, with the watershedding features formed therewith. For example, the panels can be formed with an integrated drip edge, lip, trough, or other watershedding feature along one or more peripheral edges thereof, and cut to a selected length.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In still other embodiments of the method, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>13</b><i>b, </i>the mixture <b>150</b> can form a top layer or portion <b>152</b> of a panel <b>10</b>, which can be formed separately from a bottom layer or portion <b>154</b>, and then joined and pressed or otherwise combined and fused to the substrate <b>156</b>. For example, the bottom portion <b>154</b> could comprise a flexible polymer sheet or bottom layer that can be formed (e.g. extruded) in a separate process from the formation of the extrudate or top layer, and then the two layers brought together and pressed while still at a temperature sufficient to enable the portions or layers to be substantially fused together to form the panel body. The formation of such panels can facilitation concentration of colorants, textures, granular and other filer materials adapted to provide performance and/or aesthetic characteristics such as slip resistance, UV protection.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the substrate or bottom layer further could include more rigid materials, such as a plywood, metal, or other substantially rigid materials, over which the extrudate can be applied to form a panel body. In some embodiments, a UV protective layer or other protective layer (e.g. an impact resistant coating, etc.) also can be applied over an upper surface of the body of the panels.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In embodiments, the panels <b>10</b> will be formed in configurations that optimize size, shape, material usage, minimize overlaps, minimize the cutting required at obstructions, prevent windblown water leaks, increase speed of installation, enable using faster production processes, and prevent wind uplift. In addition, in some applications, a thinner tile can be less expensive. In order to reduce thickness, other manufacturing processes and material formulations can be used.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, the panels <b>10</b> can be sized or configured to match the size or configuration of a typical solar panel, e.g. 3.25 feet by 6.<b>5</b> feet for a 72 cell panel. Any or all of the water shedding feature embodiments described above may be used in such panels. In addition, the panels can include a frame with releasable connectors, such as clips, snaps, magnets, hooks, fasteners, brackets/battens, or other connectors, enabling removal and replacement or change-out as needed. With such a sizing strategy, a waterproofing layer on the top of a panel can be replaced by a solar panel without changing or disturbing the water shedding capabilities of the installation.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, adaptation of the water shedding feature concepts disclosed herein can be made to a green or living roof, which traditionally has been limited to low slope roofs. A roofing panel forming a framework or a tray sized to contain a layer of biological or vegetative, living material such as grass allows green roofs to be used on the steep slope roofs of residential houses as well. The growing material of each panel can be changed or replaced without disturbing the water shedding features and functions of the roof panel installation. For example, such a panel framework can include connectors that engage brackets, battens or other cooperative connectors arranged along the underlying roof structure (e.g. a roof deck or substrate, or rafters or other support beams), and also can include connectors configured to connect or interlock with adjacent panels. Such connectors can include, but are not limited to hooks, snap, magnets, clips, locking connectors, fasteners and/or other engageable and disengageable connectors.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition, the vegetative or &#x201c;green&#x201d; panels shown are to be understood as examples of various types of panels, which panels further can be made interchangeable, i.e., they can be snapped or changed by a homeowner, etc. . . . , and various other types of panels, including various types of &#x201c;smart&#x201d; or functional/decorative panels such as (but not limited to) energy panels configured to collect solar, wind, and heat energy, i.e. solar panels; panels configured for water collection and filtration; panels adapted to provide or configured with an antenna array; illuminating panels or panels with pre-installed lights; panels configured to enable roof access equipment, containing items such as a retractable ladder; skylight panels; panels configured for digital sensing/communications; decorative panels in solid colors, textures, patterns and/or customizable print options; panels incorporating traditional roofing materials and aesthetics; panels with storage chamber for parts and tools for easy repair/replacement; and/or various combinations thereof, can be exchanged or substituted therefor.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The foregoing description generally illustrates and describes various embodiments of the present disclosure. It will, however, be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made to the above-discussed construction of the present disclosure without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure as disclosed herein, and that it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as being illustrative, and not to be taken in a limiting sense.
