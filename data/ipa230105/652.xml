Conditions that may require an above-knee amputation include peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, infections, gangrene, trauma that causes the lower leg to be crushed or severed, and cancer.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most above-knee amputations are performed due to peripheral vascular disease which causes reduce blood flow to the limbs. Poor circulation limits healing and immune responses to an injury or an infection which may spread and become life threatening. Above-knee amputations are performed when blood flow is inadequate, or when an infection is so severe that it prohibits a lower-level surgery.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During an above-knee amputation, the diseased or injured part of the leg is removed, while the healthy tissue and bone is kept as much as possible. The surgeon shapes the remaining limb to allow the best use of a prosthetic leg after recovery. After surgery, it is important to protect the wound so that it can heal properly.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general terms, the present disclosure relates to a removable dressing that is configured to protect a wound from an above-knee amputation. Various aspects are described in this disclosure, which include, but are not limited to, the following aspects.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect relates to a kit for removably dressing a leg amputated above-knee. The kit comprises a leg protector, the leg protector including: a thigh piece configured to wrap around a thigh of the leg; and an end piece configured to removably attach to the thigh piece, and to wrap around a distal end of the leg; a belt configured to be secured around a torso; and one or more limb attachment straps, each limb attachment strap configured to attach the belt to at least one of the thigh piece or the end piece to anchor the leg protector to the torso.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect relates to a method of attaching a leg protector to a leg amputated above-knee. The method comprises wrapping an end piece about an axis of rotation to cover a distal end of the leg; wrapping a thigh piece about an axis of rotation to cover a thigh of the leg such that a second distal end of the thigh piece overlaps a first distal end of the thigh piece, the axis of rotation of the thigh piece being orthogonal to the axis of rotation of the end piece; and removably attaching a fastener on an interior surface of the thigh piece to one or more fasteners on an exterior surface of the thigh piece to secure the thigh piece and the end piece around the leg amputated above-knee.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect relates to a leg protector for a leg amputated above-knee. The leg protector comprises a thigh piece configured to wrap around a first axis of rotation to wrap around a thigh of the leg amputated above-knee; and an end piece configured to removably attach to the thigh piece, and to wrap around a second axis of rotation to wrap around a distal end of the leg amputated above-knee, wherein the second axis of rotation is orthogonal to the first axis of rotation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

described in detail with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts and assemblies throughout the several views. Reference to various embodiments does not limit the scope of the claims attached hereto. Additionally, any examples set forth in this specification are not intended to be limiting and merely set forth some of the many possible embodiments for the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a kit <b>10</b> that includes a leg protector <b>100</b>. The leg protector <b>100</b> is a removable dressing that protects a wound from dehiscence after an above-knee amputation. The leg protector <b>100</b> is therapeutic and promotes healing by providing warmth and cushioning for the amputated leg. The leg protector <b>100</b> includes a number of separate pieces that attach to each other. When assembled, the leg protector <b>100</b> covers, warms, and protects the amputated leg.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The leg protector <b>100</b> includes a thigh piece <b>102</b> that is configured to wrap around the thigh of the amputated leg. The leg protector <b>100</b> further includes an end piece <b>104</b> that is configured to removably attach to the thigh piece <b>102</b>, and to wrap around a distal end (i.e., stump) of the amputated leg. The thigh piece <b>102</b> and the end piece <b>104</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, and will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The leg protector <b>100</b> can include a distal spacer <b>106</b> that is configured to reduce or eliminate a space between an interior surface of the end piece <b>104</b> and the distal end of the amputated leg to provide additional cushioning and protection. For example, the distal spacer <b>106</b> can include a body portion <b>116</b> that is lined with a padding material <b>114</b> for cushioning and warming the stump of the amputated leg. The body portion <b>116</b> can include a foam layer that is at least partially surrounded by an outer layer of an air-permeable and durable fabric material.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The interior surfaces of the thigh piece <b>102</b> and the end piece <b>104</b> can also be lined with the padding material <b>114</b>. The padding material is washable such that the leg protector <b>100</b> is configured for extended wear and use. The padding material <b>114</b> is made from a light and soft or airy material such as fleece, wool, cotton, or similar types of materials.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The thigh piece <b>102</b>, end piece <b>104</b>, and distal spacer <b>106</b> can protect a leg amputated above-knee from impact with an object whether from a patient fall, an object falling onto the amputated leg, or from accidentally banging the amputated leg into another object. For example, the thigh piece <b>102</b>, end piece <b>104</b>, and distal spacer <b>106</b> can each include foam layers as well as the padding material <b>114</b> to cushion and protect the amputated leg from impacts with objects. The cushioning and protection provided by the leg protector <b>100</b> may help to prevent dehiscence of the wound, which can cause severe pain, bleeding, and inflammation.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, the thigh piece <b>102</b>, end piece <b>104</b>, and distal spacer <b>106</b> warm the amputated leg with minimal skin trauma (e.g. ulcerations, cracking, and/or abrasions). For example, the padding material <b>114</b> allows the thigh piece <b>102</b> end piece <b>104</b>, and distal spacer <b>106</b> to warm the amputated leg to promote vasodilatation and maintain blood circulation, while preventing ulceration or other physical degradation of the stump of the amputated leg.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The leg protector <b>100</b> is machine washable for extended use and reusability. Also, the leg protector <b>100</b> does not use any latex materials such that it is a latex-free product.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the leg protector <b>100</b> includes a belt <b>108</b> and one or more limb attachment straps <b>110</b>. As will be described in more detail, the belt <b>108</b> and the one or more limb attachment straps <b>110</b> can be used to anchor the leg protector <b>100</b> to a patient's body after the leg protector is attached to a leg amputated above-knee.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the kit <b>10</b> can include scissors <b>112</b>. As will be described in more detail, the scissors <b>112</b> can be used by a caregiver to trim and thereby adjust the size of the thigh piece <b>102</b> to more comfortably fit around the thigh of a patient.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view of an exterior surface <b>120</b> of the thigh piece <b>102</b> shown in an unwrapped condition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view of an interior surface <b>122</b> of the thigh piece <b>102</b> shown in an unwrapped condition. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the thigh piece <b>102</b> has a first distal end <b>130</b>, a second distal end <b>132</b>, a first lateral side <b>134</b>, and a second lateral side <b>136</b>. When the leg protector <b>100</b> is worn, the first lateral side <b>134</b> is adjacent to the crotch region of the patient, and the second lateral side <b>136</b> is adjacent to the stump of the amputated leg.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The thigh piece <b>102</b> has a length L and a width W. The length L is substantially longer than the width W such that the thigh piece <b>102</b> has a substantially rectangular shape. In some examples, the length L ranges from about 40 inches to about 44 inches. In some examples, the length L is about 42 inches. In some examples, the width W ranges from about 8 inches to about 12 inches.
