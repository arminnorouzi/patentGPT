Information is stored by programing different states of a memory cell.

One way of reducing manufacturing costs is to improve manufacturing processes to increase the margin of successfully manufactured devices. Manufacturers can improve the manufacturing margin by implementing processes that, for example, increase the consistency or tolerance off manufacturing steps (e.g., removal or deposition of materials), improve the scale of manufacturing, reduce variability among memory cells, etc.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many aspects of the present technology can be better understood with reference to the following drawings.

In some embodiments, the memory array may include densely populated access lines (e.g., word lines, bit lines) that topologically cross each other without physical intersections. Further, memory cells can be formed at each topological cross-points between individual word lines and bit lines. In this manner, individual access lines may be coupled with a plurality of memory cells. Such access lines may be formed with a minimum pitch (e.g., a combination of a minimum line width and a minimum space between the lines in a repeated line and space pattern) for a given process technology node to maximize a quantity of memory cells per unit area.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, a substrate includes the CMOS circuitry configured to access (e.g., read, write) the memory cells coupled with access lines, above which the memory array is disposed. In such embodiments, individual access lines laterally extend across a boundary of the memory array and connect to corresponding vias that vertically extend from the CMOS circuitry. Such vias may have a dimension (e.g., width) equal to (or less than) the pitch of the access lines&#x2014;hence, the vias may be referred to as on-pitch vias. The interface between the on-pitch vias and the corresponding access lines may determine an amount of current flowing between the memory cells and the CMOS circuitry through the access lines (e.g., the access lines carrying the current). Maintaining the current uniform throughout the memory array may be beneficial to minimize variations in electrical characteristics of the memory cells, such as programming and/or read current distributions, cycling behaviors, data retention characteristics, among others.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, a group of on-pitch vias may be disposed in an area next to the memory array, which may be referred to as a socket area (or a socket region). During fabrication processing steps, the socket area may experience nonuniform processing conditions due to differences between the memory array and the socket area&#x2014;e.g., differences in pattern density, material compositions, or the like. Such nonuniform processing conditions may result in the vias in the socket region to have unintended, dissimilar features from each other. For example, the vias designed to have identical physical dimensions (e.g., vias laid out identical to each other) may have different heights depending on their proximity to the memory array. In other examples, the vias disposed proximate to the memory array may develop uneven surface topology and/or interface characteristics, which may interfere with the current flowing past the surface and/or the interface. Such variabilities may be referred to as a proximity effect. If the proximity effect influences the on-pitch vias resulting in undesirably broad distributions of the current flowing through the on-pitch vias, the memory arrays may suffer from reduced yield and/or become susceptible to reliability issues.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present technology facilitates to reduce nonuniformities in electrical characteristics of the on-pitch vias that may be incurred by the process variabilities stemming from the proximity effect to the memory array. In some embodiments, lengths of on-pitch vias (in some cases, with their widths fixed at a constant value, e.g., equal to or less than the pitch of access lines) may be modified based on distances between the on-pitch vias and the memory array. For example, the on-pitch vias located nearer to the memory array may be designed (e.g., laid out) to include a greater length than other on-pitch vias located farther from the memory array. As a result, the on-pitch vias located nearer to the memory array may have more elongated surface shape having a greater surface area than the other on-pitch vias. In some cases, the greater surface area of the on-pitch vias may improve surface and/or interface characteristics of the vias to be more robust against nonuniform process conditions&#x2014;e.g., a nonuniform process conditions associated with a chemical-mechanical polishing process that exposes the surface of on-pitch vias.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Numerous specific details are disclosed herein to provide a thorough and enabling description of embodiments of the present technology. A person skilled in the art, however, will understand that the technology may have additional embodiments and that the technology may be practiced without several of the details of the embodiments described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>5</b></figref>. For example, some details of memory devices well known in the art have been omitted so as not to obscure the present technology. In general, it should be understood that various other devices and systems in addition to those specific embodiments disclosed herein may be within the scope of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;lateral,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; and &#x201c;below&#x201d; can refer to relative directions or positions of features in the semiconductor devices in view of the orientation shown in the Figures. For example, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; or &#x201c;uppermost&#x201d; can refer to a feature positioned closer to the top of a page than another feature. These terms, however, should be construed broadly to include semiconductor devices having other orientations, such as inverted or inclined orientations where top/bottom, over/under, above/below, up/down, and left/right can be interchanged depending on the orientation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that suitable stages of the methods described herein can be performed at the wafer level or at the die level. Therefore, depending upon the context in which it is used, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; can refer to a wafer-level substrate or to a singulated, die-level substrate. Furthermore, unless the context indicates otherwise, structures disclosed herein can be formed using conventional semiconductor-manufacturing techniques. Materials can be deposited, for example, using chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, spin coating, and/or other suitable techniques. Similarly, materials can be removed, for example, using plasma etching, wet etching, chemical-mechanical planarization, or other suitable techniques. A person skilled in the relevant art will also understand that the technology may have additional embodiments, and that the technology may be practiced without several of the details of the embodiments described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a 3-dimensional (3D) cross-point memory array <b>101</b>. The memory array <b>101</b> illustrates two (2) decks of memory arrays&#x2014;e.g., a first deck (a lower deck) including memory cells <b>115</b><i>a</i>, a second deck (an upper deck) including memory cells <b>115</b><i>b</i>. Each deck includes two sets of access lines (e.g., word lines, bit lines). Namely, the memory array <b>101</b> includes the first deck having a set of word lines <b>105</b><i>a </i>(individually identified as <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> through <b>105</b>-<i>a</i><b>4</b>) and a set of bit lines <b>110</b> (individually identified as <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-<b>4</b>), the second deck including a set of word lines <b>105</b><i>b </i>(individually identified as <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> through <b>105</b>-<i>b</i><b>4</b>) and the set of bit lines <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the set of bit lines <b>110</b> are common to (shared by) both the first and second decks of the memory array <b>101</b>. At each topological cross-point of individual word lines <b>105</b><i>a </i>(or word lines <b>105</b><i>b</i>) and bit lines <b>110</b>, a memory cell <b>115</b><i>a </i>(or a memory cell <b>115</b><i>b</i>) may be formed. Moreover, as one skilled in the art will readily appreciate, the word lines and the bit lines are interchangeable (and can be collectively referred to as access lines) without losing their functions and/or meanings.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the word lines <b>105</b> are substantially parallel each other. Similarly, the bit lines <b>110</b> are substantially parallel to each other. Further, the set of word lines may extend to a first direction and the set of bit line may extend to a second direction that is substantially perpendicular to the first direction. In some cases, the word lines may be referred to as rows. Similarly, the bit lines may be referred to as columns. In some embodiments, the access lines include a conductive material (e.g., tungsten (W), copper (Cu)).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each memory cell <b>115</b> may include a storage component <b>120</b> and a selector component <b>125</b> connected in series. In some embodiments, the memory component <b>120</b> and/or the selector component <b>125</b> include chalcogenide materials. In some embodiments, the storage component <b>120</b> includes a conductive material that interfaces with the access lines. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the storage component <b>120</b> of the memory cell <b>115</b><i>b </i>connects to the access line <b>105</b><i>b </i>through the conductive material (not shown). Similarly, the selector component <b>125</b> may include a conductive material that interfaces with the access lines. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the selector component <b>125</b> of the memory cell <b>115</b><i>b </i>connects to the access line <b>110</b> through the conductive material (not shown). In some cases (not shown), each memory cell may comprise a sole component, for example comprising a chalcogenide material, acting both as storage and selector components. The sole component may be referred to as a self-selecting component.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some cases, the composite stack of materials forming the memory cells may be collectively referred to as cell stacks. For example, a cell stack depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may include a word line <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> (e.g., a conductive material of the word line <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>), a memory cell <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, a bit line <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> (e.g., a conductive material of the bit line <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>), a memory cell <b>115</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>, and a word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>. In some cases, when the fabrication process for making the memory array <b>101</b> is in progress, the cell stack may omit one or more materials. For example, when the word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> is not yet formed, the cell stack may refer to the stack including the word line <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, a memory cell <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, a bit line <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, and a memory cell <b>115</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In operation, a memory device including the memory array <b>101</b> may select (or activate) a word line and a bit line of a deck using CMOS circuitry through vias (e.g., on-pitch vias) coupled with the word line and the bit line, respectively. For example, the word line <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> and the bit line <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> can be selected (e.g., activated) by the CMOS circuitry to access (e.g., read, write) the memory cell <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> to determine (or modify) a logic state of the memory cell <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>. Similarly, the word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>4</b> and the bit line <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> can be selected (e.g., activated) by the CMOS circuitry to access (e.g., read, write) the memory cell <b>115</b><i>b</i>-<b>4</b>. Although, in the foregoing example embodiment, the memory array having two (2) decks of memory cells has been described and illustrated, in other embodiments, memory arrays may include a different quantity of decks of memory cells. For example, memory arrays may include four (4), eight (8), or even more decks of memory cells.

Further, the on-pitch vias <b>340</b> may include a width perpendicular to the length, where the width is equal to or less than a pitch of the access lines. For example, the diagram <b>300</b><i>a </i>includes an enlarged portion of the socket region <b>335</b><i>a </i>including the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b</i>. As described above, the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b </i>overlays (i.e., connects to) the word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>. The on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b </i>can be designed (e.g., drawn or laid out) to have a length Lv that is longitudinal to the word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>. Further, the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b </i>can be designed to have a width Wv perpendicular to the length Lv. In some embodiments, the width Wv may be equal to the pitch P of the word lines <b>105</b><i>b</i>, i.e., a width (w) of the word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> and a space (s) between the word lines (e.g., the word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>3</b> and the word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>). In other embodiments, the width Wv may be less than the pitch P of the word lines <b>105</b><i>b</i>.

The on-pitch vias <b>340</b> depicted in the diagram <b>300</b><i>a </i>are drawn to have a common length L and a common width W&#x2014;i.e., dimensions of the on-pitch vias <b>340</b> in the diagram <b>300</b><i>a </i>are identical.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, various interactions between the on-pitch vias <b>340</b> and processing conditions (e.g., distances to the array region <b>330</b>, effects of slurry and cleaning solutions chemistry) may result in different physical and electrical characteristics of the on-pitch vias <b>340</b>. In some embodiments, heights of vias (e.g., the on-pitch via <b>340</b>) may vary based on their distance D from the boundary <b>325</b>, after the CMP process&#x2014;e.g., due to a variation in a local pressure. For example, a CMP process may be targeted (e.g., optimized) to generate the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b </i>with a desired height H&#x2014;e.g., the height of via minimizing the undulation that an access line may experience as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Then, the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>(the nearest via among the on-pitch vias <b>340</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) may have a first height (measured from the underlying CMOS circuitry) that is less than the height (H) of the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b</i>. Further, the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>c </i>(the farthest via among the on-pitch vias <b>340</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) may have a third height that is greater than the second height (H) of the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b</i>. As such, if the process conditions (e.g., the CMP process conditions including one or more slurries, grinding pads, pressure, rotation speeds, etc.) are targeted to generate the desired height (H) for the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b</i>, the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>may be recessed while the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>c </i>is protruded, with reference to the height (H) of the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b</i>, respectively. When a via is either protruded or recessed, the access lines connected thereto may experience undulation (either up or down), which may decrease an amount of current flowing through the recessed (or protruded) vias.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some cases, the interfacial characteristics of the on-pitch vias <b>340</b> may be affected due to their distances to the array region <b>330</b>. For example, the surface topography and/or interfacial characteristics of the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>(e.g., the nearest on-pitch via to the array region <b>330</b>) may be degraded when compared to those of the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>c </i>(e.g., the farthest on-pitch via to the array region <b>330</b>), which in turn, may result in an amount of current flowing through the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>to be less than that flowing through the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>c</i>. For example, a first current flowing through the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>may be less than a third current flowing through the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>c </i>by approximately 10%. In some cases, the surface of the on-pitch vias <b>340</b> may suffer chemical and/or mechanical attacks during CMP process degrading overall quality of the surface of the on-pitch vias <b>340</b>. Such variations (e.g., the height variation, the surface quality variations, or both) may be detrimental to maintain (or control) the electrical characteristics of the memory cell in the memory array <b>301</b>&#x2014;e.g., minimizing variations among the memory cells within the memory array <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a plan-view schematic diagram <b>300</b><i>b </i>including a 3D cross-point memory array <b>301</b><i>b </i>(&#x201c;memory array&#x201d;) in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.

For example, the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>has a length L<b>1</b> longitudinal to the word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>3</b>. The on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b </i>has a length L<b>2</b> longitudinal to the word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, which is less than L<b>1</b>. Further, the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>c </i>has a length L<b>3</b> longitudinal to the word line <b>105</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>, which is less than L<b>2</b>. Widths of all the on-pitch vias <b>340</b> may be maintained the same (e.g., same as or less than the pitch P of the word lines <b>105</b><i>b</i>). In this manner, the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>(e.g., the nearest on-pitch via to the array region <b>330</b>) has a greater surface area than other on-pitch vias (e.g., the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b</i>, the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>c</i>) when the CMP process exposes the surface of on-pitch vias <b>340</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As described above, the greater surface area may make the surface of the on-pitch vias <b>340</b> more robust against chemical and/or mechanical interactions (e.g., attacks) during the CMP process. In this manner, the variable surface areas of the on-pitch vias <b>340</b> based on the distances from the array boundary <b>325</b> may facilitate to reduce variations (or otherwise compensate) in the physical and/or electrical characteristics of the interface. For example, the height differences between the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>and the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b </i>(or the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>c</i>) may be reduced, at least partially due to the improved robustness of the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>stemming from the greater surface area (e.g., L<b>1</b> is greater than L<b>2</b> or L<b>3</b>). Additionally, or alternatively, the surface topography and/or interfacial characteristics the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>may be improved at least partially owing to the greater surface area. Further, the greater surface area of the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>is expected to reduce the interface resistance against the current flowing therethrough, which in turn, helps to reduce differences in amounts of current in other on-pitch vias (e.g., on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>c</i>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As such, when the CMP process is targeted to generate a desired height and surface and/or interface characteristics of the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>b</i>, deviations in the above described interface characteristics of the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>a </i>(and/or the on-pitch via <b>340</b><i>c</i>) may be reduced.

Thus, the memory array <b>301</b><i>b</i>, in comparison to the memory array <b>301</b><i>a</i>, may maintain a more uniform distribution of current (e.g., access current) throughout the memory array, which in turn, may reduce variations in various memory cell characteristics, such as programming and/or read current distributions, cycling behaviors, data retention characteristics, among others.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a plan-view schematic diagram <b>300</b><i>c </i>including a 3D cross-point memory array <b>301</b><i>c </i>(&#x201c;memory array&#x201d;) in accordance with embodiments of the present technology.

Further, individual access lines coupled with the on-pitch vias <b>340</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> alternate with individual access lines coupled with the on-pitch vias <b>340</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b>. In some cases, the increased distance between the on-pitch vias <b>340</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> and <b>340</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> may provide a wider process latitude (process window) for patterning the on-pitch vias <b>340</b>&#x2014;e.g., improving integrity of the shape of on-pitch vias <b>340</b>. Thus, the memory array <b>301</b><i>c</i>, in comparison to the memory array <b>301</b><i>b </i>(and/or the memory array <b>301</b><i>a</i>), may be less prone to various issues related to the shape of on-pitch vias <b>340</b>, such as closed vias, bridging between vias, or the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The memory device described in detail above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>3</b>C</figref> or packages incorporating such a memory device can be incorporated into any of a myriad of larger and/or more complex systems, a representative example of which is a system <b>480</b> shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.
