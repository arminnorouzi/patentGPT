hygiene protocol: This is a hygiene protocol based on the definition of goals that constitute a culture of hygiene. This culture establishes that hygiene improves the quality of life, that it is a more individual responsibility, and that the culture of hygiene is best communicated by the exemplary performance of hygiene practices. Before any hygienic procedure emphasizes the importance of patient cooperation; highlight the importance of privacy in carrying out hygiene activities; avoid contact with air currents.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0029" num="0058">Hygiene protocol of the Colombian Police: This is a protocol of hygiene that is developed from the detailed observation of the different areas of citizen life. It seems important to us to mention it, because, from the surveillance of the actions that constitute the daily life of the citizen, it manages to determine the opportune hygiene actions that must be carried out in this life. Aspects to highlight: Washing hands always before and after going to the bathroom, eating and using a medical service and means of transport, in addition to removing bacteria, indicates to other people that one is aware of the bacteria present in these means; Always wash the supplies with which an activity is carried out, before carrying out this activity.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0030" num="0059">WHO Handwashing Protocol: This hygiene protocol is important for two reasons. The first of these is that it shows that there are hygiene cultures that are universal and not just local. The second is that hygiene procedures are linear. Aspects to be highlighted: direct contact of a dirty surface with the skin, even for a short time, dirty the skin. Therefore, these contacts must be avoided at all costs. The supplies and instruments to carry out hygiene activities should always be disposable.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0031" num="0060">Protocol for waste management: This protocol is important to mention because it handles waste that requires very strict rules in order not to contaminate the environment. In this way, by being able to apply these procedures of very strict rules in the home medical service, hygiene in this service will be better controlled.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0032" num="0061">Aspects to highlight: three different waste treatment procedures: volume reduction, elimination of waste and change of its composition (change from one state of matter to another; for example, the change from liquid to gaseous state).</li>        <li id="ul0004-0033" num="0062">Health regulations:</li>        <li id="ul0004-0034" num="0063">Resolution 2003 of 2014: The modality of the medical service that is provided is under the modality at home/domiciliary or extramural.
