These sensor systems typically are constructed for being carried on-board with a vehicle and can include, but are not limited to, radar, lidar, thermal imaging, cameras, movement sensors and/or the like.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following presents a summary to provide a basic understanding of one or more embodiments described herein. This summary is not intended to identify key or critical elements, or to delineate any scope of the particular embodiments and/or any scope of the claims. The sole purpose of the summary is to present concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. In one or more embodiments described herein, devices, systems, methods and/or apparatuses are described that can facilitate movement and/or cleaning of a sensor lens of a sensor system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sensor systems constructed for being carried on-board with a vehicle can include sensitive electronics. One or more sensor lenses protecting the sensitive electronics can be obscured by environmental conditions, objects and/or substances coming off the road and/or from another vehicle, and/or other obscuring elements. This obscuring can occur numerous times during a single use of a sensor system. Yet, a sensor of the sensitive electronics can be most efficient when viewing and/or sensing through a clean, and non-obscured, sensor lens. Further, even when providing cleaning of a sensor lens, the offending obscuring element, substance and/or liquid can instead be unintendedly directed, moved and/or flushed towards another sensor system, vehicle window and/or vehicle occupant, such as where a window, roof opening, convertible roof and/or removable vehicle body portion can expose the vehicle occupant to an environment about the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To account for one or more of these issues, subject matter described herein includes one or more embodiments that can employ various techniques to efficiently clean a sensor lens in at least a partially contained manner Employing one or more such techniques, waste, such as run-off, debris and/or other substances from the cleaning of a sensor lens can be directed towards a base supporting the vehicle, and thus away from the sensor system and/or from one or more other sensor systems, vehicle viewing panels (e.g., windows) and/or vehicle occupants. This cleaning can be facilitated by a retractable sensor lens, which retractability further can aid in reducing and/or preventing obscuring of the sensor lens.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one embodiment, a sensor system for a vehicle body can comprise a sensor lens having a retractable portion that is moveable at least partially into and out of a chamber. The sensor system also can comprise a cleaning assembly configured to clean the retractable portion disposed within the chamber and at least partially separated from airflow exterior to the chamber.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another embodiment, a sensor system for a vehicle body can comprise a moveable sensor lens, a cover, and a cleaning assembly configured to clean the sensor lens at least partially concealed by the cover from an environment about the vehicle body.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to yet another embodiment, a method of operating a sensor system at a vehicle body can comprise cleaning, by the sensor system, a retractable portion of a sensor lens disposed within a chamber and at least partially separated from airflow exterior to the chamber.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one or more of the above-provided embodiments, a fluid management system can direct fluid expelled by the cleaning away from one or more viewing panels at the vehicle body.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one or more of the above-provided embodiments, a sensor housing retaining the sensor lens can have a cover that can form an exterior portion of the vehicle body when the sensor lens is retracted into the chamber.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one or more of the above-provided embodiments, a heat sink of the sensor system can be at least partially exposed to an environment external to the vehicle body by a partial deployment of the sensor lens from the chamber.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">These one or more embodiments can accordingly provide at least one or more self-protection, self-cleaning and/or self-cooling aspects and/or functions.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">By retracting at least partially into a chamber at the vehicle body, the sensor lens can be protected from one or more of environmental conditions, objects and/or substances coming off the road and/or from another vehicle. This can be the case such as when the sensor system is not being utilized or in view of one or more undesirable environmental and/or road conditions. Retractability of one or more aspects of the sensor system also can provide a desirable aesthetic, such as absent a sensor system or portion thereof interrupting a contour and/or other design feature of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Self-cleaning of at least the sensor lens can be provided by the cleaning assembly of the sensor system. The self-cleaning can enable the sensor system to be utilized for longer use periods and/or to have greater availability even in less than optimal and/or less than desirable environmental and/or road conditions. That is, the sensor system can enable temporary and/or intermittent cleaning of at least the sensor lens to allow for continued use of the sensor system during one or more user periods.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Providing cleaning of the sensor lens when at least partially concealed by the cover from an environment about the vehicle body, and/or when at least partially separated from airflow exterior to the chamber, can enable enhanced cleaning of the sensor lens. That is, where the cleaning assembly includes the use of a fluid, the at least partial, nearly full and/or full concealing, covering and/or positioning of the sensor lens relative to external airflow and/or environmental conditions can minimize and/or prevent fluid from the cleaning assembly and/or removed debris from instead moving to another undesired portion of the vehicle and/or vehicle body. For example, such fluid and/or debris can be minimized and/or prevented from instead being deposited on a viewing panel and/or actuating a rain sensor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term &#x201c;fluid&#x201d; can refer to water, air, cleaning liquid, another liquid, an aqueous and/or gaseous substance, and/or any combination thereof. As used herein, the term &#x201c;viewing panel&#x201d; can refer to a window, windshield and/or another clear, transparent and/or at least partially translucent panel of the vehicle, such as of the vehicle body.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally and/or alternatively, where the cleaning assembly includes the use of a fluid, the fluid management system can reduce and/or altogether prevent such fluid and/or debris removed from the sensor lens from being directed towards a viewing panel of the vehicle. Directing fluid and/or debris away from a viewing panel can aid in keeping a rain sensor at the viewing panel from being triggered merely by the cleaning assembly of the sensor system.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, in that the sensor system can produce heat during use and/or can be exposed to a hot environment, and/or to direct and/or indirect sunlight, it also is helpful that the retractability of the sensor system can be utilized to cool the sensor system. The sensor lens can be partially deployed to allow for air to pass into the chamber, such as over one or more heat sinks of the sensor system. In one or more embodiments, this partially retracted position of the sensor lens can produce a venturi effect that can draw air into the chamber.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">One or more exemplary embodiments are described below in the Detailed Description section with reference to the following drawings.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a front orthogonal view of a sensor system, for a vehicle body, that can facilitate movement and/or cleaning of a sensor lens of the sensor system.

The sensor lens <b>102</b>, <b>1102</b> can be partially deployed to allow for air to pass into the chamber <b>106</b>, <b>1106</b>, such as over one or more heat sinks <b>310</b>, <b>1310</b> of the sensor system <b>100</b>, <b>1100</b>. In one or more embodiments, this partially retracted position of the sensor lens <b>102</b>, <b>1102</b> can produce a venturi effect that can draw air into the chamber <b>106</b>, <b>1106</b> and about the one or more heat sinks <b>310</b>, <b>1310</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Additionally and/or alternatively, one or more of the aforementioned construction aspects of the sensor system <b>100</b>, <b>1100</b> can lend to improved (e.g., optimized and/or enhanced) serviceability of the sensor system <b>100</b>, <b>1100</b>. For example, the sensor module <b>200</b>, <b>1200</b> such as including the sensor <b>302</b>, <b>1302</b> and/or sensor lens <b>102</b>, <b>1102</b>, can be removed from the chamber <b>106</b>, <b>1106</b> for servicing, such as absent complete removal of the entire sensor system <b>100</b>, <b>1100</b>, such as including one or more of the chamber housing <b>110</b>, <b>1110</b>, cleaning assembly <b>104</b>, <b>1104</b> and/or fluid management system <b>600</b>, <b>1600</b>. This removability can facilitate servicing away from the vehicle and/or easy replacement and/or swapping out of a sensor module <b>200</b>, <b>1200</b> and/or sensor <b>302</b>, <b>1302</b>. In one or more embodiments described above, a cover <b>112</b>, <b>1112</b> of the sensor housing <b>202</b>, <b>1202</b> can be removed from the sensor module <b>200</b>, <b>1200</b>, with or without removal of the sensor module <b>200</b>, <b>1200</b>, to enable access to one or more aspects within the sensor housing <b>202</b>, <b>1202</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The removability of the sensor module <b>200</b>, <b>1200</b> and/or construction of the sensor system <b>100</b>, <b>1100</b> further can enable modularity of the sensor system <b>100</b>, <b>1100</b> relative to different vehicles of the same and/or different models and/or types. That is, a same sensor module <b>200</b>, <b>1200</b> and/or chamber housing <b>110</b>, <b>1110</b> can be employed at a different vehicle (e.g., plane, boat and/or drone), different vehicle type (e.g., SUV, hatchback, coupe, sedan and/or convertible) and/or different vehicle model. Indeed a minor configuration to the chamber housing <b>110</b>, <b>1110</b> and/or swapping out of the cover <b>112</b>, <b>1112</b> can enable employment of the sensor system <b>100</b>, <b>1100</b> and/or the sensor module <b>200</b>, <b>1200</b> at any number of vehicles and/or even at different vehicle surfaces and/or locations on a vehicle. As indicated above, the locational use of the sensor system <b>100</b>, <b>1100</b> is not limited to a roof or upper portion of a vehicle. Indeed, the sensor system <b>100</b>, <b>1100</b> can be configured for use at a vehicle side surface, and thus extending out from the side surface, and/or for use at a vehicle bottom surface, and thus extending downwardly from the bottom surface.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The one or more flowcharts and/or block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of one or more possible implementations of one or more systems, apparatuses and/or methods according to various embodiments described herein.
