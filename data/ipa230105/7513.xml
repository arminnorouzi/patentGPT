In the present disclosure, the number of times of EN-DC X2 message exchange procedure success may indicate the number of times each base station successfully completes the EN-DC X2 message exchange procedure with a neighboring base station for a specific period.

In other words, each flag may be independently set to ON or OFF, and an operation of determining the low traffic cell may be performed according thereto.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0151">Referring then to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, description is made to operation S<b>1020</b> of determining the low traffic cell.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0152">When the Connection Test Flag is turned ON, the EMS may determine whether the base station corresponds to the low traffic cell, based on the daily average number of times of the RRC connection establishment success, the daily average number of times of EN-DC X2 message exchange procedure success, and the daily average number of times of Xn message exchange procedure success, in operation S<b>1110</b>. For example, when the value determined according to the sum of the number of times of RRC connection establishment success, the number of times of EN-DC Mobility success, and the number of times of Xn Handover success, or a combination thereof corresponds to a predetermined threshold value (Threshold_L4) or less, the EMS may proceed to operation S<b>1150</b> to determine the corresponding base station as a low traffic cell.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0153">When the Transmission Test Flag is turned ON, the EMS may determine whether the base station corresponds to the low traffic cell based on the daily average size of downlink data transmission in operation S<b>1120</b>.

Therefore, detecting whether transmission/reception of the base station is abnormal for the low traffic cell may have low accuracy, leading to a problem that the amount of operation for detecting the abnormal base station may be unnecessarily increased.
