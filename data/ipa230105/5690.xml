The contact case may expand and deform when the internal pressure inside the contact case rises. Accordingly, in Japanese Patent No. 5163318, the contact case is made of ceramic to ensure the strength of the contact case.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, in order to reduce the manufacturing cost of the contact case, the contact case can be made of resin. However, in the contact case made of resin, it is difficult to secure a strength of the contact case, and when the internal pressure in the contact case rises, the contact case may expand and deform.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is, in an electromagnetic relay including a contact case made of resin, to improve a strength of the contact case.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An electromagnetic relay according to an aspect of the present invention includes a fixed terminal, a movable contact piece, a drive device, a contact case, at least one magnet, and at least one yoke. The fixed terminal includes a fixed contact. The movable contact piece includes a movable contact disposed to face the fixed contact. The drive device moves the movable contact piece in a direction in which the movable contact comes into contact with the fixed contact and in a direction in which the movable contact is separated from the fixed contact. The contact case is made of resin. The contact houses the fixed contact and the movable contact piece. The at least one magnet is disposed around the contact case for generating a magnetic field inside the contact case. The at least one yoke is fixed to the contact case.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the electromagnetic relay, the strength of the contact case can be improved by the at least one yoke fixed to the contact case. As a result, when the internal pressure inside the contact case rises, deformation due to expansion of the contact case can be limited.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The at least one yoke may be disposed at least partially in contact with an outer surface of the contact case. In this case, deformation due to the expansion of the contact case can be effectively limited by the at least one yoke.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The at least one yoke may be fixedly press-fitted to the contact case. In this case, the at least one yoke can be rigidly fixed to the contact case.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The at least one yoke may include at least one press-fitting protrusion that protrude in a moving direction of the movable contact piece. The contact case may include at least one press-fitting hole to which the at least one press-fitting protrusion is press-fitted. The at least one press-fitting hole may be provided corresponding to the at least one press-fitting protrusion. In this case, the at least one yoke can be fixed to the contact case with a simple configuration.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The at least one yoke may be disposed so as to surround the contact case. In this case, deformation due to expansion of the contact case can be limited over a wide range of the contact case.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The at least one yoke may each include a middle portion extending in one of a longitudinal direction or a lateral direction of the movable contact piece, and a pair of side portions extending from both ends of the middle portion in the other of the longitudinal direction or the lateral direction of the movable contact piece. The at least one press-fitting protrusion may be provided on at least each of the pair of side portions among the middle portion and the pair of side portions. In this case, the at least one yoke can be rigidly fixed to the contact case at the at least one yoke having the pair of side portions.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The at least one yoke may be made by insert-molding into the contact case. In this case also, the strength of the contact case can be improved by the at least one yoke, and deformation due to expansion of the contact case can be limited.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The fixed terminal may be columnar and extend in the moving direction of the movable contact piece. In this case, in the electromagnetic relay including the columnar fixed terminal, deformation due to expansion of the contact case can be limited.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic relay.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of the fixed terminal, the at least one magnet, and the contact case.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top view of the fixed terminal, the at least one magnet, the at least one yoke, and the contact case.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of the at least one yoke.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram showing a modified example of the arrangement of at least one magnet.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram showing a modified example of the at least one yoke.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram showing a modified example of the at least one yoke.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram showing a modified example of the contact case.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram showing a modified example of the contact case.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Hereinafter, an embodiment of an electromagnetic relay according to one aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic relay <b>100</b>.
