Specifically, heat resistant polymers are used as a print circuit board material or a cover film material to obtain a foldable or curved display, or used as a photosensitive material in an exposure and development process. In addition, with the trend of weight lightening and thinning, heat resistant polymers are also used as a substrate material replacing an inorganic glass substrate material.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, currently-known heat resistant polymers have limitations in obtaining all of heat resistance, flexibility, transparency, photosensitivity, durability and the like to required levels, and thereby have a problem in that each material has limitations in the field of use. For example, polyether sulfone (PES) as a heat resistant polymer, has excellent mechanical properties and is used as a cover film material, but it is difficult to apply as a print circuit board (cover film) material due to its poor heat resistance and flexibility that a print circuit board material needs to have. In addition, polyimide (PI) as a heat resistant polymer, is used as a print circuit board material due to excellent heat resistance and flexibility, but it is difficult to apply as a material in an optical field due to poor transparency caused by a complete aromatic structure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, polymers having excellent properties in all of flexibility, transparency, photosensitivity, durability and the like as well as heat resistance have been required.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is directed to providing polysiloxane copolymers that could be widely used as materials in an optical field or/and an electronic field by having excellent heat resistance, flexibility, transparency, photosensitivity, durability and the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, the present invention is directed to providing a method for preparing the polysiloxane copolymers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, the present invention is directed to providing a resin compositions including the polysiloxane copolymer.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present invention in view of the above, there is provided a polysiloxane copolymer including a siloxane-based polymer-derived structural unit and a silane-based monomer-derived structural unit, wherein the silane-based monomer is selected from the group consisting of compounds represented by the following Chemical Formula 1 to Chemical Formula 3.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="85.43mm" wi="75.52mm" file="US20230002562A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">In Chemical Formula 1 and Chemical Formula 2,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">X<sup>1 </sup>to X<sup>3 </sup>are each independently selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an alicyclic hydrocarbon group having 4 to 20 carbon atoms and an aromatic hydrocarbon group having 4 to 20 carbon atoms, R<sup>1 </sup>is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, R<sup>2 </sup>and R<sup>3 </sup>are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, L<sup>1 </sup>is selected from the group consisting of an oxygen atom and an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and a<sub>1 </sub>is an integer of 0 to 20,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">in Chemical Formula 3,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">R<sup>4 </sup>to R<sup>6 </sup>are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and an aromatic hydrocarbon group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, R<sup>7 </sup>is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, R<sup>8 </sup>is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a hydroxyl group and an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, L<sup>2 </sup>is selected from the group consisting of a single bond, an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an alicyclic hydrocarbon group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms and an aromatic hydrocarbon group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and a<sub>2 </sub>is an integer of 0 to 20, and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>8</sup>, X<sup>1 </sup>to X<sup>3</sup>, L<sup>1 </sup>and L<sup>2 </sup>are each independently unsubstituted or substituted with one or more types of substituents selected from the group consisting of an oxygen atom, a fluorine atom, an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and an aromatic hydrocarbon group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preparing a polysiloxane copolymer, the method including preparing a first silane compound;
