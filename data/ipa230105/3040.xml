For example, it may be desirable to reconfigure a building structure so as to place the structure in a condition in which it is more suitable for operation as a public performance space capable of comfortably accommodating patrons who attend live events, recorded media presentations, or combinations thereof. Sometimes the reconfiguration of the structure may entail relatively extensive, and perhaps relatively costly, modifications to the structure to ensure that the re-configured structure meets an aesthetics standard and meets audience satisfaction standards such as, for example, satisfactory sight lines for each patron to view a performance and suitable fixtures providing adequate comfort at the viewing locations (i.e., seats or other customary audience gallery accommodations).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would be desirable to provide apparatus and previously configured modules that facilitate the reconfiguration of building structures for use as public performance spaces and to provide methods of manufacturing such previously configured modules and methods for transporting and erecting such previously configured modules at the locations of the public performance spaces. Additionally, it would be desirable to provide apparatus and previously configured modules that facilitate the original construction of building structures operable as public performance spaces and to provide methods of manufacturing such previously configured modules and methods for transporting and erecting such previously configured modules at the locations of the public performance spaces.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An embodiment according to the present disclosure is directed to a method for assembling a modular auditorium.

manufacturing a modular auditorium in its entirety in the form of a previously configured module, a type of which is herein denominated as a prefabricated module, or a modular auditorium comprised at least in part of a prefabricated module. As used herein, the term &#x201c;modular auditorium&#x201d; is intended to refer to a particular configuration of an audience host combination that is specifically configured to be deployable as an element of a theater having a performance space. The following description provided in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>2</b>A, <b>3</b>-<b>7</b>, <b>7</b>A, <b>8</b>-<b>11</b>, <b>11</b>A, <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>A, <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>A, <b>14</b>-<b>18</b>, <b>18</b>A, <b>19</b>-<b>26</b>, <b>26</b>A, <b>27</b>-<b>30</b></figref>, <b>30</b>A, <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>32</b>A, <b>33</b>-<b>35</b>, <b>35</b>A, <b>36</b>-<b>45</b> is directed to a modular auditorium.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is an upper perspective view of an exemplary modular auditorium, a modular auditorium hereinafter designated as the modular auditorium MOD-AD may be configured to facilitate the reconfiguration of building structures for use as public performance spaces or may be configured to facilitate the original construction of building structures operable as public performance spaces. The modular auditorium MOD-AD is constructed such that only the surface for supporting the weight of the modular auditorium MOD-AD (i.e., a prepared ground surface or a man-made surface supported above a ground surface) is required. In other words, the modular auditorium MOD-AD is self-supporting and does not require lateral support from another building structure. As a result, the modular auditorium MOD-AD can be assembled inside of a building structure, such as an existing enclosed building structure (i.e., having a roof) for protecting the modular auditorium MOD-AD from the weather. The modular auditorium MOD-AD includes one or more arbitrarily designated nominal inventory portions having one or more tier sections supported by a base portion. Each nominal inventory portion includes a tier floor having corresponding floor portions that are cantilevered from a longitudinal beam or torque tube. The floor portions are made up of modules composed of ribs interconnected to panels. The panels include openings configured to permit at least one of the following: to receive illumination sources, to provide ventilation therethrough and to receive a sound generating device. Each nominal inventory portion also includes seats and handrails. A back wall is constructed with passageways for providing electrical wiring, conveying ventilation air, as well as providing egress/ingress for spectators to each tier of the nominal inventory portions. Each nominal inventory portion is configured to be transportable and positioned for assembly with other nominal inventory portions, such as by a forklift machine. As a result, assembly of the modular auditorium MOD-AD is greatly simplified and can be achieved quickly.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For purposes herein, the term &#x201c;prefabricated&#x201d; is intended to mean that a nominal inventory portion as disclosed in further detail below is comprised of base portions and tier sections, each of which is structurally complete to a significant extent and, consequently, merely requiring the interconnection of the base portions and tier sections, such as by mechanical fasteners or welding, to essentially complete the structural assembly of the nominal inventory portion at the permanent site. It is to be understood that the installation or interconnection of components for ventilation or illumination purposes, the installation or interconnection of any electrical wiring or related components or ornamental features, and the installation of seating for each tier section can occur subsequent to the interconnection of the base portions and tier sections, and that these type of components are typically not considered as providing additional structural support. For purposes herein, the term &#x201c;projecting&#x201d; is intended to mean an orientation of one piece or component to another piece or component and includes both the situation in which one piece or component projects relative to, and is completely supported by, the other piece or component and the situation in which neither the one piece or component or the other piece or component completely support the other respective piece or component.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the nominal inventory portion <b>10</b> having a base portion <b>12</b> and three tier sections <b>36</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>290</b>.
