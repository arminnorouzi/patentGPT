the exemplary embodiments described are only some, but not all, embodiments of the present application.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The term &#x201c;remote controller&#x201d; refers to a component of an electronic device (for example, a display apparatus disclosed in the present application), can wirelessly control the electronic device generally within a short distance range, is generally connected with the electronic device using infrared and/or radio frequency (RF) signals and/or Bluetooth, and may include function modules such as WiFi, wireless USB, Bluetooth and a motion sensor. For example, a handheld touch remote controller uses a user interface on a touch screen to replace most of physical built-in keys in a general remote control device.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram illustrating a display apparatus with a speaker. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the display apparatus, for example, the television <b>100</b> includes: a display <b>12</b> and a plurality of speakers <b>13</b>. The plurality of speakers are arranged behind the display <b>12</b> inside the television <b>100</b> in a manner that allows the television have Dolby Atmos 2.1.2 or 3.0.2 two-channel height sound effects, for example, a speaker <b>131</b> provides a sound signal of a left channel, a speaker <b>132</b> provides a sound signal of a right channel, a speaker <b>133</b> provides a sound signal of a center channel, a speaker <b>134</b> provides a sound signal of a left height channel, and a speaker <b>135</b> provides a sound signal of a right height channel Applicant's another Chinese application 201910522902.4 filed on Jun. 17, 2019 describes embodiments of the television with SoD panel technology.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">With the development of user's demands for display apparatuses on the market, critical components, such as a display and a base frame, in more and more display apparatuses can be implemented with less thicknesses, and the display apparatus further needs to provide a High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) sound signal, and to provide four-channel surround, 5.1-channel, 5.1.2-channel, 7.1.2-channel and other Hi-Fi sound signals through more speakers, which requires placement of more speakers within a limited space inside, for example, the television as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and sometimes having to sacrifice the sound effect or increase the thickness of the display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Therefore, a display apparatus in the related art is configured with a &#x201c;SoD panel&#x201d; in order to provide both lightness and sound effect. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram illustrating a display apparatus with electromagnetic exciters, a plurality of electromagnetic exciters that are arranged on a rear side of a display in the display apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> can respectively excite the entire display to emit sound. For example, an electromagnetic exciter <b>141</b> provides a sound signal of a left channel, an electromagnetic exciter <b>142</b> provides a sound signal of a right channel, and an electromagnetic exciter <b>143</b> provides a sound signal of a center channel Since each electromagnetic exciter directly excites the entire display to emit sound, and the overall all directional propagation properties of the display are the same, a sound emitting region of each electromagnetic exciter cannot be subdivided, and the display apparatus can only be configured with three or fewer exciting sound emitting regions generally. For each electromagnetic exciter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a section view of a display apparatus, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded view of a display apparatus. The display of the display apparatus includes: a display structure <b>31</b> and a sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>. The display structure <b>31</b> may be configured to receive and display video or image in a form of optical signals. The sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> emits sound by bending waves emitted via modal resonance under the action of electromagnetic exciters <b>33</b>. In some embodiment, the sound-emitting substrate is also referred to as sound-emitting backplane. That is, the display structure <b>31</b> in the display apparatus can be configured to not only perform display but also emit sound to replace of conventional speakers. Therefore, there is no need to provide mounting locations for the speakers in the display apparatus, and the speakers can be replaced by a corresponding number of electromagnetic exciters <b>33</b>, thereby allowing the display apparatus to provide stronger sound effects while achieving a lighter and thinner design.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">However, in the display apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, due to the overall arrangement of the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>, regardless of how many electromagnetic exciters <b>33</b> are arranged at various locations of the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> in the display apparatus, the electromagnetic exciters <b>33</b> act on the same sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>, such that the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> emits sound by bending waves emitted via modal resonance. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an amplitude distribution of bending waves generated by the display apparatus under the action of an electromagnetic exciter during propagation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of the amplitude of bending waves propagating in the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>, wherein the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> emits bending waves under the action of the electromagnetic exciters <b>33</b>, and the bending waves generated on the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> spread all around centered at a place where the electromagnetic exciters <b>33</b> and the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> are attached, and cover the entire sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>. In the figure, the darker the color on the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> is, the greater the amplitude of the bending wave at that location above a viewing direction is; and the lighter the color on the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> is, the greater the amplitude of the bending wave at that location below the viewing direction is. Meanwhile, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the frequency of a bending wave A is 200 Hz, the frequency of a bending wave B is 1000 Hz, and the frequency of a bending wave C is 10000 Hz.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, regardless of the change in frequency of the bending wave, the amplitude of the bending wave in each direction has a little attenuation while the bending wave is spreading in the sound emitting substrate, the amplitude of the bending wave is substantially the same as the amplitude in the vicinity of the electromagnetic exciter <b>33</b> even at the rightmost location away from the electromagnetic exciter <b>33</b>. That is, the bending wave generated by the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> under the action of the electromagnetic exciter <b>33</b> is relatively uniform in amplitude distribution at all locations when propagating in the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>, resulting in the emission of sound with relatively similar intensity by the sound emitting substrate as a whole. Therefore, when hearing sound emitted by the display apparatus, a user has the intuitive feeling that all locations of the entire panel are emitting similar sound; even though the display apparatus is configured with 5, 7 or more electromagnetic exciters that respectively excite the sound emitting substrate to vibrate, the user cannot clearly distinguish the channel corresponding to which electromagnetic exciter that produces the vibration of the current sound emitting substrate, which in turn results in poor channel distinction when the display apparatus emits sound, affecting the user experience.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Therefore, the embodiments of the present application provide a display apparatus and a SoD panel. The display apparatus is divided into a plurality of regions by isolation zones, at least some of the plurality of regions are attached to electromagnetic exciters, bending waves generated by the electromagnetic exciters in the at least some of the regions are propagated only in a sound emitting substrate in the regions, and different regions of the sound emitting substrate of the display apparatus can be allowed to emit sound separately under the excitation action of electromagnetic exciters in the regions, so that the distinction of channels is improved when the sound emitting substrate emits sound under the action of the electromagnetic exciters corresponding to different channels, the user distinguishes corresponding channels emitted by different electromagnetic exciters, and further, more electromagnetic exciters can be arranged for the display apparatus to transmit sound signals of more channels, thereby improving the user experience of the display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a display apparatus according to an embodiment of the present application. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the display apparatus includes a display structure <b>31</b>, a sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>, and a plurality of electromagnetic exciters <b>33</b>. The display structure <b>31</b> is attached to one side of the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>, and the plurality of electromagnetic exciters <b>33</b> are attached to the other side of the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>. In an example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, two electromagnetic exciters <b>33</b> are provided for illustration, where an electromagnetic exciter <b>332</b> corresponds to a sound signal of a left channel of the display apparatus, and an electromagnetic exciter <b>331</b> corresponds to a sound signal of a right channel of the display apparatus. A surface area of the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> is equal to or less than a surface area of the display structure <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, the display structure <b>31</b> of the display apparatus is configured to implement a display function of the display apparatus, and configured to receive and display optical signals. The display structure <b>31</b> in the embodiments includes a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), an Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED), a laser projection screen or a screen with touch control function, wherein the laser projection screen specifically includes a film having an optical microstructure such as Fresnel, grid, or microlens array. In some embodiments, a rectangle display structure is taken as an example for illustration, for example, the display structure may also be an arc-shaped structure.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, the sound emitting function of the display apparatus may be jointly implemented by any one of the electromagnetic exciters <b>33</b> in the display apparatus, the display structure <b>31</b> and sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>. Taking an electromagnetic exciter <b>331</b> as an example, the electromagnetic exciter <b>331</b> is configured to receive an electrical signal corresponding to sound for play, convert the electrical signal into mechanical vibration, and apply the mechanical vibration to the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>. The sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> generates a bending wave through modal resonance under the action of the mechanical vibration of the electromagnetic exciter <b>331</b>, and the bending wave generated on the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> spreads in a 360-degree-direction range centered at a place where the electromagnetic exciter <b>331</b> and the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> are attached. The sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> and the display structure <b>31</b> attached with the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>, under the action of the bending wave propagating in the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>, vibrate back and forth in an up-down direction in the section view as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to emit sound. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic exciters described in the various embodiments of the present application can also include, but are not limited to, one or more electromagnetic exciters, piezoelectric exciters, magnetostrictive exciters, and any type and structure of exciters used in the future to excite bending waves.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> is further divided into different regions by isolation zones, at least some regions in the plurality of regions are attached to electromagnetic exciters, bending waves generated by the electromagnetic exciters are propagated only inside the regions attached with the electromagnetic exciters, whereas, bending waves propagating through the isolation zones to other regions are attenuated by the isolation zones. That is, the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> of the embodiment can achieve the performance of regional sound emitting, thereby reducing the interaction between the regions during simultaneous sound emitting. It can be understood that in some embodiments, the quantity of the regions divided on the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> may be greater than or equal to the quantity of at least one electromagnetic exciter, for example, the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> is divided into 10 regions, wherein 5 regions are respectively attached to 5 electromagnetic exciters.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram illustrating a sound emitting substrate according to an embodiment of the present application. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> according to the embodiments specifically includes: a first skin <b>321</b>, a first coating layer <b>322</b>, an intermediate layer <b>323</b>, a second coating layer <b>324</b>, and a second skin <b>325</b>. The first skin <b>321</b> and the second skin <b>325</b> are configured to house and fix the intermediate layer <b>323</b>, and surface areas of the first skin <b>321</b>, the intermediate layer <b>323</b> and the second skin <b>325</b> are substantially the same. The first coating layer <b>322</b> is attached between the first skin <b>321</b> and the intermediate layer <b>323</b> and is configured to adhere the first skin <b>321</b> and the intermediate layer <b>323</b>; the second coating layer <b>324</b> is attached between the second skin <b>325</b> and the intermediate layer <b>323</b>, and is configured to adhere the second skin <b>325</b> and the intermediate layer <b>323</b>. The first coating layer <b>322</b> and the second coating layer <b>324</b> may be selected according to the property of the intermediate layer <b>323</b>, for example, when the intermediate layer <b>323</b> is made from a foamed plastic core material, due to multiple holes in material of the intermediate layer <b>323</b>, the first skin <b>321</b> and the second skin <b>325</b> may be adhered by the first coating layer <b>322</b> and the second coating layer <b>324</b>; and if the intermediate layer <b>323</b> is made from a relatively flat material without holes, the first skin <b>321</b> and the second skin <b>325</b> may be directly affixed to two surfaces of the intermediate layer <b>323</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an exploded view illustrating a display apparatus according to an embodiment of the present application, wherein the display apparatus employs the sound emitting substrate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, and the sound emitting substrate may be attached to the display structure <b>31</b> by one surface of the first skin <b>321</b> and attached to a plurality of electromagnetic exciters by one surface of the second skin <b>325</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the sound emitting substrate according to the embodiments of the present application is further divided into a plurality of regions by isolation zones, and each region is individually attached to at least one electromagnetic exciter. For example, in an example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> that the display apparatus plays via a left channel and a right channel, the electromagnetic exciter <b>332</b> arranged in the display apparatus is configured to emit a sound signal of a left channel, the electromagnetic exciter <b>331</b> is configured to emit a sound signal of a right channel, and in this case, the two electromagnetic exciters are both attached to the same side of the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>. To distinguish the sound signal emit from the left channel and the sound signal emit from the right channel, the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> may divide the intermediate layer <b>323</b> into a left region and a right region by an isolation zone <b>34</b>, wherein the left region corresponds to the electromagnetic exciter <b>332</b>, and the right region corresponds to the electromagnetic exciter <b>331</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the isolation zone described in the embodiments of the present application includes a plurality of grooves <b>341</b> formed in two side surfaces of the intermediate layer <b>323</b> of the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>, wherein the two side surfaces are specifically configured with at least one groove <b>341</b> separately, for example, in the example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the isolation zone <b>34</b> includes three grooves <b>341</b> in an upper side of the intermediate layer <b>323</b> and three grooves <b>341</b> in a lower side of the intermediate layer <b>323</b>, none of these grooves <b>341</b> passes through the intermediate layer <b>323</b>, a depth of each groove <b>341</b> may be greater than or equal to half of a thickness of the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b>, and in some embodiments, the depth of each groove <b>341</b> is 80% of the thickness of the sound emitting substrate. Meanwhile, it can be seen from the exploded view as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> that the grooves <b>341</b> formed in the two side surfaces of the intermediate layer <b>323</b> of the sound emitting substrate are also mutually staggered and are parallel, a depth direction of each groove <b>341</b> is perpendicular to the surface of the intermediate layer <b>323</b>, and an extension direction of each groove <b>341</b> is the same as an extension direction of the isolation zone. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram illustrating the intermediate layer according to an embodiment of the present application, wherein the cross-sectional structure of the isolation zone <b>34</b> in the intermediate layer for isolating different regions is shown, it can be seen that the staggered grooves <b>341</b>, formed in the two side surfaces of the intermediate layer, of the isolation zone <b>34</b> divide the intermediate layer into left and right portions in the figure, the structure of the intermediate layer itself is not disconnected, and can the play the role of integral support.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Accordingly, in the display apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, since the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> has the isolation zone <b>34</b> in the intermediate layer <b>323</b>, such that the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> is divided into the left and right portions.

It can be seen that when the electromagnetic exciter <b>332</b> imposes an upward force to the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> in a process that the electromagnetic exciter <b>332</b> drives the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> to vibrate by mechanical vibration, a region, which is located on a left side of the isolation zone <b>34</b>, of the sound emitting substrate <b>32</b> deforms upwards under the force. At the same time, due to the presence of the isolation zone <b>34</b>, the isolation zone <b>34</b> is lower in rigidity, and has a strength anisotropic mechanical conduction property, which shows that the strength in a direction perpendicular to the extension direction of each groove is less than the strength in a parallel direction of each groove, such that the isolation zone <b>34</b> as a whole may play the role of damping and attenuating the propagation of vibrations on two sides, even if the region on the left side of the isolation zone <b>34</b> deforms upwards, the isolation zone <b>34</b> also does not propagate the upward deformation to a region on a right side, the region on the right remains in a state of no deformation or a state of extremely slight deformation in this case, so as to form a gradient difference of a corresponding excitation distribution of the bending waves between the regions on the left and right sides, such that it is easier for a user to distinguish sounds emit by the regions on the left and right sides.

Since the resilient bumper is spaced between the magnets and the first end cap <b>413</b><i>d</i>, in order to avoid disconnection of a magnetic circuit, a second magnetic yoke <b>47</b><i>d </i>may be further arranged between the contact plate and the coils, or between the resilient bumper and the coils. In order to drive the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d </i>to vibrate, after the magnet and the magnetostrictive element <b>44</b><i>d </i>are stacked on the second end cap <b>414</b><i>d</i>, the other side of the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d </i>can extend out of the coils and abut against the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d</i>. That is, the magnet, the magnetostrictive element <b>44</b><i>d </i>and the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d </i>are stacked on the second end cap <b>414</b><i>d </i>and are compressed between the panel and the second end cap <b>414</b><i>d </i>to avoid separation of any adjacent two of the magnet, the magnetostrictive element <b>44</b><i>d </i>and the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d </i>in the process that the panel is driven to vibrate by the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">As for the arrangement mode where the magnets surround the outside of the coils in the related art, the exciters in the present embodiment are arranged inside the coils, and the magnets and the magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d </i>are arranged in parallel along the axial direction of the coils, reducing the sizes of the exciters along a radial direction of the coil, and the thickness of the display apparatus is reduced accordingly.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some embodiments, the coils include a first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and a second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>arranged coaxially. The first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>may be connected in series or in parallel by an electrical connection line, and the connected first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>are connected with the external power supply, the amplifier, and other components. The first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>may also be respectively connected with the external power supply, the amplifier, and other components through electrical connection lines. The first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>which are coaxially arranged may increase the strength of the alternating magnetic field, such that the magnetic flux at the location of the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d </i>is increased, the amount of expansion of the magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d </i>is increased, which contributes to driving the panel to vibrate to emit sound; and the intensity of sound emit by the panel is higher, that is, the sound emitting effect of the display apparatus is optimized without increasing the sizes of the exciters. It can be understood that the coils are formed by winding copper wires, parameters such as the number of turns of the coils, and the diameters of the copper wires are different, and the coils have different inductance magnitudes, and the inductance tends to cause lost to the coils, resulting in low efficiency of the coils.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments, a winding direction of the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and a winding direction of the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>are opposite, and the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>are connected with each other in series through an electrical connection line <b>423</b><i>d</i>. In this way, the inductance of the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the inductance of the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>may partially counteract each other, when the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>have the same structure, the inductance of the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the inductance of the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>can be approximately counteracted, and the coils serve as a purely resistive load, which effectively boosts the high frequency response of the exciters, thereby extending the frequency bandwidth of the exciters.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In some embodiments, the magnets include a first magnet <b>431</b><i>d </i>arranged inside the first coil <b>421</b><i>d</i>, and a second magnet <b>432</b><i>d </i>arranged inside the second coil <b>422</b><i>d</i>, and polarities of ends, facing the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d</i>, of the first magnet <b>431</b><i>d </i>and the second magnet <b>432</b><i>d </i>are opposite. When the winding directions of the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>are opposite, the alternating magnetic fields generated by the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>are opposite in direction when the external control signal is introduced. Correspondingly, arrangement directions of the first magnet <b>431</b><i>d </i>and second magnet <b>432</b><i>d </i>corresponding to the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>are also opposite so that the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the first magnet <b>431</b><i>d</i>, as well as the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>and the second magnet <b>432</b><i>d </i>can respectively form two independent superimposed magnetic fields.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments, there are a plurality of first magnets <b>431</b><i>d</i>, the plurality of first magnets <b>431</b><i>d </i>are arranged at intervals along the axial direction of the first coil <b>421</b><i>d</i>, the polarities of the ends, facing the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d</i>, of the plurality of first magnets <b>431</b><i>d </i>are the same, and a magnetostrictive element <b>44</b><i>d </i>is arranged between two adjacent first magnets <b>431</b><i>d</i>. There is a plurality of second magnets <b>432</b><i>d</i>, the plurality of second magnets <b>432</b><i>d </i>are arranged at intervals along the axial direction of the second coil <b>422</b><i>d</i>, the polarities of the ends, facing the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d</i>, of the plurality of second magnets <b>432</b><i>d </i>are the same, and a magnetostrictive element <b>44</b><i>d </i>is arranged between two adjacent second magnets <b>432</b><i>d</i>. Since the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>in the exciter are arranged coaxially, the length of the exciter is greater than the radial size of the exciter, that is, the exciter is in an elongated rod-like structure, to avoid less magnetic flux at each of the locations of the magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d</i>. In the embodiment, the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>is configured with a plurality of first magnets <b>431</b><i>d </i>correspondingly, and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>is configured with a plurality of second magnets <b>432</b><i>d </i>correspondingly, and one magnetostrictive element <b>44</b><i>d </i>is arranged between the two adjacent first magnets <b>431</b><i>d</i>, and one magnetostrictive element <b>44</b><i>d </i>is arranged between the two adjacent second magnets <b>432</b><i>d</i>, so that the magnetic flux at each of the locations of the magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d </i>is greater, which can generate a greater force to drive the panel to vibrate.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some embodiments, a first magnetic yoke <b>46</b><i>d </i>is arranged between the adjacent first magnet <b>431</b><i>d </i>and second magnet <b>432</b><i>d</i>, and is connected with the housing <b>41</b><i>d </i>to form a closed magnetic circuit through which the magnetic lines generated by the coils can pass to avoid magnetic leakage. Opposite ends of the first magnet <b>431</b><i>d </i>and the second magnet <b>432</b><i>d </i>have the same polarity, the first magnetic yoke <b>46</b><i>d </i>arranged between the first magnet <b>431</b><i>d </i>and the second magnet <b>432</b><i>d </i>may allow the magnetic lines of the magnetic fields generated by the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>on the two sides as well as the first magnet <b>431</b><i>d </i>and the second magnet <b>432</b><i>d </i>to pass. Since the magnets may move with the magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d</i>, the first magnetic yoke <b>46</b><i>d </i>may include a movable part <b>462</b><i>d </i>and a fixed part <b>461</b><i>d</i>, wherein the movable part <b>462</b><i>d </i>is arranged between the first magnet <b>431</b><i>d </i>and the second magnet <b>432</b><i>d </i>and can follow the magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d </i>to move, and the fixed part <b>461</b><i>d </i>is arranged between the first coil <b>421</b><i>d </i>and the second coil <b>422</b><i>d </i>and can be fixedly connected with the housing <b>41</b><i>d</i>, for example, can be fixed by threaded fasteners. With a gap between the movable part <b>462</b><i>d </i>and the fixed part <b>461</b><i>d</i>, relative movement between the movable part <b>462</b><i>d </i>and the fixed part <b>461</b><i>d </i>are made more convenient and excessive amount of magnetic leakage can be prevented as well.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some embodiments, the magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d </i>are relatively fixed with the magnets. The relatively fixed magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d </i>and magnets move relative to the coils as a whole, with the ends abutting against the vibration element <b>45</b><i>d </i>and the other ends abutting against the second end cap <b>414</b><i>d</i>. The magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d </i>may be connected with the magnets by in a manner of clamping, screwing, etc., or may be adhesively fixed to the magnets by adhesion elements. The magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d </i>are fixed relative to the magnets such that a plurality of independent components arranged along the axial direction of the coil can be fixed as a whole and move telescopically with the magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d </i>to avoid separation and gaps between the adjacent magnetostrictive elements <b>44</b><i>d </i>and magnets when the exciters vibrate, which may cause impact noise and the like.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments, the housing <b>41</b><i>d </i>is also filled with a heat-conducting medium that can transfer heat generated by the coils to the housing <b>41</b><i>d</i>.
