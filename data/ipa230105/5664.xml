The wound metalized film or the metalized films stacked are formed by vapor deposition of metal films on a surface of a dielectric film of, for example, a polypropylene resin.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A film capacitor that has short-circuited in a defective insulating portion of its dielectric film can self-recover the insulation in the defective insulating portion by causing a metal film portion around the defective insulating portion to diffuse using energy resulting from the short-circuiting. Such film capacitors are thus less likely to undergo dielectric breakdown and have increasingly been used in, for example, motors for driving hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) or electric vehicles (EVs) and inverter systems for solar cell devices.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For a film capacitor manufactured using a metalized film, the withstand voltage and the element processability of the film capacitor depend on the surface properties of a dielectric film included in the metalized film. A known metalized film can lower the withstand voltage of the film capacitor or the yield in manufacturing the film capacitor.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A metalized film used in one or more embodiments of the present disclosure will now be described.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A metalized film <b>10</b> in the present embodiment includes a dielectric film <b>1</b> and a metal film <b>2</b>. The dielectric film <b>1</b> has a first surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>and a second surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>opposite to the first surface <b>1</b><i>a</i>. The dielectric film <b>1</b> has a film thickness of 1 to 3 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The dielectric film <b>1</b> is formed from an insulating resin. Examples of insulating materials for the dielectric film <b>1</b> include polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyarylate (PAR), polyphenylene ether (PPE), polyetherimide (PEI), and cycloolefin polymers (COP).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For the dielectric film <b>1</b>, an arithmetic mean height Sa1 of the first surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>and an arithmetic mean height Sa2 of the second surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>are different. The arithmetic mean height Sa1 and the arithmetic mean height Sa2 may be expressed using a 10-point average.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The dielectric film <b>1</b> has a maximum height Sz1 of the first surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>satisfying the expression 100 nm&#x3c;Sz1&#x2264;350 nm, and a maximum height Sz2 of the second surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>satisfying the expression 10 nm&#x2264;Sz2&#x2264;100 nm. More specifically, the dielectric film <b>1</b> has the different maximum heights Sz1 and Sz2, which satisfy the expression 110 nm&#x3c;Sz1+Sz2&#x2264;450 nm. The maximum heights Sz1 and Sz2 may be maximum heights of 10 points.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The metal film <b>2</b> is formed from a metal material and is formed on the second surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the dielectric film <b>1</b>. Examples of the metal material for the metal film <b>2</b> include aluminum and an aluminum-based alloy. The metal film <b>2</b> has a film thickness of, for example, 10 to 30 nm.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The metalized film <b>10</b> may include, at one end of the dielectric film <b>1</b> in the width direction (perpendicular to the page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), a metal film-free portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>in which the metal film <b>2</b> is not deposited and the second surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the dielectric film <b>1</b> is exposed. The metal film-free portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>may extend continuously in the longitudinal direction of the dielectric film (lateral direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The metalized film <b>10</b> can be prepared as described below.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The insulating resin is first dissolved in a solvent to prepare a resin solution. Examples of the solvent include methanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monopropyl ether, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, xylene, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, dimethylacetamide, cyclohexane, toluene, and a mixture of two or more solvents selected from these solvents.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, a base formed from, for example, PET is prepared, and a first main surface (also referred to as a third surface) of the base is blasted using alumina particles. The third surface may have a maximum height Sz3 in a range satisfying 100 nm&#x3c;Sz3&#x2264;350 nm.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The resin solution is then shaped into a sheet on the third surface of the base. The method for shaping may be selected as appropriate from known methods including doctor blading, die coating, and knife coating. The resin solution applied onto the third surface is dried and the solvent is volatilized. This allows the base to include the dielectric film <b>1</b> on its third surface.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The dielectric film <b>1</b> is separated from the base. The dielectric film <b>1</b> is then wound around a winding core, which is formed from resin or metal, and is collected. The metalized film <b>10</b> can be manufactured by vapor deposition of the metal film <b>2</b> onto the second surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the collected dielectric film <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With the method for manufacturing the metalized film <b>10</b>, the dielectric film <b>1</b> formed on the third surface of the base is not wound around the winding core together with the base, but is separated from the base and wound around the winding core and is collected. This reduces indentations on the first surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the dielectric film <b>1</b> resulting from a second main surface of the base pressed against the first surface <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For the metalized film <b>10</b>, the first surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the dielectric film <b>1</b>, on which the metal film <b>2</b> is not deposited, has fine irregularities that satisfy the expression 100 nm&#x3c;Sz1&#x2264;350 nm. This reduces wrinkles that may be caused by the high smoothness of the first surface <b>1</b><i>a</i>. This structure further reduces adhesion between the metalized films <b>10</b> and also possible rapture of the metalized films <b>10</b> in producing the film capacitor using the wound or stacked metalized films <b>10</b>. This improves the reliability of film capacitor including the metalized films <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For the metalized film <b>10</b>, the second surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the dielectric film <b>1</b>, on which the metal film <b>2</b> is deposited, satisfies the expression 10&#x3c;Sz1&#x2264;100 nm. The second surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>is smoother than the first surface <b>1</b><i>a</i>. More specifically, in the dielectric film <b>1</b>, although a valley on the first surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>and a valley on the second surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>overlap as viewed in plan, the dielectric film <b>1</b> has the film thickness less likely to be reduced excessively. Thus, the film capacitor including the stacked or wound metalized films <b>10</b> is less likely to undergo dielectric breakdown under a high voltage.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The maximum height Sz1 of the first surface <b>1</b><i>a </i>may have a maximum profile peak height Sp1 greater than a maximum profile valley depth Sv1.

assessment. In examples 1 to 6, the sum of the maximum heights Sz1 and Sz2 was 450 nm or less, and the frequency of breakdown was less than 100%. The frequency of breakdown decreased as the sum of the maximum heights Sz1 and Sz2 decreased, and the frequency of breakdown decreased as the ratio Sp1/Sv1 increased.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">The metalized films in comparative example 1 have greater maximum heights Sz1 and Sz2 than the metalized films in examples 1 to 6, indicating that the frequency of breakdown is high in comparative example 1. This may result from, for example, indentations on the dielectric film resulting from the base pressed against the dielectric film when the base and the dielectric film are wound simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">The metalized films in comparative example 2 each have the second surface <b>1</b><i>b </i>with a less maximum height Sz2 than the metalized films in examples 1 to 6. In comparative example 2, the degree of wrinkling is high when the metalized films were stacked to form the body. This may result from the second surface of the dielectric film formed on the base without being blasted, thus with reduced smoothness.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">The present disclosure may be implemented in the following forms.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">A metalized film according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure includes a dielectric film having a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface.
