end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Exemplary embodiments (examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings) are elaborated below. The following description refers to the accompanying drawings, in which identical or similar elements in two drawings are denoted by identical reference numerals unless indicated otherwise. The exemplary implementation modes may take on multiple forms, and should not be taken as being limited to examples illustrated herein. Instead, by providing such implementation modes, embodiments herein may become more comprehensive and complete, and comprehensive concept of the exemplary implementation modes may be delivered to those skilled in the art. Implementations set forth in the following exemplary embodiments do not represent all implementations in accordance with the subject disclosure. Rather, they are merely examples of the apparatus and method in accordance with certain aspects herein as recited in the accompanying claims.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">At present, higher and higher requirements on the storage performance and cell size of the memory are put forward in the market, which brings severe challenges to the design and manufacture of the memory.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The technical solution of the present disclosure can be applied to design and manufacture of a semiconductor memory, for example, a semiconductor memory such as a common DRAM. The common DRAM achieves storage of charges by using a capacitor, and the value of a binary bit is represented by a storage capacity of charges, that is, a memory cell can be used for representing a logical state of a bit. Due to the phenomena such as current leakage exists in a transistor, the stored charges are easily lost, which affects the stability of data storage. Therefore, periodic charging and discharging is required by the DRAM, and dynamic storage is achieved by refreshing storage data.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In consideration of a structure that a capacitor structure needs two capacitor plates, a dielectric layer and the like, a larger space size is required to be occupied, as a result, it is difficult to decrease the size of a single memory cell, and the overall size of the memory is also limited by this problem. Therefore, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a memory, transfer and storage of charges are achieved by using a storage layer communicated with a conducting channel of a transistor, and thus a 1T0C memory cell structure is achieved without a capacitor, thereby effectively reducing the size of the memory.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The technical solutions of the present disclosure are further described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments as follows.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a memory. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the memory <b>100</b> includes: a substrate <b>110</b>, a transistor array, and a storage layer <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The transistor array includes multiple transistors <b>120</b> on a surface of the substrate <b>110</b>. Conducting channels <b>121</b> of the transistors <b>120</b> extend in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The storage layer <b>130</b> is disposed at a side of the conducting channel <b>121</b> of each transistor <b>120</b>, communicated with the conducting channel <b>121</b> of the transistor <b>120</b>, and configured to store charges and perform charge transfer with the communicated conducting channel.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Here, the substrate may be a semiconductor substrate made of a silicon material or other wafer materials. A device structure of the memory can be formed on the surface of the substrate through technological processes of semiconductor devices. For example, a layered graphical structure is formed on the surface of the substrate through the technological processes such as doping, photoetching, depositing, cleaning and the like, so as to form the semiconductor device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, multiple transistors are formed on the surface of the substrate, and the transistors are arranged on the surface of the substrate in pairs. Multiple pairs of transistors can be arranged in rows and columns to form transistor arrays to form a memory.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Here, the conducting channels of the transistors extend in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate, less surface area of the substrate can be occupied compared with a transistor formed in parallel to the surface of the substrate, and the utilization rate of the area of the substrate is improved.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the embodiments of the disclosure, the storage of the charges is achieved by the storage layer communicated with the conducting channel of each transistor, and the storage layer can perform charge transfer with the conducting channel, so as to achieve a change in a logical state of a memory cell. The storage layer may be made of a semiconductor material or a metal material, and may be used for storing electrons or holes. The storage layer is communicated with the conducting channel, and when a voltage is applied to the transistor, charges accumulate in the conducting channel and a potential difference is formed between the conducting channel and the storage layer, so that charge transfer occurs between the conducting channel and the storage layer, and the quantity of charges of the storage layer is changed. In this case, the charge transfer between the storage layer and the conducting channel is achieved through the control of the transistor, and charges are stored in the storage layer.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The storage layers are distributed on the side surfaces of the transistors and communicated with the conducting channels of the transistors, and the storage layers also extend in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate, thereby occupying less surface area of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The memory structure in the embodiments of the present disclosure not only saves a manufacturing space required for a capacitor structure in the memory, and further save the occupation of the surface area of the substrate by using a perpendicular form, thereby effectively increasing the number of memory cells in a unit area. The embodiments of the present disclosure further achieve the charge storage through the storage layer, which replaces the function of the original capacitor, achieves a 1T0C memory cell structure, and facilitates the development of a small size and a high integration degree of the memory.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a source electrode <b>122</b> of the transistor <b>120</b> is disposed at an end of the conducting channel <b>121</b> close to the surface of the substrate <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A drain electrode <b>123</b> of the transistor <b>120</b> is disposed at an end of the conducting channel <b>121</b> away from the surface of the substrate <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The transistor includes a source electrode, a gate electrode, and a drain electrode. A state switching of charge conduction or non-conduction between the source electrode and the drain electrode is achieved by voltage control of the gate electrode and a voltage difference between the source electrode and the drain electrode. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, an extension direction of the conducting channel of the transistor is a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate, and therefore, the source electrode and the drain electrode of the transistor are respectively disposed at two ends of the conducting channel, that is, one end is close to the surface of the substrate and the other one end is away from the surface of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this case, the structure of the transistor can effectively use a height space above the substrate, which saves the surface area of the surface of the substrate, so that more memory cells may be integrated on the surface of the substrate per unit area, thereby improving storage efficiency of the memory.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, a first insulating layer covers a periphery of the source electrode of the transistor. A height of the first insulating layer with respect to the surface of the substrate is higher than a height of the source electrode with respect to the surface of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The periphery of the source electrode of the transistor may be covered with the first insulating layer, so as to achieve the function of protecting and separating the source electrode and the storage layer. The first insulating layer may be evenly distributed on the surface of the substrate at a certain thickness, the first insulating layer at this thickness may completely cover the source electrode of the transistor, and the height of the first insulating layer with respect to the surface of the substrate is higher than the height of the source electrode with respect to the surface of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Here, the material of the first insulating layer may be materials such as silicon oxide and silicon nitride, and may also be an organic material and the like.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, a second insulating layer is provided at a side, communicated with the storage layer, of the transistor, the second insulating layer covers the storage layer, and the second insulating layer is communicated with the first insulating layer. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the transistors may be separated from each other through the second insulating layer, and the second insulating layer may extend from a position where the first insulating layer is, i.e., a bottom of the conducting channel of the transistor, directly to a top of the conducting channel. Moreover, the second insulating layer is separated from the first insulating layer, and the storage layer is also separated from other transistors and other storage layers through the insulating layers.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, since the first insulating layer covers the source electrode of the transistor, the first insulating layer is communicated with the second insulating layer, so as to form an overall insulating layer, so that the source electrode of the transistor and the storage layer are separated from each other, and are covered with the insulating layers, so as to reduce charge movement between the source electrode and the storage layer, thereby facilitating stably storing charges by the storage layer.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Here, the first insulating layer and the second insulating layer may be made of the same material, and may also be made of different materials.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the memory may further include: at least one bit line <b>140</b>, disposed at a side, away from the surface of the substrate <b>110</b>, of the transistor <b>120</b>, and connected to the drain electrode <b>123</b> of the transistor <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, multiple transistors of the memory may be arranged to form a transistor array having a row-column structure.
