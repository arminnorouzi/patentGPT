Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the etching process of the semiconductor device manufacturing process, there is a problem of nonuniformity in the etching rate at different positions of the workpiece, which may lead to the problem that different positions of a same film layer cannot be etched out at the same time. In order to realize that different positions of a same film layer are opened at the same time, the work will inevitably lead to long-term over-etching on certain positions, for example, the substrate portion that does not need to be etched too much is lost too much, which reduces the yield and finished product ratio.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, in the plasma etching of the silicon oxide spacer layer, due to the different etching rates at the top and bottom of the silicon oxide spacer layer, the silicon oxide on the top and the bottom of the silicon oxide spacer layer cannot be opened at the same time. Therefore, if both the top and the bottom are opened, it will inevitably cause long-term over-etching in some areas, for example, resulting in excessive loss of the silicon substrate, which reduces the yield and finished product ratio.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to solve the above problems, the present disclosure provides a plasma etching process for the spacer layer, which open the top and bottom of the spacer layer while minimizing over-etching time and reducing substrate loss, and improves the yield and finished product ratio.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present disclosure, a spacer layer is formed on the workpiece; for example, in a specific example, the workpiece includes at least a substrate and a stack structure formed on the substrate, and the stack structure includes at least at an oxide layer which forms an oxide spacer layer on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a specific example, before the etching process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the substrate <b>101</b> is a silicon substrate, and the stacked structure includes, from bottom to top, a gate layer <b>102</b> formed on at least a portion of the substrate, a silicon nitride layer <b>103</b> formed on the gate layer <b>102</b>, and a silicon oxide layer <b>104</b>, the silicon oxide layer <b>104</b> is formed on the silicon nitride layer <b>103</b> and on other regions of the substrate <b>101</b> where the gate layer <b>102</b> and the silicon nitride layer <b>103</b> are not formed, so as to form a silicon oxide spacer layer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a specific example, the composition modulation gas is selected in the etching process to modulate the volume ratio of carbon to fluorine, so as to control the distribution of the carbon-based polymer formed on the spacer layer based on the volume ratio of carbon to fluorine. Here, the composition modulation gas contains one or more molecules having a chemical formula C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>F<sub>z</sub>, where x and z are natural numbers greater than zero, and may be the same or different natural numbers and y is a natural number greater than or equal to zero. Then, one or more species were generated using one or more plasmas from a process gas including the composition modulation gas to create a mixture. Here, the process gas further includes an etching gas and the modulating the volume ratio of carbon and fluorine may specifically be modulating the volume ratio of carbon and fluorine in the process gas. Further, when workpiece is exposed to the mixture, part of the substances in the mixture react with the oxide layer to form a polymer layer which covers the oxide layer, and at the same time, part of the gas in the process gas etches at least a portion of the spacer layer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a specific example, the etching gas is C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>. In another specific example, the composition modulation gas includes one or more of Difluoromethane(CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>), Fluoroform (CHF<sub>3</sub>), and Carbon tetrafluoride (CF<sub>4</sub>).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Here, the volume ratio of carbon to fluorine may also be the ratio of the number of atoms.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be noted that the polymer layer formed on the oxide layer includes a carbon-based polymer. Of course, in practical applications, the polymer layer may also include other polymers, and is not restricted specifically in the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, in practical applications, the step of forming the polymer layer and the etching step occur at the same time, but the etching rate is greater than the formation rate of the polymer layer. In this way, the etching is implemented so as to expose the film layer that needs to be exposed. For example, for the oxide spacer layer, after etching, the top of the oxide spacer layer exposes a portion of the silicon nitride layer, and the bottom of the oxide spacer layer exposes a portion of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a specific example, the first portion of the polymer layer is formed on the first area (for example, the top) of the spacer layer, and the second portion of the polymer layer is formed on the second area (for example, the bottom) of the spacer layer. The first area may be higher than the second area, and the first thickness of the first portion may be different from the second thickness of the second portion, that is to say, the thickness of the polymer layer formed on the top of the spacer layer is different from the thickness of the polymer layer formed on the bottom of the oxide spacer layer. In this way, it is convenient for the composition modulation gas to control the distribution of the polymer layers formed on the top and bottom of the silicon oxide spacer layer, indirectly adjust the etching rate, and realize the simultaneous opening of the top and bottom silicon oxide layers in the spacer layer, reduce over-etching time and avoid excessive loss of substrate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a specific example, selecting the composition modulation gas may specifically include: selecting the composition modulation gas to produce a first volume ratio of carbon and fluorine that is greater than or equal to a preset ratio, such that the first thickness is greater than the second thickness. For example, a composition modulation gas is selected such that the volume ratio of carbon and fluorine in the process gas is greater than or equal to a preset ratio. Here, in an example, after the etching gas is determined, modulating the volume ratio of carbon and fluorine in the process gas may be specifically modulating the volume ratio of carbon and fluorine in the composition modulation gas, needed to be used, to be greater than or equal to the volume ratio of carbon and fluorine in the etching gas. For example, the volume ratio of carbon and fluorine in the etching gas is 0.5, and the volume ratio of carbon and fluorine in the composition modulation gas may be modulated to be greater than or equal to 0.5, so that the thickness of the polymer layer formed on the top of the spacer layer (that is, the first thickness) is greater than the thickness of the polymer layer on the bottom (that is, the second thickness). In other words, when the volume ratio of carbon and fluorine in the process gas is greater than or equal to the preset ratio, the growth rate of the polymer layer on the top of the spacer layer is greater than the growth rate on the bottom, so that the thickness of the top polymer layer of the spacer layer is greater than the thickness of the bottom polymer layer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the etching gas is C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, and, Difluoromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) is selected as the composition modulation gas. In this case, during the etching process, the thickness of the polymer layer <b>105</b> formed on the top of the silicon oxide spacer layer is greater than the thickness of the polymer layer <b>105</b> formed on the bottom. In this case, part of the gas in the process gas, such as C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>and CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, etches the polymer layer formed, etches the oxide layer on the top and bottom of the silicon oxide spacer layer, but does not etch the silicon oxide layer of the spacer layer, so that the silicon oxide layers on the top and bottom of the silicon oxide spacer layer are opened at the same time to obtain an etched structure. In the etched structure, the top of the silicon oxide spacer layer exposes a portion of the silicon nitride layer, and the bottom exposes a portion of the substrate (such as a silicon substrate).

Therefore, different and cost-effective designs can be made to overcome the difficulties associated with previous designs. As discussed in detail below, the secondary inductive element <b>540</b> may also be operated at a lower frequency (for example, about 2 MHz), allowing the secondary inductive element <b>540</b> to be very compact and fit in a limited space on top of the dielectric window.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In some embodiments, the primary inductive element <b>530</b> and the secondary inductive element <b>540</b> may be operated at different frequencies.

Using a magnetic flux concentrator with an appropriate coil can enable the secondary inductive element <b>540</b> to have higher plasma coupling and good energy transmission efficiency, and can significantly reduce its coupling with the metal shield <b>552</b>. Using a lower frequency (for example, about 2 MHz) on the secondary induction element <b>540</b> can increase the skin layer, which also improves the plasma heating efficiency.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In some embodiments, the primary inductive element <b>530</b> and the secondary inductive element <b>540</b> may have different functions. For example, the primary inductive element <b>530</b> may be used to perform the basic function of plasma generation during ignition and provide sufficient priming for the secondary inductive element <b>540</b>. The primary inductive element <b>530</b> may have couplings to both the plasma and the ground shield to stabilize the plasma potential. The first Faraday shield <b>554</b> associated with the primary inductive element <b>530</b> avoids window sputtering and may be used to provide coupling to the ground shield.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">An additional coil may be operated in the presence of a good plasma priming provided by the primary induction element <b>530</b>, and therefore, the additional coil preferably has good plasma coupling to the plasma and good energy transfer efficiency. The secondary inductive element <b>540</b> including the magnetic flux concentrator <b>544</b> not only provides good magnetic flux transfer to the plasma volume, but also provides good decoupling between the secondary inductive element <b>540</b> and the surrounding metal shield <b>552</b>. The symmetrical driving of the magnetic flux concentrator <b>544</b> and the secondary inductive element <b>540</b> further reduces the voltage amplitude between the coil end and the surrounding ground element. This can reduce the sputtering of the dome, but at the same time it will bring some small capacitive coupling to the plasma, which can be used to aid ignition.
