Pulsed electric field energy delivery utilizes brief pulses of high voltage that generate locally high electric fields that can drive the breakdown of cell membranes and result in cell death, a process also referred to as irreversible electroporation. For example, in the cardiac context, an endocardial focal ablation catheter can be used to deliver pulsed field ablation via irreversible electroporation to cardiac tissue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the presence of a relatively more electrically conductive fluid medium (for example, such as blood), the high voltage pulses of pulsed field ablation can result in current flows between the electrodes of an ablation device, where a significant proportion of the net current flows through the fluid medium rather than through tissue. This can result in lesion characteristics that can be suboptimal for some applications, such as, for example, generating deeper lesions in thicker tissue (e.g., ventricular tissue). It therefore can be desirable to have ablation device designs that can improve the generation of deep lesions in tissue.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In Example 1, an endocardial catheter comprising an outer shaft, an inner shaft, a spline assembly, and a foldable membrane.

Examples of endocardial focal catheters configured for the delivery of PFA include multi-electrode basket constructions with deployable splines, such as those described in: (1) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/874,721, filed Jan. 18, 2018, titled &#x201c;SYSTEMS, DEVICES, AND METHODS FOR FOCAL ABLATION,&#x201d; issued as U.S. Pat.

The signal generator can be coupled to the ablation devices described herein and can be generate waveforms that are suitable for use with such devices. Such pulsed waveforms can be designed to enhance one or more of the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of energy delivery to tissue by reducing the electric field threshold associated with irreversible electroporation, thus yielding more effective ablative lesions with a reduction (e.g., minimization) in total energy delivered. In some embodiments, the voltage pulse waveforms disclosed herein may be hierarchical and have a nested structure. For example, the pulse waveform may include hierarchical groupings of pulses having associated timescales. Examples of suitable pulse waveforms including a plurality of levels of a hierarchy are disclosed in International Application Serial No. PCT/US2016/057664, filed on Oct. 19, 2016, titled &#x201c;SYSTEMS, APPARATUSES AND METHODS FOR DELIVERY OF ABLATIVE ENERGY TO TISSUE,&#x201d; and International Application Serial No. PCT/US2019/031135, filed May 7, 2019, titled &#x201c;SYSTEMS, APPARATUSES AND METHODS FOR DELIVERY OF ABLATIVE ENERGY TO TISSUE,&#x201d; the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In endocardial clinical applications of pulsed field ablation, it can be desirable to generate focal lesions where a local region of tissue is ablated. In some instances, such a lesion can be transmural, e.g., the lesion extends across an entire depth of a tissue wall. In thicker cardiac tissue, for example, as is common in the left ventricle, the tissue thickness can be significantly thick, e.g., about 8 mm to about 10 mm, or more. Accordingly, in applications such as for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), it can be desirable to be able to create lesions with greater depth. Systems, devices, and methods described herein can be configured to deliver pulsed field ablation to tissue for generation of deeper lesions.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Systems</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">This disclosure describes apparatus and device embodiments for pulsed field ablation delivery to generate deep lesions in cardiac tissue and associated methods of use. In some embodiments, the device may be a catheter including an outer shaft and an inner shaft. The inner shaft may be configured to translate (e.g., extend) beyond a distal end of the outer shaft. The device may include a spline assembly comprising a plurality of splines coupled (e.g., attached) between a distal end of the outer shaft and a distal end of the inner shaft. For example, a proximal end of each spline can be attached to a distal end of the outer shaft, and a distal end of each spline can be attached to a distal end of the inner shaft. In some embodiments, a length of each spline can be longer than a maximum distance by which a distal end of the inner shaft extends beyond a distal end of the outer shaft. Thus, the splines can collectively form a basket-like shape. In some embodiments, the inner shaft can be translated (e.g., retracted) relative to the outer shaft via a handle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the device may be configured to transition between an undeployed configuration and a deployed configuration, including a plurality of semi-deployed (e.g., partial deployment) configurations between the undeployed configuration and the deployed configuration. For example, in an undeployed configuration, the inner shaft can be extended beyond a distal end of the outer shaft such that the basket-like shape formed by the splines has a minimal diameter or cross-section. When the inner shaft is retracted, the splines can deploy (e.g., via buckling or outward movement) into a basket-like structure with a larger cross-section (e.g., larger cross-sectional area with a larger maximum diameter than in the undeployed configuration). In some embodiments, a range of deployments from undeployed to full deployment are generally available, with the basket-like shape attaining its widest cross-section when the device is fully deployed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, each spline may include a plurality of electrodes, with a set of one or more distal electrodes and a set of two or more proximal electrodes being located proximal to the set of distal electrodes. For ablation delivery of a pulsed field ablation waveform, various subsets of the distal electrodes can be polarized with a first electrical polarity while various subsets of the proximal electrodes can be polarized with a second electrical polarity opposite the first electrical polarity. The applied waveform can be either monophasic (e.g., single relative polarity) or biphasic (e.g., alternating relative polarities). Example waveforms for pulsed field ablation are described in International Application Serial Nos. PCT/US2016/057664 and PCT/US2019/031135, each of which are incorporated above by reference.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, a membrane comprising insulating material can be disposed generally in a middle or central portion of the splines. To facilitate attachment of the membrane to one or more of the splines, the membrane may define one or more recesses (e.g., cut-outs) along an outer edge of the membrane configured to attach to one or more of the splines. In some embodiments, an inner portion of the membrane may define an aperture (e.g., hole) configured to receive an inner shaft. In some embodiments, the membrane may be coupled to one or more splines between a set of distal electrodes and a set of proximal electrodes of one or more of the splines.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, a one-sided surface area of the membrane can be larger than a cross-sectional area formed by the splines in the undeployed configuration.

Generally, one or more catheters may be advanced in a minimally invasive fashion through vasculature to a target location. For example, an ablation device may be advanced through vasculature over a guidewire and through a deflectable sheath. The sheath may be configured for deflection and aid in guiding a focal ablation catheter through vasculature and one or more predetermined targets (e.g., pulmonary vein ostia or other atrial or ventricular locations).

The methods described here include introducing and disposing an ablation device (e.g., ablation device (<b>1110</b>) or any other ablation devices described herein) near or in contact with a region of the heart. In some embodiments, a cardiac stimulator (e.g., cardiac stimulator (<b>1128</b>)) may be used to deliver a pacing signal to the heart, or measurement device may be used to measure cardiac activity.

In some embodiments, the voltage pulse waveforms described herein may be applied during a refractory period of the cardiac cycle so as to avoid disruption of the sinus rhythm of the heart. The method (<b>1200</b>) includes introduction of a device (e.g., ablation device (<b>1110</b>) or any other ablation devices described herein) into an endocardial space of a heart, at (<b>1202</b>). For example, the device may be inserted through a delivery device such as a deflectable sheath and navigated into an anatomical region of interest. In some embodiments, the electrodes of the ablation device can be disposed near or adjacent to an endocardial surface of the heart. In some embodiments, one or more portions of the device may be deflected to fine-tune the location and placement of the distal portion of the device. The ablation device can be deployed, e.g., as described with respect to example embodiments herein, at (<b>1204</b>). For example, the device may be deployed so as to be apposed to tissue before a pulsed field ablation waveform is applied to tissue using the catheter electrodes.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">A pulse waveform may be generated, at (<b>1206</b>). Various bipolar pairing arrangements of subsets of the distal and proximal electrodes respectively can be implemented for ablation delivery and lesion generation. For example, a voltage pulse waveform may be applied in a refractory time window. In some embodiments, the pulse waveform may be generated with a time offset with respect to the indication of a pacing signal. For example, the start of a refractory time window may be offset from the pacing signal by a time offset. The voltage pulse waveform(s) may be applied over a series of heartbeats over corresponding common refractory time windows. In alternate embodiments, the ablation pulse waveform can be delivered without a pacing signal, e.g., asynchronously delivered. The generated pulse waveform may be delivered to tissue, at (<b>1208</b>). In some embodiments, the pulse waveform may be delivered to tissue a heart of a patient via one or more splines of a set of splines of an ablation device. In other embodiments, voltage pulse waveforms as described herein may be selectively delivered to electrode subsets such as anode-cathode subsets for ablation. For example, first and second electrodes of a group of electrodes may be configured to have opposite polarities. These steps may be repeated for a desired number of tissue sites for ablation. For example, after completion of lesion delivery to a first target location, the device may be navigated (using one or more of catheter or sheath deflection) to a second anatomical location for ablation delivery at the second location. The device deployment may be adjusted as needed. In some embodiments, a more complete deployment can generate relatively deeper lesions if the catheter basket orientation with respect to the local tissue wall is at 45 degrees or less relative to the local surface normal at the endocardial surface.
