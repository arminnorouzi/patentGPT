frequencies audible to the human ears. The ultrasonic waves are widely used for ultrasonic imaging devices that obtain images of interiors of objects. The advantages of the ultrasonic imaging device are that the ultrasonic imaging device is small in scale and low in cost, the ultrasonic imaging device displays information in real time, and the ultrasonic imaging device has high stability because there is no exposure to radiation such as X-rays. Therefore, the ultrasonic imaging devices are widely used together with other imaging diagnosis devices such as computed tomography (CT) devices, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices, and nuclear medicine device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, technologies related to ultrasonic therapeutic systems, together with the ultrasonic imaging devices, are also being actively developed. Most ultrasonic therapeutic systems obtain therapeutic effects by generating vibration of tissue or heat in a body by irradiating the body with the ultrasonic waves having frequencies of several MHz and used for medical purposes. A representative example of the ultrasonic therapeutic system is a high-intensity focused ultrasound system. In general, the high-intensity focused ultrasound system is embedded with a transducer configured to emit the ultrasonic waves and focuses the emitted ultrasonic waves on a focal point to generate heat, thereby rapidly raising a temperature of a surgical site. An intended surgical procedure is performed on various types of diseased parts by the heating function without leaving adverse effect.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The ultrasonic surgical device uses various types of probes respectively suitable for surgical sites and patient's characteristics, and the settings of the ultrasonic surgical device need to be adjusted depending on the type of probe.

A user may discriminate the probes being used by inputting the information on the probes to the apparatus. Further, the ultrasonic surgical device may be more efficiently used when the apparatus may automatically discriminate types of probes and select the settings suitable for the probes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Meanwhile, the probe may be designed such that the probe efficiently vibrates at a desired frequency so that the probes may be discriminated.

In this case, the ultrasonic surgical device uses generated mechanical kinetic energy and frictional heat to incise and coagulate tissue during various types of surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Most of medical ultrasonic surgical devices use an output of about 100 to 200 W and use an ultrasound handpiece having oscillating frequencies within a range of 20 to 60 kHz depending on the use of the surgical procedure. The ultrasonic surgical device uses a low-frequency probe when large amplitude (amplitude of about 300 &#x3bc;m) is required, and uses a high-frequency probe (with amplitude of about 60 &#x3bc;m to 80 &#x3bc;m) when the ultrasonic surgical device needs to perform a delicate surgical procedure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The amplitude varies depending on driving power and an ultrasound horn shape suitable for the ultrasonic frequency.

In contrast, the present system <b>1</b> may immediately initiate the operation without requiring a separate manipulation for tuning.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present system <b>1</b> may provide the present apparatus <b>100</b> with an identification frequency for discriminating the type of probe of the ultrasonic surgical device. The present apparatus <b>100</b> may discriminate any one probe among the multiple types of probes by analyzing a feedback signal produced on the basis of the identification frequency and generate a control signal suitable for the corresponding probe. The present system <b>1</b> may control the operation of the ultrasonic surgical device by receiving the corresponding control signal.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In step S<b>110</b>, the present apparatus <b>100</b> may receive the identification frequency for discriminating the type of probe of the ultrasonic surgical device. In other words, the present apparatus <b>100</b> may receive a resonant frequency detected (e.g., predicted) by the present system <b>1</b> as the identification frequency. The identification frequency may be used to discriminate the type of probe.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present system <b>1</b> may scan frequencies in order to find the resonant frequency of the transducer included in the ultrasonic surgical device. In addition, the present system <b>1</b> may maintain the resonant frequency of the transducer, which is detected by scanning, as a predetermined resonant frequency.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In other words, the present system <b>1</b> may scan the identification frequency for finding the resonant frequency of the particular probe on the basis of an operating signal of an output mode provided from a foot switch. The present system <b>1</b> may perform the process of scanning the identification frequency in order to find the resonant frequency of the transducer included in the ultrasonic surgical device.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, the present system <b>1</b> may use a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) and change the frequency by increasing the frequency by a preset frequency value (e.g., 4 kHz) from a first frequency (e.g., 30 kHz) to a second frequency (e.g., 32 kHz). In this case, the present system <b>1</b> may determine a frequency, which induces maximum voltage, as the resonant frequency by monitoring a voltage inputted through a feedback circuit.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, an ultrasonic vibrator generates ultrasonic waves on the basis of the resonant frequency. The ultrasonic vibrator may match the changing resonant frequency with the oscillating frequency and maintain the constant output of the ultrasonic waves, thereby improving the function of the ultrasonic surgical device.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, the present system <b>1</b> may perform the tracking process of maintaining the resonant frequency of the transducer, which is detected by scanning, as a predetermined (optimal) resonant frequency. The tracking process may monitor the voltage inputted through the feedback circuit for each preset time (e.g., 100 to 200 ms), compare the monitored voltage with the voltage detected during the tuning process, and adjust and correct the frequency depending on a difference in voltage.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, the present system <b>1</b> may decrease the frequency when the voltage decreases, and increase the frequency when the voltage increases. For example, the present system <b>1</b> may predict the resonant frequency within a particular range of the frequency of the transducer of the ultrasonic surgical device (ultrasonic probe).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, the present system <b>1</b> may compare the frequency at the maximum voltage with the current frequency. For example, the present system <b>1</b> may detect the maximum voltage and detect the frequency at the maximum voltage. In addition, the present system <b>1</b> may detect the current frequency generated by the transducer of the ultrasonic therapeutic device (ultrasonic probe).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present system <b>1</b> may determine whether the maximum voltage frequency is within a preset range. In this case, the maximum voltage frequency may be the resonant frequency. In this case, when the maximum voltage frequency is within the preset range, the present system <b>1</b> may perform the tracking process in response to feedback. In contrast, when the maximum voltage frequency is not within the preset range, the present system <b>1</b> may perform the tuning process again. In other words, when the result of the comparison between the frequency at the maximum voltage and the current frequency is not within the preset range, the present system <b>1</b> may generate a feedback signal related to a process of performing a tuning step again.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the present system <b>1</b> may include a retuning step of scanning the frequency again in order to find the resonant frequency of the transducer included in the ultrasonic surgical device on the basis of the feedback signal after a tracking step. For example, the present system <b>1</b> may perform the retuning process of scanning the frequency again to find the resonant frequency of the transducer included in the ultrasonic therapeutic device on the basis of the feedback signal after the tracking step without performing the tuning process by the user's input and the manipulation of the separate switch.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In step S<b>120</b>, the present apparatus <b>100</b> may analyze the feedback signal generated on the basis of the received information on the identification frequency. The present apparatus <b>100</b> may analyze the feedback related to the output of the ultrasonic waves by using the fact that the ultrasonic oscillation varies depending on the thickness and length of the probe. The present apparatus <b>100</b> may analyze the feedback signal generated by the present system <b>1</b> to find the resonant frequency.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In step S<b>130</b>, the present apparatus <b>100</b> may discriminate any one probe among the multiple types of probes by comparing the analysis result with preset reference frequency information. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, because the frequencies at which the types of probes most efficiently vibrate are different from one another, it is possible to discriminate the probes by analyzing the feedback signal and the reference frequency information according to the preset type of probe.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present apparatus <b>100</b> may discriminate any one probe among the multiple types of probes by comparing the analysis result with the reference frequency information stored in database (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The database (not illustrated) may store first reference frequency information corresponding to a first probe, second reference frequency information corresponding to a second probe, and third reference frequency information corresponding to a third probe.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The first to third probes may be different in thicknesses, lengths, and groove shapes. The first reference frequency information and the third reference frequency information may be information corresponding to the frequency at which the particular probe most efficiently vibrates.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, the present apparatus <b>100</b> may detect information on a temperature produced by the ultrasonic vibrator included in the ultrasonic surgical device. The maximum output is made at the resonant frequency, but a change in impedance may occur, for example, within a range of 10 to 20% because of a change in temperature during the operating process. For this reason, the resonance state may not be maintained because of an increase in temperature.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The present apparatus <b>100</b> is intended to solve the problem in that the discrimination deteriorates at the time of discriminating the probes because the characteristics of the ultrasonic vibrator are changed by the temperature of the ultrasonic vibrator. Therefore, the present apparatus <b>100</b> may discriminate the types of probes after measuring the temperature of the ultrasonic vibrator and correcting the frequency information on the basis of information related to the temperature of the ultrasonic vibrator.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, the present apparatus <b>100</b> may correct frequency error information according to the change in temperature by adjusting the frequency information on the basis of the difference between the pre-stored temperature change frequency information and the identification frequency information.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the present apparatus <b>100</b> may correct the frequency error information according to the change in temperature by adjusting the frequency information on the basis of the difference between the identification frequency information and the temperature change frequency information stored in the database.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The database may store characteristic information of the vibrator that changes at a first temperature, characteristic information of the vibrator that changes at a second temperature, and characteristic information of the vibrator that changes at a third temperature.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The present apparatus <b>100</b> may correct the error information by adjusting the frequency information on the basis of the difference between the identification frequency information and the frequency information that changes at a particular temperature stored in advance in the database.
