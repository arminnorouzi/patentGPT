Specific migraine triggers include rapid changes in the weather, alcohol, caffeine, cheese, fever, lack of sleep, stress, and menstrual periods. With this range of potential causes, there was no clear biological marker for migraine, and diagnosis was dependent on assessment of numerous clinical criteria having to do with duration, location, quality of pain, and concurrent development of other symptoms, such as nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a typical treatment scenario for suspected migraine, patients begin by using over-the-counter medication. If this does not bring sufficient relief, they proceed to a primary care physician, who may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications or, if necessary, narcotics. Ultimately, the patient may be referred to a neurologist who may seek a computer tomography (CT) scan or MRI of the brain. Ninety-five percent of all brain scans performed for migraine patients are normal. Therefore, physicians begin prescribing migraine-specific medications and/or ultimately referring the patient into chronic pain management.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to some studies, migraine headaches are diagnosed in approximately 18% of women and 6% of men, affecting as many as 40 million people per year in the United States. These debilitating headaches present a crippling personal and economic burden, not least because historically their etiology has been complex and the most effective way to diagnose and treat them is uncertain. In part because of this uncertainty, more than half of migraine sufferers have not been formally diagnosed, nor have they ever received prescription medications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One study showed 43% of migraine sufferers reported five or more days of headache pain in the previous three months. More than half reported that their pain forced them to go to bed for days at a time, and the same percentage reported a reduction of 50% or more in work or school productivity. Nearly 25% had sought care in an emergency room or urgent care clinic.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another study reported that families with at least one person suffering from migraines had total annual medical costs that were 70% higher than families without migraine. In those families with an adult sufferer, this amounted to about $4,700 per year. Interestingly, a significant proportion of these costs was not for direct treatment of headache symptoms, but was related to comorbid conditions and to treatment delivered to spouses and family members. For example, the spouse of a migraine sufferer had total healthcare costs that were 24% higher than a counterpart in a non-migraine family, and a child had costs that were 11% higher.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One of the &#x201c;hidden&#x201d; costs of migraine is the loss of productivity in employees who come to work but cannot perform at optimum levels. Researchers from the University of Michigan conducted a study with Chicago-based Bank One to determine the costs in lost productivity in its workers who suffered from migraine. Health risk appraisal questionnaires were completed by 19,853 employees, of whom 20% reported a history of migraine headache. Responses were combined with demographic and payroll data to estimate the corporate costs due to migraine-related absenteeism and reduced productivity. While direct costs due to absenteeism totaled $21.5 million, estimated costs due to lost productivity were even higher, at $24.4 million. The magnitude of these costs reflects the fact that the prevalence of migraines peaks during the ages of 25 to 55 years, the prime working years. The surprising conclusion of this study was that productivity costs related to chronic diseases such as migraine, arthritis, allergies, and back pain, are equivalent to the medical costs related to severe conditions such as heart disease and cancer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another set of costs related to migraine reflects the difficulty of diagnosis in patients suffering from severe headaches. In the one year period from February 2003-February 2004, 689 patients with a primary diagnosis of headache NOS (not otherwise specified) were admitted to a major teaching hospital in Houston, Tex. The average length of stay for these patients was 3.9 days, with a total billed cost for all patients of nearly $14 million for a single one-year period.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, a longstanding need exists for effective methods and systems to permanently reduce the frequency or severity of or completely eliminate migraine headaches by performing a surgery to eliminate the root cause.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The medical systems and methods of the present invention meets such needs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is directed to specific systems and methods which surgically treat persistent headaches such as migraine headaches based on matching a computer tomography (CT) scan of the patient's sinus cavities with a nasal-sinus surgical treatment plan aimed at optimally reducing or eliminating the root cause of persistent headaches. The present inventor has discovered that the activation of the trigeminal nerve by contact with hypertrophied turbinates and the rigid confines of the nasal cavity (even without a deviated septum) can cause a headache. More commonly, a septal deviation or septal spur impinges on the turbinates causing a range of headaches from mild intermittent or severe daily pain that is commonly diagnosed as migraine. A septal deviation is defined as an off-center deflection of the septum from a line extending from the crista galli to the maxillary crest. A septal spur is a severe, sharp deflection of the septum that can pierce the turbinates or lateral wall of the nose.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present system and methods may be used on patients initially presented with migraine headache in addition to chronic nasal congestion and/or recurrent sinus infections. Such patients are initially manually examined with the application of a topical decongestant (e.g. Phelylephrine) and anesthetic (e.g. Pontacaine&#xae; or Tetracaine&#xae;) spray within the nose in order to obtain a clear view of the entire nasal airway with an endoscope. Septal deviation and/or septal spurs are commonly diagnosed using this procedure. After application of the spray, patients with a headache are observed to see if there was a reduction/resolution of the pain, as further evidence of a rhinogenic cause. (To prevent introducing bias, patients may be told the are receiving only a decongestant spray, then questioned at the end of the visit to see if there was a reduction or resolution of their headache). As an alternative test for rhinogenic etiology of the headaches, some patients were sent home with Afrin&#xae; decongestant nasal spray and instructed to use it at the onset of a headache to see if it inhibited or diminished the headache.
