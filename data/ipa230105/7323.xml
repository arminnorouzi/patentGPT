The mastering of content personalization is double edged in its impacts though, because users may be locked in isolated bubbles of their world view. As a result, vital exposure to challenging world views of other user groups may be reduced. The issue of problems caused by the limits of human subjectivity is not new and is very well known in journalism. In order to resolve this issue, journalism ethics and standards were established which bound journalists to report about stories in a way which respects different opinions so that the audience is faced with a full picture containing the challenging views. However, the content feeds of successful internet applications like YouTube&#x2122; and Twitter&#x2122;&#x2014;which greatly influence the world's perception of contemporary people&#x2014;are generated in automated way and lack the touch of human journalists who obey a code of objectivity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This Summary introduces simplified concepts that are further described below in the Detailed Description of Illustrative Embodiments.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system <b>10</b> for providing content feeds to a user is provided. The system <b>10</b> is provided in a communications network <b>8</b> including one or more wired or wireless networks or a combination thereof, for example including a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the internet, mobile telephone networks, and wireless data networks such as Wi-Fi&#x2122; and 3G/4G/5G cellular networks. Operating system <b>60</b> (hereinafter &#x201c;OS <b>60</b>&#x201d;) is executed on computing devices <b>12</b>. The system <b>10</b> enables monitoring a plurality of user content streams of a plurality of users on a plurality of computing devices <b>12</b>, the plurality of user content streams including a plurality of content instances accessible via a network. Content instances include media for example videos, social networking posts, and news articles, or portions thereof for example headings or summaries of videos, social networking posts, and news articles, or links thereto for example links to videos, social networking posts, and news articles.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The system <b>10</b> further enables generating a plurality of archetypes based on the user content streams, receiving a selection of a particular archetype of the plurality of archetypes from a particular user on a particular computing device <b>12</b>, determining a particular content stream based on the particular archetype, and delivering the particular content stream to the particular user via the particular computing device <b>12</b>. Beneficially, a label is applied to each of the plurality of archetypes based on content instances within each of the plurality of archetypes, for example by applying a classifier to text within content instances within each of the plurality of archetypes, and the particular user is enabled to select the particular archetype based on the label of the archetype. The particular computing device <b>12</b> is not necessarily included as one of the plurality of computing devices from which user content streams are monitored, but can be included as one of the plurality of computing devices from which user content streams are monitored.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A network-connectable processor-enabled content feed manager <b>20</b> enables content feeds to be provided to a user of a computing device <b>12</b> via a content feed application <b>14</b>. The content feeds can be provided in a user interface <b>56</b> via the content feed application <b>14</b> based on data transmitted from a content feed application program interface (&#x201c;API&#x201d;) <b>30</b> of the content feed manager <b>20</b>. Alternatively, content feeds can be provided via the user interface <b>56</b> based on data transmitted from a web application <b>28</b> enabled by the content feed manager <b>20</b> and accessible via a web browser <b>50</b> executed on the computing device <b>12</b>. Content feeds beneficially include links to content hosted by internet applications, websites, or other network-enabled platforms. Content feeds can alternatively include content in its entirety, abridged content, or excerpted content. Internet applications or websites providing content can include for example social media, video hosting, or news platforms, for example Youtube&#x2122;, Twitter&#x2122;, and Wall Street Journal&#x2122; content platforms. Applications providing content (&#x201c;content applications&#x201d;) can include standalone applications, plugins, add-ons, or extensions to existing applications, for example web browser plugins. Content applications or components thereof can be installed and executed locally on a computing device <b>12</b> or installed and executed on remote computing systems accessible to the computing device <b>12</b> via the communications network <b>8</b>, for example the internet.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A website server or application server <b>40</b> (hereinafter &#x201c;web/app server&#x201d;) can function to enable local content applications <b>52</b> or components of a local content application <b>52</b>. Web/app servers <b>40</b> can further enable services including network-based applications, webpages, or other services accessible via a web browser <b>50</b>. A monitoring agent <b>16</b> monitors user activity on the computing device <b>12</b> including a user's use of local and network-based applications and a user's accessing of websites and of particular content on local and network-based applications and websites. Records and statistics of such use is used by a modeling engine <b>22</b> to build behavioral archetypes stored in a model datastore <b>24</b> of the content feed manager <b>20</b> or a local datastore <b>54</b> of the computing device <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A first methodology for providing content feeds includes tweaking known internet browser online tracking mechanisms in order to set an internet browser into a state which would cause a determined response from particular internet applications or websites. Internet applications and websites are individually and jointly referred to herein as &#x201c;platforms&#x201d;. Eventually, by setting the browser into carefully chosen states a desired user experience can be brought to the user. This procedure is not ideal because the common purpose of known tracking mechanisms (e.g., browser fingerprinting, storing of browser's history, and saving of cookies) is to provide valuable information to a visited website or third-party, for example to improve a customer's user experience in e-shops, achieve better advertisement targeting, automate localization of website content, or conduct marketing studies. The purpose of tracking mechanisms is not to significantly influence the personalization of platforms. Tweaking of relevant online tracking mechanisms of a browser may result in limited or no impact in eliciting a desired response from a particular platform.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An important observation of the nature of successful contemporary platforms (e.g., internet applications and websites) is that their personalization mechanisms rely greatly on the recording of a user's interaction with the platform through the particular user's account. This observation is supported by the conclusion set forth above regarding the above-described first methodology. A second methodology provided involves elaborating on the idea of maintaining a population of artificially created user accounts initialized into well-defined states, so that their content feed would include desired properties. This second methodology is also not ideal. First, different platforms typically have different mechanisms of interaction and personalization. Accordingly, it is largely necessary to reverse engineer mechanisms for interaction and personalization separately for each platform of interest. Second, maintaining artificially created user accounts user may be against the terms and conditions of platforms of interest.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Instead of trying to create an internet experience by creating an artificial user with particular traits, a third methodology in the form of a content feed mimicking process is described herein enabling a mimicking of the content feeds of internet applications and websites, individually and jointly referred to herein as &#x201c;platforms&#x201d;, of interest so that they represent preferences of a chosen group of users. Content feeds are enabled that mimic preferences of behavioral archetypes of internet users making it possible for a user to experience the internet through the eyes of a different chosen group of users.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> an exemplary pipeline <b>100</b> of a content feed mimicking process is shown. While proprietary content platforms including Youtube&#x2122; and Twitter&#x2122; are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, these are only exemplary and may be substituted with any number of different content platforms. In order to achieve the goal of mimicking content feeds, beneficially data from a data source is obtained including a plurality of content streams <b>102</b> including a plurality of streams of browsing activity of internet users <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> who gave consent to being tracked on internet applications and websites (individually and jointly referred to herein as &#x201c;platforms&#x201d;) with publicly available content instances. One skilled in the art would understand that processes described herein are scalable to any number of users. Content instances include for example hosted user videos <b>110</b> (e.g., YouTube&#x2122; videos), social networking posts <b>112</b> (e.g., Twitter&#x2122; Tweets&#x2122;), and news media articles <b>114</b>. The data from the data source can be obtained for example via a monitoring agent <b>16</b> for example in the form of a tracking browser extension installed on a computing device <b>12</b> of a user.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">After gathering the plurality of content streams <b>102</b> of internet users <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> on websites or internet applications of interest, which data can be stored in a user datastore <b>26</b>, significant groups of internet users <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are discovered by an archetype discovery process <b>120</b> in which archetype &#x201c;A&#x201d; <b>130</b>A, archetype &#x201c;B&#x201d; <b>130</b>B, and archetype &#x201c;C&#x201d; <b>130</b>C are determined, allowing the feeds of internet users <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> to be mimicked. This mimicking is beneficially performed by implementing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hereinafter &#x201c;LDA&#x201d;), a powerful topical modeling algorithm from the field of natural language processing. An LDA is configured to receive documents as inputs and to output topics defined as a weighted list of words within the documents. The LDA algorithm is beneficially applied to a stream of browsing activity, for example by the modeling engine <b>22</b> based on a stream of browsing activity stored in the user datastore <b>26</b>. A single user (e.g., a first user <b>104</b>, a second user <b>106</b>, or a third user <b>108</b>) is perceived over a certain period of time (e.g., a day, week, or month) as a &#x201c;document&#x201d; under the LDA. A unique video, text instance (e.g., Twitter&#x2122; Tweet&#x2122;), article, or other content instance accessed by the user (e.g., the first user <b>104</b>, the second user <b>106</b>, or the third user <b>108</b>) is beneficially perceived as a &#x201c;word&#x201d; of the &#x201c;document&#x201d; under the LDA. The output of the LDA algorithm are behavioral archetypes perceived as &#x201c;topics&#x201d; under the LDA, which behavioral archetypes are defined as a weighted list of LDA &#x201c;words&#x201d; (e.g., videos, Tweets&#x2122;, articles). Behavioral archetypes can be stored in a model datastore <b>24</b>. Every &#x201c;document&#x201d; (i.e., every user) is represented as a weighted average of &#x201c;topics&#x201d; (i.e., behavioral archetypes). Hereinafter, LDA &#x201c;topics&#x201d; are referred to as significant &#x201c;behavioral archetypes&#x201d;, the content feeds of which can be mimicked. Alternatively, other types of algorithms can be used for the discovery of behavioral archetypes. The behavioral archetypes are labeled based on content represented thereby, for example by applying a classifier to text or other data of the LDA &#x201c;words&#x201d; (e.g., videos, Tweets&#x2122;, articles) defining the behavioral archetypes.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a feed mimicking process <b>140</b>, a content feed application <b>14</b> is provided enabling an end user <b>204</b> to choose a behavioral archetype, a plurality of behavioral archetypes, or a weighted average of behavioral archetypes for example based on a corresponding label. A content feed including publicly available content instances is created via the content feed application <b>14</b> beneficially resembling a feed of a particular internet application by selecting the most relevant elements (e.g., videos, social media posts, or articles) from source data streams of browsing activities of internet users <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. Content instances can include for example hosted user videos <b>210</b> (e.g., YouTube&#x2122; videos), social networking posts <b>212</b> (e.g., Twitter&#x2122; Tweets&#x2122;), and news media articles <b>214</b>. A very useful property of the output of the LDA is that the weights of every &#x201c;word&#x201d; (e.g., every video, Tweet&#x2122;, or article) are distributed across the &#x201c;topics&#x201d; (i.e., behavioral archetypes) so that the sum of the weights is equal to 1 for each &#x201c;topic&#x201d; (i.e., behavioral archetype). These weights are interpreted as elements of a vector embedding of the &#x201c;word&#x201d; (e.g., video, Tweet&#x2122;, or article) in the vector space of the &#x201c;topics&#x201d; (i.e., behavioral archetypes), resulting in an archetype vector of a content instance. The behavioral archetypes in this space are beneficially represented by one-hot vectors, and the content feed is created by retrieving the most similar archetype vectors of content instances to the vector of the chosen behavioral archetype, for example by utilizing the cosine similarity.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> a process flow <b>300</b> of an exemplary application of a content feed mimicking process in accordance with the exemplary pipeline <b>100</b> is shown.
