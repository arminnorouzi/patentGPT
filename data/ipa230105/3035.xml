The sheathing materials on their own may not provide the desired level of fire protection or sound insulation, particularly at the joints or ends of the sheathing assemblies, such as the joint formed between the top of a wall and the ceiling. As a result, additional materials, such as mineral wool, fire caulking, intumescent strips, intumescent putty, fire resistant foam, or other fire resistant or sound insulating materials may be installed at these joints in order to achieve the desired level of fire protection and/or sound insulation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, many walls are constructed to allow for vertical movement of the studs and the wallboard panels attached thereto relative to the ceiling, which may result from thermal expansion of the studs, seismic activity or shifting loads on higher floors or other similar factors. Typically, in those walls, the wallboard panels are installed such that there is a gap between the top of the wallboard panel and the horizontal support structure (e.g., ceiling). The gap allows the wallboard panel to travel vertically without contacting the ceiling when the studs and wallboard panel deflect. Those gaps are typically filled with a resilient and/or a compressible filler material, such as backer rod or caulk, so that the wallboard panel can still move vertically during a deflection. In some applications, the filled gap can then be covered by a finishing component, such as joint tape and joint compound.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to applying a finishing component over the filler material in the gap, a finishing accessory, including but not limited to a piece of ceiling trim or an L bead, may also be installed at the top of the wallboard panel to help provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance to the joint. The finishing accessories may be manufactured from plastics, metals, paper products, composites and other materials.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, providing a finishing accessory that comprises a backing strip that can fill the gap with a resilient and/or compressible material, may allow a single component to replace multiple components or materials, which may reduce installation time and total material cost.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">While a variety of finishing accessories have been made and used, it is believed that no one prior to the inventor(s) has made or used an invention as described herein.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

In some embodiments, second leg (<b>104</b>) may be attached to wallboard panel (<b>40</b>) via fasteners inserted through the solid portions of second leg (<b>104</b>) and into wallboard panel (<b>40</b>). In other embodiments, second leg (<b>104</b>) may be attached to wallboard panel (<b>40</b>) via adhesive or any other suitable attachment means.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown, bead (<b>103</b>) of finishing accessory (<b>100</b>) comprises first leg (<b>102</b>), second leg (<b>104</b>), lip (<b>106</b>), and removable leg (<b>120</b>). In some embodiments, first leg (<b>102</b>), second leg (<b>104</b>), lip (<b>106</b>), and removable leg (<b>120</b>) may be of unitary construction such that they are formed from a single integral piece of material. In some embodiments, the components of bead (<b>103</b>) may be extruded or co-extruded together. However, in other embodiments, one or more of first leg (<b>102</b>), second leg (<b>104</b>), lip (<b>106</b>), and removable leg (<b>120</b>) may comprise non-integral, separate components that are attached to each other. It will thus be appreciated that bead (<b>103</b>) may have a unitary construction or be comprised of various components attached together to collectively form bead (<b>103</b>). In some embodiments, bead (<b>103</b>), including one or more of first leg (<b>102</b>), second leg (<b>104</b>), lip (<b>106</b>), and removable leg (<b>120</b>), may comprise polyvinyl chloride (PVC), steel, aluminum or any other suitable material, including but not limited to other suitable plastics, metals, paper products, and composites.

In other embodiments, including those where lip (<b>106</b>) is omitted, removable leg (<b>120</b>) may extend from either first leg (<b>102</b>) or second leg (<b>104</b>) at any suitable location, length, and/or orientation. In some embodiments, removable leg (<b>120</b>) may be integrally attached to first leg (<b>102</b>), second leg (<b>104</b>), or lip (<b>106</b>) via extrusion of bead (<b>103</b>) during the manufacturing process. In the illustrated embodiment, removable leg (<b>120</b>) of finishing accessory (<b>100</b>) is configured to inhibit any finishing material, such as joint compound, veneer plaster, paint, or other similar materials applied to second leg (<b>104</b>) from being inadvertently applied to the surrounding components of finishing accessory (<b>100</b>) or wall assembly (<b>10</b>), such as strip (<b>110</b>) and lower surface (<b>51</b>) of horizontal support structure (<b>50</b>).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown, bead (<b>103</b>) further includes a frangible connection (<b>107</b>) extending between lip (<b>106</b>) and removable leg (<b>120</b>). More particularly, frangible connection (<b>107</b>) may have a thin and/or weakened section of material configured to selectively fracture upon being manipulated by a user. A user may thus separate removable leg (<b>120</b>) from lip (<b>106</b>) by grasping removable leg (<b>120</b>) at any location along the longitudinal length of removable leg (<b>120</b>) (e.g., a proximal end, a distal end, a middle portion, and/or etc.) and applying sufficient force to removable leg (<b>120</b>) in a direction generally away from lip (<b>106</b>) (e.g., an upward force, a downward force, a rightward force, or an angled force generally away from lip (<b>106</b>)). As used herein, the term &#x201c;fracture&#x201d; generally refers to the failure of the material itself such that the material may crack, rip, and/or tear for separation of removable leg (<b>120</b>) from bead (<b>103</b>). The term &#x201c;fracture&#x201d; is not intended to unnecessarily limit the invention described herein. In instances where lip (<b>106</b>) is omitted from bead (<b>103</b>), frangible connection (<b>107</b>) may be positioned along removable leg (<b>120</b>) such that the portion of removable leg (<b>120</b>) connecting to first leg (<b>102</b>) and/or second leg (<b>104</b>) has a thin and/or weakened material configured to selectively fracture in response to application of sufficient force.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, removable leg (<b>120</b>) may include one or more apertures and/or perforations along frangible connection (<b>107</b>) between removable leg (<b>120</b>) and lip (<b>106</b>) to further weaken frangible connection (<b>107</b>). In these embodiments, the apertures and/or perforations along frangible connection (<b>107</b>) are configured to facilitate removal of removable leg (<b>120</b>). It will be appreciated that such apertures and/or perforations are not required, but may be desirable to ease removal of removable leg (<b>120</b>) depending on the material(s) from which bead (<b>103</b>) may be manufactured. The apertures and/or perforations may be sized and shaped to enhance the ease in removing removable leg (<b>120</b>) while still inhibiting a finishing material that is applied to second leg (<b>104</b>) from contacting any surrounding components of finishing accessory (<b>100</b>) or wall assembly (<b>10</b>), as described above.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Removable leg (<b>120</b>) may be configured to be gripped directly by hand by the user for removal from lip (<b>106</b>). However, that the user may alternatively grip removable leg (<b>120</b>) indirectly with a tool, including but not limited to, a pair of pliers or other suitable gripping devices, to manipulate removable leg (<b>120</b>) relative to lip (<b>106</b>). In this instance, applying a necessary force to removable leg (<b>120</b>) via the tool is operable to fracture frangible connection (<b>107</b>) and thereby separate removable leg (<b>120</b>) from lip (<b>106</b>). Other methods and/or tools for separating removable leg (<b>120</b>) from lip (<b>106</b>) may also be used. By way of example only, removable leg (<b>120</b>) may be removed from lip (<b>106</b>) by cutting removable leg (<b>120</b>) along frangible connection (<b>107</b>) with a knife, scissors, boxcutter, and/or other various suitable cutting means. While removable leg (<b>120</b>) is removably connected to lip (<b>106</b>) via frangible connection (<b>107</b>) in the illustrated embodiment, other embodiments of finishing accessory (<b>100</b>) may include alternative connections between removable leg (<b>120</b>) and lip (<b>106</b>). As merely an illustrative example, an adhesive connection or mechanical connection may be employed to removably connecting removable leg (<b>120</b>) to lip (<b>106</b>) of bead (<b>103</b>).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, finishing accessory (<b>100</b>) includes strip (<b>110</b>), which is a separate component attached to the exterior surface (<b>102</b><i>a</i>) of first leg (<b>102</b>). In this embodiment, strip (<b>110</b>) is only located on first leg (<b>102</b>) and does not extend onto second leg (<b>104</b>). As shown, strip (<b>110</b>) comprises a substantially rectangular cross-section. In other embodiments strip (<b>110</b>) may comprise various other suitable cross-sections. By way of example only, strip (<b>110</b>) may comprise a squared, circular, or other suitable cross-section. In some embodiments, strip (<b>110</b>) may comprise a rectangular cross-section that is oriented such that the height (i.e., vertical dimension) of strip (<b>110</b>) is greater than the width (i.e., horizontal dimension) of strip (<b>110</b>). Strip (<b>110</b>) may be attached to first leg (<b>102</b>) using an adhesive, one or more fasteners, or any other attachment means as will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments where strip (<b>110</b>) is attached to first leg (<b>102</b>) with a layer of adhesive, the adhesive may be fire resistant or, in other words, able to maintain its adhesive qualities at elevated temperatures by incorporating fire resistant properties. In some embodiments strip (<b>110</b>) may be attached to first leg (<b>102</b>) as a result of strip (<b>110</b>) and first leg (<b>102</b>) being coextruded together.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, strip (<b>110</b>) comprises a base layer (<b>112</b>) and a fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>). Base layer (<b>112</b>) may comprise a resilient and/or compressible material, such as a closed cell foam or an open cell foam. In some embodiments, base layer (<b>112</b>) may comprise a material used for conventional backer rod or another substantially similar material. In the illustrated embodiment, fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) is attached atop base layer (<b>112</b>) such that fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) is positioned above base layer (<b>112</b>) and between horizontal support structure (<b>50</b>) and bead (<b>103</b>) in wall assembly (<b>10</b>). Fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) may comprise material that has fire resistant properties.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) may comprise material that has intumescent properties that allow the material to expand and, in some embodiments char, in response to being subjected to elevated temperatures in order to resist fire. By way of example only, the fire resistant material may be configured to expand when it is exposed to temperatures at or above about 300 degrees Fahrenheit. In other examples, the fire resistant material may fully intumesce when exposed to temperatures at or above about 375 degrees Fahrenheit. This may help provide fire protection at the head of wall joint between wallboard panel (<b>40</b>) and horizontal support structure (<b>50</b>) where finishing accessory (<b>100</b>) is installed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) may also comprise a resilient and/or compressible material similar to base layer (<b>112</b>). In some embodiments, fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) may comprise intumescent tape, while in other embodiments fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) may comprise an intumescent coating applied to the upper surface of base layer (<b>112</b>). In some embodiments, fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) is substantially the same width and length as base layer (<b>112</b>) such that substantially the entire upper surface of base layer (<b>112</b>) is covered by fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>). In other embodiments, fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) may cover less than the entire upper surface of base layer (<b>112</b>) provided fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) comprises a sufficient amount of fire resistant material to allow finishing accessory (<b>100</b>) to provide the desired fire resistant properties.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) may be attached to base layer (<b>112</b>) using any conventional means or methods, including but not limited to an adhesive between fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) and base layer (<b>112</b>). In embodiments that use an adhesive, the adhesive may be fire resistant or, in other words, able to maintain its adhesive qualities at elevated temperatures. By way of example only, in one embodiment, fire resistant layer (<b>114</b>) may comprise intumescent tape with an adhesive on the bottom surface.

As shown, first leg (<b>802</b>) is positioned along top edge (<b>42</b>) of wallboard panel (<b>40</b>) and second leg (<b>804</b>) extends downwardly from lip (<b>806</b>) and contacts outer vertical surface (<b>44</b>) of wallboard panel (<b>40</b>). In addition, as shown, third leg (<b>805</b>) is positioned between wallboard panel (<b>40</b>) and leg or flange (<b>24</b>) of header track (<b>20</b>) such that the upper end of wallboard panel (<b>40</b>) is received within pocket (<b>803</b>) of finishing accessory (<b>800</b>). In some embodiments, third leg (<b>805</b>) may be in contact with the inner vertical surface (<b>49</b>) of wallboard panel (<b>40</b>) and/or the outer surface of flange (<b>24</b>) of header track (<b>20</b>). Strip (<b>810</b>) may be dimensioned such that upper surface (<b>816</b>) of strip (<b>810</b>) contacts the lower surface (<b>51</b>) of horizontal support structure (<b>50</b>). In embodiments where the upper surface (<b>816</b>) of strip (<b>810</b>) contacts the lower surface (<b>51</b>) of horizontal support structure (<b>50</b>), that contact may provide a seal that helps prevent the spread of smoke at the head of wall joint and reduces the amount of sound that passes through the head of wall joint, even when strip (<b>810</b>) is in a normal or unexpanded state. In embodiments where strip (<b>810</b>) comprises material with intumescent properties, at least a portion of strip (<b>810</b>) may be configured to expand when exposed to elevated temperatures, thereby expanding into surrounding gaps and substantially sealing the head of wall joint to help prevent the spread of smoke and fire through the joint.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In embodiments where strip (<b>810</b>) comprises compressible material, such a construction allows wallboard panel (<b>40</b>) to travel vertically during deflections because strip (<b>810</b>) can be compressed as wallboard panel (<b>40</b>) travels upward toward horizontal supporting structure (<b>50</b>). In embodiments where strip (<b>810</b>) comprises material that is also resilient, strip (<b>810</b>) can then return to its original size to substantially fill gap (<b>60</b>) as wallboard panel (<b>40</b>) travels downward away from horizontal supporting structure (<b>50</b>).
