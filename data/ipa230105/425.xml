Some pigmented skin conditions or lesions are benign, whereas other pigmented skin conditions or lesions are malignant.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Images of skin lesions may be used in an effort to identify the type of lesion, and to determine if a lesion is benign or malignant. For example, a specialist may be able to identify the type of a lesion by inspecting a dermatoscopic image.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present disclosure is a method of distinguishing between benign and malignant conditions (e.g., skin lesions) utilizing a numerical value of an order parameter (S<sup>2</sup>) that may be extracted from images of human skin. At least some aspects of the method may be implemented utilizing a computer and/or other suitable hardware and devices. In general, the order parameter has a range of 0 to 1, inclusive. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an S<sup>2 </sup>value below a predefined &#x201c;malignant&#x201d; value indicates that a region (e.g., a skin lesion) may be malignant, and an S<sup>2 </sup>value above a predefined &#x201c;benign&#x201d; value indicates that a region (e.g., a skin lesion) may be benign. The method includes extracting (calculating) a numerical value of an order parameter (S<sup>2</sup>) from an image such as a dermatoscopic image of skin, wherein the image includes at least one region (e.g., a pigmented skin lesion) having variable contrast. S<sup>2 </sup>comprises a numerical value quantifying a degree of order present in the image. The numerical value of S<sup>2 </sup>may be determined by dividing an area of the light regions by a total area that includes the light regions and the dark regions. The method may include comparing the numerical value of the extracted S<sup>2 </sup>to a predefined maximum acceptable (malignant) S<sup>2 </sup>value. It may be determined that the region (e.g., pigmented skin lesion) is likely to be malignant if the numerical value of the extracted S<sup>2 </sup>is less than or equal to the predefined malignant S<sup>2 </sup>value.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method may optionally include determining that the pigmented skin lesion is likely to be benign if the numerical value of the extracted numerical value of S<sup>2 </sup>is greater than or equal to a predefined benign S<sup>2 </sup>value. Although the present disclosure is not limited to specific predefined values of S<sup>2 </sup>indicating that a lesion is benign or malignant, benign lesions may typically have an S<sup>2 </sup>value greater than 0.5, and malignant skin lesions may typically have an S<sup>2 </sup>value that is less than 0.5. If the S<sup>2 </sup>value of a lesion is within the range of 0.5+/&#x2212;0.1, or the image quality is inadequate to achieve such certainty, the status of the lesion may be indeterminate, although the present disclosure is not limited to any specific value.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the present disclosure is a computer-implemented method of distinguishing between benign and malignant skin conditions utilizing a numerical value determined from data corresponding to one or more images of skin. The method includes utilizing a computer to extract a numerical value from data corresponding to a digital image of skin, wherein the digital image corresponding to the data includes at least one region of concern comprising a potential malignancy having light regions and dark regions, and wherein the numerical value is determined, based at least in part, on an area of a selected one of the light regions or the dark regions relative to a total area, wherein the total area is equal to the sum of an area of the light regions and an area of the dark regions. The light regions and the dark regions may be determined, at least in part, utilizing a threshold value whereby portions (areas) of the image (e.g. pixels) having a brightness value above the threshold value are included in the light regions, and portions (e.g. pixels) having a brightness value below the threshold value are included in the dark regions. The threshold value may be determined for a specific set of data (image). The method further includes estimating the likelihood that the potential malignancy is malignant based, at least in part, on a comparison of the extracted numerical value to one or more predefined numerical malignancy criteria that correspond to a likelihood that the potential malignancy is malignant. The numerical value may optionally comprise an order parameter squared (S<sup>2</sup>). The potential malignancy may optionally comprise a pigmented skin lesion, and the method may optionally include determining that the pigmented skin lesion is likely to be benign if the numerical value of the extracted S<sup>2 </sup>is greater than or equal to a predefined benign S<sup>2 </sup>value. The predefined malignant S<sup>2 </sup>value may be less than the predefined benign S<sup>2 </sup>value.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present disclosure is a computer-implemented method of identifying margins of malignant skin lesions. The method includes utilizing a computer to create an S<sup>2 </sup>spatial map from an image of skin by forming a binary image, followed by utilizing a computer to assign each pixel of the binary image a greyscale value that is equal to the average value of the adjacent pixels in the binary image, wherein the S<sup>2 </sup>spatial map may be utilized to aid in determining the margins of malignant skin lesions to facilitate removal of the entire malignant lesion without removing an excessive amount of surrounding tissue that is not malignant.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In general, extracted S<sup>2 </sup>values between the malignant and benign S<sup>2 </sup>values may be indeterminate. Also, the predefined malignant and benign S<sup>2 </sup>values may be determined by extracting a sufficiently large number of S<sup>2 </sup>values from images of skin lesions that are known to be either malignant or benign. The predefined malignant and/or benign S<sup>2 </sup>values may be determined, at least in part, on a required confidence level that a given lesion will be malignant or benign. For example, the predefined malignant S<sup>2 </sup>values could be selected to be greater than the largest S<sup>2 </sup>values of known malignant lesions to minimize or eliminate the risk that a malignant lesion is incorrectly evaluated due to an unexpectedly large S<sup>2 </sup>value that is above the S<sup>2 </sup>value of known malignant lesions (e.g., known malignant lesions utilized to determine the predefined malignant S<sup>2 </sup>value). Similarly, the predefined benign S<sup>2 </sup>value may be selected to be greater than the smallest S<sup>2 </sup>values of known benign skin lesions to minimize or eliminate the risk that an indeterminate skin lesion (i.e., a lesion requiring additional evaluation to determine if it is malignant or benign) is incorrectly evaluated as benign. Furthermore, known malignant and/or benign lesions may be utilized to form a range or a series of ranges of predefined malignant and/or benign S<sup>2 </sup>values corresponding to increasing confidence levels (probabilities) that a given lesion is malignant or benign. For example, S<sup>2 </sup>values between 0.4-0.5 may indicate that a lesion is indeterminate, but likely not malignant, S<sup>2 </sup>values between 0.3-0.4 may indicate a moderate probability that a lesion is malignant, and S<sup>2 </sup>values below 0.3 may indicate a very high probability that a lesion is malignant. Similarly, S<sup>2 </sup>values between 0.5-0.6 may indicate a lesion is indeterminate, but likely benign, S<sup>2 </sup>values between 0.6-0.7 may indicate a moderate probability a lesion is benign, and S<sup>2 </sup>values above 0.7 may indicate a very high probability that a lesion is benign. It will be understood that the numerical ranges described above are examples, and the numerical values of the predefined ranges may be different than the examples.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other features, advantages, and objects of the present device will be further understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art upon studying the following specification, claims, and appended drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color.

The extraction process is discussed in more detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. As discussed in more detail below, larger S<sup>2 </sup>values generally indicate that a lesion may be benign, whereas lower S<sup>2 </sup>values may indicate that a skin lesion is malignant. Thus, the S<sup>2 </sup>value extracted from dermatoscopic images may be utilized to determine if a skin lesion is benign or malignant. As used herein, the term &#x201c;order parameter&#x201d; broadly refers to S, S<sup>2</sup>, or any other suitable parameter or quantity relating to a degree of order present in a physical item and/or an image of a physical item.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In general, the order parameter S specifies or quantifies the degree of disorder characterizing a specific physical sample in a number of physical systems. In some cases, it is possible to link the order parameter to a physical parameter of interest (such as band gap energy, or critical temperature). Even in cases where such a physical property is not immediately evident, comparison between samples, or quantitative analysis of physical system evolution, can be obtained by comparing order parameter values.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">There are established relationships between the degree of ordering which characterizes a physical system and key system properties. Thus, an appropriate metric for ordering can, in some instances, provide the basis for a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms which influence properties, and suggest possible ways to control them. Quantifying system ordering is possible across multiple length scales ranging from the microscopic to the astronomical. Temporal variation of the order parameter yields valuable information regarding system evolution over a range of time scales.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is possible to experimentally quantify the degree of disorder in physical systems using a metric such as the Bragg-Williams order parameter (S). For a perfectly ordered system S=1, for a system with complete disorder S=0, and partially ordered systems exhibit a value of S between 0 and 1. Foundational work for obtaining an experimental measurement of S was accomplished via x-ray diffraction measurements on metal binary alloys, such as CuAu and beta-brass (ZnCu). A methodology for extracting S from Raman spectra, reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), and electron microscopy images has also been developed. These techniques have been applied to heterovalent ternary semiconductors to establish a relationship between disorder and critical system-level properties of the material, specifically the band gap. However, the approach applies to semiconductors in general, including silicon and graphene, and also organic-based polymers as well as biological systems in the context of, for example, viruses and vaccines and skin conditions.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For the case of an atomic lattice with two elements (A and B) the Bragg-Williams order parameter is defined as S=r<sub>A</sub>+r<sub>B</sub>&#x2212;1, where r<sub>A </sub>(r<sub>B</sub>) is the ratio of A (B) atoms on A (B) lattice sites; in the case of N different elements S=(r<sub>A</sub>+r<sub>B</sub>+ . . . +r<sub>N</sub>&#x2212;1)/(N&#x2212;1). However, experimental techniques do not require knowledge apriori of the definition of S, i.e., a methodology for extracting S from experimental techniques, whether x-ray diffraction, RHEED, Raman spectroscopy, or electron microscopy, applies regardless of the number of elements responsible for the disorder. While the full range of S is from 0 to 1, the maximum value achievable in a given system is limited by the compositional stoichiometry, i.e., the perfectly ordered state S=1 is only achievable when there are equal amounts of all constituent elements. For the specific case of two elements, where the composition x is defined as</p><p id="p-0031" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>x</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <msub>    <mi>N</mi>    <mi>A</mi>   </msub>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>N</mi>     <mi>A</mi>    </msub>    <mo>+</mo>    <msub>     <mi>N</mi>     <mi>B</mi>    </msub>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0032" num="0000">with N<sub>A </sub>(N<sub>B</sub>) equal to the number of A (B) elements in the system, the maximum S value is S<sub>max</sub>=2x for x&#x3c;0.5 and 2(1&#x2212;x) for x&#x3e;0.5; similar constraints can be derived for cases with a higher number of unique elements. Additionally, system-level properties dominated by pair interactions have a linear relationship with S<sup>2</sup>. By using a spin modeling technique (each element type is assigned a different spin), in conjunction with cluster expansion theory limited to single and pair-wise interaction terms, it can be shown that P(x, S)=S<sup>2</sup>[P(x=0.5, S=1)&#x2212;P(x, 0)]&#x2212;P(x, 0).

A threshold value is set to the value of the highest center point value minus the floor of that number of standard deviations. As discussed below, the threshold value may be used to determine which pixels are &#x201c;bright&#x201d; (white), and which pixels are &#x201c;dark&#x201d; (black).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0041">At step <b>28</b>, a binary threshold is performed on the region of interest in the image using the threshold calculated in step <b>26</b>.

In general, the result of the binary threshold is a black (dark) and white (bright) image (not shown) having white (ordered) regions and black (disordered) regions. At step <b>30</b>, a numerical value, which may comprise the squared order parameter (S<sup>2</sup>) value of the region of interest, is calculated by counting the bright (white) pixels in the thresholded image and dividing this number by the total number of pixels contained with the region of interest. The total number of pixels is equal to the sum of the number of dark (black) pixels and the number of bright (white) pixels. Because the sizes (areas) of each of the pixels are the same, the S<sup>2 </sup>value is the ratio of the area of the bright regions to the total area.

A box blur or normalization operation is applied to the binary image, which results in each pixel in the resulting image having a value equal to the average value (greyscale) of its neighboring pixels in the input binary image.

Thus, in this example, the value that results from the taking the average value of the neighboring pixels in the binary image, which are all white (255) or black (0), is a greyscale value between 0 and 255.
