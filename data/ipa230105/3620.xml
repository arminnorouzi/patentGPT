Exemplary process fluids include, without limitation, high velocity gases or liquids that pass through one or more pipes, ducts, or vessels. Instruments, such as sensors or probes, can be housed in the process inserts and inserted within the container directly in the stream of the high velocity fluid for various applications. For example, the sensors or probes can be used to monitor the fluid via the extraction of fluid samples or obtain real-time temperature measurements of the fluid as it flows through the container.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some instances, the process inserts vibrate in response to turbulence or vortices that form as a result of passing the high velocity fluid over and/or around the insert. Such vibrations can have adverse effects on the ability to obtain a dynamic fluid sample or accurate measurements using the instruments housed in the process inserts. Moreover, prolonged vibration of the process inserts can cause the inserts to oscillate, experience fatigue and/or cracking, detach from the container, and/or, in some instances, fail.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, and in view of the problems described above, a need exists for improved process inserts and assemblies having an improved resistance to velocity induced vibration.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Process inserts, assemblies, and related methods are set forth herein. Such inserts and assemblies can attach to containers having a high velocity fluid flowing therethrough, and be used to support or attach instruments that measure or sample the fluid, or instruments that inject material into the fluid. The process inserts, assemblies, and methods described herein advantageously support the formation of flanged and threaded connections that respectively seal the fluid in the container or insert and provide a point of support at the exterior surface of the fluid-containing container, which allows an unsupported length of the insert disposed within the container to be reduced. Reducing the unsupported length of the insert within the container improves the mechanical integrity of the insert and, thus, renders the insert less prone to damage caused by velocity induced vibration.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some aspects, the process inserts described herein comprise a head having a cavity disposed therein for receiving an instrument. Such inserts further comprise a shank having an elongated body with a first end disposed adjacent or proximate to the head, a free end opposite the first end, and a threaded portion spaced apart from each of the first and free ends. The cavity can extend through a portion of the elongated body.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The threaded portion of the shank comprises a non-locking thread, such as a straight or non-tapered thread. The threaded portion may be located closer to the free end than the first end, or vice versa. In certain embodiments, the threaded portion is disposed on less than one-half of the elongated body. For example, approximately one-half of the elongated body can be disposed on a first side of the threaded portion and approximately one-quarter of the elongated body can be disposed on a second side of the threaded portion. Alternatively, the threaded portion may be disposed on more than one-half of the elongated body.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The process inserts described herein therefor can comprise a head having a cavity disposed therein for receiving an instrument, and a shank having a threaded portion spaced apart from each of the first and free ends. The process inserts can in some instances further comprise a flange configured to form a seal, such as a pressure containing seal. The seal can be formed between the process insert and a container to which the process insert can be attached. In some instances a plurality of flanges can form a seal between the process insert and a container. The flange or plurality of flanges can be any type of flange or have any flange design capable of forming a seal. For example, in some cases, a flange is or comprises a Van Stone-type flange, raised face flange, flat face flange, ring joint flange, or a tongue and groove flange. Additionally, when a plurality of flanges are used, such as a first flange and a second flange, the plurality of flanges are complementary in flange-type to each other. As understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, complementary flanges need not be the same type of flange, provided that the complementary flanges can be joined together to form a seal. Complementary flanges can be of the same type or different types. Moreover, one or more flanges of a process insert or system described herein can be used to form a seal in conjunction with one or more other components, such as a hub, washer, or o-ring.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, for example, process inserts described herein can comprise a hub disposed between the head and the shank of the insert, wherein the hub is configured to form a lap or lapped joint, such as with a flange member or plurality of flange members. The hub can extend radially outward from the process insert and have a diameter greater than a diameter of the head or shank.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, and in some embodiments, a first flange member is disposed on a first side of the hub and a second flange member is disposed on a second side of the hub, where the first side is a shank facing side and the second side is a head facing side of the hub. The first flange member or the second flange member can optionally comprise a Van Stone-type flange, raised face flange, flat face flange, ring joint flange, or a tongue and groove flange.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the hub itself comprises or forms an integral flange, and a first flange member is disposed on a first side of the integral flange. The &#x201c;integral&#x201d; flange can be integrally formed from the process insert such that the integral flange is part of a unitary structure of the process insert (such as may be obtaining by forming the integral flange from the same material as the remainder of the process insert during manufacture of the process insert through a turning process). Alternatively, the &#x201c;integral&#x201d; flange can be a separately formed component that is attached or coupled to the process insert through welding, soldering, brazing, frictional engagement, threaded engagement, bonding, or any other type of joining process consistent with this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, a plurality of bolts can be disposed through portions of a first flange member, second flange member, or integral flange described herein for forming a pressure containing seal that prevents the fluid from breaching the container and/or the insert. The pressure containing seal is a pressure rated seal, in certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, the elongated body of a process insert described herein can comprise a straight body, a stepped body, or a tapered body. For example, and in certain embodiments, the elongated body comprises a first body portion having a first diameter and a second body portion having a second diameter that is less than the first diameter. The threaded portion can be disposed on the first body portion or the second body portion. In certain embodiments, the first body portion abuts the second body portion, and the threaded portion is disposed adjacent to the where the first body portion meets the second body portion. The first and second body portions can be non-tapered or tapered.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cavity formed in the head of the process inserts described herein can extend only partially through the shank or entirely through the shank. Various instruments can be fully or partially positioned and disposed in the cavity. For example, such instruments may include a sensor, probe, or sensor attaching device. Such sensors, where used, may include temperature sensors such as thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), bimetal Gauges, thermometers, or gas actuated thermometers. Other sensors and/or temperature sensors may be provided, including, without limitation, pressure sensors, leak detection sensors, velocity sensors, or any other type of sensor not inconsistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments, the process inserts set forth herein are thermowells, protection tubes, sampling probes, and/or injection quills. In some cases, the thermowell process inserts set forth herein have structures that comply with ASME standards, including ASME PTC 19.3 TW, and specifically ASME PTC 19.3 TW 2016. Alternatively, process inserts comprising thermowells having dimensions that do not fall within the scope of ASME PTC 19.3 TW are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The process inserts described herein can be attached or connected to a container which can comprise, without limitation, any one of a duct, a pipe, a vessel, a conduit, or a tank. Such containers include one or more outer walls that define or enclose an interior volume. A free end of the process insert shank can be positioned or disposed in the interior volume of the container, and the first end of the shank can be positioned or disposed outside of the interior volume of the container. In certain embodiments, the free end of the shank is disposed at a spatial position located a distance away from the outer wall, such that a majority of the shank is outside of the container. Alternatively, a majority of the shank could be disposed inside the container.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain embodiments, the process insert shanks described herein comprises a supported length disposed adjacent to the outer wall of the container and an unsupported length positioned in the interior volume of the containers. In certain embodiments, a ratio of the supported length to the unsupported length is greater than 1. Alternatively, the ratio of the supported length to the unsupported length is less than or equal to 1.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another aspect, process insert assemblies are disclosed. Such an assembly comprises a process insert and a support. The process insert can comprise a shank, and the support can be disposed around the shank. The support further comprises a threaded region that is configured to threadingly engage the shank.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The assemblies set forth herein can further comprise a nozzle disposed between the insert and the support. Fluid can be sealed in the nozzle via the flanged connection to prevent fluid from breaching the insert. The nozzle can also support a non-threaded portion of the shank. The nozzle can optionally be nested or partially housed in the support. Alternatively, the nozzle can abut the support. In certain embodiments, the nozzle is welded to the support. Alternatively, the nozzle can frictionally or threadingly engage the support.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Notably, the support and/or nozzle, alone or combined, engage and support the shank on or over the outer wall of the container to which the insert is attached. Supporting the shank on or over the outer wall of the container improves the mechanical integrity of the insert and allows the unsupported length to be reduced.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, in some embodiments when the first flange member or the second flange member is a Van Stone flange, the nozzle can have a first end and an opposite support facing end. The first end of the nozzle can be rolled, bent, or turned outward to form a Van Stone-style face flange that is positioned, disposed, or sandwiched between the first and second flange members. The face flange of the nozzle can in some instances directly contact the first side of the hub on the process insert, or indirectly contact the first side of the hub through a washer or spacer. In embodiments where the first flange member and the integral flange form a pressure tight or pressure rated seal, the face flange of the nozzle can be positioned between the first flange member and the integral flange.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some instances, when the nozzle is or comprises a raised face flange, flat face flange, ring joint flange, or a tongue and groove flange, a first flange member can be attached to a first end of the nozzle through welding, soldering, brazing, frictional engagement, threaded engagement, bonding, or any other type of joining process.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In further aspects, methods of installing process inserts and assemblies on a container are disclosed. Such a method comprises inserting the free end of the process insert in the interior volume of the container. The method can further comprise screwing the threaded portion of the insert into a threaded portion of the container or a threaded portion of a support attached to the container, thereby threadingly engaging the insert with the container and forming a threaded attachment between the insert and the container. The threaded attachment does not form a substantially pressure containing and/or a pressure rated seal between the interior volume of the container and the exterior of the container. Rather, in many cases, the flanged connection formed at the process insert hub forms the pressure containing and/or pressure rated seal.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The method of installing an insert can further comprise forming a flanged connection between the insert and the container proximate to the hub of the insert.

The devices, assemblies, and methods described herein, however, are not limited to the specific embodiments presented in the detailed description, examples, and figures. It should be recognized that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles of the present subject matter. Numerous modifications and adaptations will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art without departing from the scope of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, all ranges disclosed herein are to be understood to encompass any and all subranges subsumed therein. For example, a stated range of &#x201c;1.0 to 10.0&#x201d; should be considered to include any and all subranges beginning with a minimum value of 1.0 or more and ending with a maximum value of 10.0 or less, e.g., 1.0 to 5.3, or 4.7 to 10.0, or 3.6 to 7.9.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">All ranges disclosed herein are also to be considered to include the end points of the range, unless expressly stated otherwise. For example, a range of &#x201c;between 5 and 10&#x201d; or &#x201c;from 5 to 10&#x201d; or &#x201c;5-10&#x201d; should generally be considered to include the end points <b>5</b> and <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, the term &#x201c;container&#x201d; refers to any structure having an interior volume formed by or between one or more surfaces of the container. Exemplary containers include, without limitation, pipes, vessels, ducts, tanks, conduits, enclosures, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;fluid&#x201d; and &#x201c;process fluid&#x201d; refer to any material or composition that is flowing through a container. Exemplary compositions are fully or partially solid-phase, liquid-phase, or gas-phase compositions, or compositions can be formed from a combination of any two or more solid, liquid, or gas phase constituents.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, the term &#x201c;process insert&#x201d; refers to a structure that is configured for full or partial insertion into a stream of a process fluid flowing through a container. Exemplary process inserts include, without limitation, sensor attaching devices, thermowells, protection tubes, sampling probes, and injection quills.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">I. Process Inserts</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one aspect, process inserts are described and disclosed herein. The process inserts set forth herein are configured for insertion in a container containing a fluid that is flowing at a high velocity through an interior volume of the container. The process inserts have a structure that facilitates the formation of flanged, pressure containing seals that are spaced apart from the outer surface of the container for improved installation, inspection, replacement, or removal of the inserts and/or instruments housed therein</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The process inserts described herein also exhibit a more robust and improved structural integrity that is bolstered, in part, by the provision of a threaded portion having a threaded support surface being supported on or over the outer surface of the container. Such inserts are also operable to facilitate improved fluid sampling, injecting, or fluid monitoring via an insert having a shortened unsupported length positioned inside the container. Reducing the unsupported length of the insert inside the container improves its ability to withstand forces or vibrations generated by the high velocity fluid as it flows around the insert. Thus, the inserts described herein may be operable for longer lifetimes and/or require less maintenance. The process inserts described herein also improve the protection and support afforded to instruments being housed therein, so that the instruments can more efficiently monitor, sample, inject, or otherwise interact with the high velocity fluid flowing through a container.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Turning now to specific components of the process inserts described herein, such inserts can comprise, consist, or consist essentially of a head, and an elongated shank having a threaded portion disposed on or over the elongated body of the shank.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the head comprises a cavity configured to receive an instrument and the shank comprises an elongated body having a first end disposed proximate to the head, a free end opposite the first end, and a threaded portion spaced apart from each of the first and free ends. In certain instances, for example, the cavity extends through portions of head and the shank. For example, and in some embodiments, the cavity only extends through a portion of the elongated body of the insert. Alternatively, the cavity can extend through the entire length of the elongated body so that the cavity is open at multiple ends of the insert for accommodating a variety of different instruments and/or fluid management applications. Various instruments, such as sensors or probes, can be positioned within or connected to the cavity for measuring, monitoring, sampling, injecting, or otherwise managing the fluid as it flows through the container.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The head of the process insert can comprise an upper body portion having an upper surface in which an opening of the cavity is defined. The head can further comprise a lower body portion or base located opposite from the upper portion. One or more outer walls of the head portion extend between and connect the upper surface and the base. The outerwall(s) are optionally formed, machined, or otherwise shaped so that the head can be engaged and manipulated via one or more tools during installation, repair, inspection, or removal of the insert, such tools comprising, for example and without limitation, grips, pincers, pliers, sockets, or wrenches.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the process inserts comprise a hub disposed between the head and the shank. The hub is in some instances configured to form a lapped joint on or over one or more flange members that form a flanged connection to seal the process fluid inside the container and/or portions of the insert (e.g., in an optional insert nozzle), thus preventing the fluid from reaching the outside environment when the process insert is coupled to the container. In other instances, the hub defines, forms, or is configured to form an integral flange that connects with a flange member to form a flanged connection to seal the process fluid inside the container and/or portions of the insert when the process insert is coupled to the container.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The hub is located or disposed proximate to the base of the head. In some cases, the hub is disposed around the circumference or perimeter of the base. The hub can also be disposed around the circumference or perimeter of the shank, in some cases, where the head meets the shank. The base of the head may terminate at the hub and/or at the shank. For example, and in some cases, the head abuts the shank and is directly adjacent to the shank, while in other cases the head abuts the hub and is directly adjacent to the hub and indirectly adjacent to the shank. In certain cases, each of the head and the shank are adjacent to the hub and abut the hub, as the hub is disposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Moreover, and in some cases, for example, the hub extends radially outward from the outer surface of the process insert to form a skirt, seat, or ledge that is larger in diameter than each of the head and the shank. The hub is configured to overlap one or more flange members for forming a lapped joint. In some cases, the one or more flange members can fittingly engage or seat against the hub, for example, and on opposing sides of the hub. The flange members can seat directly against the hub, or a spacer, such as a washer, may be positioned between the hub and one or both flange members.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some instances, the hub extends radially outward from the outer surface of the process insert to form an integrated or integral flange. In this instance, the integral flange has a diameter larger than instances where the hub forms a lapped joint between two flange members. Generally, the integral flange, when present, has a diameter corresponding in size to the flange member. The integral flange is configured to engagingly fit or seat against the flange member. The integral flange and the flange member can seat directly against each other in some cases, or, in other cases, a spacer or washer may be positioned between the integral flange and the flange member. The integral flange can comprise a plurality of fastener receiving holes distributed radially proximate to an outer circumferential edge, the particular locations of each fastener receiving hole corresponding to a complementary fastener receiving hole on the flange member to be fastened to the integral flange. The integral flange can be integrally formed form the process insert, or the integral flange can be connected to the process insert through welding, soldering, brazing, frictional engagement, threaded engagement, bonding, or any other type of joining process consistent with this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">When forming an overlapping joint, upon positioning the flange members against the hub, one or more bolts or other such fasteners can be inserted through the complementary fastener receiving holes to secure the flange members together to form a pressure containing seal. When the hub comprises, forms, or defines the integral flange, upon positioning the flange member against the integral flange, one or more bolts or other such fasteners can be inserted through the complementary fastener receiving holes to secure the flange member and integral flange together to form a pressure containing seal. The flange members can be, but do not have to be, Van Stone flange members. In some instances, the flange members are a raised face flange, flat face flange, ring joint flange, or a tongue and groove flange. Additionally, in some instances the hub can overlap portions of one or both flange members for supporting formation of the pressure containing seal between the interior and exterior of the container or insert, thereby preventing fluid from breaching the container, the insert, or both.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In certain embodiments, the pressure containing seal formed via the flange members positioned at the hub, or via the flange member connected to the integral flange, is a pressure rated seal that is approved for use at high temperatures and pressures. For example, certain flanges must be approved for use under high pressure and/or temperature conditions according to one or more widely recognized standards, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards. Depending on the material the flange is made from, such as cast iron or forged steel, and the type of connection required to attach the flange to a pipe (e.g. via a welded or threaded connection), standard class ratings are determined that set forth pressure/temperature ratings, required bolt and nut dimensions, etc. In the oil and gas industry, for example, flanges are expected to withstand high pressures, and the ANSI standards provide consumers with an assurance that the product is approved for particular applications. Accordingly, and in certain embodiments, the flanged connections described herein are ANSI B16.5 pipe flanges that are rated from Class 150 through to Class 2500 which allow for hydrostatic test pressures ranging from 400 psi (2.76 MPa) up to just under 10,000 psi (68.95 MPa). It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, however, that not all flanges fall within the scope of the ANSI standards. Thus, some of the flanges described herein are configured to meet and comply with the ANSI standards and ratings, while other flanges fall outside of the scope of having to meet the ANSI standards and ratings.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The process insert shank can extend outwardly away from the hub and terminate at a remote, distal location relative to the hub. The total length of the shank, as measured from the first end (i.e., adjacent to the hub or head) to the free end (i.e., the terminal end), can comprise any suitable length not inconsistent with the present disclosure. For example, the total length of the process insert shank, in some instances, is between about 1 and 48 inches, or any subrange thereof (e.g., 4-8 in., 5-10 in., 6-12 in., etc.). Longer or shorter shanks are also contemplated. Other exemplary shank lengths are provided in Table 1 below.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Total Length of Shank,</entry></row><row><entry>in inches (in.)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x3e;2 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry>&#x3e;10 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry>&#x3e;12 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry>&#x3e;24 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry>4-16 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry>6-48 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">The process inserts shanks described herein comprise a threaded portion, defining a threaded support surface that is disposed on or over the elongated shank body. The threaded portion is spaced at least some distance apart from each of the first and free ends and, in some cases, is disposed over an intermediate portion of the elongated shank body that is disposed between and/or bounded by the first and free ends. For example, in certain cases the threaded portion is spaced at least 0.2 inches apart from each of the first and second free ends, or any distance greater than 0.2 inches not inconsistent with the instant disclosure (e.g., 0.5 in., 0.8 in., 1 in., 2 in., etc.). As noted above, the threaded portion can be spaced equal distances away from the first and free ends (i.e., a centrally disposed threaded portion) or unequal distances from the first and free ends (i.e., a non-centrally disposed threaded portion).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">Further, and in some instances, a first portion of the shank is disposed on a first side of the threaded portion, between the first end of the shank and the initial thread of the threaded portion, the initial thread being the closest thread to the hub. A second portion of the shank can be disposed on a second side of the threaded portion, on the free end side of the body. In certain cases, the threaded portion is a non-locking thread, such as a straight or non-tapered thread. The threaded portion of the process insert is configured to threadingly engage a threaded support or a threaded region of the container to which the insert attaches for improved support and stability of the instrument disposed inside of the insert. The threaded portion provides a point of support on the insert, and is not necessarily configured to substantially seal the inside of the container from the outside of the container, or prevent fluid from breaching the container.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The threaded portion of the shank improves the stability and support of the insert via threaded engagement to a matching thread of the support or wall of the container, which allows for a reduction in the unsupported length of the shank. For example, portions of the shank disposed below the final thread of the threaded portion, the final thread being the most distal from the hub, including portions of the shank that extend between the final thread and the free end of the shank define the &#x201c;unsupported length&#x201d; of the shank and insert. The unsupported length of the shank is the portion of the insert that is inserted in the interior volume of the container and positioned in the path of the fluid. The remainder of the shank can be supported outside of the container.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">In certain instances, the ratio of the supported length of the shank to the unsupported length of the shank for the process inserts described herein is greater than 1. Alternatively, the ratio of the supported length of the shank to the unsupported length of the shank can be less than 1. The unsupported length of the shank, in some cases, is between about 0.5 and 24 inches, or any subrange thereof (e.g., 1-6 in., 2-6 in., 4-8 in., etc.). However, the unsupported length of the shank can comprise any length not inconsistent with the present disclosure. Other exemplary lengths are provided in Table 2 below.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Unsupported Length of Shank,</entry></row><row><entry>in inches (in.)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x3e;0.5 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry>&#x3e;2 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry>&#x3e;4 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry>&#x3e;12 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry>2-16 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry>4-24 </entry><entry>in.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">Still referring to the process insert shank, and in some cases, the threaded portion of the shank is located closer to the free end of the shank than the first end of the shank, such that the unsupported length is reduced. However, it may be desirable in other embodiments to position the threaded portion of the shank closer to the first end of the shank. Any placement of the threaded portion on, over, or relative to the elongated body of the shank, not inconsistent with the present application, is contemplated. For example, in certain embodiments, the thread is centrally located between the first end of the shank and the free end of the shank.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">In an exemplary embodiment, approximately one-half of the elongated body is disposed on a first side of the threaded portion, approximately one-quarter of the elongated body is disposed on a second side of the threaded portion, and the thread extends over approximately one-quarter of the elongated body. However, the threaded portion can occupy any spatial location and length of the shank not inconsistent with the present disclosure. In another exemplary embodiment, approximately one-third of the elongated body is disposed on a first side of the threaded portion, approximately one-third of the elongated body is disposed on a second side of the threaded portion, and the thread extends over approximately one-third of the elongated body. The threaded portion can be disposed on less than one-half of the total length of the shank or more than one-half of the total length of the shank. Any length and location of the threaded portion over the shank, not inconsistent with the present disclosure, are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">The shank can further comprise any size of diameter not inconsistent with the present disclosure. For example, the shank can comprise a diameter of between about 0.25 and 6 inches, or any subrange thereof (e.g., 1-2 in., 1-6 in., 2-4 in., etc.). The shank diameter can be substantially uniform along its entire length. Alternatively, the shank diameter can vary along its entire length between the first end and the free end. For example, in certain cases, the first end comprises a larger diameter than the free end. In other embodiments, the threaded portion comprises a larger diameter than the first and free ends. In further embodiments, the shank, or any portion thereof, comprise a tapered diameter. The shank can comprise a substantially uniform diameter, a non-uniform (i.e., variable) diameter, or a tapered diameter, where desired. Where the diameter varies, it may optionally assume a stepped configuration, in which a larger diameter section abuts and/or forms a step against a smaller diameter section. Any shank shape or configuration not inconsistent with the present disclosure can be provided.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">Referring now to the cavity being formed through the process insert, and in certain embodiments, the cavity is an elongated cavity that extends in an elongated direction along an elongated axis of the process insert. The elongated axis can bisect the insert in the longitudinal direction corresponding to the elongated length of the shank. One or more instruments, such as one or more sensors or probes, are then positioned in the cavity. The cavity can be centrally or non-centrally disposed through portions of the head and the shank. Other cavity shapes, such as non-elongated shapes area also contemplated. The cavity can comprise a substantially circular sectional shape, a non-circular sectional shape, or any other sectional shape not inconsistent with the present disclosure</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">In some embodiments, for example, where the cavity does not extend the full length of the shank, the cavity can house or support a sensor. Exemplary sensors include, without limitation, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, velocity sensors, humidity sensors, leak sensors, or any other type of sensor not inconsistent with the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, the sensor disposed in the process insert cavity is a temperature sensor including, without limitation, a thermocouple, a resistance temperature detector (RTD), a bimetal Gauge, or a thermometer.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">In further embodiments, for example, where the cavity does extend through the entire length of the shank, the cavity can be connected to a sampling instrument or injection device to function as a sampling probe or an injection quill. The cavity can include openings at the process insert head and free end for allowing the sampling probe or injection quill to respectively extract a fluid sample or inject a material into the fluid passing through the container. Any other type of probe or instrument not inconsistent with the present disclosure may be positioned within the insert cavity for interacting with and/or managing the flow of fluid through the container.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">Notably, as described in reference to the hub, the process insert is configured to support and/or form a flange sealed or flanged connection proximate the process insert hub. In some instances the hub forms a lapping joint with one or more flange members to form a pressure containing seal that prevents the fluid from breaching the container or insert. In some embodiments with the overlapping joint, a first flange member is disposed on a first side of the hub and a second flange member disposed on a second side of the hub, where the first side is a shank facing side and the second side is a head facing side of the hub. Each flange member can abut or seat on, over, or against the hub, directly or indirectly. The flange members can optionally comprise a Van Stone-type flange, raised face flange, flat face flange, ring joint flange, or a tongue and groove flange. One or more fasteners (e.g., screws, clips, or bolts) can be positioned through the fastener receiving holes of the flange members and compressively draw the flange members towards and against each other to form a pressure containing seal. The pressure containing seal can prevent fluid from breaching the container as well as an optional nozzle that surrounds portions of the insert. The first flange member can be optionally attached to an end of the nozzle by welding, soldering, brazing, frictional engagement, threaded engagement, bonding, or any other type of joining process consistent with this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">In some instances, the hub itself forms the integral flange and contacts the flange member to form a pressure containing seal that prevents the fluid from breaching the container or insert. In the embodiments with the integral flange, a first flange member is disposed on a first side of the integral flange, and the first flange member abuts or seats on, over, or against the first side of the integral flange, either directly or indirectly. For purposes of orientation, the first side is a shank facing side and the second side is a head facing side of the integral flange. As described for the overlapping joint embodiment, the first flange member can optionally be a Van Stone-type flange, raised face flange, flat face flange, ring joint flange, or a tongue and groove flange, and one or more fasteners can compressively draw the flange member and the integral flange together to from a pressure containing seal. In some preferred embodiments, the first flange member is a raised face flange. Moreover, the first flange member can optionally be connected to the nozzle via welding, soldering, brazing, frictional engagement, threaded engagement, bonding, or any other type of joining process consistent with this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">The inserts described herein can comprise any type of insert not inconsistent with this disclosure. Such inserts house, support, or attach instruments configured to test, inject, sample, monitor, or manage the high velocity fluid passing through a container. In some embodiments, the process insert is a sensor attaching device that facilitates support and attachment of one or more sensors to the container. In other embodiments, the process insert is a thermowell having an overall structure that complies with ASME PTC 19.3 TW 2016 standard. In further embodiments, the process insert is a protection tube, a sampling probe, an injection quill, or a thermowell falling outside of the scope of ASME PTC 19.3 TW 2016 standard.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">The process inserts described herein can be attached or connected to a container comprising an outer wall enclosing an interior volume. The free end of the process insert shank is positioned in the interior volume of the container and the first end of the shank is positioned outside of the interior volume and a distance away from the outer wall. Exemplary containers include, without limitation, pipes, vessels, ducts, conduits, or tanks.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">The process inserts described herein can have any combination of properties or features described herein not inconsistent with the objectives of this disclosure. Numerous modifications and adaptations thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the subject matter.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">II. Process Insert Assemblies</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0070">In a further aspect, process insert assemblies are disclosed. The assemblies described herein improve the amount of support being provided to process inserts and facilitate the formation of a threaded attachment between the insert and the container. Improving the degree of support bestowed to the process inserts allows for improved fluid monitoring and management using the instruments disposed in the inserts, in part, by improving the structural integrity of the inserts.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">The process insert assemblies described herein comprise, consist, or consist essentially of a process insert and a support. The process insert has a shank and the support can be fully or partially disposed around the shank. In certain cases, the support is a threaded support having a threaded region configured to threadingly engage the threaded portion of the shank. The process insert can comprise, for example, and in some embodiments, any of the process inserts described hereinabove in Section I. However, any other type of process insert not inconsistent with the present disclosure can also be provided, so long as the support can threadingly engage and support the insert.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">In some cases, the support is formed from a body of metallic material that can be disposed on or over a container. Non-metallic supports being formed from plastics, composites, or other materials are also contemplated. The supports can be discrete, standalone components or integrally formed with a container to which the insert will be connected. The support can, but does not have to, include a lower surface that is contoured to match the outer surface geometry of the container to which it will attach. For example, where the container is a pipe or vessel having a curved outer surface, the lower surface of the support can likewise have a contoured surface that matches or substantially matches the curvature of the container's outer surface.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">Further, in some cases, the support comprises an annular shaped body having a bore extending through the center of the body. A portion of the bore forms an inner support surface that supports the shank. The inner support surface is machined or otherwise formed with an inner thread. The inner thread of the support matches the outer thread of the threaded portion of the shank, so that the two threaded surfaces can threadingly engage upon inserting the shank through the bore and rotating, screwing, or otherwise manipulating the insert so that the threaded shank threads with the threaded bore. The process insert and support can collectively form a process insert assembly, which can be supported on or over the exterior surface of a given container that contains a high velocity fluid.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">The threaded portion of the process insert shank and the threaded region of the support are configured to engage to form a substantially non-locking threaded joint. That is, the threaded portion of the process insert shank and the threaded region of the support each comprise a machined thread that is substantially straight and non-tapered. Therefore, the non-locking threaded joint does not substantially seal the fluid inside the container, and some portion of the fluid may breach the joint and partially extend through a nozzle being attached to the support and/or insert. The fluid can be sealed in the container and nozzle via the flanged connection formed at the hub as described in Section I above.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075">For example, and in certain embodiments, an optional nozzle is provided and disposed between the insert and the support. The nozzle is configured to at least partially enclose the process insert shank and support one or more non-threaded portions of the shank. The nozzle can be partially nested in the bored portion of the support. Alternatively, the nozzle can abut the support and not substantially overlap the bore. The nozzle may be attached to the support and/or the process insert shank via welding, soldering, brazing, frictional engagement, threaded engagement, bonding, or any other type of joining process consistent with this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0076">One or more process assemblies can be connected to a container that comprises, consists, or consists essentially of an outer wall enclosing an interior volume. Each assembly includes a support configured to engage and support the process insert shank on or over the outer wall of the container. The support can directly contact the container or be spaced apart therefrom via one or more spacers, mats, seals, or grips. Containers incorporating such process insert assemblies can include pipes, ducts, vessels, tanks, conduits, or any other type of container enclosing a high velocity fluid.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0077">The process insert assemblies described herein can have any combination of properties or features described herein not inconsistent with the objectives of the present disclosure. Numerous modifications and adaptations thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">III. Methods of Installing Process Inserts</heading><p id="p-0081" num="0078">In further aspects, methods of installing process inserts are disclosed. The process inserts and/or assemblies being installed on or over a container may include any of the inserts and assemblies described in Sections I and II above.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">The method of installing a process insert to a container comprises inserting the free end of the insert in the interior volume of the container. The free end and portion of the insert being positioned inside the container forms the unsupported length, which corresponds to the portion of the shank that is distal from the hub and threaded portion. The remainder of the process insert can be supported outside of the container.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">The installation method can further comprise, for example, rotating, threading, engaging, or screwing the threaded portion of the insert against or into the threaded region or portion of the container or the threaded region or portion of a support attached to the container. Screwing the threaded portion of the insert into the threaded portion of the container or support facilitates formation of a threaded engagement between the insert and the container and a threaded attachment between the insert and the container.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">As noted above, the threaded portion of the support and the threaded portion of the process insert can comprise non-locking, machine threads. Thus, the threaded attachment does not form a substantially pressure containing and/or a pressure rated seal between the interior volume of the container and the exterior of the container. The fluid can be sealed in the container via a flanged connection or seal positioned at the process insert hub.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">The installation method can further comprise forming a flanged connection between the insert and the container proximate to the hub or with the hub of the process insert. In some instances, forming the flanged connection can comprise inserting the process insert through a first flange member, inserting a second flange member over the insert, and seating the second flange member insert over the hub. In other instances, forming the flanged connection can comprise inserting the process insert through a first flange member and seating the first flange member directly or indirectly against an integral flange formed by the hub. The first flange member and integral flange are then joined via one or more fasteners and tightened together. Notably, the flange members or flange member and integral flange can form a pressure rated seal at the hub that complies with ANSI standards, where desired, between the interior volume of the container and the exterior of the container. Non-pressure rated seals are also contemplated, for lower pressure and/or lower temperature applications that fall outside of the ANSI standards.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">The installation method can comprise threading the insert directly to the container, for example, in cases where the container has a threaded opening, or alternatively, threading the insert directly to the support being positioned over the container surface. The support can be attached or joined to the container via welding, soldering, brazing, bonding, threaded engagement, or any other type of joining process consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">Further, and in some cases, the method of installing the process insert to the container further comprises inserting an instrument into the cavity of the insert. Such instrument can comprise, for example and without limitation, a probe, a sensor, a temperature sensor, a sampling attachment instrument, or an injection attachment device.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">The methods described herein can have any combination of components or steps described herein not inconsistent with the objectives of this disclosure. Numerous modifications and adaptations thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">IV. Methods of Using Process Inserts</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0086">In further aspects, methods of using process inserts and assemblies are disclosed. In one embodiment, a method of measuring the temperature of a fluid flowing through a container is disclosed. The method can comprise inserting the free end of a process insert in the interior volume of the container. The process insert being inserted in the container may be any of the inserts described in Section I above. In certain embodiments, for example, where the temperature of the fluid is measured, the process insert comprises a thermowell. The thermowell can be inserted in a container such as a pipe, duct, vessel, conduit, or tank. The thermowell can have an overall structure that complies with the ASME PTC 19.3 TW standard, or the thermowell may fall outside of the ASME PTC 19.3 TW standard.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">The method of measuring the temperature of a fluid flowing through the container can further comprise inserting a temperature sensor into the cavity of the insert and measuring the temperature of the fluid using the temperature sensor. The temperature sensor may include, without limitation, a RTD, bimetal Gauge, or thermometer, such as a gas actuated thermometer. Any other type of temperature sensor not inconsistent with the present disclosure is also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">According to a further embodiment, a method of sampling a fluid flowing through a container is disclosed. The method comprises inserting the free end of the process insert into the interior volume of the container. In this embodiment, for example, where the fluid is being sampled, the insert comprises a sampling probe. The method can further comprise extracting a fluid sample from the interior volume of the container through the cavity of the insert.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">According to yet a further embodiment, a method of injecting a material into a fluid flowing through a container is disclosed. The method comprises insert the free end of the process insert into the interior volume of the container. In this embodiment, for example, where the fluid is being injected, the process insert is an injection quill. The method can further comprise injecting the material into the fluid flowing through the container through the cavity of the insert. The material being injected may include, without limitation, a liquid, a gas, a corrosion inhibiting material, or any other material not inconsistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">The methods described herein can have any combination of components or steps described herein not inconsistent with the objectives of the present disclosure.

The hub <b>15</b> can have a larger diameter than the head <b>12</b> and the shank <b>16</b> for supporting and/or engaging one or more flange members (e.g., <b>90</b>A, <b>90</b>B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). The hub <b>15</b> can overlap at least one of the flange members (not shown) to form a lapped joint with the overlapped flange member. In some cases, the hub <b>15</b> can, but does not have to, overlap each of the flange members for forming a lapped joint with each flange member. The hub <b>15</b> is configured to form and/or support the formation of a pressure containing seal via the flanged connection or other pressure containing clamp style arrangement, which is optionally a pressure rated seal. For example, and in some cases, first and second flange members are seated on or over a respective first face ISA and a second face <b>15</b>B of the hub <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">The process insert shank <b>16</b> is elongated and comprises a first end <b>18</b>A and a free end <b>18</b>B opposite the first end.

Similarly, the hub <b>15</b> can surround portions of the head <b>12</b> and/or shank <b>16</b>. The shank <b>16</b> can comprise one or more non-threaded portions and one or more threaded portions. For example, a threaded portion <b>19</b> of the shank can be disposed between the first and free ends <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B.

In this exemplary embodiment, the container <b>140</b> is a pipe. The hub is an integral flange <b>202</b> configured to be tightened together with the first flange member <b>90</b>A to form a flanged connection (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> for an exemplary connection).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0121">The integral flange <b>202</b> is positioned between the shank <b>106</b> and the head <b>102</b>, and radially extends outward from a surface of the process insert <b>201</b>. The integral flange <b>202</b> can be integrally formed from the process insert <b>201</b>, or can be a separate flange piece that has been attached to the process insert <b>201</b> through welding, soldering, brazing, frictional engagement, threaded engagement, bonding, or any other type of joining process consistent with this disclosure. A plurality of fastener receiving holes <b>94</b> are distributed radially, proximate to an outer circumferential edge of the integral flange <b>202</b>, and extend through the integral flange <b>202</b>. The fastener receiving holes <b>94</b> are configured to receive one or more fasteners (e.g., bolts, <b>154</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>), which can be tightened against the first flanged member <b>90</b>A and the integral flange <b>202</b>, applying a compressive force that pushes the first flanged member <b>90</b>A and the integral flange <b>202</b> together, forming a flanged connection to seal the fluid in the container <b>140</b>. The first flange member <b>90</b>A can optionally be a Van Stone-type flange. In some instances, the first flange member <b>90</b>A can be a raised face flange, flat face flange, ring joint flange, or a tongue and groove flange. In some preferred embodiments, the first flange member <b>90</b>A is a raised face flange. Pressure containing clamp style seals are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0122">In instances where the first flange member <b>90</b>A is a Van Stone-type flange, the nozzle <b>120</b> can have a first end (e.g., the end facing the integral flange <b>202</b>, opposite a support facing end) that is rolled, bent, or turned outward to form a Van Stone-style face flange commonly known to the skilled artisan for Van Stone-style flange connections. This face flange is positioned (e.g., sandwiched) between the first flange member <b>90</b>A and the integral flange <b>202</b> to form a seal there between. In some instances, the face flange can be a separate component welded or otherwise bonded to the first end of the nozzle <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">When the first flange member <b>90</b>A is a raised face flange, flat face flange, ring joint flange, or a tongue and groove flange, the first flange member <b>90</b>A can be attached to the first end of the nozzle <b>120</b> through welding, soldering, brazing, frictional engagement, threaded engagement, bonding, or any other type of joining process consistent with this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124">The inserts and assemblies illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> can have any combination of features or components as described in Sections I and II above, and are not limited to the exemplary embodiments being shown.
