One challenge in the field of minimally invasive surgeries such as endoscopy, laparoscopy, and thoracoscopy, among other surgical procedures, is associated with providing control of multiple medical devices with respect to an access and manipulation of such devices during a procedure. Placement of such medical devices within a patient may be difficult. Additionally, maintaining a desired position of a device after placement without requiring continued manual control of the device is unreliable. The limitations on medical devices that facilitate access of other devices into a patient for placement may prolong the procedure, limit its effectiveness, and/or cause injury to the patient due to device failure or breakage. There is a need for devices and methods that address one or more of these difficulties or other related problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of the disclosure relate to, among other things, systems, devices, and methods for accessing a target treatment site with a medical apparatus fixed relative to the target treatment site, among other aspects. Each of the aspects disclosed herein may include one or more of the features described in connection with any of the other disclosed aspects.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an example, a medical device includes a shaft having a proximal end and a distal end, the shaft defining a lumen extending from the proximal end of the shaft to an opening on a side of the shaft. The medical device includes a grasping tool proximate to the distal end of the shaft and configured to fix the distal end relative to a target site. The medical device includes a lock at the proximal end of the shaft and configured to fix the proximal end to an ancillary device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Any of the medical devices described herein may have any of the following features. The lock includes a threaded portion and an anchor nut coupled to the threaded portion. The anchor nut is rotatable and translatable relative to the threaded portion. The anchor nut is configured to engage the ancillary device and secure the shaft to the ancillary device in response to the anchor nut moving along the threaded portion toward the ancillary device. The medical device may include a valve at the proximal end of the shaft and configured to inhibit passage of fluid and/or gas from insufflation through the lumen from the opening to the proximal end. The valve is configured to allow passage of one or more devices through the lumen from the proximal end of the shaft to the opening of the shaft. The medical device may include a fastening device at the proximal end of the shaft and configured to fasten the one or more devices to the shaft. The opening is side-facing and proximal of the grasping tool. The shaft is rigid. The ancillary device includes a trocar or a port such that the lock is configured to fix the proximal end of the shaft to the trocar or the port. The grasping tool includes a clamp, and the medical device further comprises a handle at the proximal end of the shaft and configured to selectively actuate the grasping tool.

The medical device includes a grasping tool at the distal end of the shaft distal of the side opening and configured to engage a first object to fix the shaft to the first object. The medical device includes a lock at the proximal end of the shaft distal of the proximal opening, wherein the lock is configured to engage a second object to fix the shaft to the second object.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Any of the medical devices described herein may have any of the following features. The lock includes a threaded portion and an anchor nut configured to translate along the threaded portion in response to rotating about the threaded portion. The lock engages the second object when the anchor nut moves along the threaded portion and abuts against the second object. The medical device may include a fastening device and a valve at the proximal end of the shaft. The fastening device is configured to securely fasten the one or more devices to the shaft and the valve is configured to inhibit passage of fluid or gas through the lumen from the distal opening to the proximal opening of the shaft; and allow passage of one or more devices through the lumen from the proximal opening to the distal opening of the shaft.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another example, a method of securing a medical device to a target site, with the medical device including a shaft defining a lumen that extends between a proximal end of the shaft and a distal end of the shaft, includes inserting the shaft through an ancillary device to position the distal end of the shaft adjacent to the target site. The method includes actuating a grasping tool at the distal end of the shaft to fix the distal end to the target site, actuating a lock at the proximal end of the shaft to fix the proximal end to the ancillary device, and inserting a device through the lumen of the shaft at an opening on a side of the distal end of the shaft such that the device is positioned at the target site.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Any of the methods described herein may have any of the following features or steps.

The shaft <b>102</b> is formed of a rigid material (e.g. plastic) and, in at least some embodiments, is straight without bends. Although not shown, it should be appreciated that in some embodiments the shaft <b>102</b> may include a bend along a longitudinal length between the proximal end <b>106</b> and the distal end <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, shaft <b>102</b> may be formed of a flexible material such that shaft <b>102</b> may be configured to selectively bend at various locations along a longitudinal length of shaft <b>102</b>.
