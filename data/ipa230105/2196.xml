The elevator car can thus be moved in such a way that it can be positioned at individual shaft doors such that access from the elevator car to the floor associated with the individual shaft door is provided. The control of the elevator system, in particular for the mobility of the elevator car is required. In addition, such a control unit can contain interfaces and input modules which are necessary for servicing the elevator system and for diagnostics.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This control unit can advantageously be arranged such that servicing of the elevator system or the control unit can be carried out easily. Therefore, it is advantageous to arrange the control unit in a door frame of such a shaft door. Such a door frame is usually formed by a door lintel and a door post formed on each side of the door opening. To accommodate the control unit, the interior of one of these two door posts can form a chamber which is delimited by side walls of the door post.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">EP1518815 discloses such a door post which is formed having a chamber. A control unit is arranged in this chamber. The control unit itself is not visible when the elevator system is in normal operation. Access to the control unit is required for service or maintenance work. On the one hand, the control unit must be accessible for service work on the elevator system. The control unit must be visible in this state and it must be possible to carry out the activities required to service the elevator system, such as initializing travel commands, requesting status information or actuating switches. On the other hand, if more extensive maintenance work is required, such as the replacement of components of the control unit, an appropriately extended degree of accessibility must be ensured. The difference between service and maintenance work is that servicing requires limited access to the control unit and does not require a large amount of space. In contrast, parts may have to be replaced as part of the maintenance of the control unit, for which a correspondingly large access space is necessary.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The interior of the chamber and thus the control unit for carrying out service work can be accessed from the floor. A further opening in the door post is arranged such that maintenance can be carried out on the control unit from inside the elevator shaft. It is therefore necessary for the service technician to be in front of this opening to carry out maintenance of the control unit. This can be achieved by placing the roof of the elevator car directly below this opening so that the service technician can carry out this maintenance from the roof of the elevator car.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, the disadvantage is that the elevator car has to be arranged in the elevator shaft in such a way that the roof of the elevator car can be used as a work platform for maintenance of the control unit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The problem addressed by the invention is therefore that of providing a door frame which allows improved access to a control unit which can be arranged in the door frame.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The problem is solved by means of a door frame of an elevator system having an elevator shaft, the door frame forming a chamber for accommodating a control unit and forming a side surface facing the elevator shaft, the door frame having a first door frame element delimiting the chamber and a second door frame element delimiting the chamber, wherein the first door frame element can be detached from the second door frame element substantially by a movement of the first door frame element, from its closed position, in parallel with the side surface, and the chamber can thus be opened. The problem is also solved by means of an elevator system comprising such a door frame.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The elevator system preferably has a building wall, in which building wall a shaft door of the elevator system is formed. The side surface facing the elevator shaft is preferably formed in parallel with this building wall.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such a door frame usually comprises a door lintel and two door posts, the door lintel being arranged above a door opening which is usually delimited laterally and at the top by the door frame. A first of these door posts is arranged to the side of the door opening, and a second of the two door posts is arranged on the other side of the door opening. Such a door post or door lintel usually has two walls which are arranged at an angle to one another and which face the floor, with one of these walls usually forming a direct closure of the door opening. In addition, the door lintel or door post has the side surface mentioned, which is arranged in parallel with the door opening, i.e. substantially in parallel with at least one door leaf closing the door opening.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The parallel of the side surface of the door frame that is in the closed state forms a part of the door frame that cannot be accessed from the floor when the shaft door is closed, since this side surface directly faces the elevator shaft. The side surface is not necessarily designed as a closed wall of the door frame, but optionally comprises only webs, profile elements or the like that stabilize the door frame or the corresponding door frame element. Optionally, the side surface can include a part of the second door frame element and a part of the first door frame element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention is based on the knowledge that access to the mechanism for fixing the door frame elements which delimit the chamber is crucial in order to allow maintenance to be carried out on the control unit quickly and easily. Accordingly, if the control unit is arranged in a door post or door lintel of the car door, positioning the elevator car at the floor so that an interior of the elevator car can be accessed from this floor is a way of significantly simplifying maintenance. If, on the other hand, the control unit is arranged in the door post of the shaft door, it is preferably possible to carry out the maintenance of the control unit with the shaft door closed, irrespective of the position of the elevator car.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A prerequisite for this is, on the one hand, that the first door frame element to be removed for maintenance can be removed independently of the position of the elevator car that is movably arranged in the elevator shaft. On the other hand, it is necessary that this first door frame element to be removed or the opening in the door frame resulting from the removal of the first door frame element is designed to be sufficiently large for carrying out maintenance of the control unit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to achieve removability of the first door frame element when the elevator car is present at the floor, for example, the removable first door frame element is thus proposed, which first door frame element can preferably be moved out of its closed position, i.e. its position closing the chamber, solely by a movement of the first door frame element directed in parallel with the above-mentioned side wall.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a development of the door frame, the first door frame element has a fixing region parallel to the side surface and the second door frame element has a fixing region parallel to the side surface, and the fixing regions of the first door frame element and the second door frame element can be fixed directly to one another by means of a detachable fixing. By means of such a fixing, the first and the second door frame element can be fixed to one another directly adjacent to the interior of the elevator shaft. By detaching this fixing and removing the first door frame element in such a way that part of the side surface of the first door frame element that adjoins an interior of the elevator shaft can also be removed, the chamber containing or capable of containing the control unit can be accessed for the purpose of maintenance of the control unit.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A development of the fixing is formed by a screw connection. By means of such a screw connection, which interconnects the fixing regions of the first and the second door frame element in the closed position of the first door frame element, a connection which can be easily detached by the service or maintenance technician from inside the chamber is made possible.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a development of the door frame, a slot-shaped open threaded pin receptacle is or can be arranged on a first of the first and second door frame elements and a threaded pin is or can be arranged on the second of the two door frame elements in such a way that the first element can be fixed to the second door frame element by means of a screw nut. Such a threaded pin can be fixed to the first or second door frame element or formed by a screw so that detachment of such a screw connection can take place preferably manually from the interior of the chamber containing the control unit. When the screw connection is loosened, the slot-shaped open threaded pin receptacle allows the first door frame element to be moved from its closed position without requiring a relative movement of the first and second door frame elements in the main orientation of the threaded pin.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The screw nut can be formed by a wing nut. The connection which can be detached in the interior of the chamber by means of a screw nut allows the first door frame element to be removed easily, since no tools are required to detach this fixing if the chamber can be accessed beforehand.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A main extension direction of the threaded pin preferably extends substantially perpendicularly to the side surface. This allows good access for detaching the screw nut in the interior of the chamber.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a development of the door frame, the detachable fixing of the first door frame element to the second door frame element can be detached by reaching into an interior of the chamber. This detachability of the fixing makes it possible for the elevator car to be arranged directly at the door post of the shaft door or for the shaft door to be closed when the first door frame element is removed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The door frame preferably comprises a further fixing option for fixing the first door frame element in its closed position. Alternatively, in addition to the detachable fixing of the first door frame element, a device for supporting the first door frame element on the second door frame element may be provided to ensure a secure hold of the first door frame element in its closed position.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A development of the door frame comprises a third door frame element which delimits the chamber and is designed in such a way that the chamber can be accessed when the third door frame element is in an open position for detaching the first door frame element from the second door frame element, with the chamber preferably being accessible for servicing the control unit when the third door frame element is in the open position. On the one hand, removing the third door frame element makes it possible to carry out service work on the control unit. On the other hand, the ability to reach into the interior of the chamber ensured in this way makes it possible to move the first door frame element out of the closed position for the purpose of maintenance of the control unit or to be able to detach the detachable fixing of the first door frame element from the second door frame element on the side surface. For this purpose, there is an opening behind the third door frame element so that, when the third door frame element is open, the chamber for accommodating the control unit can be accessed for a service or for detaching the first door frame element.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A development of the door frame comprises a door post, which door post is intended to be arranged on the side of the door opening enclosed by the door frame, and the door post comprises the door frame elements. As a result, it is possible for the control unit which can be placed in the chamber to be arranged in its vertical height in such a way that maintenance can be carried out in a simple manner for the service technician, for example without necessarily having to carry out maintenance from a ladder.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a development of the door frame, the second door frame element is an integral part of the door post. Accordingly, the second door frame element is firmly fixed and cannot be removed for maintenance or servicing of the control unit.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a development of the door frame, the first door frame element is formed by a corner element of the door frame. This means that the first door frame element preferably has an angled portion which is aligned in parallel with the side closure of the element and is preferably formed by an angle of 70&#xb0; to 110&#xb0;, preferably 90&#xb0;, to form the corner element. Such an angled portion causes increased stability of the door frame element formed in this way such that the first door frame element does not have to have any additional reinforcements or reinforcement elements.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A development of the door frame is designed as a shaft door frame. In this way, maintenance of the control unit is made possible without there being a compelling need for the elevator system to be functional, i.e. for the elevator car to be in the movable state. Furthermore, it is advantageous that maintenance can be carried out entirely from the floor by means of such a door frame, preferably with the shaft door completely closed, i.e. independently of the position of the elevator car within the elevator shaft.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a development of the door frame, the side surface facing the elevator shaft comprises a part of the first door frame element and a part of the second door frame element. This ensures that the accessibility of the control unit for maintenance purposes is as great as possible. The reason for this is that the gap between the open door post or open door lintel that can be provided with the control unit and the component arranged directly thereon, for example between the shaft door post that can be provided with the control unit and the car door post that can be arranged next to this shaft door post, can be used as a space for maintenance.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a development of the door frame, the third door frame element is fixed in its closed position to the first door frame element. This allows for a simple design of the devices for fixing the first or the third door frame element in their closed position.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an elevator system having a plurality of shaft doors;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows one of the shaft doors having a door frame;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a door post of the shaft door with an elevator car positioned at this shaft door in cross section; and</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a screw connection connecting the first and the second door frame element according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in detail.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an elevator system <b>2</b>.

The shaft door <b>18</b><i>a </i>substantially comprises a door frame <b>22</b> and at least one door leaf <b>20</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>20</b>.<b>2</b>, and the door opening can be closed and/or opened by means of the at least one door leaf <b>20</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>20</b>.<b>2</b>. The door opening is formed in a building wall <b>24</b>, with this building wall <b>24</b> usually delimiting the elevator shaft <b>4</b> on one side. The door frame <b>22</b> comprises two door posts <b>22</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>22</b>.<b>2</b> and a door lintel <b>22</b>.<b>3</b>. A first of the two door posts <b>22</b>.<b>1</b> is arranged on one side of the door opening, and the second of the door posts <b>22</b>.<b>2</b> is arranged on the other side of the door opening. The door lintel <b>22</b>.<b>3</b> is arranged above the door opening.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">One of the two door posts <b>22</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>22</b>.<b>2</b> or the door lintel <b>22</b>.<b>3</b> has a chamber for accommodating a control unit. As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that the chamber <b>26</b> is arranged within one of the door posts <b>22</b>.<b>1</b>. The door post <b>22</b>.<b>1</b> has walls <b>26</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>.<b>3</b> which delimit the chamber <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The door post <b>22</b>.<b>1</b> has a first and a second door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>0</b>, <b>28</b>.<b>1</b> which delimits the chamber <b>26</b>, and the second door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>1</b> can be formed by a plurality of door frame elements. The second door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>1</b> is formed across a corner, according to which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that a part of the second door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>1</b> is part of both a first and a second of these walls <b>26</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>26</b>.<b>3</b>. The wall <b>26</b>.<b>3</b> directly delimiting the door opening, i.e. facing the door post <b>22</b>.<b>2</b> arranged on the other side of the door opening, is arranged at a right angle to the wall <b>26</b>.<b>1</b> in the embodiment shown. The wall <b>26</b>.<b>3</b> facing the door opening thus forms a direct closure of the door opening. To carry out maintenance work, the first door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>0</b> is detachably fixed to the second door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, the door post <b>22</b>.<b>1</b> can comprise a third door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>2</b> delimiting the chamber <b>26</b>. The third door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>2</b> is designed as a service opening, so that the control unit <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) can be accessed through an opening in the door post <b>22</b>.<b>1</b> by moving the third door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>2</b> into its open position for carrying out service work to be carried out on the control unit <b>32</b>. For example, the control unit <b>32</b> can comprise an input field <b>31</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) for entering commands for this purpose. Consequently, the third door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>2</b> can have significantly smaller dimensions than the first door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>0</b> and can be limited in the extent of its length or width by the first door frame element <b>28</b>.<b>0</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The door frame elements <b>28</b>.<b>0</b>, <b>28</b>.<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which can be removed for maintenance or servicing of the control unit <b>32</b>, are shown in their closed position.
