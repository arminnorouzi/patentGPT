id="p-0051" num="0050">First, a brief description will be given of an overview of a game implemented by a game program according to a first exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the virtual space of a game, &#x201c;players' towers&#x201d; (game areas) each associated with one of a plurality of players may be present, and an individual player may be able to play the game not only in the player's tower but also in any &#x201c;other player's tower&#x201d; associated with any other player. A plurality of players of the game may be able to asynchronously play the game in a plurality of towers that are present. The term &#x201c;game in a tower&#x201d; refers to a game that encourages a player character of a player to explore the inside of the tower in a limited number of turns and defeat an enemy character that the player character encounters while acquiring items to proceed with the conquest of the tower. When the player successfully conquers floors up to the top floor of the &#x201c;player's tower&#x201d;, the player can increase the number of floors of the tower. Accordingly, each player can increase the number of floors of the &#x201c;player's tower&#x201d; (or any &#x201c;other player's tower&#x201d; for another player). Thus, even if a player conquers floors up to the top floor of any &#x201c;other player's tower&#x201d; at a certain point in time, the number of floors of the &#x201c;other player's tower&#x201d; may be larger the next time the player logs in to the game than when the player last conquered the top floor of the &#x201c;other player's tower&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the virtual space of the game, additional game areas other than the above-described towers associated with the individual players, such as a &#x201c;common tower&#x201d;, a &#x201c;battle tower&#x201d;, an &#x201c;event tower&#x201d;, and a &#x201c;quest&#x201d;, may be present. The game areas such as the towers and the quest described above may be game areas not associated with any players but managed on the server (supervisor) side, and can be visited by any players. In any of these game areas, every player aims to conquer the top floor or the bottom level by causing the player character to explore the inside. In the &#x201c;common tower&#x201d;, players can encounter and greet each other while exploring the inside, or a plurality of players are ranked according to the state of conquest of the &#x201c;common tower&#x201d;. The &#x201c;battle tower&#x201d; is a tower in which players fight against each other, and an opponent that a player character encounters in the tower may be any other player character. In addition, each player can explore a game area such as any of the towers described above together with, a duplicate of any other player character, which has been acquired by the player through a random lottery (&#x201c;gacha&#x201d;), as a companion character or the like.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The &#x201c;event tower&#x201d; is a tower related to an in-game event held for a certain period. The &#x201c;event tower&#x201d; may be a tower that appears in a predetermined condition in accordance with the progress of each player through the game, and allows the player to gain a special reward by exploring the inside. The &#x201c;quest&#x201d; may allow a player character of a player to encounter an enemy character different from that in any of the towers described above or may allow the player to gain a special reward. Furthermore, an &#x201c;achievement list&#x201d; that is a list of items achievable for a player of the game may be set, and a reward may be provided to the player when the player has achieved an item on the list. The items in the achievement list may include, for example, &#x201c;log in to the game on ten or more days&#x201d;, &#x201c;take out <b>50</b> or more items in total from all the towers&#x201d;, &#x201c;encounter other players ten or more times within a tower&#x201d;, and &#x201c;visit other players' towers ten or more times&#x201d;.

Information (such as a program or image data) for displaying the start screen <b>500</b> may be stored in the game information storage unit <b>163</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A. The display processing unit <b>152</b> may generate information for displaying the start screen <b>500</b> by using the information stored in the game information storage unit <b>163</b>, and may output the generated information to the display unit <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Tapping on the tower <b>510</b> allows the player A to make their player character, namely, a player character A, enter the tower <b>510</b>. The player A makes the player character A move within the tower <b>510</b> in a limited number of turns and fight against an enemy character that the player character A has encountered. The player character A wins the fight to obtain an experience value and grow, and can further acquire a coin. In addition, there is a treasure chest within the tower <b>510</b>, and the player character A can acquire an item in the treasure chest as a reward. The acquired item may be a set of arms or a defensive weapon such as protective clothing or an accessory such as a necklace or a ring, which determines the characteristic values of the player character A, such as defense ability, attack ability, speed, and luck. The player A can set an item or accessory with which the player character A is to be equipped in order to defeat an enemy character. When a fight is set up between the player character A and an enemy character, the progress unit <b>153</b> may perform parameter calculations based on the characteristic values of the player character A, which are determined based on the equipment of the player character A, such as defense ability, attack ability, speed, and luck, and the characteristic values of the enemy character, and determines the amounts of damage that the respective characters receive. The character by which the total amount of damage received exceeds the total number of hit points (HP) possessed is the loser.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">An exemplary embodiment of the game described above may proceed as follows.

The player A may tap on the button <b>512</b> and spend a preset coin to add a floor to every three floors <b>514</b>. An enemy character on a higher floor may have higher defense ability or attack ability, and the characteristic values of an item which can be acquired may be set higher. The information described above may be stored in the game information storage unit <b>163</b>. Boss enemies may be located on every three floors (such as the third, sixth, and ninth floors) of the tower <b>510</b>. A player who wins a boss battle can escape from the tower <b>510</b> carrying acquired items with them. A player whose number of turns reaches zero or who loses a boss battle or escapes from the tower <b>510</b> during exploration is not allowed to take acquired items from the tower <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to an exemplary embodiment, the status of the player's progress through the game in the player's tower is transmitted from the transmitting unit <b>112</b> to the server <b>200</b>. The status of the player's progress through the game includes a stage of the game (such as the number of floors of the player's tower, and the equipment of the player character controlled by the player). The server <b>200</b> receives from each player (for example, the players A to C of the mobile terminals <b>100</b>A to <b>100</b>C) the status of the player's progress through the game in the corresponding player's tower, and stores the status in the status storage unit <b>262</b>. The status of each player who progresses through the game is transmitted to the server <b>200</b> periodically such as at the timing when the player updates the height of the tower or when the player finishes (or logs out of) the game.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to an exemplary embodiment, a plurality of players of the game may each be associated with a tower such as that on the start screen <b>500</b>, and each player can visit another player's tower (in an exemplary embodiment, any other player's tower) to play a battle game such as that described above in the other player's tower. When visiting any other player's tower, each player may need to spend coins which are virtual currency. It may be appreciated that, in some exemplary embodiments, information concerning any other player's tower is transmitted from the server <b>200</b>, and is received by the receiving unit <b>111</b>. The received information is stored in the game information storage unit <b>163</b> to allow the player to play the game in the other player's tower (information on which other player's tower is transmitted from the server <b>200</b> to each player will be described below).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As described above, the height of a tower associated with a player changes with the progress of the player through the game. Information such as the number of floors of each player's tower is transmitted to the server <b>200</b>, and the latest state of each player's tower is stored in the storage unit <b>260</b> of the server <b>200</b>. The storage unit <b>260</b> also stores information transmitted to each player, which is related to any other player's tower (for example, this may include information regarding which player can progress through the game, and in which other player's tower the player can progress through the game). Accordingly, if any other player's tower that a player visited has been updated (if the number of floors has been increased), the server <b>200</b> transmits information indicating the update of the other player's tower to a mobile terminal of the player. Based on the information, the player can receive (download) information concerning the other player's tower which has been updated, by using the receiving unit <b>111</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A. In this manner, even if a player visited once and explored and conquered any other player's tower, the number of floors of the other player's tower may have been increased the next time the player logs in. An enemy character that the player encounters and the item that the player can acquire changes depending on the height of the tower, which can give the player an incentive to visit and conquer the other player's tower multiple times. This can result in the growth of interaction among players.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring back to the start screen <b>500</b>, according to an exemplary embodiment, tapping on the shop button <b>520</b> allows the player A to display a screen for a virtual shop in the game. In the virtual shop, the player A can use acquired coins or gems to purchase an item or summon a companion character. The coins and gems are virtual currency that a player spends to purchase an item in the game, summon a companion character, or enter any other player's tower or the battle tower. The menu button <b>530</b> is a button for displaying a menu screen to make the game progress. The menu screen shows, for example, a game score (e.g., the maximum number of floors reached, etc.) that is information concerning the status of the player's progress through the game in the player's tower, any other player's tower, the common tower, or the battle tower, a button to switch to a screen for setting the equipment of the player character, and a button to switch to an item management screen.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to an exemplary embodiment, the map button <b>540</b> is a button to transition to a map screen on which any other player's tower that the player A can visit or the common tower is displayed. The news button <b>550</b> allows a message to be displayed in accordance with the progress of the game. Examples of the message may include &#x201c;expansion (adding a floor) of a tower is available&#x201d;, &#x201c;another player visited this tower&#x201d;, &#x201c;the functions available to the player A have been released&#x201d;, and &#x201c;information on any other player's tower has been updated&#x201d;. These messages are generated by the display processing unit <b>152</b> in accordance with an instruction from the progress unit <b>153</b>. Among the messages described above, the messages related to other players are generated based on information concerning the other players and the other players' towers, which is transmitted from the server <b>200</b>. The news button <b>550</b> may also allow ranking (described below) to be displayed. While the ranking is displayed, the color of the news button <b>550</b> is changed or a label with the ranking is displayed on top of the news button <b>550</b> to allow the player to see the display of the ranking at a glance. The map button <b>540</b> and the news button <b>550</b> are each displayed with an exclamation mark if there is any information that remains unchecked by the player A. The shop button <b>520</b> and the map button <b>540</b> are displayed when the tower <b>510</b> is nine or more floors high. A process based on such a condition is also performed by the progress unit <b>153</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The mail button <b>560</b> may be displayed by the display processing unit <b>152</b> in accordance with information received from the server <b>200</b> when there is any announcement from the supervisor of the game. Tapping on the mail button <b>560</b> allows the player A to display the announcement on the display unit <b>120</b>. Start screen <b>500</b> may also show a number of coins <b>570</b>, which may indicate the total number of coins that the player A currently owns. The number of gems <b>580</b> shows the number of gems owned by the player A. According to an exemplary embodiment, tapping on a plus (+) button located near the number of gems <b>580</b> allows the player A to make the display unit <b>120</b> transition to a gem purchase screen.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, according to an exemplary embodiment, the player A can decorate the player's tower <b>510</b> with a decorative element. For example, the player A can color the exterior wall of the player's tower <b>510</b> or stick an image on the wall. The player A can also decorate the tower <b>510</b> with a picture or image hanging on the interior wall. Such decoration is performed by the update unit <b>155</b> updating the player A's tower so that the player A's tower is decorated with an image and the like selected by the player A in accordance with an instruction given by the player A. Information concerning the player A's tower which has been updated may be transmitted to the server <b>200</b>, and the server <b>200</b> may store the information concerning the player A's tower in the storage unit <b>260</b>. The decorated tower may also be displayed in the same fashion on mobile terminals of other players who have received the information concerning the player A's tower from the server <b>200</b>. Accordingly, a player can decorate the player's tower at their own preference to make the player's tower appeal to other players, thereby providing the player with a more entertaining experience.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to another exemplary embodiment, a map may be displayed by the player A tapping on the mail button <b>540</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a map displayed on the display unit <b>120</b>. The illustrated map may be generated by the map generation unit <b>157</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A. Alternatively, the map generation unit <b>254</b> of the server <b>200</b> may generate a map, and map information for displaying the map may be transmitted to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a player's tower (the player A's tower) <b>610</b>, a common tower <b>611</b>, a battle tower <b>612</b>, an event tower <b>613</b>, and a quest (bottomless well) <b>614</b> are displayed on a map <b>600</b>. A tab menu <b>620</b> and a list <b>630</b> are also displayed. The player A can tap on the map <b>600</b> to select the destination.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Other towers may be displayed on the map <b>600</b>. As described above, the player's tower <b>610</b> is a game area associated with the player A, and the height of the tower <b>610</b> can be increased in accordance with the conquest of the player A. The common tower <b>611</b> is a tower that every player can conquer. As described above, each player aims to conquer the top floor while fighting against an enemy character that the player encounters within the common tower <b>611</b>. The player may be required to spend a coin in order to enter the common tower <b>611</b>, and can acquire more valuable reward items as they proceed to a higher floor. The height of the common tower <b>611</b> does not change in accordance with a user operation. On the contrary, the supervisor of the game may change the height of the common tower <b>611</b> in accordance with the progress of each user through the game. In the common tower <b>611</b>, the player may encounter another player character, which may include a player character whose player is playing the game at the same time, or a player character whose player is not currently playing the game. The player may encounter another player character which is selected by the game program and displayed.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The battle tower <b>612</b> may be a tower in which the player character A of the player A fights against another player character of another player. According to an exemplary embodiment, the battle tower <b>612</b> may not be displayed on the map <b>600</b> until the player's tower <b>610</b> meets a predetermined condition; for example, when the player's tower <b>610</b> becomes twelve or more floors high, the player A may be able to explore the battle tower <b>612</b>. That is, the map generation unit <b>157</b> generates a map on which the battle tower <b>612</b> is displayed, in accordance with the progress of the game caused to progress by the progress unit <b>153</b>. In the battle tower <b>612</b>, the player A may encounter another player character as an opponent character. Another player who controls the other player character that the player A encounters may not necessarily be playing the game at the same time, and any other player character satisfying a predetermined condition is selected by the game program (any other player character satisfying a predetermined condition is selected by the server <b>200</b>, and information concerning the other player character is transmitted) and is displayed to the player A. Examples of the predetermined condition for selecting an opponent include situations where the status of the opponent's progress through the game is similar to the status of the player A's progress through the game. For example, these may be situations where the opponent's tower has a height in a range of plus/minus one floor with respect to the height of the player A's tower. As described above, the player A can explore the inside of the battle tower <b>612</b> together with, as a companion character, a duplicate of any other player character which has been acquired by the player A through a random lottery (&#x201c;gacha&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The event tower <b>613</b> may be displayed on the map <b>600</b> when a predetermined condition is satisfied. For example, when the player A wins battles in the battle tower <b>612</b> and completes the conquest of the top floor or when the player A is ranked in top ten according to the battle record in the common tower <b>611</b>, the player A may be able to explore the event tower <b>613</b>. That is, the comparison unit <b>253</b> of the server <b>200</b> compares the battle records of the individual players in the common tower <b>611</b> to rank the players, and, when a predetermined condition is satisfied, information concerning the event tower <b>613</b> (information such as the appearance, enemy characters, and items) is transmitted from the server <b>200</b> to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A of the player A. The map generation unit <b>157</b> generates a map on which the event tower <b>613</b> is displayed, on the basis of the received information concerning the event tower <b>613</b>. In the event tower <b>613</b>, for example, the player A can be encouraged to acquire items in absence of an enemy character or can obtain a special reward by winning a fight against a special enemy character that appears, in accordance with the content of the event. The quest (bottomless well) <b>614</b> may be a game space in which the player A can encounter an enemy character different from that in the common tower <b>611</b> or the player's tower <b>610</b> or can acquire a special item.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The tab menu <b>620</b> shows &#x201c;Other players' towers&#x201d; that the player A can visit&#x2014;for example, by selecting the tab&#x2014;and also shows &#x201c;Exploration history&#x201d;, &#x201c;Favorites&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Towers accessible with a ticket&#x201d;, which are not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the list <b>630</b>, which is a list of &#x201c;other players' towers&#x201d; that the player A can visit, is illustrated.

This allows the player to understand other players' towers that the player can visit at a glance. In addition, tapping on a point on the map allows the player to readily visit any other player's tower corresponding to the point, which can motivate the player to visit other players' towers and facilitate the promotion of interaction among players.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">A description will be given here of any other player's tower that the player A can visit. If the height of the player A's tower satisfies a predetermined condition (e.g., nine or more floors), the player A encounters another player character while exploring the player A's tower, and the other player character hands out a map for the other player's tower to the player A. Player A may be able to visit this tower, for example upon retrieving the map from the tower. When the player A wins a boss battle in the player A's tower and successfully escapes from the player A's tower carrying acquired items with them, Player A can take the map. The other player's tower for which the player A has taken out the map is displayed on the list <b>630</b> as one of the other players' towers that the player A can visit.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Selection of a player character that may be encountered by player A while exploring player A's own tower may be based on, for example, whether or not the player of that player character has a tower having a stage that satisfies a predetermined condition. A player whose tower has a stage satisfying a predetermined condition for a particular stage of player A's tower may be selected from among a plurality of other players. Examples of the predetermined condition may include situations where the height of the other player's tower is within a range of plus/minus one floor with respect to the height of the player A's tower. The selection of another player is performed by determining, based on the status of the individual players who progress through the game (including the stages of the players' towers) which are received by the server <b>200</b> from the mobile terminals of the corresponding players, whether or not the predetermined condition is satisfied, by using the comparison unit <b>253</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Here, a level of any other player's tower having a height equivalent to that of a given player's tower, such as the characteristic values of an enemy character that appears, is equivalent to that of the given player's tower. This enables the conquest of the other player's tower to have the right level, which is not too difficult or too easy, for the given player to enjoy the game, and can maintain the motivation of the given player to play the game.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Alternatively, another player who controls another player character that the player A encounters while exploring the player A's tower may be another player character of another player who has visited or conquered the player A's tower. Information concerning another player who has visited or conquered the player A's tower may be transmitted from the server <b>200</b> to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A of the player A, or may be transmitted directly from a mobile terminal of the other player to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A of the player A. As described above, according to an embodiment of the present invention, a player may be provided with information on another player who has visited the player's tower, which can motivate the player to visit the other player's tower. This can result in the growth of interaction among players.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition, the reward that other players gain in a player's tower or the number of coins required for other players to enter the player's tower may be changed in accordance with the relation of each of the other players to the player's tower (such as the number of times the other player has visited the player's tower or whether or not the other player has conquered the player's tower). For example, the number of coins required for any other player to visit a player's tower may be reduced as the number of times the other player has visited the player's tower increases. Furthermore, any other player who has visited a player's tower more times may be provided with a more special reward (with lower probability of occurrence) in the player's tower.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In addition, other players who can play the game in the player A's tower may be other players associated with the player A on any other service. For example, another player associated with the player A on any other service such as an SNS, that is, another player having a friendship with the player A, may be allowed to play the game in the player A's tower.

For example, according to one exemplary embodiment, the ranking on the display unit <b>120</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A of the player A is displayed. Prior to the display of the ranking, the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A of the player A may receive information concerning the ranking determined by the comparison unit <b>253</b> of the server <b>200</b>.

This ranking may be accessible to players other than the player. This can give top-ranked players a sense of achievement and give players of lower ranking encouragement to tackle the game multiple times. In addition, interaction among a plurality of players can be stimulated.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Furthermore, according to an exemplary embodiment, interaction may be enabled among a plurality of players that is centered on a player's tower, that is, a player. Specifically, in addition to enabling a player to interact with other players in the player's game area, such an exemplary embodiment enables other players to interact with one another (that is, compete with one another in the ranking, exchange messages with other players while battling in the tower, etc.) in the player's game area. In addition, since players' game areas have different configurations from player to player, other players who get together in a certain player's game area feel that the configuration is attractive and are closely related to each other accordingly. Accordingly, other players with similar preferences get together in a certain player's game area, and can actively interact with one another. Consequently, diverse opportunities of interaction are created for the individual players' areas in the game space, resulting in the stimulation of interaction among players.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Additionally, a reward specific to a player's tower may be provided to other players in the top ranking in the player's tower. For example, while any other player ranked in top <b>100</b> for the player A's tower is exploring the player A's tower, an item that is difficult to acquire in any other player's tower but can be acquired in the player A's tower may be made to appear. In addition, a specific enemy character may appear which does not appear in any other player's tower but appears in the player A's tower and which allows a player to acquire a double reward such as the number of coins or the experience value when the player defeats the enemy character. That is, the reward providing unit <b>255</b> of the server <b>200</b> determines other players who can gain a reward specific to the player A's tower on the basis of the ranking in the player A's tower. A player who wins a boss battle in the player A's tower can acquire (take out) an item.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In this way, a player who is top-ranked in any other player's tower can acquire a reward (such as an item or coin) specific to the other player's tower. This can further motivate a player to repeatedly play the game in any other player's tower.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The above-described reward provided to top-ranked players may be at least partially different for each of other players' towers. That is, the reward providing unit <b>255</b> may change the type of specific reward for each player's tower. For example, items which can be acquired in the player A's tower may be different from items which can be acquired in the player B's tower. Accordingly, each player can be motivated to visit a plurality of other players' towers in order to achieve the top ranking position in the plurality of other players' towers, leading to active interaction among a plurality of players. In addition, since only players in the top ranking may be able to acquire a specific item, acquisition of such a specific item can make a player feel achievement because others do not possess the item.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Furthermore, the reward provided to other players who have explored the player A's tower may be changed in accordance with the battle record of the player A in the common tower or the battle tower. For example, according to an exemplary embodiment, when the player A successfully conquers the top floor of the battle tower, the player A's tower may become special to other players for a certain period, so that a player who visits the player A's tower during this period is provided with a special reward different from a normal reward that can be gained during other periods. Examples of providing the player with the special reward may include making an item that does not appear within a period during which the player A's tower is not special appear while the player is battling in the tower, or may include enabling the player to acquire double or more coins compared to normal when the player wins a fight. That is, the reward providing unit <b>255</b> determines when or if a player's tower can become a special tower, on the basis of the status of individual players who progress through the game; such information may be stored in the status storage unit <b>262</b>. While the player A's tower is a special tower, the appearance of the player A's tower displayed to other players may be changed in such a manner that, for example, the player A's tower is illuminated. This is achievable by transmitting information concerning the appearance of a player's tower that becomes a special tower from the server <b>200</b> to the respective mobile terminals of the other players. In addition, the player A can share a situation in which the player A's tower has become a special tower on an SNS to brag to other players.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In this way, each player is able to make the player's tower attractive to other players in accordance with their progress in the game. This allows the player to plunge enthusiastically into the game. In addition, each player is able to make the player's tower appeal to other players, providing increased motivation for the player. Additionally, the other players can be given an incentive to visit the player's tower, resulting in the growth of interaction among players.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Furthermore, each player may be provided with a reward according to the status of visitors of the player's tower. For example, each player may be provided with a reward in accordance with the number of other players who have visited the player's tower, the number of times other players have failed to conquer the player's tower, or the like. According to an exemplary embodiment, this may be achieved by the reward providing unit <b>255</b> determining a reward to be provided in the player's tower on the basis of the status of the individual players who progress through the game (including which player has visited which player's tower, and the number of times other players have failed to conquer the player's tower) which is stored in the status storage unit <b>262</b>. This configuration enables each player to make the player's tower more attractive or make the player's tower more difficult to conquer, and can motivate each player to actively interact with other players.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a control method may be described using a flowchart. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of a process for allowing the player A to play a game in a player's tower by using the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the progress unit <b>153</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A may cause a game to progress in the player A's tower in accordance with operation input information from the player A through the input acceptance unit <b>130</b> (step S<b>11</b>).

Alternatively, the ranking may be based on the number of floors reached. The comparison result may be transmitted to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A of the player A, and displayed on the display unit <b>120</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">While the configuration in which the server <b>200</b> determines ranking has been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the ranking in the player A's tower may be determined by a mobile terminal such as the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A of the player A. For example, in a case where the ranking is determined by the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A of the player A, the information in the table <b>950</b> may be transmitted from the server <b>200</b> to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A via the network <b>300</b>, and is stored in the status storage unit <b>162</b>.

The comparison result may be transmitted from the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A directly to the mobile terminals <b>100</b>B and <b>100</b>C by using the ad hoc mode or infrastructure mode described above without the intervention of the server <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Advantages achievable by some exemplary embodiments will be described again. As described above, according to an exemplary embodiment, when a player visits any other player's tower and explores and conquers the other player's tower, the number of floors of the other player's tower may have been increased the next time the player logs in. An enemy character that the player encounters and the item that the player can acquire change depending on the height of the tower, which can give the player an incentive to visit and conquer the other player's tower multiple times. This can result in the growth of interaction among players. In addition, a plurality of players may be ranked according to the battle record in a player's tower and the ranking may also be accessible to players other than the player. This can give top-ranked players a sense of achievement and give players of lower ranking encouragement to tackle the game multiple times. Furthermore, every player can be encouraged to be competitive, and interaction among a plurality of players can be stimulated.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">According to an embodiment of the present invention, furthermore, a player who is top-ranked in any other player's tower can acquire a specific reward (such as an item or coin). This can further motivate a player to repeatedly play the game in any other player's tower.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">According to an exemplary embodiment, the above-described reward provided to top-ranked players may be at least partially different for each of other players' towers. Accordingly, each player can be motivated to visit a plurality of other players' towers in order to achieve the top ranking position in the plurality of other players' towers, leading to active interaction among a plurality of players. In addition, since only players in the top ranking may be able to acquire a specific item, acquirement of such a specific item can make a player feel achievement because others do not possess the item.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Furthermore, according to an exemplary embodiment, the reward provided to other players who have explored a player's tower may be changed in accordance with the battle record of the player in the common tower or the battle tower. In this way, each player is able to make the player's tower attractive to other players in accordance with their progress in the game. This allows the player to plunge enthusiastically into the game. In addition, each player is able to brag to other players about the player's tower, providing increased motivation for the player. Additionally, the other players can be given an incentive to visit the player's tower, resulting in the growth of interaction among players.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">According to an embodiment of the present invention, furthermore, a player can be encouraged to conquer any other player's tower. Here, a level of any other player's tower having a height equivalent to that of a given player's tower, such as the characteristic values of an enemy character that appears, may be considered to be an equivalent of the given player's tower. This may cause the towers that a player has available to conquer to scale in level with the player's own advancement, which may cause the difficulty of the conquest of the other player's tower to be maintained at the right level (that is, a level which is not too difficult or too easy). This may allow for the given player to enjoy the game, and can maintain the motivation of the given player to play the game.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In addition, according to an embodiment of the present invention, other players who can play a game in a given player's tower may be other players associated with the given player on any other service (such as an SNS or any other game), that is, another player having a friendship with the given player. In this way, a player's friend on an SNS or in any other game is allowed to explore the player's tower, which can provide an attractive incentive for the player and the friend to enjoy the game together.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">According to an exemplary embodiment a player may be provided with information on another player who has visited the player's tower, which can motivate the player to visit the other player's tower. This can result in the growth of interaction among players.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">According to an exemplary embodiment, furthermore, a map for other players' towers that a player can visit may be generated and displayed to the player. This allows the player to understand other players' towers that the player can visit at a glance. In addition, tapping on a point on the map allows the player to readily visit any other player's tower corresponding to the point, which can motivate the player to visit other players' towers and facilitate the promotion of interaction among players.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">According to an exemplary embodiment, furthermore, a player can decorate the player's tower with a decorative element. The decorated tower is also displayed to other players in the same fashion. Accordingly, a player can decorate the player's tower at their own preference to make the player's tower appeal to other players, thereby providing the player with a more entertaining experience.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">According to an exemplary embodiment, a plurality of players may be ranked according to the battle record in a player's tower and the ranking may also be accessible to players other than the player. This can give top-ranked players a sense of achievement and give players of lower ranking encouragement to tackle the game multiple times. In addition, interaction among a plurality of players can be stimulated.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">While exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to said embodiments. For example, in one alternative exemplary embodiment, a player may visit any other player's tower in such a manner that any other player who has visited the player's tower can visit any other player's tower listed on the ranking in the player's tower (a configuration for navigating from the ranking in the player's tower may be used). This may be achievable by, for example, when transmitting information concerning the player A's tower from the server <b>200</b> to a mobile terminal of another player (the player B), also transmitting information concerning other players (such as the players C and D) listed on the ranking in the player A's tower (including information on the heights of the other players' towers and the equipment of player characters controlled by the other players). Alternatively, the following procedure may be used. The server <b>200</b> may transmit display information for displaying the ranking in the player A's tower to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>B of the player B to display the ranking on the mobile terminal <b>100</b>B (the display unit <b>120</b>B) of the player B. Then, the player B may tap on and selects another player (such as the player C or D) displayed on the display unit <b>120</b>B (the input acceptance unit <b>130</b>B accepts operation information), and may transmit a request to the server <b>200</b> to transmit information concerning the selected other player. Then, the server <b>200</b> may transmit the information concerning the other player selected by the player B. In this configuration, ranking a player in any other player's tower with a large number of visitors can allow a larger number of other players to visit the player's tower. Accordingly, a player can be motivated to tackle the game to boost their ranking in a player's tower with a large number of visitors.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">According to another exemplary embodiment, still another configuration may be used in which, for example, when interacting with the player B (such as when visiting and conquering the player B's tower), the player A may be able to interact with the player C who has a relationship with the player B (such as being able to visit the player C's tower). The term &#x201c;the player C having a relationship with the player B&#x201d;, as used here, is used to indicate that the player B has conquered the player C's tower or that the player B and the player C have a friendship with each other on an SNS or in any other game. This configuration is achievable using the following procedure. For example, when the player A progresses through the game in the player B's tower, information concerning the presence of the player C (information indicating that the player C interacts with the player B) may be transmitted from the server <b>200</b>, and the display processing unit <b>152</b> may display news which indicates that the player A is also able to visit the player C's tower that the player B has conquered, in response to tapping on the news button <b>550</b> on the start screen <b>500</b> of the game illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Then, the map generation unit <b>157</b> may cause the player C's tower to be displayed in the list <b>630</b> on the map <b>600</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. When the input acceptance unit <b>130</b> accepts the operation of the player A tapping on the player C's tower, the control unit <b>150</b> may request information concerning the player C's tower from the server <b>200</b>, and may receive information concerning the player C's tower from the receiving unit <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the foregoing description, furthermore, other players' towers are displayed as a list on a map. However, according to an alternative exemplary embodiment, other players' towers may be displayed on a map in a manner similar to that of the common tower. Furthermore, other players' tower may be displayed on a map in such a manner that the display positions thereof on the map can be changed in accordance with the relationship with a player. For example, any other player's tower having a closer relationship with a player may be displayed so as to be closer to the player's tower. The term &#x201c;any other player's tower having a close relationship with a player&#x201d;, as used here, refers to a tower associated with any other player who has visited the player's tower a larger number of times, or any other player's tower that the player has visited a large number of times. In addition, other players' towers may be displayed on a map in such a manner that the display positions thereof on the map can be changed in accordance with the relationship among other players. For example, a tower associated with any other player A may be displayed so as to be closer to a tower associated with any other player B which has a close relationship with the other player A (for example, a relationship based on the other player A having visited the player B's tower multiple times). In this case, for example, the comparison unit <b>253</b> of the server <b>200</b> may compare relationships between players, which are stored in the status storage unit <b>262</b>, and the map generation unit <b>254</b> may generate map information for displaying other players' towers while changing the spaces in which the other players' towers are displayed in accordance with the relationships. A condition of the display spaces may be stored in advance in the storage unit <b>260</b>. The generated map information may be transmitted to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and may be controlled by the display processing unit <b>152</b> so as to be displayed on the display unit <b>120</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The configuration described above allows a player to check their relationships with other players at a glance, which can give an indication of interaction with other players.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Additionally, in accordance with the above-described distance between a player's tower and any other player's tower, information related to the other player's tower, such as parameters, may be changed. For example, the number of coins or the like required for a player to visit any other player's tower may be changed. In this case, for example, if the player A and the player B have a close relationship with each other on the basis of the result of comparison in the relationship described above by the comparison unit <b>253</b>, the information processing unit <b>251</b> may transmit to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A of the player A information concerning any other player's tower (the player B's tower) in which the number of coins required to visit the player B's tower has been changed to a smaller value. This configuration can provide distinct identification of a connection between players, and can motivate a player to visit other players' towers or motivate a larger number of other players to visit the player's tower, facilitating the promotion of interaction among players.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Furthermore, according to an alternative exemplary embodiment, each player may form a group with a plurality of other players. In this configuration, information on other players who can visit the player's tower or information on other players' towers that the player can visit may be shared within the group. For example, in a case where one player within the group can visit the player A's tower, the other players within the same group may also be able to visit the player A's tower. In this configuration, for example, information concerning the group may be stored in the storage unit <b>260</b> of the server <b>200</b>. The information concerning the group is updated in accordance with the status of the players who progress through the game, which is periodically transmitted from the mobile terminals of the individual players. Further, the information concerning the group may also be stored in the storage unit <b>160</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A, and information concerning the other players within the group may be transmitted periodically (such as when the game starts or when a screen transition occurs) from the server <b>200</b> to update the information. This configuration can make even a player such as a novice of the game whose tower has a small number of visits of other players belong to a group, enabling an increase in the number of other players who can visit such a player's tower, resulting in the player being able to actively interact with the other players. In addition, an enhanced entertaining game experience can be provided for a novice of the game.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In the foregoing description, exemplary embodiments have been described in which a computer functions as a mobile terminal (client device) and a game program is executed by the mobile terminal as a so-called native application (native game). However, other exemplary embodiments of a computer and game program may be understood. For example, according to one exemplary embodiment, a computer may function as a server, and a game program may serve as a so-called web application (web game), with part or all of the game program being executed by the server, and with the result of the executed process being returned to a mobile terminal. In the foregoing description, furthermore, information concerning a player's tower, which is transmitted from the server <b>200</b> to a mobile terminal of any other player, may be transmitted from the mobile terminal of the player directly to the mobile terminal of the other player. That is, data may be transmitted and received via communication between mobile terminals.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">According to an exemplary embodiment where the result of the game is displayed through a web browser, the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A can accumulate information received from the server <b>200</b> in, for example, a predetermined storage area (web storage) included in the web browser.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In this manner, a configuration may be used in which some or all of the functional units (particularly, the control unit <b>150</b>) included in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A in the foregoing description may be included in the server <b>200</b>, and wherein the server <b>200</b> transmits the output result of the game to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A in accordance with input given to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A. This configuration allows the server <b>200</b> to achieve advantages similar to those achievable by the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A when the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A provides the individual functions.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">For example, according to an exemplary embodiment, the reward providing unit <b>154</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A may determine any other player which is provided with a reward specific to an own game area associated with a player on the basis of the comparison result of the status of a plurality of other players who progress through the game in the own game area, while this process is performed by the reward providing unit <b>255</b> of the server <b>200</b> in the foregoing description. The reward provided by the reward providing unit <b>154</b> may be at least partially different for each of a plurality of game areas. In addition, the reward providing unit <b>154</b> provides different rewards to other players who progress through the game in the own game area associated with the player, in accordance with the status of the player's progress through the game in a game area different from the own game area or any other game area.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">In addition, the comparison unit <b>156</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A may compare the status of a plurality of other players who progress through the game in an own game area associated with a player, while this process is performed by the comparison unit <b>253</b> of the server <b>200</b> in the foregoing description. Further, the comparison unit <b>156</b> may compare the stage of any other game area associated with any other player with the stage of the own game area.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In some further examples, a game may be a hybrid game in which some of the processes are performed by each of the server <b>200</b> and the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A in such a manner that, for example, a game progress screen is displayed on the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A on the basis of the data generated by the server <b>200</b> in web display mode and other menu screens and the like are displayed in native display mode by using a native application installed on the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In addition, according to an exemplary embodiment, the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A and other mobile terminals, e.g., the mobile terminals <b>100</b>B and <b>100</b>C, may be connected to each other so as to be capable of performing communication (called peer-to-peer communication), and may be synchronized with each other to provide multiplayer gameplay.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In addition, the control method described above may not only include the processes described above with reference to the flowcharts but may also optionally include processes executed by the components included in the control units <b>150</b> and <b>250</b>.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In the foregoing description, a game implemented by a game program according to an embodiment of the present invention has been described in the context of a battle game in a tower setting.

It should therefore be noted that such changes and modifications fall within the scope of the present invention. For example, functions included in means, steps, and the like are reconfigurable so that logical consistency may be maintained, and a plurality of means, steps, and the like may be combined into a single one or divided into multiple ones. In addition, the configurations illustrated in the embodiments described above may be combined as necessary.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Exemplary embodiments such as those described above may be widely applicable to any kind of computer such as a smartphone, a tablet terminal, a mobile phone, a home game console, a personal computer, a server, a workstation, or a mainframe.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">Other exemplary embodiments of a game implemented by a game program may also be described.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">In the virtual space of a game, &#x201c;players' towers&#x201d; (game spaces) each associated with one of a plurality of players may be present, and an individual player may be able to play the game not only in the player's tower but also in any &#x201c;other player's tower&#x201d; associated with any other player. A plurality of players of the game may be able to asynchronously play the game in a plurality of towers that are present. The term &#x201c;game in a tower&#x201d; refers to a game that encourages a player character (game medium) of a player to explore the inside of the tower in a limited number of turns and defeat an enemy character that the player character encounters while acquiring items to proceed with the conquest of the tower. When the player successfully conquers floors up to the top floor of the &#x201c;player's tower&#x201d;, the player can increase the number of floors of the tower. Accordingly, each player can increase the number of floors of the &#x201c;player's tower&#x201d; (or any &#x201c;other player tower&#x201d; for another player). Thus, even if a player conquers floors up to the top floor of any &#x201c;other player tower&#x201d; at a certain point in time, the number of floors of the &#x201c;other player tower&#x201d; may be larger the next time the player logs in to the game than when the player conquered the top floor of the tower.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">In the virtual space of the game, additional game spaces other than the above-described towers associated with the individual players, such as a &#x201c;common tower&#x201d;, a &#x201c;battle tower&#x201d;, an &#x201c;event tower&#x201d;, and a &#x201c;quest&#x201d;, may be present. The additional game spaces such as the towers and the quest described above are game spaces not associated with any players but managed on the server (supervisor) side. In any of these game spaces, every player aims to conquer the top floor or the bottom level by causing the player character to explore the inside. The &#x201c;common tower&#x201d; is a tower that every player can conquer in common. In the &#x201c;common tower&#x201d;, players can encounter and greet each other while exploring the inside, or a plurality of players may be ranked according to the state of conquest of the &#x201c;common tower&#x201d;. The &#x201c;battle tower&#x201d; is a tower in which players may fight against each other, and an opponent that a player character encounters in the tower may be any other player character. The &#x201c;event tower&#x201d; may be a tower related to an in-game event held for a certain period. The &#x201c;event tower&#x201d; may be a tower that appears in a predetermined condition in accordance with the progress of each player through the game, and allows the player to gain a special reward by exploring the inside. The &#x201c;quest (e.g., an object displayed in a fashion like a bottomless well)&#x201d; may allow a player to encounter an enemy character different from that in any of the towers described above or to gain a special reward.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">In addition, each player can explore a game area such as any of the towers described above together with, a duplicate of any other player character, which has been acquired by the player through a random lottery (&#x201c;gacha&#x201d;), as a companion character. Each player can further place a companion character acquired through a random lottery in the player's tower as a defensive character that serves to defend the player's tower. Furthermore, an &#x201c;achievement list&#x201d; that is a list of items achievable for a player of the game is set, and a reward is provided to the player when the player has achieved an item on the list. The items in the achievement list may include, for example, &#x201c;log in to the game on ten or more days&#x201d;, &#x201c;take out <b>50</b> or more items in total from all the towers&#x201d;, &#x201c;encounter other players ten or more times within a tower&#x201d;, and &#x201c;visit other players' towers ten or more times&#x201d;. The foregoing is a brief summary of the game.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">An exemplary embodiment may be described in detail hereinafter with reference to some drawings.

For example, a parameter of the player character, such as the HP, may be increased. In this case, the duplication unit <b>257</b> may refer to the history of an object to be provided, which is stored in the to-be-provided object storage unit <b>265</b> of the server <b>200</b>, and change the parameters of the player character on the basis of, for example, whether or not the player character has been previously selected as a provided entity, the number of times the player character has been previously an object to be provided, the period during which the player character was an object to be provided in the past, and the like.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">Tapping on the shop button <b>520</b> on the start screen <b>500</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> allows a menu screen to be displayed, and the player can select a menu such as &#x201c;purchase an item&#x201d; or &#x201c;summon a companion character&#x201d;. When the player selects &#x201c;summon a companion character&#x201d;, the player can acquire (summon) one player character through a random lottery from among player characters stored in the server <b>200</b> as provided entities. A plurality of companion characters may be acquired in accordance with the number of times the player has played a random lottery. The random lottery (&#x201c;gacha&#x201d;) is a selection method in which a player character stored as a provided entity is randomly selected in accordance with a predetermined probability of occurrence. The player can accompany the acquired other player character as a companion character in exploring the battle tower <b>612</b> or the common tower <b>610</b>. The random lottery method may involve setting in advance the order in which player characters appear, and selecting a player character by the selection unit <b>258</b> in accordance with the order. Information such as the probability of occurrence and the order is stored in advance in the storage unit <b>160</b> or <b>260</b>. Alternatively, a provided entity may be obtained by using a combination of a random lottery based on a predetermined probability of occurrence and a selection based on a preset order. This configuration includes, for example, a configuration in which a plurality of patterns of orders are set and a random lottery is performed by using one of the patterns.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">The battle tower <b>612</b> may be a tower in which the player character A of the player A fights against another player character of another player. According to an exemplary embodiment, the battle tower <b>612</b> may not be displayed on the map <b>600</b> until the player's tower <b>610</b> meets a predetermined condition n; for example, when the player's tower <b>610</b> becomes twelve or more floors high, the player A may be able to explore the battle tower <b>612</b>. In the battle tower <b>612</b>, the player A may encounter another player character as an opponent character. Another player who controls the other player character that the player A encounters may not necessarily be playing the game at the same time, and any other player character satisfying a predetermined condition is selected by the game program and is displayed to the player A. As described above, the player A can explore the inside of the battle tower <b>612</b> together with, as a companion character, a duplicate of any other player character acquired by the player A through a random lottery (&#x201c;gacha&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">As described above, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, each player's player character which satisfies a predetermined condition at predetermined timing is set as a provided entity through a random lottery (&#x201c;gacha&#x201d;) for a game in a game space (the common tower <b>611</b>). Since a provided entity is set at predetermined timing, the player's enthusiasm for the game can be aroused to encourage satisfying the condition by the predetermined timing. Furthermore, selection based on the score at predetermined timing yields provided entities including effective (powerful) player characters for the game configuration at the timing. A player who plays a random lottery (or &#x201c;gacha&#x201d;) needs a player character which is effective on the current game configuration. Adjusting the timing as appropriate allows an effective player character to be set as a provided entity in accordance with the situation even if the state of the game changes (e.g., an event takes place or an update occurs).</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">In addition, it may be difficult for a novice of the game to win fights in the battle tower <b>612</b> since their player character can be equipped with a small number of items or has a low experience value, and continuously losing at the game may cause the player to lose motivation to participate in the game. If the player is able to acquire a powerful companion character through a random lottery, the player would more probably win fights, and even a novice can enjoy the game. According to an embodiment of the present invention, since a companion character acquired through a random lottery will be associated with a high-ranked player (high-score player) of the game in the common tower <b>611</b>, a player can easily acquire a high-ability companion character. This can provide the player with an enhanced entertaining game experience. In addition, the player may be motivated to increase the ability of their character so that the character can be registered as a provided entity in order to receive the honor of being used as a companion character. Accordingly, the player can be motivated to repeatedly play the game.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">The event tower <b>613</b> may be displayed on the map <b>600</b> when a predetermined condition is satisfied. For example, when the player A wins battles in the battle tower <b>612</b> and completes the conquest of the top floor or when the player A is ranked in top ten according to the score in the common tower <b>611</b>, the player A may be able to explore the event tower <b>613</b>. In the event tower <b>613</b>, for example, the player A can be encouraged to acquire items in absence of an enemy character or can obtain a special reward by winning a fight against a special enemy character that appears, in accordance with the content of the event. The bottomless well <b>614</b> is a game space in which the player A can encounter an enemy character different from that in the common tower <b>611</b> or the player's tower <b>610</b> or can acquire a special item.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> illustrates an example game screen for displaying the details of a companion character which has been acquired by a player.

The weapons <b>1020</b> and the accessories <b>1030</b> are items that a player character that is the source of the companion character <b>1010</b> was wearing when the player character was duplicated and the duplicate character was stored as a provided entity at predetermined timing. The player who has acquired the companion character <b>1010</b> may be restricted from modifying some of the parameters such as the weapons <b>1020</b> and the accessories <b>1030</b>. For example, according to an exemplary embodiment, the player may not be allowed to change the weapons <b>1020</b> to other items (however, the player may be allowed to strengthen the weapons <b>1020</b>). Similarly, the accessories of the player who has acquired the companion character <b>1010</b> can be updated with the accessories <b>1030</b> for equipment, though the player may not be allowed to acquire the accessories with which a companion character is equipped. In addition, if any other player character that is the source of a companion character exchanges a weapon on a game or acquires a new accessory, such a weapon or accessory may not be applied to the companion character.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example game screen on which a player fights (battles) against an enemy character together with companion characters.

Tapping on a &#x201c;fight&#x201d; button <b>1140</b> may allow the player to fight the enemy character <b>1110</b>. As described above, since the outcome of the fight depends on the parameters of the respective characters, the parameters of the companion characters <b>1120</b> and <b>1130</b> can be the key to winning or losing the game.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">As described above, according to an exemplary embodiment, restrictive modification of the parameters of a companion character which has been acquired can suppress proliferation of strong player characters to appropriately maintain the game balance. Specifically, some limitations on an acquirable player character with respect to an original player character that is the source of the player character can guarantee the superiority of a player who owns the original player character. This allows an increase in the strength of a player such as a novice, and also allows adjustment of the strength of players so that such a player does not easily achieve strength comparable to experts.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">In addition, a player corresponding to a player character which has been acquired as a companion character a large number of times may be provided with a reward. For example, a configuration may be used in which the parameters of a player character are increased in accordance with the number of times the player character has been acquired as a companion character. Alternatively, a reward may be provided to a player to help the player progress through the game in accordance with the number of times the player's player character has been acquired as a companion character. The reward described above may be provided in accordance with use conditions as a companion character in the game. The term &#x201c;use conditions&#x201d;, as used here, refers to the number of times the player character has been used as a companion character in the game or the period during which the player character was used as a companion character in the game, the number of times the player character has been made to grow by any other player who has acquired the player character, or the number of times any other player who has acquired the player character has won a battle together with the player character as a companion character, for example. Examples of providing a reward may include, specifically, encouraging a player to acquire an item with low probability of occurrence in the event tower, and making an enemy character appear to enable a player who has defeated the enemy character to acquire double or more coins.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">In this manner, each player can obtain a reward in accordance with the number of times a duplicate of their player character has been acquired as a companion character. This can keep the player's enthusiasm for repeated play of the game to increase their ranking. In addition, each player can obtain a reward in accordance with the use of a duplicate of their player character as a companion character. This can provide a player with an enthusiastic experience to raise their character to higher levels.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">A player who has acquired a companion character and a player (&#x201c;source player&#x201d;) who controls a player character that is the source of the companion character may be made to interact with each other. For example, the player who has acquired the companion character may be able to transmit an email to the source player, or may be able to express a gratitude to the source player on an SNS. In this case, the game program may include a chat function to give players the opportunity to chat, or registration information on an SNS may be set at the time of start of the game so that information on players is stored in association with the SNS. Alternatively, the tower associated with the player who has acquired the companion character and the tower associated with the source player may be stored in association with each other. For example, the player who has acquired the companion character and the source player may be able to visit their counterpart's towers, or may be able to acquire more coins when they have conquered their counterpart's towers. Additionally, information on the player who has acquired the companion character and information on the source player may be stored in association with each other. For example, both players may be registered as friends, or may ask each other for preferential cooperation in the case of cooperative gameplay such as fighting an enemy in cooperation with a plurality of players. Furthermore, both players may be notified of information relating to a change in the parameters of the companion character or the player character of the source player. Specifically, when the companion character is equipped with equipment A having more powerful parameters, the source player may be notified of information on a quest in which the equipment A can be acquired, or a release may be performed so that the quest can be completed.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">An exemplary embodiment as described above can encourage players to further interact via player characters.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, a process in the game according to the second embodiment of the present invention may be described using a flowchart. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of a process for storing the player character A of the player A of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A as a provided entity and sending a request from the player B of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>B to acquire a companion character (summon a companion character, play a &#x201c;gacha&#x201d;).

Since a provided entity is set at predetermined timing, the player's enthusiasm for the game can be aroused to encourage satisfying the condition by the predetermined timing.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">According to an exemplary embodiment, a player may enjoy advantages from acquiring a player character. High-ranked characters may be characters effective on the current game specifications. Accordingly, effective game characters may be easily available to a player among characters raised by other players. An advantage of a player who raises a player character stored as a provided entity is as follows. A character raised by a player is usable by a larger number of other players, allowing the player to interact with other players. In the related art, a player needs to directly fight against other players or access other players to exchange player characters. Some exemplary embodiments may enable player characters to be exchanged between players without requiring the players to directly interact such as fighting each other. This can encourage players to interact via player characters, increasing the opportunity for interaction.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">According to an exemplary embodiment, since a companion character acquired through a random lottery will be associated with a high-ranked player (high-score player) of the game in the common tower, a player can easily acquire a high-ability companion character. This can provide the player with an enhanced entertaining game experience. In addition, the player may be motivated to increase the ability of their character so that the character can be registered as a provided entity in order to receive the honor of being used as a companion character or obtain a reward. Accordingly, the player can be motivated to repeatedly play the game.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">According to another exemplary embodiment, furthermore, restrictive modification of the parameters of a companion character which has been acquired can suppress proliferation of strong player characters to appropriately maintain the game balance. Specifically, some limitations on an acquirable player character with respect to an original player character that is the source of the player character can guarantee the superiority of a player who owns the original player character. This may allow an increase in the strength of a player such as a novice, and also allows adjustment of the strength of players so that such a player does not easily achieve strength comparable to experts.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">According to another exemplary embodiment, furthermore, each player can obtain a reward in accordance with the number of times a duplicate of their player character has been acquired as a companion character or in accordance with the use conditions as a companion character in the game. This can keep the player's enthusiasm for repeated play of the game to increase their ranking.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">Other exemplary embodiments other than what has been so far described may be understood. For example, in the foregoing description, the probability of occurrence for a random lottery is set in advance. However, the probability of occurrence may be set in accordance with a predetermined probability distribution from the highest rank. For example, the probability of occurrence of a player character ranked first may be lowest, whereas the probability of occurrence of a player character ranked <b>100</b>th may be highest. Alternatively, the probability may be changed in accordance with the relationship between a player who plays a gacha and a player corresponding to a player character included in the gacha. The probability of the player A being able to acquire the player character of the player B may be increased in accordance with relationships, for example, the player A having a friendship with the player B or the player A being able to visit the player B's tower or having conquered the player B's tower.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">In addition, according to an exemplary embodiment, a plurality of player characters may be associated with a player. In this case, player characters stored as objects to be provided may be some or all of a plurality of player characters associated with a player. Furthermore, the duplication unit <b>257</b> may selectively store a player character as a provided entity in accordance with the parameters of each of the plurality of player characters. For example, a player character having a highest parameter among the plurality of player characters may be duplicated and the duplicate character may be used as an object to be provided.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">In the foregoing description, furthermore, a provided entity is determined at predetermined timing. In another exemplary embodiment, a player character may be added to a provided entity, as necessary, at the timing when the player character satisfies a condition. For example, at the timing when a player is ranked in top <b>100</b>, the player's player character may be stored in the server <b>200</b>. Further, at the timing when a player is removed from the ranking, the player's player character may be deleted from the server <b>200</b>. With this configuration, player characters included in provided entities can be changed in flux.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">The predetermined timing is not limited to that described above, and may be the timing at which the game configuration is changed (e.g., when an event starts, when an event ends, or when an update occurs). The provided entities stored in the server <b>200</b> may be replaced periodically.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">In the foregoing description, furthermore, a player may be restricted from modifying some of the parameters of a companion character that the player has acquired (e.g., equipment of weapons or accessories). In an alternative exemplary embodiment, restrictions may be imposed on parameters that can be changed. For example, each player can spend coins to increase the weapon skill level, and the upper limit of the weapon skill level that can be increased may be restricted. Alternatively, the initial parameters of a companion character when the companion character is acquired may be set lower than the parameters before the duplication.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">The foregoing description has been given of an exemplary embodiment in which a computer functions as a server, a game program serves as a so-called web application (web game), part or all of the game program being executed by the server, and the result of the executed process is returned to a mobile terminal. However, other exemplary embodiments of a computer and game program may be understood. For example, according to one exemplary embodiment, a computer may function as a mobile terminal (client device), and a game program may be executed by the mobile terminal as a so-called native application (native game).</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">According to an exemplary embodiment where the result of the game is displayed through a web browser, the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A can accumulate information received from the server <b>200</b> in, for example, a predetermined storage area (web storage) included in the web browser.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">In this manner, a configuration may be used in which some or all of the functional units (particularly, the control unit <b>150</b>) included in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A in the foregoing description may be included in the server <b>200</b>, and wherein the server <b>200</b> transmits the output result of the game to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A in accordance with input given to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A. This configuration allows the server <b>200</b> to achieve advantages similar to those achievable by the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A when the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A provides the individual functions.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">In some further examples, a game may be a hybrid game in which some of the processes are performed by each of the server <b>200</b> and the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A in such a manner that, for example, a game progress screen is displayed on the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A on the basis of the data generated by the server <b>200</b> in web display mode and other menu screens and the like are displayed in native display mode by using a native application installed on the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">In addition, according to an exemplary embodiment, the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A and other mobile terminals, e.g., the mobile terminals <b>100</b>B and <b>100</b>C, may be connected to each other so as to be capable of performing communication (called peer-to-peer communication), and may be synchronized with each other to provide multiplayer gameplay. While the configuration in which information is transmitted and received from one mobile terminal to another mobile terminal via the server <b>200</b> has been described, information may be directly transmitted and received between mobile terminals in an ad hoc mode or an infrastructure mode, for example.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">In addition, the control method described above may not only include the processes described above with reference to the flowcharts but may also optionally include processes executed by the components included in the control unit <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">In the foregoing description, a game implemented by a game program according to an embodiment of the present invention has been described in the context of a battle game in a tower setting. However, according to other exemplary embodiments, and a game program according to an embodiment of the present invention may be implemented as any of a wide variety of games, examples of which include business simulation games, farm simulation games, and character-raising games.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">In the foregoing description, furthermore, a game in which players' scores that determine provided entities are determined is a game in the common tower. However, the present invention is not limited to this configuration, and provided entities may be based on the scores of the player of games in players' towers associated with a plurality of players. In the foregoing description, furthermore, a companion character to be summoned is a player character duplicated as a provided entity. Alternatively, a companion character may be a non-player character programmed in advance. Furthermore, a companion character that appears together with a subject player character, which is acquired through a random lottery, may be the subject player character if the subject player character has been duplicated as a provided entity.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">Furthermore, the mobile terminals <b>100</b>A to <b>100</b>C are not limited to smartphones. Each of the mobile terminals <b>100</b>A to <b>100</b>C may be any device so long as the device is an information processing device capable of implementing the functions described in the second embodiment described above, and examples of the device may include a mobile phone, a PC, and a tablet terminal. Furthermore, while the embodiment described above has been described in the context of a game across three mobile terminals, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and more than three mobile terminals may be used.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">Furthermore, the control units <b>150</b> and <b>250</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A and the server <b>200</b> may be each implemented by a logic circuit (hardware) mounted on an integrated circuit (IC) chip or the like, or may be implemented by software by using a CPU. In the latter case, each of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>A and the server <b>200</b> may include a CPU that executes a command of a game program, which is software implementing the individual functions, a ROM or a storage device (collectively referred to as a &#x201c;recording medium&#x201d;) on which the game program and various kinds of data are recorded in computer-readable (or CPU-readable) form, a RAM onto which the game program is loaded, and so forth.
