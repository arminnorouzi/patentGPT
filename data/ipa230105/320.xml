Current imaging probes are limited in their ability to reach certain anatomical locations due to their size and rigidity. Current imaging probes are inserted over a guidewire, which can compromise their placement and limit use of one or more delivery catheters through which the imaging probe is inserted. There is a need for imaging systems that include probes with reduced diameter and high flexibility, as well as systems with one or more delivery devices compatible with these improved imaging probes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an aspect of the present inventive concepts, an imaging system for a patient comprises an imaging probe, comprising: an elongate shaft comprising a proximal end, a distal portion, and a lumen extending between the proximal end and the distal portion; a rotatable optical core comprising a proximal end and a distal end, wherein at least a portion of the rotatable optical core is positioned within the lumen of the elongate shaft; and an optical assembly positioned proximate the distal end of the rotatable optical core, the optical assembly configured to direct light to tissue to be imaged and to collect reflected light from the tissue; and an imaging assembly constructed and arranged to optically couple to the imaging probe, the imaging assembly configured to emit light into the imaging probe and receive the reflected light collected by the optical assembly. The reflected light comprises image data, and the system is constructed and arranged to produce one or more images based on the image data. The imaging assembly can comprise multiple reference paths, and each reference path can comprise an optical fiber that comprises a different optical dispersion. The imaging assembly can be constructed and arranged to select a reference path that matches the optical dispersion of the rotatable optical core</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the elongate shaft further comprises an optically transparent window including one or more imagable portions, and the system further comprises an algorithm configured to utilize image data provided by the one or more imagable portions to reduce the negative impact of NURD on the one or more produced images.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the system further comprises an algorithm, and the algorithm is configured to modify different image data portions of the one or more produced images based on one, two, or more characteristics of those image data portions.

Imaging assembly <b>300</b> can be configured to provide light to optical assembly <b>115</b> (e.g. via optical core <b>110</b>) and collect light from optical assembly <b>115</b> (e.g. via optical core <b>110</b>). Imaging assembly <b>300</b> can include a light source <b>310</b>. Light source <b>310</b> can comprise one or more light sources, such as one or more light sources configured to provide one or more wavelengths of light to optical assembly <b>115</b> via optical core <b>110</b>. Light source <b>310</b> is configured to provide light to optical assembly <b>115</b> (via optical core <b>110</b>) such that image data can be collected comprising cross-sectional, longitudinal and/or volumetric information related to a patient site or implanted device being imaged. Light source <b>310</b> can be configured to provide light such that the image data collected includes characteristics of tissue within the patient site being imaged, such as to quantify, qualify or otherwise provide information related to a patient disease or disorder present within the patient site being imaged. Light source <b>310</b> can be configured to deliver broadband light and have a center wavelength in the range from 350 nm to 2500 nm, from 800 nm to 1700 nm, from 1280 nm to 1310 nm, or approximately 1300 nm (e.g. light delivered with a sweep range from 1250 nm to 1350 nm). Light source <b>310</b> can comprise a sweep rate of at least 50 KHz. In some embodiments, light source <b>310</b> comprises a sweep rate of at least 100 KHz, such as at least 200 Khz, 300 KHz, 400 KHz, and/or 500 KHz. These faster sweep rates provide numerous advantages, such as to provide a higher frame rate, where each &#x201c;frame&#x201d; is based on, or otherwise represents, the data collected during a single 360&#xb0; rotation of optical core <b>110</b>. In addition, the faster sweeper rates are compatible with (e.g. are supportive of) rapid pullback and rotation rates. For example, the higher sweep rate enables the requisite sampling density (e.g. the amount of luminal surface area swept by the rotating beam) to be achieved in a shorter time, advantageous in most situations and especially advantageous when there is relative motion between the probe and the surface/tissue being imaged such as arteries in a beating heart. Light source <b>310</b> bandwidth can be selected to achieve a desired resolution, which can vary according to the needs of the intended use of imaging system <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, bandwidths are about 5% to 15% of the center wavelength, which allows resolutions of between 20 &#x3bc;m and 5 &#x3bc;m. Light source <b>310</b> can be configured to deliver light at a power level meeting ANSI Class <b>1</b> (&#x201c;eye safe&#x201d;) limits, though higher power levels can be employed. In some embodiments, light source <b>310</b> delivers light in the 1.3 &#x3bc;m band at a power level of approximately 20 mW. Tissue light scattering is reduced as the center wavelength of delivered light increases, however water absorption increases. Light source <b>310</b> can deliver light at a wavelength approximating 1300 nm to balance these two effects. Light source <b>310</b> can be configured to deliver shorter wavelength light (e.g. approximately 800 nm light) to traverse patient sites to be imaged including large amounts of fluid. Alternatively or additionally, light source <b>310</b> can be configured to deliver longer wavelengths of light (e.g. approximately 1700 nm light), such as to reduce a high level of scattering within a patient site to be imaged. In some embodiments, light source <b>310</b> comprises a tunable light source (e.g. light source <b>310</b> emits a single wavelength that changes repetitively over time), and/or a broad-band light source. Light source <b>310</b> can comprise a single spatial mode light source or a multimode light source (e.g. a multimode light source with spatial filtering).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Light source <b>310</b> can comprise a relatively long effective coherence length, such as a coherence length of greater than 10 mm, such as a length of at least 50 mm, at all frequencies within the bandwidth of the light source. This coherence length capability enables longer effective scan ranges to be achieved by system <b>10</b>, as the light returning from distant objects to be imaged (e.g. tissue) must remain in phase coherence with the returning reference light, in order to produce detectable interference fringes. In the case of a swept-source laser, the instantaneous linewidth is very narrow (i.e. as the laser is sweeping, it is outputting a very narrow frequency band that changes at the sweep rate). Similarly, in the case of a broad-bandwidth source, the detector arrangement must be able to select very narrow linewidths from the spectrum of the source. The coherence length scales inversely with the linewidth. Longer scan ranges enable larger or more distant objects to be imaged (e.g. more distal tissue to be imaged). Current systems have lower coherence length, which correlates to reduced image capture range as well as artifacts (ghosts) that arise from objects outside the effective scan range.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Console <b>50</b> can comprise one or more algorithms, such as algorithm <b>51</b> shown, which can be configured to adjust (e.g. automatically and/or semi-automatically adjust) one or more operational parameters of imaging system <b>10</b>, such as an operational parameter of console <b>50</b>, imaging probe <b>100</b> and/or a delivery catheter <b>80</b>.

In some embodiments, algorithm <b>51</b> is configured to adjust a retraction parameter such as a parameter triggering the initiation of the pullback, such as a pullback that is initiated based on a parameter selected from the group consisting of: lumen flushing (the lumen proximate optical assembly <b>115</b> has been sufficiently cleared of blood or other matter that would interfere with image creation); an indicator signal is received from injector <b>20</b> (e.g. a signal indicating sufficient flushing fluid has been delivered); a change in image data collected (e.g. a change in an image is detected, based on the image data collected, that correlates to proper evacuation of blood from around optical assembly <b>115</b>); and combinations of one or more of these. In some embodiments, algorithm <b>51</b> is configured to adjust an imaging system <b>10</b> configuration parameter related to imaging probe <b>100</b>, such as when algorithm <b>51</b> identifies (e.g. automatically identifies via an RF or other embedded ID) the attached imaging probe <b>100</b> and adjusts an imaging system <b>10</b> parameter, such as an optical path length parameter, a dispersion parameter, and/or other parameter as listed above.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some embodiments, algorithm <b>51</b> is configured to trigger the initiation of a pullback based on a time-gated parameter. In some embodiments, a T-wave trigger (e.g. provided by a separate device) can be provided to console <b>50</b> to begin pullback when the low-motion portion of the heart cycle is detected. As an alternative to a T-wave trigger, or in addition to it, motion patterns (e.g. relative motion patterns) can be tracked (e.g. using angiography) between one or more portions (e.g. components or other features) of probe <b>100</b> and relatively stable (e.g. non-moving) portions of the patient's anatomy (e.g. ribs, sternum and/or spinal column).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">When a console <b>50</b> of system <b>10</b> is first installed at a clinical site (e.g. a catheter lab), a simple calibration routine can be used to establish the latency between the angiographic system and system <b>10</b>. Essentially, a probe <b>100</b> is provided, an angiographic system at the clinical site is engaged and an angiographic image feed is provided to console <b>50</b> (e.g. using any standard video connection, analog or digital). Angiographic system-provided video frames are registered according to a clock of console <b>50</b>, which is used as a reference time frame. A pullback (e.g. in a patient or in a non-patient simulation mode) of probe <b>100</b> is initiated (also coordinated by the console <b>50</b> clock) and captured by angiography. A trained user or technician reviews the angiographic image frames and designates the first frame in which motion was detected. This process establishes the associated latency according to the console <b>50</b> clock. The motion detection can also be automated, for example using a neural network trained to recognize probe <b>100</b> movement (e.g. movement of a marker band of probe <b>100</b>) under angiography.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some embodiments, a calibration procedure to establish the latency between an angiographic system and system <b>10</b>, and an imaging procedure performed during relatively low motion of a heart cycle, includes the following steps. In a first step, angiography is initiated once probe <b>100</b> has been inserted into the patient and deployed into the target anatomy. In a second step, system <b>10</b> analyzes the relative motion between one or more portions of probe <b>100</b> (e.g. motion of a marker band or other probe <b>100</b> portion which follows the beating heart of the patient) and more stable features in the image, such as images of the sternum or spinal column. Once a cardiac rhythm has been established and the low motion portion identified (typically 5-10 heart cycles are used for this analysis, which can be velocity vector analysis, neural network analysis, and the like), an indicator is provided and a system <b>10</b> &#x201c;metronome&#x201d; is started. System <b>10</b> can reference the output of the metronome, such as at the time that radiopaque flushing material is injected to clear the blood from the target area to be imaged, since the one or more portions of probe <b>100</b> (e.g. one or more marker bands) can become radio-invisible during this flushing period. In an alternative embodiment, a non-radiopaque flushing material can be used (e.g. dextran). In a third step, the flushing is started, such as by an operator or in an automated way controlled by system <b>10</b>. The flushing should continue over several heart cycles, such as 3-5 heart cycles. In a fourth step, clearing of the vessel to be imaged is detected by system <b>10</b> analyzing one or more of the images it produces. In a fifth step, at the low motion part of the metronome (e.g. a predicted low motion portion of the heart cycle), and accounting for the latency between system <b>10</b> and the angiographic system previously established, a pullback starts. In some embodiments, the pullback will finish in about one-half of a heart cycle or less, such as to remain within the low motion portion of the heart cycle. System <b>10</b> can be configured to provide a pullback speed of at least 50 mm/sec, such as at least 100 mm/sec, or 200 mm/sec. In a sixth step, the pullback sequence of images, which include minimal motion artifacts, can be provided to the operator and/or used for CFD calculations, implant (e.g. stent) length measurements, and the like. The use of image capture during low motion, as described herein, avoids errors associated with motion artifacts, notably longitudinal motion artifacts.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, algorithm <b>51</b> is configured to perform one, two, or more analyses of the OCT data (e.g. filtering or other image processing analyses) that provide image stabilization (e.g. of displayed OCT data).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Imaging system <b>10</b> can comprise one or more interconnect cables, bus <b>58</b> shown.

After retraction, connector <b>180</b> can be removed from carrier <b>855</b> (e.g. lifted out of), and carrier <b>855</b> and imaging probe <b>100</b> can be re-advanced independently. For example, carrier <b>855</b> can re-advance via the bias of spring <b>852</b>, as the proximal end of linkage <b>891</b> is allowed to advance, and imaging probe <b>100</b> can be re-advanced manually by an operator of system <b>10</b>. Subsequent retractions can be performed by repositioning connector <b>180</b> in carrier <b>855</b> after both have been re-advanced. Carrier <b>855</b> can comprise a capturing portion, such as a &#x201c;cup-like&#x201d; geometry, a hook, or other capture-enabling portion, such that carrier <b>855</b> can only impart a retraction force on connector <b>180</b>.

In some embodiments, system <b>10</b> is configured to provide information that is used (e.g. by a clinician) to perform a treatment (e.g. an intervention), wherein the information is based on, at least, optical coherence tomography data. For example, OCT and other data gathered by system <b>10</b>, can be used to plan a treatment and/or predict a treatment outcome (e.g. the planning and/or predicting performed by system <b>10</b>, an operator of system <b>10</b>, or a combination of the two), such as to impact a treatment to be delivered to the patient (&#x201c;OCT-guided treatment&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;OCT-guided therapy&#x201d; herein).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">As described herein, imaging probe <b>100</b> can comprise at least one of: size (e.g. diameter and/or length), scan range, flexibility, and/or imaging capability configured to provide the improved imaging. Imaging probe <b>100</b> can comprise a size and/or flexibility configured to enable imaging of tight lesions within the vessel. As used herein, a tight lesion can comprise a lesion whose resultant lumen (i.e. the lumen within the lesion) comprises a diameter (e.g. the smallest diameter along the length of the lesion) of less than 2 mm (0.080&#x2033;). A commercially available OCT catheter positioned to image a lesion with a lumen of this small diameter would effectively block the proximally-applied flush media from propagating to locations distal to the lesion, preventing the use of this commercial device. However, imaging probe <b>100</b> can be constructed and arranged to image these tight lesions, for example lesions with a resultant lumen as small as 1.5 mm (0.060&#x2033;), 1.3 mm (0.053&#x2033;), 1.1 mm (0.043&#x2033;), and/or as small as 0.9 mm (0.036&#x2033;) can be imaged by imaging probe <b>100</b>. For example, the distal portion of imaging probe <b>100</b> can comprise an outer diameter of no more than 2.6 F (0.034&#x2033;), such as an outer diameter of no more than 1.7 F (0.022&#x2033;), such as to enable system <b>10</b> to be used to image potential vessels (e.g. arteries) to be treated that have a tight lesion, such as when the distal portion of imaging probe <b>100</b> is inserted into and through a stenosis, such as in a &#x201c;pre-treatment&#x201d; imaging procedure (e.g. a procedure performed prior to intervention or other treatment of the stenosis). As described herein, currently available OCT imaging systems can be too large to provide useful data (e.g. unable to pass thru and/or provide sufficient blood clearing in a tight lesion). Other types of imaging systems, such as angiography, may not provide sufficiently accurate results when imaging tight lesions (e.g. erroneously indicate no treatment is warranted, such as when providing FFR information). In some embodiments, system <b>10</b> is used to perform a pre-treatment imaging procedure (e.g. of a tight lesion) to gather data to enable OCT-guided treatment in which the data provided by system <b>10</b> (e.g. using images from at least probe <b>100</b>) is used by an operator (e.g. a clinician) to make decisions about a future treatment to be performed.

Each of optical fibers <b>313</b><i>a,b </i>terminate at a mirror, mirrors <b>314</b><i>a,b</i>, respectively, configured to reflect signals S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2 </sub>back to splitter <b>312</b>. Optical fiber <b>313</b><i>b </i>comprises a length greater than the length of optical fiber <b>313</b><i>a</i>, whereby the difference in length is selected such that signal S<sub>2 </sub>is delayed by a time equal to one-half of the period of signal S<sub>O </sub>(e.g. signal S<sub>2 </sub>is delayed one-half period behind signal S<sub>1 </sub>when signals S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2 </sub>return to splitter <b>312</b>). Splitter <b>312</b> can be configured to recombine the two signals reflected by mirrors <b>314</b><i>a,b</i>, and to transmit this recombined signal along a fourth optical fiber, fiber <b>315</b>, to imaging probe <b>100</b>. The recombined signal, signal S<sub>R</sub>, includes signal S<sub>1 </sub>and signal S<sub>2</sub>, whereby signal S<sub>2 </sub>comprises signal S<sub>1 </sub>offset by one-half of the period of signal S<sub>O </sub>and therefore falls into the time period where signal S<sub>1 </sub>is inactive. In this manner, signal S<sub>R </sub>comprises a greater duty cycle than S<sub>O </sub>(e.g. S<sub>R </sub>comprises a 100% duty cycle signal).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">This physical duplicating of the active portion of S<sub>O </sub>can provide various benefits: the duplication allows doubling the sweep speed of the laser (for example from 200 kHz to 400 kHz), or reduction of the sweep speed by 50% (from 200 kHz to 100 kHz), while still collecting the same amount of information (e.g. the same as the amount of information captured at 200 kHz). In the reduction configuration, it is possible to maintain the same amount the information (captured at 200 kHz), but at the same time, slow down the laser sweep by 50%, and allow the use of a slower k-clock which can allow reduced complexity electronics (e.g. reduced cost of detector, digitizer, and/or other electronic components).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, sectional anatomic views of an imaging probe within a vessel prior to and after a pullback procedure are illustrated, respectively, consistent with the present inventive concepts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates imaging probe <b>100</b> positioned within a vessel prior to a pullback imaging procedure.

Imaging assembly <b>300</b> includes a balanced interferometer, interferometer <b>320</b>, which is optically coupled to both light source <b>310</b> and a light measurement element, photodetector <b>330</b>. Interferometer <b>320</b> includes a reference arm, arm <b>322</b>, which is optically coupled to a reference pathway, pathway <b>340</b>, and a sample arm, arm <b>321</b>. Sample arm <b>321</b> is optically coupled to a sample pathway, pathway <b>350</b>, that includes the optical path of an attached imaging probe <b>100</b>. Interferometer <b>320</b> can be configured to receive light transmitted from light source <b>310</b> and it can optically split the received light to further transmit the light along both reference pathway <b>340</b> and sample pathway <b>350</b>. The light that propagates away from interferometer <b>320</b> along each pathway <b>340</b>,<b>350</b>, is reflected back along each pathway, and the reflections are received by interferometer <b>320</b>. Interferometer <b>320</b> then directs the reflected light received from each pathway <b>340</b>,<b>350</b> to photodetector <b>330</b>. Photodetector <b>330</b> produces a signal related to the reflected light (e.g. a signal related to the difference in phase, amplitude, polarization, a spectral difference, or any combination of these, in the light received from each pathway <b>340</b>,<b>350</b>). The signal produced by photodetector <b>330</b> is used by system <b>10</b> to generate an OCT image, for example, when processor <b>52</b> comprises a digital signal processor, which can be configured to process the signal and generate the OCT image.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The axial resolution of an OCT image is strongly dependent on the matched optical properties of reference pathway <b>340</b> and sample pathway <b>350</b>. For example, the optical dispersion of the optical fibers of pathways <b>340</b>,<b>350</b> should be approximately the same (e.g. the average dispersion along the length of each pathway) for the optimal OCT image resolution. In the illustrated embodiment, imaging assembly <b>300</b> incudes multiple reference paths optically connected to interferometer <b>320</b> via an optical switch, switch <b>342</b>. Switch <b>342</b> is optically coupled to interferometer <b>320</b> via a fiber, fiber <b>341</b>.

Each fiber <b>343</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>can comprise a different optical dispersion, for example, to cover a range of dispersion values likely to match the optical dispersion of imaging probe <b>100</b>. Switch <b>342</b> is configured to optically connect one of the multiple reference path fibers <b>343</b> to interferometer <b>320</b>. Switch <b>342</b> can be configured to switch between the multiple fibers <b>343</b> to connect the fiber that best matches the dispersion of a connected imaging probe <b>100</b>. It can be difficult and/or expensive to mass produce imaging probes <b>100</b> each comprising an optical dispersion within a narrow range of acceptable values. By enabling a wider range of dispersion values for imaging probes <b>100</b>, imaging assembly <b>300</b> can accommodate a more cost-effective manufacturing of the various probes <b>100</b>.

In some embodiments, the inner surface of chamber <b>1215</b> comprises a textured surface, such as a gear-like surface comprising one or more teeth, teeth <b>1213</b>. As core <b>110</b> spins, weight <b>1212</b> is pulled towards the inner surface of chamber <b>1215</b> via centrifugal force.
