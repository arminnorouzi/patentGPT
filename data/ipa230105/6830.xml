Some blockchain systems include multiple nodes that validate one or more transactions at a time to generate a block that contains the validated transactions. A hash function applied to each block can then generate a unique hash value for a block, which may be stored with the transactions in the block. As additional blocks are created, the hash values of each block can be used to ensure that stored transaction data is not modified by any party. Advantageously, if transaction data of a block has been modified, the hash function will no longer generate the known hash values for each subsequent block. In this way, the generation of blocks on a blockchain is capable of maintaining data integrity for a series of transactions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, blockchain systems may maintain anonymity of users. Transactions in blockchain systems may include any amount and type of information. For example, a transaction in a blockchain system may list addresses (e.g., physical or digital) for each party to a transaction, a transaction ID, a value of the transaction, and/or any other suitable details. In one embodiment, the address used by a party for a transaction can be changed for each new transaction. Accordingly, each transaction can include a unique public key as an address, as well as a private key that a party to the transaction uses to sign the public key and generate a digital signature. The digital signature can then be confirmed by one or more additional nodes of the blockchain system to ensure that the value of the transaction is owned by the party initiating the transaction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">While this form of asymmetric cryptography may provide anonymity, it may also enable the use of cryptocurrencies built on blockchain systems for illegal or illicit transactions. Furthermore, this level of anonymity can prevent or discourage certain regulated entities from engaging in use of blockchain technologies. For example, banking, medical, governmental, and other regulated industries can be prohibited from using blockchain systems for transactions because of record keeping requirements enforced by government agencies or industry standards.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to reduce potential issues from an anonymous blockchain system, described herein is a blockchain system that leverages biometric data from one or more of the parties to a transaction in order to provide access to the blockchain system. As described herein, biometric data may include any biometric data with some level of identifiability of an individual associated with a transaction. For example, biometric data may include a fingerprint data, iris/retinal data, facial data, blood-related data, any other suitable physiological data, or any combination of such data. The particular biometric data used may be selected based on characteristics of an individual that are unlikely to change, or change slowly, such that the biometric data will be useable for a period of time. Additionally, the biometric data should be specific enough to identify an individual over a period of time.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, biometric data from one or more parties to a transaction can be used in a variety of ways to improve the operation of a blockchain system. For example, in some embodiments, biometric data can be stored as part of the transaction to maintain a record of at least one of the parties involved. The biometric data can be simplified to a digital representation that provides appropriate characteristics before storing. In some embodiments, the biometric data may also be compressed, encrypted, or otherwise protected from unauthorized use when the transaction is recorded.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, stored biometric data for a transaction can be used by one or more approved nodes of a transaction when validating the transaction. For example, a bank may compare biometric data of a transaction to a known person associated with an address of a blockchain system in order to verify an identity of an approved user of the address. In some embodiments, the biometric data can be stored in an encrypted manner, such that only approved nodes can decrypt the biometric data to identify an individual.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, biometric data may be used within cryptocurrency wallets for identity verification of a user. For instance, a representation of biometric data can be provided to a biometric sensor and used by the wallet to identify an individual prior to enabling access to one or more addresses within the cryptocurrency wallet. In some embodiments, the wallet may include alternate security measures that enable recovery of addresses within the wallet when biometric data is no longer available. For example, biometric data may change with age, due to damage to a finger, eye, or face, due to death, or due to other circumstances. Thus, in some embodiments, addresses within a wallet may be recovered by providing evidence to an authorized node of identification other than the biometric data. In response, biometric data stored on the authorized node may be decrypted and used to unlock the wallet. Biometric data can be used in these and other embodiments to improve the operation of a blockchain system. Such embodiments are described further below with reference to the figures.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, blockchain systems can implement a blockchain-based cryptocurrency. In some embodiments, blockchain systems described herein may include transactions involving such cryptocurrency. In some embodiments, other information, such as information related to digital identification data, copyright and/or royalty data, real estate data, land data, title data, digital voting data, medical data (e.g., medical recordkeeping data), wills and inheritance data, asset data, logistics data, distributed storage system data, and the like can be stored in a blockchain using the systems and methods as described herein, with or without the use of a cryptocurrency. Additionally, some systems can be used to implement a cryptocurrency while also being used for one or more additional applications.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram that illustrates an example blockchain system <b>100</b>, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the blockchain system <b>110</b> includes multiple nodes <b>120</b>. The nodes <b>120</b> may be communicatively coupled to each other via a network <b>130</b>. Network <b>130</b> may be a public network (e.g., the internet), a private network (e.g., a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN)), or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, network <b>130</b> may include a wired or a wireless infrastructure, which may be provided by one or more wireless communications systems, such as a Wi-Fi&#xae; hotspot connected with the network <b>130</b> and/or a wireless carrier system that can be implemented using various data processing equipment, communication towers (e.g. cell towers), etc. The network <b>130</b> may carry communications (e.g., data, messages, packets, frames, etc.) between the nodes <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, a node <b>120</b> may be a combination of one or more computing devices. A computing device may be any suitable type of computing device or machine that has a programmable processor including, for example, server computers, desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones, set-top boxes, etc. In some examples, a computing device may be a single machine or may be multiple interconnected machines (e.g., multiple server computers configured in a cluster). A node <b>120</b> may also be a virtual machine that may execute on top of the host operating system of a computing device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, each node <b>120</b> includes a copy of a blockchain <b>121</b>. Each copy of the blockchain <b>121</b> may be stored in a data store of a respective node <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, one or more nodes <b>120</b> may not include a full copy of the blockchain <b>121</b>. For example, some nodes <b>120</b> may store only a portion of the blockchain <b>121</b>. The blockchain system <b>110</b> can store a record of transactions in the blockchain <b>121</b>. For example, the blockchain <b>121</b> may record transactions between different parties that include transfer of a cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency may be a digital asset that uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions that use the cryptocurrency. Transferring of the cryptocurrency and creating new units of the cryptocurrency may be secured using various cryptographic functions. The blockchain <b>121</b> may serve as the record of the transactions for the cryptocurrency. The blockchain <b>121</b> may also be referred to as a ledger, a distributed ledger, a distributed blockchain, or the like. In other embodiments, blockchain <b>121</b> may store transactions associated with digital identification data, copyright and/or royalty data, real estate data, land data, title data, digital voting data, medical data (e.g., medical recordkeeping data), wills and inheritance data, asset data, logistics data, distributed storage system data, etc.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the blockchain <b>121</b> includes blocks of transactions and at least some of the transactions may include biometric data <b>131</b> associated with a part of a transaction. For example, a user <b>140</b> may initiate a transaction in the blockchain system <b>110</b>. The user <b>140</b> can initiate the transaction using a client <b>150</b> that includes a number of addresses, private keys, public keys, or the like. In some embodiments, the client <b>150</b> may be a cryptocurrency wallet. In other non-cryptocurrency embodiments, the client <b>150</b> may be any client device capable of accessing the blockchain system <b>110</b>. The client <b>150</b> may be hosted on a computer system of the user or on a remote system. In some embodiments, the client <b>150</b> can be a stand-alone computing device that connects to network <b>130</b> to initiate a transaction within the blockchain system <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The client <b>150</b> may store and provide transaction data <b>122</b> associated with a transaction to be added to the blockchain <b>121</b> of blockchain system <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the client <b>150</b> may also include a record of biometric data <b>131</b> associated with the user. The biometric data <b>131</b> can include any biometric data that can provide some level of identification of a user <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, the client <b>150</b> may include one or more biometric sensors that acquire biometric data <b>131</b> by sensing features of the user <b>140</b>. For example, a biometric sensor may include a fingerprint scanner, an iris/retinal scanner, a facial scanner, an imaging device, and/or other sensors that can generate biometric data <b>131</b> from a user <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, the user <b>140</b> may have a separate biometric sensor that then provides biometric data to the client <b>150</b>. In a variety of embodiments, client <b>150</b> may receive biometric data from any device, internal or external to client <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the client <b>150</b> may initiate a transaction (e.g., corresponding to transaction data <b>122</b>) in the blockchain system <b>110</b> by providing a public key, such as an address, and a digital signature to demonstrate ownership of cryptocurrency (or other data) at the address. In some embodiments, the client <b>150</b> verifies an identity of the user <b>140</b> using the biometric data <b>131</b> prior to initiating a transaction. In some embodiments, the client <b>150</b> provides the biometric data <b>131</b> to blockchain system <b>110</b> in a request to initiate a transaction. The blockchain system <b>110</b> may then validate the transaction using previous transactions stored in the blockchain <b>121</b>. In some embodiments, the one or more nodes <b>120</b> of the blockchain system <b>110</b> may also use the biometric data <b>131</b> to validate the transaction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">After the transaction is validated, the nodes <b>120</b> may store the transaction data <b>122</b> in a new or current block of the blockchain <b>121</b>. In some embodiments, the biometric data <b>131</b> can also be stored in the blockchain <b>121</b> along with additional details (e.g., transaction data <b>122</b>) of the transaction. Because sharing of biometric data <b>131</b> could prevent the privacy of users of blockchain system <b>110</b>, the biometric data <b>131</b> may be encrypted or otherwise obscured for use by the blockchain system <b>110</b>. For example, biometric data <b>131</b> may be encrypted by the client <b>150</b> before initiating a transaction, by a node <b>120</b> before storing the transaction, or at other times throughout processing a transaction. In some embodiments, one or more nodes <b>120</b> or other entities with access to the blockchain <b>121</b> may have access to a decryption key that enables access to the biometric data <b>131</b> or an algorithm from which biometric data <b>131</b> can be reproduced from an obscured value. Additionally, to reduce the size of the blockchain <b>121</b>, in some embodiments, biometric data <b>131</b> can be compressed prior to storage. Thus, to access biometric data <b>131</b>, nodes <b>120</b> or another entity accessing the blockchain <b>121</b> may decompress and/or decrypt the biometric data <b>131</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, different nodes <b>120</b> may perform different transaction-validation operations. For example, the client <b>150</b> or user <b>140</b> may be associated with one or more of the nodes <b>120</b>. The node(s) <b>120</b> associated with the client <b>150</b> or user <b>140</b> may have access to a private key for decrypting biometric data <b>131</b> associated with the transaction. That node <b>120</b> may provide validation of the biometric data <b>131</b> as compared to records of the node. Additional nodes <b>120</b> may provide validation of the additional transaction details (e.g., transaction data <b>122</b>). For example, additional nodes <b>120</b> can provide validation by a sufficient (e.g., threshold) number of the nodes verifying the transaction is valid according to previous records in the blockchain <b>121</b>. Thus, in some embodiments, the transaction may receive different validation results from certain nodes <b>120</b> than from others. In some embodiments, the transaction may also include a record (e.g., identifier) of a node <b>120</b> associated with the user <b>140</b> or client <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram that illustrates an example blockchain <b>121</b>, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments, system <b>300</b> may include authorized validation nodes <b>350</b> to perform similar or additional tasks as those performed by nodes <b>320</b>. The blockchain system <b>300</b> may include one or more orchestrator nodes (e.g., orchestrator <b>340</b>) to route transactions, hashes, stored blocks, or other data through the blockchain system <b>300</b>. For example, the orchestrator <b>340</b> may determine one or more nodes <b>320</b> of the system, to which to route a transaction for validation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the blockchain system <b>300</b> may receive a transaction initiation, including transaction data, from a client <b>330</b>. The transaction data can include an address of another party to the transaction. In a variety embodiments, the transaction data <b>322</b> may include an amount of cryptocurrency to transfer in the transaction, digital identification data, copyright and/or royalty data, real estate data, land data, title data, digital voting data, medical data (e.g., medical recordkeeping data), wills and inheritance data, asset data, logistics data, distributed storage system data, etc. In some embodiments, the client <b>330</b> may include biometric data <b>332</b> as transaction data <b>322</b> (or in addition to transaction data <b>322</b>) when initiating a transaction. The transaction data <b>322</b> from the client <b>330</b> can be routed (e.g., by orchestrator <b>340</b>) through network <b>305</b> to one or more nodes <b>320</b>, authorized validation nodes <b>350</b>, or other entities. In some embodiments, all nodes <b>320</b> in a system are presented with transaction details (e.g., transaction data <b>322</b>) for validation. The transaction can then be validated after all nodes <b>320</b> have validated the transaction or a threshold number of nodes <b>320</b> have validated the transaction. In other embodiments, a subset of nodes <b>320</b> receive and validate transactions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, biometric data <b>332</b> may be provided with the transaction data <b>322</b>.

In some embodiments, each authorized validation node <b>350</b> may have stored biometric data <b>352</b> for each user of the blockchain system <b>300</b>. Advantageously, stored biometric data <b>352</b> may also be stored in a blockchain (e.g., a separate blockchain from that of blockchain system <b>300</b>). In some embodiments, the authorized validation nodes <b>350</b> may have stored biometric data <b>352</b> of only users that have an association or affiliation with the authorized validation nodes. For example, a financial institution such as a bank may have stored biometric data <b>352</b> of customers of the bank. Such stored biometric data <b>352</b> may be stored in a separate blockchain maintained by (and private to) the bank.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, an authorized validation node <b>350</b> may validate a transaction based on the transaction data <b>322</b> as well as the biometric data <b>332</b> received with the transaction. As discussed above, the biometric data <b>332</b> may be converted to an encrypted and/or compressed format for which the authorized validation node <b>350</b> has a decryption/decompression key. Thus, the authorized validation node <b>350</b> may decrypt the biometric data <b>332</b> for comparison to stored biometric data <b>352</b> that is not accessible to other nodes <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, all the nodes in the blockchain system <b>300</b> can be regular nodes <b>320</b> or authorized validation nodes <b>350</b>. Thus, validation may be performed without confirmation of biometric data <b>332</b> in some embodiments. Furthermore, in some embodiments, transactions may be validated using transaction data <b>322</b> that include biometric data <b>332</b>. In some embodiments, validation may include a combination of validating transaction data <b>322</b> by nodes <b>320</b> as well as validation of biometric data <b>332</b> by comparison to stored biometric data <b>352</b> for a user associated with the transaction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, after validation, biometric data <b>332</b> may be stored in a block of blockchain <b>321</b> with the additional transaction data <b>322</b>.

Furthermore, in some embodiments, an identification of a user that initiated the transaction can be stored in the transaction data. For example, an authorized validation node <b>350</b> can store a unique identifier for the user that can be used to track transactions within the blockchain <b>321</b>. In some embodiments, such a unique identifier may obscure the actual identity of a user, but can be used by one or more of the authorized validation nodes <b>350</b> to determine the identification of the user in case tracing the identity of the user is useful and authorized. In some embodiments, the biometric data <b>332</b> is formatted in a manner unique to the user, such as a unique representation of the user's fingerprint, so that the biometric data <b>332</b> can act as the unique identifier of the user when tracing transactions.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a first flow diagram of a method <b>400</b>A of integrating biometric data in a blockchain system, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. Method <b>400</b>A may be performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, a processor, a processing device, a central processing unit (CPU), a system-on-chip (SoC), etc.), software (e.g., instructions running/executing on a processing device), firmware (e.g., microcode), or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the method <b>400</b>A may be performed by a blockchain system as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> above.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Beginning at block <b>402</b>, processing logic receives, by a processing device, biometric data associated with a first party of a transaction to be added to a block of a blockchain system. In one embodiment, biometric data corresponds to one or more of: a fingerprint scan, an iris or retinal scan, or a facial scan. In other embodiments, any other form of suitable biometric data may be used. In some embodiments, the biometric data may be included in a request from which the transaction is initiated. In some embodiments, the blockchain system may validate transaction data before receiving biometric data from the first party. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the blockchain system may receive biometric data from additional parties to the transaction. In some embodiments, the biometric data may be received in an encrypted and/or compressed format.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">At block <b>404</b>, processing logic provides the biometric data to a validation node of the blockchain system. For example, the blockchain system may provide the biometric data to each node in a system. In some embodiments, the blockchain may provide the biometric data to a subset of validation nodes. For example, transactions may be distributed to only validation nodes associated with one or more parties of the transaction, to particular authorized validation nodes based on a random or round robin distribution scheme, or in another manner.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At block <b>406</b>, processing logic determines that the biometric data has been validated by the validation node. For example, processing logic may determine that the biometric data has been validated based on all or a portion of the nodes receiving the biometric data validating the data. At block <b>408</b>, processing logic, in response to determining that the biometric data has been validated, records, by the processing device, the biometric data in the block of the blockchain system.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the blockchain system may use transaction details of addresses within the blockchain system and/or the biometric data to validate the transaction. In some embodiments, the transaction details alone can be used by one or more nodes to validate the system. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the biometric data may be validated by a subset of nodes while the transaction details are validated by a different subset of nodes.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, processing logic may provide transaction data of the transaction to a node of the blockchain system and determine that the transaction data has been validated by the node. In one embodiment, the node is separate from the validation node used to validate the biometric data. In other embodiments, the same nodes may be used to validate both the transaction data and the biometric data. In some embodiments, the transaction data may include addresses for sending and receiving cryptocurrency within a blockchain system. The transaction data may also include one or more digital signatures. In response to determining that the transaction data and the biometric data has been validated, processing logic may record the biometric data and the transaction data in the block of the blockchain system. In one embodiment, processing logic may record an identity of the first party in the block of the blockchain system.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the biometric data may be encrypted and/or compressed before recording to the blockchain. Advantageously, this can protect the privacy of parties to the transaction. In some embodiments, the encryption keys used to decrypt/decompress the biometric data may be secured by one or more nodes having a relationship with one of the parties. An indication of the identity of such nodes may also be stored in the transaction data of the blockchain or may be evident from the addresses used in the transaction.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The embodiments described herein may store and utilize any amount of biometric data associated with any number of suitable parties. For example, in one embodiment, processing logic may receive second biometric data associated with a second party of the transaction (e.g., a buyer in a buy-sell transaction). Processing logic may then providing the second biometric data to the validation node, and, in response to determining that the second biometric data has been validated, record the second biometric data in the block of the blockchain system.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a second flow diagram of a method <b>400</b>B of integrating biometric data in a blockchain system, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.

For example, beginning at block <b>401</b>, processing logic receives a request from a requesting entity to access stored biometric data. At block <b>403</b>, processing logic determines that the requesting entity is authorized to access the stored biometric data. To determine whether the requesting entity is authorized to access the stored biometric data, any number of techniques may be used. For example, in one embodiment, processing logic may compare the requesting entity to a database of entities that are authorized to access the stored biometric data. In another embodiment, processing logic may determine that the stored biometric data is stored by a particular entity, and allow that entity unrestricted access.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At block <b>405</b>, processing logic decrypts the stored biometric data to provide to the requesting entity in response to determining that the requesting entity is authorized to access the stored biometric data.
