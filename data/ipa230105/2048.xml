The vehicle is flown to a desired position. Once at the desired position, a sensor mounted on the aerial vehicle is operated to capture a measurement. Typically, the aerial vehicles comprise propellers, which are driven by motors; when driven by the one or more motors the propellers rotate to generate a thrust force which enables the aerial vehicle to fly.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Disadvantageously, the propellers and/or motors tend to cause aerial vehicles to vibrate when they are in use. These vibrations are caused by imperfect balance of the rotating masses of propellers and/or motors causing forces and torques to act on the aerial vehicle, as well as due to aerodynamic interactions between the airflow generated by the propeller and other components of the aerial vehicles (e.g. pressure waves or tip vortices hitting the structure of the aerial vehicle). Therefore, if the sensor is operated during flight to capture a measurement, the vibrations can negatively affect the captured measurement. Many sensors take measurements in a specific direction (e.g. Pitot tube wind speed sensors, imaging sensors, and star trackers). Disadvantageously, the orientation of the body of many aerial vehicles is dictated by the need to orient lift-generating surfaces such that the effect of gravity on the aerial vehicle is opposed. To freely orient the sensor, many aerial vehicles use gimbals onto which the sensor is mounted to allow the pointing of the sensor in a direction of interest. Such gimbals add cost and complexity to aerial vehicles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, some aerial vehicles are equipped with imaging sensors, the measurements of which are images. When operated during flight, the vibrations result in motion blur in the captured images due to the camera vibrating during the exposure time; said motion blur is especially evident in low-light conditions where a camera requires a longer exposure time to achieve an image with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio which in turn requires the camera to remain stationary (or substantially stationary) for an equally longer amount of time; in addition, a &#x201c;Jello effect&#x201d; can occur due to the rolling shutter interacting with vibrations of the camera; an event-based imaging sensor/dynamic vision sensor may record a large number of pixel events due the relative motion of the sensor with respect to the environment caused by the vibrations. Preferably, the imaging sensor is an active pixel sensor because such sensors combine small size, low power consumption, and high capture frequencies. In a more preferred embodiment, the imaging sensor is a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) active pixel sensor due to its low cost, small size, and low power consumption. CMOS imaging sensors are particularly susceptible to rolling shutter (&#x201c;Jello&#x201d;) effects, which are greatly amplified by vibrations and therefore largely mitigated by this invention.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In other examples of the prior art aerial vehicles having a 3D scanning sensor (3D scanner) mounted thereon are widely used to record depth data that can be used to create three-dimensional models. The propellers and/or motors, when in use, can disturb and/or compromise the measurements taken by the 3D scanner; in particular, the vibration of the aerial vehicle caused by propellers and/or motors when the propellers and/or motors are in use can compromise the data by introducing motion blur, or by causing momentary changes in the orientation of the 3D scanning sensor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example the aerial vehicles are provided with one or more ultrasonic sensors and/or one or more laser-based sensors which may for example be used to measure distance such as the distance from the aerial vehicle to the ground. The vibrations which the vehicle undergoes, and/or the magnetic fields generated by electric motors in the vehicle, will result in noise in the measurements taken by the one or more ultrasonic sensors and/or the one or more laser-based sensors (e.g. the vibrations which the vehicle undergoes will result in a constantly changing distance from the aerial vehicle to the ground such that the one or more ultrasonic sensors and/or the one or more laser-based sensors will be unable to take a stable and/or accurate distance measurement).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example the aerial vehicles are provided with one or more microphones which are used to take sound measurements. In such an example the one or more motors which drive the propellers and/or the propellers themselves and/or the airflow caused by said propellers will cause sounds which will be &#x201c;noise&#x201d; for the sound measurements taken by the one or more microphones. In addition, the air flow caused by the aerial vehicle moving with respect to the surrounding air will cause sounds which will be &#x201c;noise&#x201d; for the sound measurements taken by the one or more microphones.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet a further example the aerial vehicles are provided with one or more magnetic field sensors which are used to measure magnetic fields. In such an example the current which flows to electric motors operable to drive the propellers to spin when the motors and propellers are in use, will generate a changing magnetic field which will be &#x201c;noise&#x201d; for the magnetic measurements taken by the one or more magnetic field sensors.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an aim of the present invention to mitigate or obviate at least some of the disadvantages associated with the methods of the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention, these aims are achieved by means of a method and/or aerial vehicle having the features recited in the independent claims; wherein the dependent claims recite optional features of preferred embodiments.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention will be better understood with the aid of the description of an embodiment given by way of example and illustrated by the figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates the flight path of an aerial vehicle which performs a method of taking a measurement using a sensor/measurement means mounted on an aerial vehicle, according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates the flight path of an aerial vehicle which performs a method capturing an image using a camera mounted on an aerial vehicle, according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the flight path of an aerial vehicle which performs a method of capturing an image using a camera mounted on an aerial vehicle, according to a further embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the flight path of an aerial vehicle which performs a method of capturing a measurement using a 3D scanner mounted on an aerial vehicle, according to a further embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the flight altitude, propeller speed, flight speed, and angle of attack of a fixed-wing aerial vehicle which performs a method of capturing an image according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the flight altitude, orientation, rotation speeds of rotary wings, of a multicopter which performs a method of capturing an image using a camera mounted on the multicopter, according to an embodiment of the present invention; and also provides a top view and side views of said multicopter.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF POSSIBLE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates the altitude <b>101</b> of an aerial vehicle which performs a method of taking a measurement using a sensor/measurement means mounted on an aerial vehicle, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The aerial vehicle comprises one or more propellers and one or more motors which are selectively operable to drive the one or more propellers; when the one or more propellers rotate they generate a thrust force which causes the vehicle to fly. A sensor/measurement means is mounted on the aerial vehicle; the sensor/measurement means is operable to take measurements. The sensor/measurement means may be of any suitable type and may take any suitable form; for example, the sensor/measurement means may be a magnetometer configured to take a single measurement or multiple measurements; in another example the sensor/measurement means may be a microphone configured to take a short sequence of measurements; in another example the sensor/measurement means may be a thermal imaging sensor/measurement means configured to capture a single image.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, between time t<b>0</b> and a first time instant t<b>1</b> the one or more motors are operating to drive the one or more propellers to rotate; the rotation of the propellers will generate a thrust which will cause the vehicle to fly (in this example to fly at a substantially constant altitude); however it will be understood that it is not essential for the vehicle to fly at a substantially constant altitude between time t<b>0</b> and the first time instant t<b>1</b>. It should be understood that in the present application the term &#x2018;motor&#x2019; includes electric motors as well as internal combustion engines, which typically cause even stronger vibrations due to the translational motion of the piston(s).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">At a first time instant t<b>1</b> a controller provided in the aerial vehicle receives a first command which indicates that the sensor/measurement means should take a measurement. This command may be provided by a user to the controller via a keyboard/control panel/or PC which is in wireless, or wired communication with the controller. In the present application the term &#x2018;controller&#x2019; describes a processing unit designed to compute one or more speed commands that, if provided to the one or more motors, configures the one or more motors to rotate at or close to one or more rotation speeds equal to one or more speed specified in said speed commands. In addition, said controller is connected to the sensor/measurement means; and said controller is configured such that the controller can initiate the sensor/measurement means to take a measurement.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In response to receiving the first command the controller turns off said one or more motors. When the one or more motors are turned off said motors no longer drive the one or more propellers to rotate and the rotation of the one or more propellers will begin to slow; if the one or more motors are turned off for long enough the propellers may eventually slow to a standstill. In most cases the one or more propellers will continue spinning due to aerodynamic torques (windmill effect).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">After the one or more motors have been turned off the controller then initiates the sensor/measurement means which is mounted on the aerial vehicle to take a measurement.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At a second time instant t<b>2</b>, which occurs after the sensor/measurement means has taken a measurement, the controller operates the one or more motors again to drive the one or more propellers to rotate; the rotation of the one or more propellers will generate a thrust. The controller will define a target speed of rotation for the one or more propellers; in order to counter the downward momentum of the vehicle, at the second time instant t<b>2</b> the controller defines said target speed of rotation for the one or more propellers in excess of the speed of rotation of the one or more propellers required to maintain a substantially constant altitude; the increased speed of the propellers will provide additional lift force necessary to counter the downward momentum of the vehicle; however, since the lift force results in an acceleration acting on the vehicle, the downward momentum of the vehicle may not be instantaneously changed, thus the vehicle will continue to decrease in altitude between the second time instant t<b>2</b> and a third time instant t<b>3</b>. However since during the time between the second time instant t<b>2</b> and a third time instant t<b>3</b> the downward momentum is gradually approaching zero momentum, the rate at which the vehicle drops in altitude slows between the second time instant t<b>2</b> and a third time instant t<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">At a third time instant t<b>3</b>, the controller operates the one or more motors to rotate the one or more propellers at a rotational speed required to maintain a substantially constant altitude thus generating sufficient lift to maintain the vehicle at a substantially constant altitude.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Advantageously, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, since the motors are turned off when the sensor/measurement means is taking a measurement the measurement taken by the sensor/measurement means will have a higher signal-to-noise ratio; specifically, the noise caused by vibration of the one or more motors or the one or more propellers, and any other potential measurement noise caused by operating the one or more motors (such as changing magnetic fields, combustion sounds, or heat) will at least be reduced or is substantially zero.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates the flight altitude <b>102</b> of an aerial vehicle which performs a method of capturing an image using an image sensor (e.g. camera) mounted on an aerial vehicle, according to an embodiment of the present invention.

Said main wing is designed to produce a lift force due to the air flow resulting from forward motion of said aerial vehicle with respect to the surrounding air which, at a certain minimum forward velocity, said lift force is in excess of the force resulting from gravitational acceleration acting on said vehicle.

In this example, the three or more elevons are operated such that the vehicle maintains a substantially constant orientation; specifically the three or more elevons are operated such that the angle of attack of the aerial vehicle remains substantially constant.

When said motor is turned off said motor no longer drives the propeller to rotate and the rotation of the propeller will begin to slow; the decrease in the speed of rotation of the propeller leads to a decrease in thrust; in turn, the decrease in thrust results in a decreasing flight speed. If the one or more motors are turned off for long enough the propellers may eventually slow to a standstill (however it should be understood that it is not essential in the present invention that the motors come to a standstill). In most cases the propeller will continue spinning due to aerodynamic torques (windmill effect).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Importantly, even though the motor has been turned off, the momentum of the vehicle causes the vehicle to continue moving forward. At a substantially constant angle of attack, the decrease in flight speed would lead to a decrease in lift produced by the main wing which would lead to a decrease in altitude; however, in this example, the controller operates said three or more elevons to gradually increase the angle of attack such that the lift force produced by the main wing remains substantially constant, and thus the altitude remains substantially constant.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">At a second time instant t<b>2</b> the controller initiates the camera to capture a single or multiple images (or in the case that the vehicle has a sensor/measurement means which can take a measurement, the controller initiates the sensor/measurement means to take a measurement). Said time instant t<b>2</b> may chosen to occur after a predefined amount of time after the time instant t<b>1</b>. In another embodiment of the present invention, the time instant t<b>2</b> depends on the speed of rotation of the propeller; specifically, the time instant t<b>2</b> may be defined as the time when the speed of rotation of the propeller has reached or has dropped below a predefined threshold value (which may be zero); said predefined threshold value may be determined by choosing a maximum allowed vibration magnitude such that a certain image quality is achieved, and then experimentally determining the propeller rotation speed that does not exceed said maximum allowed vibration magnitude.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Advantageously in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> of the present invention since the motor is turned off when the camera is capturing an image the image captured by the camera will have reduced motion blur.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">At a third time instant t<b>3</b>, which is after the image has been captured using said camera (or after the sensor/measurement means has takes a measurement), the controller operates the motor again to drive the propeller so that they increase their speed of rotation to a target speed of rotation (said target speed of rotation being defined by said controller); the rotation of the propeller will generate a thrust which will cause the vehicle to accelerate forward which causes the flight speed to increase. At a substantially constant angle of attack, the increase in flight speed leads to a increase in lift produced by the main wing; however, in this example, the controller operates said three or more elevons to gradually increase the angle of attack such that the lift force produced by the main wing remains substantially constant, and thus the altitude remains substantially constant. Since at the third time instant t<b>3</b>, the propeller is beginning rotation from a standstill (or from a slow rotation), it will take some time before the propeller reaches said target speed of rotation as defined by the controller; therefore the speed of rotation of the propellers will increase from zero to said target speed of rotation between the third time instant t<b>3</b> and a fourth time instant t<b>4</b>. At the fourth time instant t<b>4</b> the propellers will be rotating at said target speed of rotation defined by the controller. Said third time instant t<b>3</b> may be chosen to occur immediately after an image has been captured using said camera (or after the measurement has been taken by the sensor/measurement means); in another embodiment of the present invention, the third time instant t<b>3</b> can be chosen to maximize the time between the second time instant t<b>2</b> and third time instant t<b>3</b> such that for example multiple images can be captured by the camera (or multiple measurements can be taken by the sensor/measurement means) between the second time instant t<b>2</b> and third time instant t<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Although not explicitly required by the method disclosed herein, it should be understood that the third time instant t<b>3</b> should typically be chosen to occur before a critical time instant at which the flight speed of the aerial vehicle drops below a threshold speed required for maintaining a stable lift force (if the flight speed drops below said threshold, the aerial vehicle would experience a stall). Said threshold may be determined by physical modelling, flight experiments and/or numerical simulation of the aerial vehicle.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">After the fourth time instant t<b>4</b>, the aerial vehicle will continue to accelerate until it reaches the steady-state forward velocity at which the aerodynamic drag acting on the vehicle cancels the thrust produced by the propeller.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In another embodiment, the additional step of increasing the speed of rotation of the propeller before decreasing speed of rotation of the propeller thereafter is taken after the first time instant t<b>1</b> and before the second time instant t<b>2</b> so as to increase the forward momentum of the vehicle and thus increasing the time interval between the second time instant t<b>2</b> and said critical time instant at which the flight speed of the aerial vehicle drops below a threshold required for maintaining a stable lift force.

This first command may be provided by the user to the controller via a keyboard/control panel/or PC which is in wireless or wired communication with the controller. In another embodiment the system is fully autonomous, wherein the controller is pre-programmed to initiate the camera to capture an image (and/or to initiate the sensor/measurement means(s) to take a measurement) when the vehicle is at a predefined position and/or at a predefined time instant; in this embodiment advantageously the user does not need to send a first command to the controller.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In response to receiving the first command the controller operates the four motors to increase the speed of rotation of the four rotary wings to a rotation speed which is greater than the rotation speed required to maintain the vehicle at a substantially constant altitude; said increase in the speed of rotation of the rotary wings will cause the rotary wings to generate additional lift force which causes the vehicle to fly to a higher altitude level (i.e. to an altitude higher than the first altitude level).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">At a second time instant t<b>2</b>, which occurs after the first time instant t<b>1</b> as the four rotary wings are rotating at an increased speed of rotation, the controller configures the motors that are operable to drive rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> to rotate such that the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> decreases gradually to a predefined low target rotation speed (which may be zero). Shortly thereafter, i.e. after a predefined time interval (which is smaller than the interval between the second time instant t<b>2</b> and a third time instant t<b>3</b>; in this example about 30% of the time interval between the second time instant t<b>2</b> and a third time instant t<b>3</b>), the controller configures the motors that are operable to drive rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> to rotate such that the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> decreases gradually to said predefined low target rotation speed at a rate of decrease that is faster than the rate of decrease in the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b>; the different rate of decrease in speed of rotation of the rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> compared to the rate of decrease in speed of rotation of the rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> will result in a first time interval in which the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> is greater than the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b>, and in a second time interval in which the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> is smaller than the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b>; the momentary difference in lift forces produced by the rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> compared to the rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> during said first time interval will cause a momentary negative torque around the axis <b>512</b>; said momentary negative torque will cause the vehicle to accelerate in rotation around the axis <b>512</b>; the acceleration in rotation around axis <b>512</b> will cause the vehicle to build up angular momentum which will result in a change of orientation; the momentary difference in lift forces produced by the rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> compared to the rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> during said second time interval will cause a momentary positive torque around the axis <b>512</b>; said momentary positive torque will cause the vehicle to decelerate in rotation around the axis <b>512</b>; the deceleration in rotation around axis <b>512</b> will cause the vehicle to reduce its angular momentum to zero which will stop the change of orientation; at a third time instant t<b>3</b> the vehicle will however remain at an orientation that is different from the orientation at time to, the first time instant t<b>1</b> and the second time instant t<b>2</b>. After said first and second time interval i.e. at a third time instant t<b>3</b>, all four motors have reached said low target rotation speed; if said low target rotation speed is zero the four rotary wings will be at standstill after said first and second time interval. In this example both said first time interval and said second time interval are each 50% of the time between the second time instant t<b>2</b> and a third time instant t<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Importantly, even though the four motors have been turned off, the momentum of the vehicle causes the vehicle to follow a parabolic trajectory. When the four motors have been turned off, the vehicle will continue moving towards the maximum altitude along said parabolic trajectory.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">At a fourth time instant t<b>4</b> the vehicle will have reached maximum altitude along said parabolic trajectory; at this fourth time instant t<b>4</b> the vertical velocity of the vehicle will be zero, or at least will be substantially zero; in addition, the vehicle will be an orientation <b>515</b> that is different from the orientation at time to, the first time instant t<b>1</b> and the second time instant t<b>2</b>. At the fourth time instant t<b>4</b> the controller initiates the camera to capture an image (and/or in the case the multicopter has sensor/measurement means which can be used to take a measurement, at the fourth time instant t<b>4</b> the controller initiates the sensor/measurement means to take a measurement). A sensor may be provided on the vehicle which detects the vertical velocity of the vehicle (i.e. a velocity sensor), thus when the velocity sensor indicates that the vertical velocity is zero or close to zero the controller can detect that the vehicle has reached the maximum altitude along said parabolic trajectory i.e. fourth time instant t<b>4</b> has been reached. In one example, the vehicle comprises a velocity sensor which detects that the speed of the vehicle is zero, and will then send a signal to the controller; the controller initiates the camera to capture an image (and/or in the case the multicopter has sensor/measurement means, initiates the sensor/measurement means to take a measurement) in response to receiving said signal from the velocity sensor. In this manner the controller can initiate the camera to capture an image at the fourth time instant t<b>4</b> when the vertical velocity of the vehicle will be zero, or at least will be substantially zero.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">At a fifth time instant t<b>5</b>, which occurs after the camera has captured an image (and/or in the case the multicopter has sensor/measurement means, after the sensor/measurement means has take a measurement), the controller configures the motors that are operable to drive rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> to rotate such that the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> increases gradually to a high target rotation speed; said high target speed of rotation is selected to counter the downward momentum of the vehicle, at the fifth time instant t<b>5</b> the controller defines said target speed of rotation for the four rotary wings in excess of the speed of rotation of the four rotary wings required to maintain a substantially constant altitude. Shortly thereafter, i.e. after a predefined time interval (which is smaller than the interval between the fifth time instant t<b>5</b> and a sixth time instant t<b>6</b>; in this example about 30% of the time interval between the fifth time instant t<b>5</b> and a sixth time instant t<b>6</b>), the controller configures the motors that are operable to drive rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> to rotate such that the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> increases gradually to said high target rotation speed at a rate of increase that is faster than the rate of increase in the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b>; the different rate of increase in speed of rotation of the rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> compared to the rate of increase in speed of rotation of the rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> will result in a first time interval in which the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> is smaller than the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b>, and in a second time interval in which the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> is greater than the speed of rotation of rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b>; the momentary difference in lift forces produced by the rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> compared to the rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> during said first time interval will cause a momentary positive torque around the axis <b>512</b>; said momentary positive torque will cause the vehicle to accelerate in rotation around the axis <b>512</b>; the acceleration in rotation around axis <b>512</b> will cause the vehicle to build up angular momentum which will result in a change of orientation; the momentary difference in lift forces produced by the rotary wings <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> compared to the rotary wings <b>510</b> and <b>511</b> during said second time interval will cause a momentary negative torque around the axis <b>512</b>; said momentary negative torque will cause the vehicle to decelerate in rotation around the axis <b>512</b>; the deceleration in rotation around axis <b>512</b> will cause the vehicle to reduce its angular momentum to zero which will stop the change of orientation; at a sixth time instant t<b>6</b> the vehicle will have returned to an orientation that is equal to the orientation at time to, the first time instant t<b>1</b> and the second time instant t<b>2</b>. After said first and second time interval i.e. at a sixth time instant t<b>6</b>, all four motors have reached said high target rotation speed.

However since during the time between the sixth time instant t<b>6</b> and a seventh time instant t<b>7</b> the downward momentum is gradually decreasing to zero, the rate at which the vehicle drops in altitude slows between the sixth time instant t<b>6</b> and a seventh time instant t<b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">At a seventh time instant t<b>7</b>, the controller operates the four motors to rotate the rotary wings at a rotational speed required to maintain a substantially constant altitude thus generating sufficient lift to maintain the vehicle at a substantially constant altitude.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The embodiment described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> achieves the same advantages as the embodiment described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; in addition, an additional step of changing the orientation of the vehicle prior to turning off the motors and following along its parabolic trajectory allows to point the camera (and/or sensor/measurement means) attached to the vehicle to be orientated in an arbitrary way without the need of additional hardware such as, for example, gimbals.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that for example the change in orientation between the time instants t<b>2</b> and t<b>3</b>, as well as between the time instant t<b>5</b> and t<b>6</b> may be achieved through feedback control methods (such as PID control, LQR, feedback linearization, nonlinear control etc.) without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As mentioned throughout this description while many of the embodiments are described as having an imaging sensor e.g. a camera, which is used to capture an image, any other sensor/measurement means which can be used to take a measurement can be used instead of, or in addition to, said imaging sensor. In this case instead of, or in addition to, the attached imaging sensor, the aerial vehicle comprises a sensor/measurement means which can take a measurement(s). In this embodiment, the flight path of an aerial vehicle may correspond to the flight paths described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, but a step of taking a measurement using the sensor/measurement means is performed in place of, or in addition to, the step of capturing an image using said camera mounted on an aerial vehicle. It should be understood that said sensor/measurement means may take any suitable form; for example said sensor/measurement means may comprise any one or more of an ultrasonic sensor, a microphone, a magnetic field sensor, or a laser-based sensor.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">It will be understood that the aerial vehicle may take any suitable form. In the most preferred embodiment the aerial vehicle will comprise at least one propeller which is used for flight. The aerial vehicle may comprise a plurality of propellers which are used for flight (e.g. a multicopter). In another example the aerial vehicle may comprise one or more propellers which are used for flight and one or more elevons and/or one or more flaps. In another example the aerial vehicle may further comprise one or more wings that generate lift forces caused by the vehicle's forward airspeed and the shape of the one or more wings. Vehicles equipped with such lift-generating wings are referred to as fixed-wing aerial vehicles. It will be understood that if the aerial vehicle comprises one or more propellers and one or more wings then the vehicle may undergo a period of gliding using the one or more wings, during the time when the one or more motors which operate the one or more propellers are turned off (i.e. when the propellers are not rotating).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the some of the above presented embodiments the controller may turn off the one or more motors simply by preventing current from flowing through the electric motor. Disconnecting the one or more motors from the electric supply ensures that no power is provided by the one or more motors to the one or more propellers and the propellers reduce their speed and may eventually come to a standstill. It should be understood that the one or more motors may be combustion engines or any other types of motors; and the appropriate steps would be taken to turn off those respective motors or to slow down those respective motors.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In another embodiment the controller may turn off the one or more motors by rheostatic braking using braking resistors or the winding resistance of the motors. This rheostatic braking slows the propellers more quickly.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">It should be noted that in the present invention, one or several of the one or more propellers may be configured to generate lift forces (that is, thrust forces opposing gravity). Propellers generating lift forces are frequently referred to as rotary wings, and are typically configured such that their axis of rotation is approximately vertical (that is, approximately aligned with gravity) during flight.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">It should be noted that in the present invention, one or several of the one or more propellers may be configured to generate forward thrust forces (that is, thrust forces opposing drag in forward motion). Propellers generating lift forces typically contribute little to the lift forces causing the aerial vehicle to fly, and are typically configured such that their axis of rotation is approximately horizontal (that is, orthogonal to gravity) during flight. If the motor operable to spin the propeller is mounted behind the propeller (as seen during forward flight), such propellers are commonly referred to as &#x201c;tractor&#x201d; or &#x201c;puller&#x201d; propellers, while they are commonly referred to as &#x201c;pusher&#x201d; propellers if the motor is mounted ahead of the propeller.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the invention, the one or more motors operable to spin the one or more propellers may be any one, or any combination of multiple, machines that convert one form of energy into mechanical energy. In some embodiments, one or several of the one or more motors may be internal combustion engines (for example two-stroke spark ignition engines, four stroke compression ignition engines, or jet engines). In some embodiments, one or several of the one or more motors may be electric motors. In some embodiments, the electric motors may be brushless direct current (brushless DC, BLDC) motors, advantageously providing high power at low weight and precise electronic control.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">It should be understood that the motors may be slowed down or turned off by active braking of the one or more motors. Active braking of the motors includes, for example, any one or more of, providing a short circuit in electric motors, increasing pitch on a variable pitch propeller, sending motor brake commands, or rheostatic braking etc. or applying any other suitable braking mechanisms which can be selectively applied to the motor to slow its speed or to stop the motor entirely thereby turning off the motor. Advantageously, active braking allows a faster reduction of the propeller speed than if the propeller is only slowed by its drag torque, which reduces the overall duration of the method and reduces the amount of energy lost by the aerial vehicle during the maneuver.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Preferably, the active braking of electric motors is performed through generative braking, i.e. by operating the motor as a generator and storing the generated electrical energy in an energy storage (typically a battery which powers the motors when the motors are being driven). Advantageously, generative braking allows the recuperation of some of the kinetic energy of the motor and propeller by converting it back to electrical energy, making the execution of the method more energy-efficient.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments when the controller turns off the one or more motors the rotational kinetic energy which the rotating propellers have will be dissipated into heat or motion of the medium surrounding the propellers. In a further embodiment this rotational kinetic energy which the one or more propellers have after the one or more motors have been turned off, is harnessed through generative braking and is later used.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Various modifications and variations to the described embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. Although the invention has been described in connection with specific preferred embodiments, it should be understood that the invention as claimed should not be unduly limited to such specific embodiment.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">For example, in the above-mentioned examples illustrated in</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> it is disclosed that the motors are turned off; it should be understood that for all of the above-mentioned examples, instead of &#x2018;turning off&#x2019; the one or more motors the one or more motors may instead be &#x2018;slowed down&#x2019;. For example, the speed of the one or more motors may be reduced by 20%, 50%, 80% (or by any other predefined amount). In one example, the motor may comprise a rotor and stator, wherein the rotor is moveable (e.g. can rotate) with respect to the stator; the steps described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> are performed except instead of turning off the motors, the motors are slowed down; in this example the motors are slowed down by reducing the speed of rotation of the rotor.
