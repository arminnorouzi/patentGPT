They are made from a range of fibrous material, whether naturally occurring, such as cotton or wool, or synthetic, such as acrylic or polyester. Further, socks are made for a number of different reasons. Some are formed of thick material for providing extra warmth in cold weather or for providing extra cushioning for extensive walking and/or standing. Some are specifically manufactured for athletic undertakings, often including materials that have sweat and/or odor reducing qualities. Socks can be long and cover a person's leg, or be short, covering only the portion of the foot that will be inserted into a shoe.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Of the many potential features of a sock, providing comfort to a user is one of the most important. Attempts to provide more comfort from a sock typically include providing extra material on the sole of a sock or stitched padding in heavily used regions, such as the heal or ball of one's foot. Often times, however, these methods do not provide the comfort one needs, and thus other measures must be taken to provide sufficient comfort. One such measure may be in the form of extra cushioning within a shoe, whether incorporated in the manufacturing process or with after-market padded insoles. The drawback with this measure is that the cushioning within a shoe is only provided while wearing a shoe.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for knitted foot garments, such as socks, that provide greater comfort to the sole of a user than those currently offered.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a knitted foot garment including an upper, heel, toe, and sole knitted fabric portions integrally woven together to define a chamber. A plurality of encapsulated polymer pads are attached to and protrude from an outer surface of at least one of a heel, toe, ball and arch portion of the garment. The polymer pads contain gas infused gel to provide increased cushioning to the sole of the foot garment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is a further object of the present disclosure to provide a method for treating a knitted foot garment that provides added cushion to the knitted material of the sock, which includes the steps of heating a liquid polymer gel mixture, forcing gas into the mixture, agitating the mixture to create a gas infused mixture, injecting the gas infused mixture into a polymer template including a plurality of pads, attaching the polymer pads to the outer sole of a knitted foot garment, and cooling the gas infused polymer mixture.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a study of the following description when viewed in the light of the accompanying drawing, in which:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow chart showing steps for treating a knitted foot garment according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of knitted foot garments according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front view of the sole of the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of a portion of the sole in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a top view of the sole of a knitted foot garment according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the sole and upper of the knitted foot garment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> are perspective views of the knitted foot garment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a front view of a portion of the knitted foot garment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a flow chart shows a method for treating a knitted foot garment. The method includes heating a liquid polymer mixture, such as a silicone gel, forcing gas into the mixture, and agitating the mixture to create a bubble infused mixture. Once the bubble infused mixture is created, it is injected into a polymer template, which is attached to the outer sole of a knitted foot garment. The mixture is cooled to trap the bubbles in each of the encapsulated pads of the template. The gas infused bubbles results in cushioning on the bottom of a foot garment, which provides more cushioning than with standard polymer templates that do not include the gas bubbles.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, an embodiment of a knitted foot garment <b>2</b> is shown. It includes upper <b>4</b>, heel <b>6</b>, arch <b>7</b>, ball <b>8</b>, and toe <b>10</b> portions, all integrally woven together to define an inner chamber <b>12</b>. The upper contains an opening <b>14</b> through which a foot is inserted. The heel, arch, ball and toe portions together form the sole <b>15</b>. There are a plurality of encapsulated convex polymer pads <b>16</b> attached to and protruding from the outer surface of the heel, arch, ball and toe portions of the garment. The pads are made of a silicone gel mixture and are configured to correspond with the contours of the heel, arch, ball, and toe portions of a foot.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A first set of pads <b>16</b><i>a, </i><b>16</b><i>b </i>are attached to the toe portion. These pads include a first, elongated inner pad <b>16</b><i>a </i>and a set of a plurality of elongated outer pads <b>16</b><i>b </i>arranged around the inner pad <b>16</b><i>a, </i>generally outlining the inner pad. A second set of pads <b>16</b><i>c, </i><b>16</b><i>d </i>are also attached to the ball portion. These pads include a first, inner pad <b>16</b><i>c </i>having a generally kidney-shaped configuration and a plurality of elongated outer pads <b>16</b><i>d </i>arranged around the inner pad <b>16</b><i>c, </i>generally outlining the inner pad. A third set of pads <b>16</b><i>e, </i><b>16</b><i>f </i>are attached to the arch portion. These pads include a first, inner pad <b>16</b><i>e </i>having a generally crescent-shaped configuration and a second set of a plurality of elongated outer pads <b>16</b><i>f </i>arranged around the inner pad <b>16</b><i>e </i>generally outlining the inner pad. A fourth set of pads <b>16</b><i>g, </i><b>16</b><i>h </i>are attached to the heel portion. These pads include a first, inner pad <b>16</b><i>g </i>having a generally oval-shaped configuration and a second set of a plurality of elongated outer pads <b>16</b><i>h </i>arranged around the inner pad <b>16</b><i>g </i>generally outlining the inner pad.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The pads <b>16</b> have a high degree of flex and stretch, generally flexing and stretching to the degree that a standard knitted foot garment (i.e. sock) is capable of flexing and stretching. This is due to the pads including a silicone, gas infused gel. The material of the pads thus provides additional cushion to the knitted foot garment, but also allows the garment to flex and stretch to the degree a knitted foot garment would if it did not include the pads. This general flex and stretch are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref> with the multiple ways in which the sock is folded about itself (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>) and the way in which the pads stretch along with the knitted foot garment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). The flex and stretch, in combination with the significant portion of the outer sole <b>15</b> that does not include pads, results in a sock with pads that can flex and stretch to the same extent that a knitted sock without pads would flex and stretch.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">By attaching a plurality of pads <b>16</b> to portions of the knitted foot garment sole <b>15</b>, and specifically along outlines related to typical pressure locations of an individual's foot, the treated foot garment provides much-needed support in areas where foot pressure is often placed. However, again, the garment is not overly encumbered by the pads as are some products that include pads that cover all or the vast majority of the sole of a knitted foot garment. Attaching these gel pads <b>16</b> such that they replicate the contours of portions of a foot (i.e. toe, ball, arch and heel) ensures that a significant portion of the sole <b>15</b> does not include the pads. Preferably, to provide a high level of flex and stretch, the knitted foot garment includes approximately 75% nylon, 22% polyester, and 3% spandex.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">To create and attach the pads <b>16</b> to the sole <b>15</b>, a template with the above noted numerous pads is created. The pads include an inner chamber in which the silicone gel can be injected. As noted above, the silicone mixture is heated, gas is forced into the mixture, and the mixture is agitated to create a bubble infused gel mixture which is then injected into the pads of the template. Ultimately, the pads <b>16</b> are attached to the knitted foot garment sole <b>15</b>. This may take place prior to injecting the pads with the gel, or the pads may be attached and then injected with the gel. Once the gel is injected into the pads, the mixture is cooled to finalize the process encapsulation of the gas infused gel pads.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the silicone mixture <b>16</b> include a plurality of bubbles <b>18</b>, which are formed by forcing gas into a hot silicone mixture, agitating the mixture to form the bubbles, and encapsulating the mixture within the template to trap the bubbles in the pads. The addition of bubbles to the mixture provides increased cushioning over the silicone alone.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It will be understood by those with skill in the art that other liquid polymers could be used in the place of silicone, and a range of gasses could be used to provide the bubbles. Further, the pads can be arranged in different configurations with more or less pads depending on the desired level of cushion on the sole of the garment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although the above description with reference to particular embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present disclosure. It is therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative embodiments and that other arrangements may be devised and employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
