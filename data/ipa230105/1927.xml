description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0085214 filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein for all purposes by this reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a regenerative braking control system and a regenerative braking control method using a paddle shift of a hybrid vehicle, and more particularly, to a regenerative braking control system and a regenerative braking control method using a paddle shift of a hybrid vehicle, which perform a vehicle stop through regenerative braking using a paddle shift and allow hydraulic braking to be performed in a full vehicle stop state so that a micro behavior is capable of being suppressed when stopping to improve driving ability.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, by use of motors, eco-friendly vehicles such as hybrid vehicles and pure electric vehicles are driven and batteries are charged so that it is possible to obtain effects such as improvement in fuel efficiency and reduction in exhaust gas.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To the present end, a driving mode of the eco-friendly vehicle includes an EV mode in which the eco-friendly vehicle is traveling with only power of a motor, an HEV driving mode capable of obtaining an effect of reducing fuel efficiency when compared to acceleration using only an engine through power distribution between the engine and the motor, and a regenerative braking mode in which, when the vehicle is braking or traveling due to inertia, vehicle braking energy and inertia energy are recovered from the motor through power generation to charge a battery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As an example of controlling the regenerative braking mode applied to an electric vehicle, a motor torque (a wheel torque) is controlled according to a vehicle speed for each traveling situation so that a total of four or more regenerative braking steps may be automatically performed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the instant case, different deceleration control is performed for each of the four or more regenerative braking stages, and to allow a user to feel a sense of distinction between the four or more regenerative braking stages, an interval between the four or more regenerative braking stages is generally set to be constant.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, to travel with multiple gears like a manual vehicle, even the electric vehicle (an automatic transmission vehicle) is provided with a first paddle shift for a down shift and a second paddle shift for an up shift which are mounted on both side portions of a steering wheel. These paddle shifts provide a convenient advantage of rapidly performing a gear shifting without taking his or her hands off from the steering wheel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, a driver can directly adjust a regenerative braking mode using a paddle shift. For example, when a left pedal shift, i.e., a paddle shift for a down shift, is held, regenerative braking which decelerates at the greatest deceleration until a vehicle stops is performed. This is referred to as a one-pedal mode using a paddle shift.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For reference, the one-pedal mode is a mode capable of operating from vehicle traveling to a deceleration stop using only one accelerator pedal without operating a brake pedal. Without a brake pedal operation, regenerative braking according to the deceleration stop may be performed. This method using the paddle shift is one of methods of implementing the one-pedal mode.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, during actual traveling, when the regenerative braking mode applied to the electric vehicle is divided and performed in four or more regenerative braking stages, the driver feels a sense of distinction on different deceleration in each regenerative braking stage as a different feeling, and this is actually being raised as one of field claims.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the regenerative braking phase is continuously changed or when the one-pedal mode is executed to achieve a complete stop, the driver feels the most different feeling. This is because it is difficult to respond in real time to a situation in which a feeling of slightly moving back and forth according a road surface condition occurs immediately after the vehicle stops.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The information disclosed in this Background of the Invention section is only for enhancement of understanding of the general background of the invention and may not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that this information forms the prior art already known to a person skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Various aspects of the present invention are directed to providing a regenerative braking control system and a regenerative braking control method using a paddle shift of a hybrid vehicle, wherein a state in which a &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; paddle shift is pressed may be maintained for a predetermined time period so that a step of executing the regenerative braking for a stop may be performed, and in the instant case, when the vehicle speed reaches the stop state and is maintained for a predetermined time period, the hydraulic braking may be executed to assist a vehicle stop maintaining function, reducing heat generation of a motor and reducing energy.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Objectives of the present invention are not limited to the above-described objectives, and other objectives of the present invention, which are not mentioned, may be understood by the following description and also will be apparently understood through embodiments of the present invention.

and executing, by the second controller, the hydraulic braking when the second controller determines that the stop state of the vehicle has been maintained with the holding operation of the first paddle shift in the performing of regenerative braking.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Here, in the executing of the hydraulic braking, an amount of the hydraulic braking may be selectively controlled according to an inclination condition of the vehicle in a state in which the hydraulic braking is executed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, in the executing of the hydraulic braking, when an operation of the first paddle shift is input, among a plurality of preset deceleration steps according to deceleration due to control, an initial first step may be performed on the regenerative braking, and when the hold operation of the first paddle shift is performed, the control is changed to a final step for stopping the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, in the determining of whether a hold operation of a first paddle shift has been performed, when the hold operation of the first paddle shift is released and the operation of the first paddle shift is released, a deceleration step may be controlled upward to apply a regenerative braking torque which is greater than a regenerative braking torque before the first paddle shift is released.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Meanwhile, the regenerative braking control method using a paddle shift of a hybrid vehicle may further include determining whether an APS is executed according to an accelerator pedal operation with respect to the vehicle in the stop state due to the execution of the hydraulic braking; and in the APS execution determination operation, a hydraulic braking release operation, of selectively releasing the hydraulic braking in response to an input of an APS detection signal and performing an acceleration traveling in response to the input of the APS detection signal.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Other aspects and exemplary embodiments of the present invention are discussed infra.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is understood that the term &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d;

An indication of the operated automatic gear shifting stage is made through a gear shifting stage display device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, according to the vehicle, as a gear shifting operation portion for a manual mode operation of an automatic transmission, the paddle switch <b>100</b> configured for operating + and &#x2212;

or &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; operation of the paddle switch <b>100</b>, the deceleration is performed according to a corresponding deceleration step.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Meanwhile, the controller <b>300</b> controls a motor torque for the regenerative braking according to the deceleration control amount determined from the high-level controller <b>200</b>, and as a current state reaches a stop state in a state in which the deceleration is performed, the controller <b>300</b> controls to execute hydraulic braking.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the driver presses the first paddle shift <b>110</b> while the vehicle is traveling in the D stage, the deceleration is performed by as much as the deceleration control amount according to a corresponding torque map, that is, a set deceleration step B<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, as a hold operation input of the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is input from the high-level controller <b>200</b>, as described above, in a state in which the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is pressed and thus the deceleration is performed to the corresponding deceleration control amount due to the deceleration step B<b>1</b>, the controller <b>300</b> detects a state in which the press of the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is maintained for a predetermined time period (for a time A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to change the deceleration step B<b>1</b> to a final step B<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, in the state of being changed to the final step B<b>4</b>, it is determined that the vehicle reaches a stop, within 0 to 3 kph, and the stop state is maintained for a predetermined time period (for a time B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the controller <b>300</b> controls the motor torque for regenerative braking to be decreased and controls the hydraulic braking to be executed as a compensation for the decrease in motor torque.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above, when the stop state of the vehicle is maintained due to the execution of the hydraulic braking, since the use of the motor torque for the regenerative braking may be reduced when compared with before the execution of the hydraulic braking, heat generation in the motor may be prevented through reduction of the use of the motor and reduction of energy to be used in electric power generation may further be possible.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Meanwhile, since the vehicle in the state in which the hydraulic braking is executed corresponds to an inclination condition, the controller <b>300</b> may selectively adjust an amount (magnitude) of which the hydraulic braking is executed (a height C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, when it is determined that the vehicle stops in an ascending condition (an uphill condition) as a result of determining whether the presence or absence of an inclination is detected through a gyro sensor or the like in the state in which the vehicle stops, the controller <b>300</b> controls a braking torque which is relatively greater than a braking torque in a flat inclination condition to be applied to allow the hydraulic braking to be executed at a level at which the vehicle is not pushed in the ascending condition.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Here, the magnitude of the hydraulic braking may be determined through an equation of (A (constant)+m*g*sinB (inclination angle))*C (coefficient). In the instant state, when the execution of the hydraulic braking having the above magnitude is confirmed, the controller <b>300</b> controls the motor torque for the regenerative braking to be decelerated.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">This is because, even when the hydraulic braking torque is applied to prevent a push in the inclination condition such as the ascending or descending, the motor torque for the regenerative braking is controlled to be remained in a reduced state so that, even when the application of the hydraulic braking torque is released in the worst case, the push may be prevented through the motor torque maintained in a state of being applied.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Consequently, according to the related art, a variance of a vehicle speed is determined in consideration of the ascending or descending condition, and the motor torque for the regenerative braking is generated through feedback control according to the variance. However, in the instant case, immediately after the vehicle stops through the motor torque, a feeling that the vehicle moves slightly forwards and backwards may occur according to the ascending or descending condition. In various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the hydraulic braking is executed in the state in which the vehicle stops so that the above problem according to the related art may be solved.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Meanwhile, the controller <b>300</b> determines whether to execute an accelerator position sensor (APS) according to an accelerator pedal operation, that is, controls the hydraulic braking to be selectively released through a turning on or off with respect to the vehicle in the stop state due to the execution of the hydraulic braking.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In other words, when the controller <b>300</b> executes the hydraulic braking in the state in which the vehicle stops, even when the press on the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is released, the vehicle does not move. Here, the controller <b>300</b> controls the hydraulic braking to be released only when an ON signal according to the accelerator pedal operation is transmitted, except for the paddle switch <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Hereinafter, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a regenerative braking control method using a paddle shift of a hybrid vehicle according to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the regenerative braking control method using a paddle shift of a vehicle according to the exemplary embodiment will be sequentially referred to as follows.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">First, in a state in which a shift lever is in a D stage, the application of the motor torque for the regenerative braking is executed due to a turning off the accelerator pedal operation, when it is determined that the vehicle speed ranges 0 to 3 kph or more, the accelerator pedal and the brake pedal are in a state of being not operated, and the shift lever corresponds to a D stage (S<b>100</b>), it is determined whether an operation of the first paddle shift <b>110</b> for a down shift is input from the high-level controller <b>200</b> (S<b>200</b>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the instant case, when the operation of the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is input and the corresponding operation is maintained, that is, an operation state with respect to the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is maintained for a first set time and determination on a hold operation is performed (S<b>300</b>), regenerative braking for reaching a stop state of the vehicle is performed by the controller <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the operation of the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is input (S<b>200</b>), the controller <b>300</b> performs an initial first step B<b>1</b> among predetermined deceleration steps (see B<b>1</b> to B<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) first according to the deceleration due to the regenerative braking control. Afterward, when a press time for the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is maintained for the first set time, the controller <b>300</b> controls to change to the final step B<b>4</b> for stopping (S<b>400</b>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Here, in the case of the first step B<b>1</b> to the fourth step, that is, the final step B<b>4</b>, different motor torques are mapped and stored as a torque map, and the stop of the vehicle may be performed in only the state of being changed to the final step B<b>4</b>. Accordingly, through the determination whether the press time for the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is maintained for the first set time, that is, the change to the final step B<b>4</b>, determination on the vehicle stop is selectively performed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the instant case, when it is determined that the operation state for the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is not maintained for a predetermined time period (S<b>300</b>), whether the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is pressed is determined (S<b>310</b>). When it is determined that the press for the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is released, since the accelerator pedal and the brake pedal are in a state of being not operated, the first step B<b>1</b> is increased to a second step to generate a regenerative braking torque which is greater than a regenerative braking torque of the first step B<b>1</b> (S<b>320</b>).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, when it is determined that the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is in a state of being pressed as a result of determining whether the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is pressed (S<b>310</b>), whether the hold operation for the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is performed is determined again.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">On the other hand, when it is determined that the controller <b>300</b> performs control using the motor torque for the regenerative braking corresponding to a final step B<b>4</b> (S<b>400</b>), and when the vehicle speed is in the vehicle stop state, for example, corresponds within 0 to 3 kph (S<b>500</b>), whether the vehicle speed is maintained in the corresponding stop state for a second set time is determined (S<b>600</b>).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">When it is determined that the vehicle stop state is maintained for the second set time (S<b>600</b>), the controller <b>300</b> controls the hydraulic braking to be executed (S<b>700</b>). When it is determined that the vehicle stop state is maintained to be less than the second set time (S<b>600</b>), a standby is performed to maintain the vehicle stop state again for more than the second set time.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">This is to prevent a different feeling because, when the vehicle stop state is determined and the hydraulic braking is immediately executed without the passage of the second set time period (S<b>700</b>), the regenerative braking and the hydraulic braking may act together, and thus the different feeling may occur.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, as described above, when the stop state of the vehicle is maintained due to the execution of the hydraulic braking, since the use of the motor torque for the regenerative braking may be reduced when compared with before the execution of the hydraulic braking, heat generation in the motor may be prevented through reduction of the use of the motor and reduction of energy to be used in electric power generation may further be possible.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Furthermore, as described above, in controlling the hydraulic braking to be executed by the controller <b>300</b> (S<b>700</b>), as the condition of the stop vehicle corresponds to the inclination condition, the controller <b>300</b> may selectively adjust an amount (magnitude) of which the hydraulic braking is executed (the height C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, when it is determined that the vehicle stops in an ascending condition (an uphill condition) as a result of determining whether the presence or absence of an inclination is detected through a gyro sensor or the like in the state in which the vehicle stops, the controller <b>300</b> controls a braking torque which is relatively greater than a braking torque in a flat inclination condition to be applied to allow the hydraulic braking to be executed at a level at which the vehicle is not pushed in the ascending condition.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above, when the stop state of the vehicle is maintained due to the execution of the hydraulic braking, since the use of the motor torque for the regenerative braking may be reduced when compared with before the execution of the hydraulic braking, heat generation in the motor may be prevented through reduction of the use of the motor and reduction of energy to be used in electric power generation may further be possible.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thereafter, the controller <b>300</b> determines whether to execute the APS according to an accelerator pedal operation, that is, controls the hydraulic braking to be selectively released through a turning on or off with respect to the vehicle in the stop state due to the execution of the hydraulic braking (S<b>800</b>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In other words, when the controller <b>300</b> executes the hydraulic braking in the state in which the vehicle stops, even when the press on the first paddle shift <b>110</b> is released, the vehicle does not move.
