The disclosure also provides precursors of such radiohalogen prosthetic moieties. The radiohalogen prosthetic moieties can effectively retain radioactivity from biomolecules that become internalized within cells, rendering such moieties and corresponding radiolabeled biomolecules useful in the diagnosis and treatment of disease, particularly cancer.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Radioiodination is one of the simplest ways to radiolabel a biomolecule. Several radioisotopes of iodine are available for imaging and targeted radiotherapy of cancer. Radioisotopes of iodine are supplied as alkaline solutions and iodine is present in these in an oxidation state of &#x2212;1 (I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>; iodide). The standard method for biomolecule radioiodination requires oxidation of the iodine to the +1 oxidation state for electrophilic substitution into tyrosine amino acids present in biomolecules such as antibodies, other proteins and peptides. Challenges of thus radioiodinated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and peptides include their instability in vivo to proteolysis inside cells after internalization, deiodination, and as a consequence of both processes, loss of radioactivity from tumor cells. It is widely recognized that radioiodinated antibodies and peptides are proteolytically degraded inside cells after internalization (which can occur as a consequence of binding to receptors and certain antigens), to radioiodotyrosine that is efficiently exported from the cells by membrane amino acid transporters. Released radioiodotyrosine is deiodinated by deiodinases found in tissues and the free radioiodine redistributes and accumulates in organs with sodium iodide symporter expression, particularly the thyroid, stomach, and salivary glands. Thus, the amount of radiolabel that is retained in tumors is diminished and concomitantly, the uptake of radioactivity in normal tissues is increased.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the disadvantages of antibodies is their long half-life in the bloodstream, which results in high background levels after systemic administration and, consequently, in low tumor to background ratios. Moreover, conventional antibodies have a rather slow diffusion into solid tumors, which prevents them from reaching and binding to receptor/antigen in the entire tumor mass homogeneously.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While some prosthetic agents have been identified in the art, they are unstable and hard to produce in commercial quantities. Moreover, the uptake of antibodies into tumor cells, particularly brain metastases, is low due to the size of the antibodies, which is particularly problematic for tumors in the brain because of delivery restrictions imposed by the blood brain barrier. Therefore, there is a need for further prosthetic agents that can be used to radiolabel biomolecules for targeted radiotherapies and imaging applications.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention is drawn to prosthetic agents, precursors thereof, and compositions for radiolabeling biomolecules (also referred to as macromolecules) with radioactive halogen atoms, and in particular, with radioactive iodine. Advantageously, such methods, compounds, and compositions may minimize loss of the radioactive halogen due to dehalogenation in vivo, preserve the biological activity of the biomolecule, maximize retention in diseased cells, such as cancer cells, and/or minimize the retention of radioactivity in normal tissues after in vivo administration.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The biomolecules have an affinity for particular types of cells. That is, the biomolecules may specifically bind a certain cell, such as a cancer cell. Certain compositions of the invention include the radiolabeled biomolecules. Such biomolecules include antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, peptides, other proteins, nanoparticles and aptamers. Such examples of biomolecules for purposes of the invention include, diabodies, scFv fragments, DARPins, fibronectin type III-based scaffolds, affibodies, VHH molecules (also known as single domain antibody fragments (sdAb) and nanobodies), nucleic acid or protein aptamers, and nanoparticles. Additionally, larger molecules such as proteins &#x3e;50 kDa including antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, and F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragments can be used in the methods disclosed herein. In addition, nanoparticles with a size less than 50 nm can be used in the methods disclosed herein. The principles disclosed herein are, in some embodiments, particularly relevant to VHH molecule and other types of small protein constructs (although it is not limited thereto), as will be described more thoroughly herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As such, the disclosure provides such radiolabeling moieties (referred to herein as &#x201c;radiohalogen prosthetic moieties&#x201d;), as well as precursors to afford such prosthetic moieties (referred to herein as &#x201c;radiohalogen precursors&#x201d;). The disclosure further provides radiolabeled macromolecules (e.g., biomolecules) comprising such radiohalogen prosthetic moieties and one or more macromolecules. In some such embodiments, these radiolabeled macromolecules are targeted radiotherapeutic agents. The prosthetic moieties and radiolabeled macromolecules of the invention are useful, e.g., for diagnosing disease and for targeted radiotherapy.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure

MC can be any polydentate chelate moiety and may be cyclic or acyclic. The composition of MC can vary. MC can be either uncomplexed (lacking a metal) or complexed with the stable (nonradioactive) or radioactive form of a metal. In some embodiments, the metal is a metal of any charge, with a +2, +3, or +4 charge preferred. In certain embodiments, the metal is a trivalent metal (M<sup>+3</sup>) such as lutetium, yttrium, indium, actinium, or gallium and in certain embodiments, specific radioactive metals that can be complexed with the MC include, but are not limited to, radioactive metals selected from the group consisting of <sup>177</sup>Lu, <sup>64</sup>Cu, <sub>67</sub>Cu, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>90</sup>Y, <sup>225</sup>Ac, <sup>213</sup>Bi, <sup>212</sup>Pb, <sup>212</sup>Bi, <sup>67</sup>Ga, <sup>68</sup>Ga, <sup>89</sup>Zr, and <sup>227</sup>Th. It is noted that this list is not exhaustive and, although these exemplified radioactive and non-radioactive metals are trivalent, certain MCs that may be used according to the present invention may bind metals of other valencies, and such metals and MCs containing such metals are also encompassed herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0049">In some embodiments, MC is a macrocyclic ligand, consisting of a ring containing 8 or more atoms, bearing at least 3 negatively charged substituents such as carboxyl or phosphonate groups. Exemplary macrocyclic ligands suitable as the MC group include 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA), 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-1,4,8,11-tetraacetic acid (TETA), and 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-tri(methylene phosphonic acid) (NOTP). In other embodiments, MC is MeO-DOTA, as disclosed in Gali et al., Anticancer Research (2001), 21(4A), 2785-2792), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0050">The present disclosure specifically recognizes advantages of employing a functionalized MC group, e.g., a modified DOTA or a modified NOTA. One exemplary modified DOTA is DOTA-tris(t-Bu ester), i.e., DOTA comprising tert-butyl acetate groups associated with each nitrogen atom other than the nitrogen atom when it is used to connect to &#x201c;T.&#x201d; Such a compound, suitable for reaction to provide MC-T is also referred to as tri-tert-butyl 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-tricarboxylate. Upon removal of the tert-butyl protecting groups, a deprotected form is provided, which can be referred to as 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-tricarboxylic acid. A further modified DOTA that may find use in certain embodiments of the disclosure is an acyclic analogue, e.g., an acyclic analogue of DOTA or an acyclic analogue of a modified DOTA. One exemplary tert-butyl acetate-functionalized acyclic DOTA that can be reacted to form MC-T is tert-butyl (2-(2-((2-aminoethyl)(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl)(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl)glycinate. Upon removal of the tert-butyl protecting groups, a deprotected form is provided, which can be referred to as (2-((2-((2-aminoethyl)(carboxy)amino)ethyl)(carboxy)amino)ethyl)glycine. Similarly, in some embodiments, a modified analogue of NOTA is employed, which comprises tert-butyl acetate groups associated with each nitrogen atom other than the nitrogen atom when it is used to connect to &#x201c;T.&#x201d; Such a modified NOTA can be di-tert-butyl 1,4,7-triazonane-1,4-dicarboxylate, which can be reacted via the nitrogen atom without a tert-butyl group attached thereto to give MC-T.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0051">Although not intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that such acetate substituents (or acetic acid substituents, upon deprotection of the modified DOTA/NOTA MC groups) provide some degree of stabilization of the DOTA/NOTA (or analogue thereof) chelation moiety. It is understood that, in all figures herein providing a tert-butyl acetate group associated with the MC group, although shown with t-butyl, the deprotected form (comprising an acetic acid group in place of the tert-butyl acetate group) is also intended to be encompassed herein.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0052">Certain such modified &#x201c;MC&#x201d; groups are shown below in Formulas B-1, B-2, and B-3, respectively, with one feasible point of attachment to &#x201c;T&#x201d; shown on each depicted &#x201c;MC&#x201d; moiety, providing relevant radiohalogen precursor moieties, and radiohalogen prosthetic moieties, and radiolabeled biomolecules comprising the same.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-C00012" he="98.81mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230002293A1-20230105-C00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0070" num="0053">According to the present disclosure, MC is connected to the remainder of the prosthetic/precursor moiety (comprising &#x201c;T&#x201d;) via any relevant atom, e.g., via a carbon or nitrogen associated with the MC (although not limited thereto) to give corresponding radiohalogen precursors and prosthetic moieties.

In some embodiments, MMCM is an active ester. An active ester is defined herein as an ester that can be conjugated with amine groups present on a macromolecule/biomolecule (e.g., a peptide or protein) under mild conditions, i.e., conditions that will not result in loss of biological function of the macromolecule/biomolecule. Exemplary such MMCM groups include, but are not limited to, a N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester or a tetrafluorophenol (TFP) ester, an isothiocyanate group, or a maleimide group. Such MMCMs generally result in random (non-site specific) labeling of amine groups on the protein or peptide. In other embodiments, MMCM provides for site-specific conjugation to be performed using an enzyme such as Sortase, which results in conjugation to only one site on the protein (either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the protein). In the case of Sortase, MMCM is, e.g., the tripeptide GlyGlyGly. Enzymes that may be employed for obtaining suitable conjugation are not particularly limited and include, for example, translugaminase, lipoic acid ligase, farnesyl transferase, and many more, such as those disclosed, e.g., in Massa et al., <i>Exp. Opin. Drug Del. </i>2016, 13(8), pp. 1149-1163; Zhang et al., <i>Chem. Soc.
