In such an embodiment, M&#xd7;N antenna elements may transmit and receive signals of RF_TRX_H<b>1</b> to RF_TRX_VMN. A signal in the mmWave band (e.g., a signal having a frequency of 20 gigahertz (GHz) or higher) may exhibit a higher attenuation characteristic (e.g., 20 decibels (dB) to 30 dB or higher) compared to a signal in an existing band (e.g., a signal having a frequency within the 6 GHz band). To overcome a coverage degradation issue thus arisen, a front end structure for simultaneously transmitting and receiving phase-aligned signals through a plurality of antenna elements disposed in an array form may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The amplifying circuit <b>220</b> may be connected to each antenna element of the array antenna module <b>210</b>.

In addition, a CPE model supporting Power Class 1 of 5G frequency range 2 (&#x201c;FR2&#x201d;) mmWave may use peak EIRP performance of over 40 decibel-milliwatts (dBm), and the antenna circuit <b>410</b> may realize peak performance where the array antenna modules <b>411</b> with elements formed in a 4&#xd7;4 array are disposed in a 2&#xd7;2 array.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">The array antenna modules <b>411</b> may be fixed to a circuit board.

If misalignment occurs among the array antenna modules <b>411</b>, the array antenna factor may decrease. A radiation pattern of an array structure antenna may be represented as multiplication of a pattern of a single antenna and an array antenna factor according to an antenna theory.
