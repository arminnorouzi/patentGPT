of the background of the invention is merely provided to aid the reader in understanding the invention and is not admitted to describe or constitute prior art to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lateral flow assay devices are widely used in many different areas of analytical chemistry and medicine, and have become the format of choice for tests such as immunoassays which are to be performed by relatively untrained users in a rapid testing protocol. Typically, the devices and methods allow for application of a sample to a lateral flow matrix. The sample flows along the lateral flow matrix, and one or more analyte components to be detected in the sample react with at least one reagent which is provided in or added to the lateral flow matrix. At least one reagent is typically immobilized in the device for reaction with the analyte component to be detected or a reagent thereof, and labels are typically employed to provide a detectable signal that can be used to measure the extent of reaction with an immobilized reagent. See, e.g., U.S. patents and patent application publications: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,602,040; 5,622,871; 5,656,503; 6,187,598; 6,228,660; 6,818,455; 2001/0008774; 2005/0244986; U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,862; 2003/0207465; 2003/0143755; 2003/0219908; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,389; 5,989,921; 6,485,982; Ser. No. 11/035,047; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,656,448; 5,559,041; 5,252,496; 5,728,587; 6,027,943; 6,506,612; 6,541,277; 6,737,277 B1; 5,073,484; 5,654,162; 6,020,147; 4,956,302; 5,120,643; 6,534,320; 4,942,522; 4,703,017; 4,743,560; 5,591,645; and RE 38,430.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lateral flow assay devices may comprise a housing having a sample port and a result window downstream of the sample port, and, optionally, a control window separate from the result window. The sample port is adapted to receive a quantity of liquid buffer or sample applied thereto which traverses a lateral flow path via a bibulous matrix or capillary material within the housing, extending from the sample port to a downstream location. The housing may be formed of any suitable material, an example of which comprises molded plastic, and is preferably sufficiently rigid to provide support and stability for the lateral flow path or paths housed therein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electronic readers for use in combination with lateral flow assay devices are also known. These readers measure the detectable label that is used for determining the concentration and/or amount of analyte in a fluid sample. EP653625 discloses such a device which uses an optical method in order to determine the result. Typically, an assay test strip is inserted into a reader such that the strip is aligned with optics provided by reader. Light from a source of electromagnetic radiation, such as a light emitting diode (LED), laser, etc., is directed toward the test strip at the detection (and optionally control) zone and reflected or transmitted or fluoresced light is detected by a photodetector in the reader. In certain readers, the reader will have more than one LED, and a corresponding photodetector is provided for each of the plurality of LED's.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An important consideration in assay reading devices of this type is the requirement that the assay reader and the test strip are carefully aligned. This is because the visible signal formed in the detection zone (and the control zone, if present) is fairly narrow (about 1 mm wide), so a small displacement of the detection or control zone relative to the respective photodetector may significantly affect the reading made by the photodetector. In addition, it is generally important that the photodetector is as close as possible to the test strip, because the amount of light which is &#x2018;captured&#x2019; by the photodiode is fairly small, and the signal intensity normally obeys the inverse square law, so that it diminishes rapidly as the separation between the test strip and the photodetector increases.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some cases, the reader and the lateral flow test device are provided as a single device. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,794 discloses a fully disposable integrated assay reader and lateral flow assay test strip, whereby optics present in the reader enable the result to be determined optically using reflectance measurements.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An alternative solution is taught by EP 0833145, which discloses a test strip and assay result reader combination, wherein the assay result reading device can be successfully triggered to make a reading only when there is a precise three-dimensional fit between the test strip and the reader, thereby ensuring the correct alignment has been obtained.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many lateral flow test devices are limited to answering yes/no questions such as those concerning pregnancy or influenza. That is, below a certain threshold of analyte concentration in the original sample, no detectable signal is perceived, and the result is interpreted to be negative. Above the threshold, the signal is detected, and a positive result is determined. Advantages of these tests are that they are relatively simple to perform and interpret, and relatively inexpensive to fabricate. However, to obtain quantitative or even semi-quantitative results, more sophisticated instruments are employed. Many important tests require a quantitative result, which is not always achievable in a lateral flow assay format.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide improved lateral flow test devices that can provide sensitive and accurate quantitative test results, and methods for the manufacture thereof.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a first aspect, the invention relates to lateral flow analyte test devices that contain an integrated electronic reader.

These devices place a complicated set of reagents and manufactured elements into a simple, compact, easy to use package. See, e.g., Lateral Flow Immunoassay, Wong and Tse, eds., Humana Press, 2009. A test strip is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in order to define certain elements of a typical test strip for use in the following discussion. A first bibulous material, often referred to as a sample pad, is provided at the proximal end of the test strip. It is this sample pad which receives the fluid sample to be tested. At the distal end of the test strip is a second bibulous material, often referred to as an absorbent pad, which operates to receive the sample fluid once it has passed through the porous membrane. The porous membrane, which may be a nitrocellulose membrane, is positioned between these two ends. The flow path of the sample is from the sample pad, through the nitrocellulose membrane, and into the absorbent pad. In doing so, the sample typically flows through a &#x201c;conjugate pad&#x201d;, which is a portion of the device which contains a labeled reagent that binds to, or competes with, the analyte of interest. This labeled reagent is mobilized in the sample matrix so that it flows with the sample.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0058">A test line is a location on the nitrocellulose membrane that binds the labeled reagent in an amount related to the presence or amount of the analyte of interest. While depicted as a single test line, a lateral flow test strip may have multiple test lines, each of which is used to measure the presence or amount of a different analyte. As defined herein, the test line has a width dimension W<sub>T </sub>which lies on the width axis of the test strip, and a length dimension L<sub>T </sub>which lies on the longitudinal axis of the test strip. One or more control lines are often employed to act as an environmental control and to determine if the test has been successfully performed by the test strip.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0059">The test strip is typically held within a housing in order to provide protection to the test strip and for purposes of handling by the user. When the test device is read by an external reader, limited or no electronics need to be provided within the housing. In the case of an integrated reader, this housing will also provide the reader electronics necessary to read and interpret the test result. As shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, such a housing can comprise a top portion <b>301</b> having an opening <b>302</b> into which a sample may be applied. The top can be mated to a bottom portion <b>304</b> which holds the test strip <b>303</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an optical block <b>305</b> affixed to the circuit board <b>306</b>, contains the light source and photodetector and light apertures. The system is generally powered by a small battery <b>307</b> and the digital readout is displayed through the window in the top housing <b>308</b></p><p id="p-0040" num="0060">By way of example only, a test device may be formed by introducing a moldable material into a mold assembly to form the test device lid and base; removing the test device lid and base from the mold assembly; and mating the test device lid to the test device base such that a sample receiving aperture overlies the first bibulous material and a test aperture overlies the one or more test zones. While the lid and base may be formed with discrete molds, the mold assembly may be configured as a single assembly, wherein the test device base and the test device lid are formed as a unitary part. To facilitate fit of the lid and base, the test device base and the test device lid may be formed as a unitary part connected by one or more flexible hinge regions (e.g. living hinges) configured to allow the test device lid to mate to the test device base.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0061">The skilled artisan will understand that a number of polymers may be used to form the test device base, including thermoplastics, some thermosets, and elastomers. Common thermoplastics include PMMA, cyclic olefin copolymer, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyacrylate, polyaryletherketone, polybutadiene, polycarbonate, polyester, polyetherimide, polysulfone, nylon, polyethylene, and polystyrene. Common thermosets include polyesters, polyurethanes, duroplast, epoxy resins, and polyimides. This list is not meant to be limiting. Functional filler materials such as talc and carbon fibers can be included for purposes of improving stiffness, working temperatures, and part shrinkage.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a cross section along the width axis (W<sub>T</sub>) at the point of a test or control line position along the longitudinal axis (LT) showing the arrangement of the optical block of a test device of the present invention.

The test strip <b>204</b> is shown along its width axis W<sub>T </sub>such that light from the light source <b>202</b> passes through aperture <b>206</b> in optic block <b>205</b> (see <b>305</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) in order to illuminate the test line with an angle of incidence &#x3b8;. The light source <b>202</b> is offset laterally from the center of the test line in order to minimize specular reflection of the incident light from reaching photodetector <b>203</b>. The area of the test line that is illuminated is determined by the height h<sub>1 </sub>and the dimensions of aperture <b>206</b>, and is configured to limit illumination to the test line area, with minimal overlap onto portions of the lateral flow membrane that do not contain the test line. Preferably, the area of the lateral flow membrane that is illuminated is no more than 50% larger than W<sub>T</sub>, and no more than 50% larger than L<sub>T</sub>, and is more preferably no more than 25%, or 10% larger than W<sub>T </sub>and L<sub>T</sub>, respectively. This is in order to minimize reflection of non-relevant incident light received by photodetector <b>203</b>.
