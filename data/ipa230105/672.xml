Although specific reference is made to marking tissue for surgery such as eye surgery, embodiments as described herein can be used in many ways with many anatomical structures to facilitate the treatment of many tissue structures.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cutting of materials can be done mechanically with chisels, knives, scalpels and other tools such as surgical tools. However, prior methods and apparatus of cutting can be less than desirable and provide less than ideal results in at least some instances. For example, at least some prior methods and apparatus for cutting materials such as tissue may provide a somewhat rougher surface than would be ideal. Pulsed lasers can be used to cut one or more of many materials and have been used for laser surgery to cut tissue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of surgically tissue cutting include cutting the cornea and crystalline lens of the eye. The lens of the eye can be cut to correct a defect of the lens, for example to remove a cataract, and the tissues of the eye can be cut to access the lens. For example the cornea can be to access the cataractous lens. The cornea can be cut in order to correct a refractive error of the eye, for example with laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (hereinafter &#x201c;LASIK&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many patients may have visual errors associated with the refractive properties of the eye such as nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. Astigmatism may occur when the corneal curvature is unequal in two or more directions. Nearsightedness can occur when light focuses before the retina, and farsightedness can occur with light refracted to a focus behind the retina. There are numerous prior surgical approaches for reshaping the cornea, including laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (hereinafter &#x201c;LASIK&#x201d;), all laser LASIK, femto LASIK, corneaplasty, astigmatic keratotomy, corneal relaxing incision (hereinafter &#x201c;CRI&#x201d;), and Limbal Relaxing Incision (hereinafter &#x201c;LRI&#x201d;). Astigmatic Keratotomy, Corneal Relaxing Incision (CRI), and Limbal Relaxing Incision (LRI), corneal incisions are made in a well-defined manner and depth to allow the cornea to change shape to become more spherical.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Cataract extraction is a frequently performed surgical procedure. A cataract is formed by opacification of the crystalline lens of the eye. The cataract scatters light passing through the lens and may perceptibly degrade vision. A cataract can vary in degree from slight to complete opacity. Early in the development of an age-related cataract the power of the lens may increase, causing nearsightedness (myopia). Gradual yellowing and opacification of the lens may reduce the perception of blue colors as those shorter wavelengths are more strongly absorbed and scattered within the cataractous crystalline lens. Cataract formation may often progresses slowly resulting in progressive vision loss.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A cataract treatment may involve replacing the opaque crystalline lens with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL), and an estimated 15 million cataract surgeries per year are performed worldwide. Cataract surgery can be performed using a technique termed phacoemulsification in which an ultrasonic tip with associated irrigation and aspiration ports is used to sculpt the relatively hard nucleus of the lens to facilitate removal through an opening made in the anterior lens capsule. The nucleus of the lens is contained within an outer membrane of the lens that is referred to as the lens capsule. Access to the lens nucleus can be provided by performing an anterior capsulotomy in which a small round hole can be formed in the anterior side of the lens capsule. Access to the lens nucleus can also be provided by performing a manual continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) procedure. After removal of the lens nucleus, a synthetic foldable intraocular lens (IOL) can be inserted into the remaining lens capsule of the eye.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">At least some prior laser surgery systems can provide less than ideal results when used to place an intraocular lens in the eye to treat aberrations of the eye such as low order aberrations comprising astigmatism or higher order aberrations. While accommodating IOLs can correct refractive error of the eye and restore accommodation, the prior accommodating IOLs can provide less than ideal correction of the astigmatism of the eye.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, improved methods and systems would be helpful for more precisely marking and tracking anatomical features in tissue, particularly the eye, to better position tissue cuts and place implants such as intraocular lenses (IOLs) in the eye.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments as described herein provide improved methods and apparatus of marking and tracking the tissue structures such as the eye, in many embodiments to facilitate surgical procedures for the eye such as the implantation of an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) or other lens placed with the eye. In many embodiments, a fiducial is generated on an anatomical structure of the eye in order to position an axis of the IOL with an axis of the eye. In many embodiments, an implantable lens device comprises a marker, and the implantable lens device is positioned so that the marker of the implantable device is placed in a positional relationship relative to the fiducial. In many embodiments, the implantable device comprises an artificial intraocular lens such as a toric intraocular lens which can treat astigmatism of the eye. Positioning the implantable device so that the fiducial is in the positional relationship relative to the fiducial can comprise aligning the axis of the implantable device with an axis of the eye, such as an astigmatic axis of the eye.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a first aspect, a method of implanting an implantable device in an eye of a patient is provided. A fiducial is generated on an anatomical structure of the eye. The implantable device is placed so that a marker of the implantable device is in a positional relationship relative to the fiducial.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In many embodiments, the eye is retained with a patient interface coupled to the eye with suction. The fiducial can be generated when the eye is retained with the patient interface. In some cases, the patient interface may distort one or more tissue structures in the eye which can lead to inaccurate fiducial generation. Thus, the fiducial can alternatively be generated prior to retaining the eye with the patient interface.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In many embodiments, the implantable device comprises an intraocular lens. The marker of the intraocular lens and the fiducial generated on the eye can be visible to a user with a camera image or an operating microscope image provided to the user when the intraocular lens has been placed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A user can input a treatment axis of an astigmatism of the eye. A first fiducial and a second fiducial can be generated on an internal anatomical structure of the eye to define the treatment axis extending across a pupil of the eye. The marker can comprises a first marker and a second marker placed on opposite sides of the implantable device to define a lens axis of an intraocular lens. The marker and the fiducial can be visible to a user to determine an alignment of the treatment axis with the lens axis. In some embodiments, the first fiducial and the second fiducial are located on the cornea away from an entrance pupil of the eye, and the first marker, the second marker, the first fiducial and the second fiducial are displayed in an image visible to a user.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A measurement structure of the eye can be measured with a laser system when the patient has been placed on a patient support of the laser system. The fiducial can be generated on the anatomical structure of the eye in response to the orientation of the measurement structure. The measurement structure of the eye can comprise one or more of a cornea of the eye, an iris of the eye or a crystalline lens of the eye and wherein the orientation comprises one or more of an angle of an astigmatic axis of the cornea, a rotational angle of the iris about a pupil of the eye or an astigmatic axis of the lens of the eye.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The implantable device can comprise an artificial intraocular lens such as a toric intraocular lens. The positional relationship can comprise a pre-determined positional relationship.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The implantable device can be positioned so that the fiducial in the positional relationship relative to the fiducial to align a vision correcting axis of the implantable device with an aberration axis of the eye. The aberration axis of the eye may comprise an astigmatic axis or an axis of a higher order aberration. And, the implantable device can corrects a higher order aberration of the eye comprising one or more of coma, trefoil or spherical aberration.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The marker of the implantable device and the fiducial placed on the internal anatomical structure of the eye can have many shapes, including one or more of a dot, a line, a rectangle, an arrow, a cross, a trapezoid, a rectangle, a square, a chevron, a pentagon, a hexagon, a circle, an ellipse, or an arc. The fiducial may have a shape corresponding to a shape of the marking of the implantable device. The shape of the fiducial may be similar to the shape of the marking. The shape of the fiducial may be complementary to the shape of the marking.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Typically, the fiducial is generated on the anatomical structure of the eye by marking the anatomical structure with a laser. The internal anatomical structure may comprise an internal structure of one or more of the limbus, the cornea, the sclera, in the lens capsule, the iris, the stroma, or in the crystalline lens nucleus.

In many embodiments, a laser is used to form precise incisions in the limbus, the cornea, in the lens capsule, the iris, the stroma, and/or in the crystalline lens nucleus. Although specific reference is made to tissue marking and alignment for laser eye surgery, embodiments as described herein can be used in one or more of many ways with many surgical procedures and devices, such as orthopedic surgery, robotic surgery and microkeratomes.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The embodiments as describe herein are particularly well suit for treating tissue, such as with the surgical treatment of tissue. In many embodiments, the tissue comprises an optically transmissive tissue, such as tissue of an eye. The embodiments as described herein can be combined in many ways with one or more of many known surgical procedures such as cataract surgery, laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (hereinafter &#x201c;LASIK&#x201d;), laser assisted subepithelial keratectomy (hereinafter &#x201c;LASEK&#x201d;),</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Methods and systems related to laser treatment of materials and which can be used with eye surgery such as laser eye surgery are disclosed. A laser may be used to form precise incisions in the cornea, in the lens capsule, and/or in the crystalline lens nucleus, for example. The embodiments as described herein can be particularly well suited for decreasing the amount of energy to the eye and increasing the accuracy of the cutting of the material such as tissue, for example.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present disclosure provides methods and apparatus for providing adjustment to compensate for variations in disposable elements and other attachments, tolerances in hardware and alignment, and patient anatomy. The methods and apparatus may comprise a software look up table (hereinafter &#x201c;LUT&#x201d;) embodied in a tangible medium. The LUT may comprise a map of locations of the cutting volume in order to the control of actuators that direct the ranging (target detection) and the cutting modalities. A baseline LUT can be generated for a generalized system using optical based rules and physics, detailed modeling of components, and anchoring (one time) to a finite data set as described herein. The expected variations can be reduced into a set of finite and manageable variables that are applied to modify the tables subsequent to the original generation of the tables. For a constructed system having constructed components with manufacturing tolerances, fine tuning and modification of the LUTs can be achieved thru simple modifications of the tables based on individual system and automated measurements. These individualized measurements of a constructed system can be applied to variations due to one or more of: tool-to-tool variation, tool to itself variation (for example align variations), output attachment variations (for example disposable contact lenses), or patient to patient (for example individual patient anatomy), and combinations thereof, for example.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In many embodiments, one or more of the following steps can be performed with the processor and methods as described herein. For example, baseline LUT generation can be performed comprising mapping and position detection in order to provide actuator commands to evaluate system output performance. A baseline transfer function can be generated for a patient coordinate reference system such as XYZ to detect actuators of the system, for example. Baseline LUT generation can be performed to map cutting to actuators. A transfer function can be generated for XYZ to cutting actuators, for example. Baseline LUTs (transfer functions) can be generated via model (ray trace), data, or a combination, for example. The baseline LUTs can be modified given variations in the system, disposable, eye, application, for example. The baseline LUT modification may comprise an adjustment to the baseline LUT, for example. The baseline LUT modification may comprise a software (hereinafter &#x201c;SW&#x201d;) adjustment to compensate for hardware (hereinafter &#x201c;HW&#x201d;) variations, for example. The LUT modification as described herein can extend surgical volume, so as to treat the cornea, the limbus and the posterior capsule, either in lateral extent, axial extent, and resolution, for example. The LUT methods and apparatus can enable switching in tools for calibration and other optical components to accessorize&#x2014;output attachments, for example. The LUT can be set up so that the system is capable of measuring location of attachments at two surfaces and then can accurately place cuts in targeted material volume based on modifying the baseline LUT using this the locations of the two surfaces, for example. The LUTS can provide more cuts ranging from lens, capsule, corneal incisions for cataract, cornea flaps, for example. The different subsystems as described herein can have separate LUTS, which can be combined with calibration process as described herein, for example.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternatively, or in combination, the same sub-system can be used for both ranging and cutting, for example. The UF system can be used at a low power level to find surfaces and then used at high power for cutting, for example. The LUTs can be used such that the location mode differs from the cutting mode. For example, the cut locations can differ based on changes with power level. The cut location may not occur at focus, for example when the energy per pulse substantially exceeds the threshold amount of energy, for example.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In many embodiments, the LUTs of the methods and apparatus as described herein follow these principles. The baseline LUT can generated by ray tracing and data anchoring using specific tooling, for example. In many embodiments, each optically transmissive structure of the patient interface, for example a lens, is read by the system to determine its thickness and location. These numbers can be used to modify the LUTS to attain &#x3c;100 um accuracy, for example.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In many embodiments, the LUTs of the methods and apparatus as described herein are also modified to account for alignment tilts, contact lens mounting, contact lens variations so as to achieve &#x3c;100 um accuracy on cuts, for example. In many embodiments, a bubbles in plastic flatness test with the calibration apparatus as described herein generates offset and tilt adjustments of baseline UF LUT.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In many embodiments, the baseline component specifications may be less than ideal for delivering an appropriate system performance, and the final performance can be refined using SW corrections and factors based on the components of the individual system which can be determined from optically-grounded data-anchored baseline LUTs further modified for enhanced performance, for example.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A feedback loop can be used to build the enhanced or modified LUTs for the individual laser system, for example. The feedback methods and apparatus as described herein can allow SW adjustments based on LUTs and other SW factors that may not be corrected with hardware alignment, for example.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The LUTs and the methods an apparatus configured to modify the look up tables so as to enhance system performance can provide an improvement within the 3D surgical volume as described herein. The methods and apparatus as described herein can provide improved surgery for more patients with a level of high performance. The methods and apparatus as described herein can provide high performance using off-the-shelf components, such as high volume low cost components, such that the surgical procedures as described herein can be available to many patients.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, the terms anterior and posterior refers to known orientations with respect to the patient. Depending on the orientation of the patient for surgery, the terms anterior and posterior may be similar to the terms upper and lower, respectively, such as when the patient is placed in a supine position on a bed. The terms distal and anterior may refer to an orientation of a structure from the perspective of the user, such that the terms proximal and distal may be similar to the terms anterior and posterior when referring to a structure placed on the eye, for example. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize many variations of the orientation of the methods and apparatus as described herein, and the terms anterior, posterior, proximal, distal, upper, and lower are used merely by way of example.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used herein, the terms first and second are used to describe structures and methods without limitation as to the order of the structures and methods which can be in any order, as will be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the teachings provided herein.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a laser eye surgery system <b>2</b>, in accordance with many embodiments, operable to form precise incisions in the cornea, in the lens capsule, and/or in the crystalline lens nucleus. The system <b>2</b> includes a main unit <b>4</b>, a patient chair <b>6</b>, a dual function footswitch <b>8</b>, and a laser footswitch <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The main unit <b>4</b> includes many primary subsystems of the system <b>2</b>. For example, externally visible subsystems include a touch-screen control panel <b>12</b>, a patient interface assembly <b>14</b>, patient interface vacuum connections <b>16</b>, a docking control keypad <b>18</b>, a patient interface radio frequency identification (RFID) reader <b>20</b>, external connections <b>22</b> (e.g., network, video output, footswitch, USB port, door interlock, and AC power), laser emission indicator <b>24</b>, emergency laser stop button <b>26</b>, key switch <b>28</b>, and USB data ports <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The patient chair <b>6</b> includes a base <b>32</b>, a patient support bed <b>34</b>, a headrest <b>36</b>, a positioning mechanism, and a patient chair joystick control <b>38</b> disposed on the headrest <b>36</b>. The positioning control mechanism is coupled between the base <b>32</b> and the patient support bed <b>34</b> and headrest <b>36</b>. The patient chair <b>6</b> is configured to be adjusted and oriented in three axes (x, y, and z) using the patient chair joystick control <b>38</b>. The headrest <b>36</b> and a restrain system (not shown, e.g., a restraint strap engaging the patient's forehead) stabilize the patient's head during the procedure. The headrest <b>36</b> includes an adjustable neck support to provide patient comfort and to reduce patient head movement. The headrest <b>36</b> is configured to be vertically adjustable to enable adjustment of the patient head position to provide patient comfort and to accommodate variation in patient head size.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The patient chair <b>6</b> allows for tilt articulation of the patient's legs, torso, and head using manual adjustments. The patient chair <b>6</b> accommodates a patient load position, a suction ring capture position, and a patient treat position. In the patient load position, the chair <b>6</b> is rotated out from under the main unit <b>4</b> with the patient chair back in an upright position and patient footrest in a lowered position. In the suction ring capture position, the chair is rotated out from under the main unit <b>4</b> with the patient chair back in reclined position and patient footrest in raised position. In the patient treat position, the chair is rotated under the main unit <b>4</b> with the patient chair back in reclined position and patient footrest in raised position.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The patient chair <b>6</b> is equipped with a &#x201c;chair enable&#x201d; feature to protect against unintended chair motion. The patient chair joystick <b>38</b> can be enabled in either of two ways. First, the patient chair joystick <b>38</b> incorporates a &#x201c;chair enable&#x201d; button located on the top of the joystick. Control of the position of the patient chair <b>6</b> via the joystick <b>38</b> can be enabled by continuously pressing the &#x201c;chair enable&#x201d; button. Alternately, the left foot switch <b>40</b> of the dual function footswitch <b>8</b> can be continuously depressed to enable positional control of the patient chair <b>6</b> via the joystick <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In many embodiments, the patient control joystick <b>38</b> is a proportional controller. For example, moving the joystick a small amount can be used to cause the chair to move slowly. Moving the joystick a large amount can be used to cause the chair to move faster. Holding the joystick at its maximum travel limit can be used to cause the chair to move at the maximum chair speed. The available chair speed can be reduced as the patient approaches the patient interface assembly <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The emergency stop button <b>26</b> can be pushed to stop emission of all laser output, release vacuum that couples the patient to the system <b>2</b>, and disable the patient chair <b>6</b>. The stop button <b>26</b> is located on the system front panel, next to the key switch <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The key switch <b>28</b> can be used to enable the system <b>2</b>. When in a standby position, the key can be removed and the system is disabled. When in a ready position, the key enables power to the system <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The dual function footswitch <b>8</b> is a dual footswitch assembly that includes the left foot switch <b>40</b> and a right foot switch <b>42</b>. The left foot switch <b>40</b> is the &#x201c;chair enable&#x201d; footswitch. The right footswitch <b>42</b> is a &#x201c;vacuum ON&#x201d; footswitch that enables vacuum to secure a liquid optics interface suction ring to the patient's eye. The laser footswitch <b>10</b> is a shrouded footswitch that activates the treatment laser when depressed while the system is enabled.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In many embodiments, the system <b>2</b> includes external communication connections. For example, the system <b>2</b> can include a network connection (e.g., an RJ45 network connection) for connecting the system <b>2</b> to a network. The network connection can be used to enable network printing of treatment reports, remote access to view system performance logs, and remote access to perform system diagnostics. The system <b>2</b> can include a video output port (e.g., HDMI) that can be used to output video of treatments performed by the system <b>2</b>. The output video can be displayed on an external monitor for, for example, viewing by family members and/or training. The output video can also be recorded for, for example, archival purposes. The system <b>2</b> can include one or more data output ports (e.g., USB) to, for example, enable export of treatment reports to a data storage device. The treatments reports stored on the data storage device can then be accessed at a later time for any suitable purpose such as, for example, printing from an external computer in the case where the user without access to network based printing.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a simplified block diagram of the system <b>2</b> coupled with a patient eye <b>43</b>. The patient eye <b>43</b> comprises a cornea <b>43</b>C, a lens <b>43</b>L and an iris <b>431</b>. The iris <b>431</b> defines a pupil of the eye <b>43</b> that may be used for alignment of eye <b>43</b> with system <b>2</b>. The system <b>2</b> includes a cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b>, a ranging subsystem <b>46</b>, an alignment guidance system <b>48</b>, shared optics <b>50</b>, a patient interface <b>52</b>, control electronics <b>54</b>, a control panel/GUI <b>56</b>, user interface devices <b>58</b>, and communication paths <b>60</b>. The control electronics <b>54</b> is operatively coupled via the communication paths <b>60</b> with the cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b>, the ranging subsystem <b>46</b>, the alignment guidance subsystem <b>48</b>, the shared optics <b>50</b>, the patient interface <b>52</b>, the control panel/GUI <b>56</b>, and the user interface devices <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In many embodiments, the cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b> incorporates femtosecond (FS) laser technology. By using femtosecond laser technology, a short duration (e.g., approximately 10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>seconds in duration) laser pulse (with energy level in the micro joule range) can be delivered to a tightly focused point to disrupt tissue, thereby substantially lowering the energy level required as compared to the level required for ultrasound fragmentation of the lens nucleus and as compared to laser pulses having longer durations.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b> can produce laser pulses having a wavelength suitable to the configuration of the system <b>2</b>. As a non-limiting example, the system <b>2</b> can be configured to use a cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b> that produces laser pulses having a wavelength from 1020 nm to 1050 nm. For example, the cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b> can have a diode-pumped solid-state configuration with a 1030 (+/&#x2212;5) nm center wavelength.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b> can include control and conditioning components. For example, such control components can include components such as a beam attenuator to control the energy of the laser pulse and the average power of the pulse train, a fixed aperture to control the cross-sectional spatial extent of the beam containing the laser pulses, one or more power monitors to monitor the flux and repetition rate of the beam train and therefore the energy of the laser pulses, and a shutter to allow/block transmission of the laser pulses. Such conditioning components can include an adjustable zoom assembly to adapt the beam containing the laser pulses to the characteristics of the system <b>2</b> and a fixed optical relay to transfer the laser pulses over a distance while accommodating laser pulse beam positional and/or directional variability, thereby providing increased tolerance for component variation.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The ranging subsystem <b>46</b> is configured to measure the spatial disposition of eye structures in three dimensions. The measured eye structures can include the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cornea, the anterior and posterior portions of the lens capsule, the iris, and the limbus. In many embodiments, the ranging subsystem <b>46</b> utilizes optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. As a non-limiting example, the system <b>2</b> can be configured to use an OCT imaging system employing wavelengths from 780 nm to 970 nm. For example, the ranging subsystem <b>46</b> can include an OCT imaging system that employs a broad spectrum of wavelengths from 810 nm to 850 nm. Such an OCT imaging system can employ a reference path length that is adjustable to adjust the effective depth in the eye of the OCT measurement, thereby allowing the measurement of system components including features of the patient interface that lie anterior to the cornea of the eye and structures of the eye that range in depth from the anterior surface of the cornea to the posterior portion of the lens capsule and beyond.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The alignment guidance subsystem <b>48</b> can include a laser diode or gas laser that produces a laser beam used to align optical components of the system <b>2</b>. The alignment guidance subsystem <b>48</b> can include LEDs or lasers that produce a fixation light to assist in aligning and stabilizing the patient's eye during docking and treatment. The alignment guidance subsystem <b>48</b> can include a laser or LED light source and a detector to monitor the alignment and stability of the actuators used to position the beam in X, Y, and Z. The alignment guidance subsystem <b>48</b> can include a video system that can be used to provide imaging of the patient's eye to facilitate docking of the patient's eye <b>43</b> to the patient interface <b>52</b>. The imaging system provided by the video system can also be used to direct via the GUI the location of cuts. The imaging provided by the video system can additionally be used during the laser eye surgery procedure to monitor the progress of the procedure, to track movements of the patient's eye <b>43</b> during the procedure, and to measure the location and size of structures of the eye such as the pupil and/or limbus.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The shared optics <b>50</b> provides a common propagation path that is disposed between the patient interface <b>52</b> and each of the cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b>, the ranging subsystem <b>46</b>, and the alignment guidance subsystem <b>48</b>. In many embodiments, the shared optics <b>50</b> includes beam combiners to receive the emission from the respective subsystem (e.g., the cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b>, and the alignment guidance subsystem <b>48</b>) and redirect the emission along the common propagation path to the patient interface. In many embodiments, the shared optics <b>50</b> includes an objective lens assembly that focuses each laser pulse into a focal point. In many embodiments, the shared optics <b>50</b> includes scanning mechanisms operable to scan the respective emission in three dimensions. For example, the shared optics can include an XY-scan mechanism(s) and a Z-scan mechanism. The XY-scan mechanism(s) can be used to scan the respective emission in two dimensions transverse to the propagation direction of the respective emission. The Z-scan mechanism can be used to vary the depth of the focal point within the eye <b>43</b>. In many embodiments, the scanning mechanisms are disposed between the laser diode and the objective lens such that the scanning mechanisms are used to scan the alignment laser beam produced by the laser diode. In contrast, in many embodiments, the video system is disposed between the scanning mechanisms and the objective lens such that the scanning mechanisms do not affect the image obtained by the video system.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The patient interface <b>52</b> is used to restrain the position of the patient's eye <b>43</b> relative to the system <b>2</b>. In many embodiments, the patient interface <b>52</b> employs a suction ring that is vacuum attached to the patient's eye <b>43</b>. The suction ring is then coupled with the patient interface <b>52</b>, for example, using vacuum to secure the suction ring to the patient interface <b>52</b>. In many embodiments, the patient interface <b>52</b> includes an optically transmissive structure having a posterior surface that is displaced vertically from the anterior surface of the patient's cornea and a region of a suitable liquid (e.g., a sterile buffered saline solution (BSS) such as Alcon BSS (Alcon Part Number 351-55005-1) or equivalent) is disposed between and in contact with the patient interface lens posterior surface and the patient's cornea and forms part of a transmission path between the shared optics <b>50</b> and the patient's eye <b>43</b>. The optically transmissive structure may comprise a lens <b>96</b> having one or more curved surfaces. Alternatively, the patient interface <b>22</b> may comprise an optically transmissive structure having one or more substantially flat surfaces such as a parallel plate or wedge. In many embodiments, the patient interface lens is disposable and can be replaced at any suitable interval, such as before each eye treatment.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The control electronics <b>54</b> controls the operation of and can receive input from the cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b>, the ranging subsystem <b>46</b>, the alignment guidance subsystem <b>48</b>, the patient interface <b>52</b>, the control panel/GUI <b>56</b>, and the user interface devices <b>58</b> via the communication paths <b>60</b>. The communication paths <b>60</b> can be implemented in any suitable configuration, including any suitable shared or dedicated communication paths between the control electronics <b>54</b> and the respective system components. The control electronics <b>54</b> can include any suitable components, such as one or more processor, one or more field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and one or more memory storage devices.

For example, short-pulsed laser light generated by the UF laser <b>64</b> can be focused into eye tissue to produce dielectric breakdown to cause photodisruption around the focal point (the focal zone), thereby rupturing the tissue in the vicinity of the photo-induced plasma. In the assembly <b>62</b>, the wavelength of the laser light can vary between 800 nm to 1200 nm and the pulse width of the laser light can vary from 10fs to 10000fs. The pulse repetition frequency can also vary from 10 kHz to 500 kHz. Safety limits with regard to unintended damage to non-targeted tissue bound the upper limit with regard to repetition rate and pulse energy. Threshold energy, time to complete the procedure, and stability can bound the lower limit for pulse energy and repetition rate. The peak power of the focused spot in the eye <b>43</b> and specifically within the crystalline lens and the lens capsule of the eye is sufficient to produce optical breakdown and initiate a plasma-mediated ablation process. Near-infrared wavelengths for the laser light are preferred because linear optical absorption and scattering in biological tissue is reduced for near-infrared wavelengths. As an example, the laser <b>64</b> can be a repetitively pulsed 1031 nm device that produces pulses with less than 600 fs duration at a repetition rate of 120 kHz (+/&#x2212;5%) and individual pulse energy in the 1 to 20 micro joule range.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The cutting laser subsystem <b>44</b> is controlled by the control electronics <b>54</b> and the user, via the control panel/GUI <b>56</b> and the user interface devices <b>58</b>, to create a laser pulse beam <b>66</b>. The control panel/GUI <b>56</b> is used to set system operating parameters, process user input, display gathered information such as images of ocular structures, and display representations of incisions to be formed in the patient's eye <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The generated laser pulse beam <b>66</b> proceeds through a zoom assembly <b>68</b>. The laser pulse beam <b>66</b> may vary from unit to unit, particularly when the UF laser <b>64</b> may be obtained from different laser manufacturers. For example, the beam diameter of the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> may vary from unit to unit (e.g., by +/&#x2212;20%). The beam may also vary with regard to beam quality, beam divergence, beam spatial circularity, and astigmatism. In many embodiments, the zoom assembly <b>68</b> is adjustable such that the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> exiting the zoom assembly <b>68</b> has consistent beam diameter and divergence unit to unit.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">After exiting the zoom assembly <b>68</b>, the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> proceeds through an attenuator <b>70</b>. The attenuator <b>70</b> is used to adjust the transmission of the laser beam and thereby the energy level of the laser pulses in the laser pulse beam <b>66</b>. The attenuator <b>70</b> is controlled via the control electronics <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">After exiting the attenuator <b>70</b>, the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> proceeds through an aperture <b>72</b>. The aperture <b>72</b> sets the outer useful diameter of the laser pulse beam <b>66</b>. In turn the zoom determines the size of the beam at the aperture location and therefore the amount of light that is transmitted. The amount of transmitted light is bounded both high and low. The upper is bounded by the requirement to achieve the highest numerical aperture achievable in the eye. High NA promotes low threshold energies and greater safety margin for untargeted tissue. The lower is bound by the requirement for high optical throughput. Too much transmission loss in the system shortens the lifetime of the system as the laser output and system degrades over time. Additionally, consistency in the transmission through this aperture promotes stability in determining optimum settings (and sharing of) for each procedure. Typically to achieve optimal performance the transmission through this aperture as set to be between 88% to 92%.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">After exiting the aperture <b>72</b>, the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> proceeds through two output pickoffs <b>74</b>. Each output pickoff <b>74</b> can include a partially reflecting mirror to divert a portion of each laser pulse to a respective output monitor <b>76</b>. Two output pickoffs <b>74</b> (e.g., a primary and a secondary) and respective primary and secondary output monitors <b>76</b> are used to provide redundancy in case of malfunction of the primary output monitor <b>76</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">After exiting the output pickoffs <b>74</b>, the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> proceeds through a system-controlled shutter <b>78</b>. The system-controlled shutter <b>78</b> ensures on/off control of the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> for procedural and safety reasons. The two output pickoffs precede the shutter allowing for monitoring of the beam power, energy, and repetition rate as a pre-requisite for opening the shutter.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">After exiting the system-controlled shutter <b>78</b>, the optical beam proceeds through an optics relay telescope <b>80</b>. The optics relay telescope <b>80</b> propagates the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> over a distance while accommodating positional and/or directional variability of the laser pulse beam <b>66</b>, thereby providing increased tolerance for component variation. As an example, the optical relay can be a keplerian afocal telescope that relays an image of the aperture position to a conjugate position near to the xy galvo mirror positions. In this way, the position of the beam at the XY galvo location is invariant to changes in the beams angle at the aperture position. Similarly the shutter does not have to precede the relay and may follow after or be included within the relay.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">After exiting the optics relay telescope <b>80</b>, the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> is transmitted to the shared optics <b>50</b>, which propagates the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> to the patient interface <b>52</b>. The laser pulse beam <b>66</b> is incident upon a beam combiner <b>82</b>, which reflects the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> while transmitting optical beams from the ranging subsystem <b>46</b> and the alignment guidance subsystem: AIM <b>48</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Following the beam combiner <b>82</b>, the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> continues through a Z-telescope <b>84</b>, which is operable to scan focus position of the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> in the patient's eye <b>43</b> along the Z axis. For example, the Z-telescope <b>84</b> can include a Galilean telescope with two lens groups (each lens group includes one or more lenses). One of the lens groups moves along the Z axis about the collimation position of the Z-telescope <b>84</b>. In this way, the focus position of the spot in the patient's eye <b>43</b> moves along the Z axis. In general, there is a relationship between the motion of lens group and the motion of the focus point. For example, the Z-telescope can have an approximate 2&#xd7; beam expansion ratio and close to a 1:1 relationship of the movement of the lens group to the movement of the focus point. The exact relationship between the motion of the lens and the motion of the focus in the z axis of the eye coordinate system does not have to be a fixed linear relationship. The motion can be nonlinear and directed via a model or a calibration from measurement or a combination of both. Alternatively, the other lens group can be moved along the Z axis to adjust the position of the focus point along the Z axis. The Z-telescope <b>84</b> functions as z-scan device for scanning the focus point of the laser-pulse beam <b>66</b> in the patient's eye <b>43</b>. The Z-telescope <b>84</b> can be controlled automatically and dynamically by the control electronics <b>54</b> and selected to be independent or to interplay with the X and Y scan devices described next.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">After passing through the Z-telescope <b>84</b>, the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> is incident upon an X-scan device <b>86</b>, which is operable to scan the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> in the X direction, which is dominantly transverse to the Z axis and transverse to the direction of propagation of the laser pulse beam <b>66</b>. The X-scan device <b>86</b> is controlled by the control electronics <b>54</b>, and can include suitable components, such as a motor, galvanometer, or any other well known optic moving device. The relationship of the motion of the beam as a function of the motion of the X actuator does not have to be fixed or linear. Modeling or calibrated measurement of the relationship or a combination of both can be determined and used to direct the location of the beam.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">After being directed by the X-scan device <b>86</b>, the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> is incident upon a Y-scan device <b>88</b>, which is operable to scan the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> in the Y direction, which is dominantly transverse to the X and Z axes. The Y-scan device <b>88</b> is controlled by the control electronics <b>54</b>, and can include suitable components, such as a motor, galvanometer, or any other well known optic moving device. The relationship of the motion of the beam as a function of the motion of the Y actuator does not have to be fixed or linear. Modeling or calibrated measurement of the relationship or a combination of both can be determined and used to direct the location of the beam. Alternatively, the functionality of the X-Scan device <b>86</b> and the Y-Scan device <b>88</b> can be provided by an XY-scan device configured to scan the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> in two dimensions transverse to the Z axis and the propagation direction of the laser pulse beam <b>66</b>. The X-scan and Y-scan devices <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> change the resulting direction of the laser pulse beam <b>66</b>, causing lateral displacements of UF focus point located in the patient's eye <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">After being directed by the Y-scan device <b>88</b>, the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> passes through a beam combiner <b>90</b>.

The objective lens assembly <b>94</b> can include one or more lenses. In many embodiments, the objective lens assembly <b>94</b> includes multiple lenses. The complexity of the objective lens assembly <b>94</b> may be driven by the scan field size, the focused spot size, the degree of telecentricity, the available working distance on both the proximal and distal sides of objective lens assembly <b>94</b>, as well as the amount of aberration control.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">After passing through the objective lens assembly <b>94</b>, the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> passes through the patient interface <b>52</b>. As described above, in many embodiments, the patient interface <b>52</b> includes a patient interface lens <b>96</b> having a posterior surface that is displaced vertically from the anterior surface of the patient's cornea and a region of a suitable liquid (e.g., a sterile buffered saline solution (BSS) such as Alcon BSS (Alcon Part Number 351-55005-1) or equivalent) is disposed between and in contact with the posterior surface of the patient interface lens <b>96</b> and the patient's cornea and forms part of an optical transmission path between the shared optics <b>50</b> and the patient's eye <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The shared optics <b>50</b> under the control of the control electronics <b>54</b> can automatically generate aiming, ranging, and treatment scan patterns. Such patterns can be comprised of a single spot of light, multiple spots of light, a continuous pattern of light, multiple continuous patterns of light, and/or any combination of these. In addition, the aiming pattern (using the aim beam <b>108</b> described below) need not be identical to the treatment pattern (using the laser pulse beam <b>66</b>), but can optionally be used to designate the boundaries of the treatment pattern to provide verification that the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> will be delivered only within the desired target area for patient safety. This can be done, for example, by having the aiming pattern provide an outline of the intended treatment pattern. This way the spatial extent of the treatment pattern can be made known to the user, if not the exact locations of the individual spots themselves, and the scanning thus optimized for speed, efficiency, and/or accuracy. The aiming pattern can also be made to be perceived as blinking in order to further enhance its visibility to the user. Likewise, the ranging beam <b>102</b> need not be identical to the treatment beam or pattern. The ranging beam needs only to be sufficient enough to identify targeted surfaces. These surfaces can include the cornea and the anterior and posterior surfaces of the lens and may be considered spheres with a single radius of curvature. Also the optics shared by the alignment guidance: video subsystem does not have to be identical to those shared by the treatment beam. The positioning and character of the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> and/or the scan pattern the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> forms on the eye <b>43</b> may be further controlled by use of an input device such as a joystick, or any other appropriate user input device (e.g., control panel/GUI <b>56</b>) to position the patient and/or the optical system.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The control electronics <b>54</b> can be configured to target the targeted structures in the eye <b>43</b> and ensure that the laser pulse beam <b>66</b> will be focused where appropriate and not unintentionally damage non-targeted tissue. Imaging modalities and techniques described herein, such as those mentioned above, or ultrasound may be used to determine the location and measure the thickness of the lens and lens capsule to provide greater precision to the laser focusing methods, including 2D and 3D patterning. Laser focusing may also be accomplished by using one or more methods including direct observation of an aiming beam, or other known ophthalmic or medical imaging modalities, such as those mentioned above, and/or combinations thereof. Additionally the ranging subsystem such as an OCT can be used to detect features or aspects involved with the patient interface. Features can include fiducials places on the docking structures and optical structures of the disposable lens such as the location of the anterior and posterior surfaces.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the ranging subsystem <b>46</b> includes an OCT imaging device. Additionally or alternatively, imaging modalities other than OCT imaging can be used. An OCT scan of the eye can be used to measure the spatial disposition (e.g., three dimensional coordinates such as X, Y, and Z of points on boundaries) of structures of interest in the patient's eye <b>43</b>. Such structure of interest can include, for example, the anterior surface of the cornea, the posterior surface of the cornea, the anterior portion of the lens capsule, the posterior portion of the lens capsule, the anterior surface of the crystalline lens, the posterior surface of the crystalline lens, the iris, the pupil, and/or the limbus. The spatial disposition of the structures of interest and/or of suitable matching geometric modeling such as surfaces and curves can be generated and/or used by the control electronics <b>54</b> to program and control the subsequent laser-assisted surgical procedure. The spatial disposition of the structures of interest and/or of suitable matching geometric modeling can also be used to determine a wide variety of parameters related to the procedure such as, for example, the upper and lower axial limits of the focal planes used for cutting the lens capsule and segmentation of the lens cortex and nucleus, and the thickness of the lens capsule among others.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The ranging subsystem <b>46</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> includes an OCT light source and detection device <b>98</b>. The OCT light source and detection device <b>98</b> includes a light source that generates and emits light with a suitable broad spectrum. For example, in many embodiments, the OCT light source and detection device <b>98</b> generates and emits light with a broad spectrum from 810 nm to 850 nm wavelength. The generated and emitted light is coupled to the device <b>98</b> by a single mode fiber optic connection.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The light emitted from the OCT light source and detection device <b>98</b> is passed through a beam combiner <b>100</b>, which divides the light into a sample portion <b>102</b> and a reference portion <b>104</b>. A significant portion of the sample portion <b>102</b> is transmitted through the shared optics <b>50</b>. A relative small portion of the sample portion is reflected from the patient interface <b>52</b> and/or the patient's eye <b>43</b> and travels back through the shared optics <b>50</b>, back through the beam combiner <b>100</b> and into the OCT light source and detection device <b>98</b>. The reference portion <b>104</b> is transmitted along a reference path <b>106</b> having an adjustable path length. The reference path <b>106</b> is configured to receive the reference portion <b>104</b> from the beam combiner <b>100</b>, propagate the reference portion <b>104</b> over an adjustable path length, and then return the reference portion <b>106</b> back to the beam combiner <b>100</b>, which then directs the returned reference portion <b>104</b> back to the OCT light source and detection device <b>98</b>. The OCT light source and detection device <b>98</b> then directs the returning small portion of the sample portion <b>102</b> and the returning reference portion <b>104</b> into a detection assembly, which employs a time domain detection technique, a frequency detection technique, or a single point detection technique. For example, a frequency-domain technique can be used with an OCT wavelength of 830 nm and bandwidth of 10 nm.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Once combined with the UF laser pulse beam <b>66</b> subsequent to the beam combiner <b>82</b>, the OCT sample portion beam <b>102</b> follows a shared path with the UF laser pulse beam <b>66</b> through the shared optics <b>50</b> and the patient interface <b>52</b>. In this way, the OCT sample portion beam <b>102</b> is generally indicative of the location of the UF laser pulse beam <b>66</b>. Similar to the UF laser beam, the OCT sample portion beam <b>102</b> passes through the Z-telescope <b>84</b>, is redirected by the X-scan device <b>86</b> and by the Y-scan device <b>88</b>, passes through the objective lens assembly <b>94</b> and the patient interface <b>52</b>, and on into the eye <b>43</b>. Reflections and scatter off of structures within the eye provide return beams that retrace back through the patient interface <b>52</b>, back through the shared optics <b>50</b>, back through the beam combiner <b>100</b>, and back into the OCT light source and detection device <b>98</b>. The returning back reflections of the sample portion <b>102</b> are combined with the returning reference portion <b>104</b> and directed into the detector portion of the OCT light source and detection device <b>98</b>, which generates OCT signals in response to the combined returning beams. The generated OCT signals that are in turn interpreted by the control electronics to determine the spatial disposition of the structures of interest in the patient's eye <b>43</b>. The generated OCT signals can also be interpreted by the control electronics to measure the position and orientation of the patient interface <b>52</b>, as well as to determine whether there is liquid disposed between the posterior surface of the patient interface lens <b>96</b> and the patient's eye <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The OCT light source and detection device <b>98</b> works on the principle of measuring differences in optical path length between the reference path <b>106</b> and the sample path. Therefore, different settings of the Z-telescope <b>84</b> to change the focus of the UF laser beam do not impact the length of the sample path for a axially stationary surface in the eye of patient interface volume because the optical path length does not change as a function of different settings of the Z-telescope <b>84</b>. The ranging subsystem <b>46</b> has an inherent Z range that is related to light source and the detection scheme, and in the case of frequency domain detection the Z range is specifically related to the spectrometer, the wavelength, the bandwidth, and the length of the reference path <b>106</b>. In the case of ranging subsystem <b>46</b> used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the Z range is approximately 4-5 mm in an aqueous environment. Extending this range to at least 20-25 mm involves the adjustment of the path length of the reference path <b>106</b> via a stage ZED within ranging subsystem <b>46</b>. Passing the OCT sample portion beam <b>102</b> through the Z-telescope <b>84</b>, while not impacting the sample path length, allows for optimization of the OCT signal strength. This is accomplished by focusing the OCT sample portion beam <b>102</b> onto the targeted structure. The focused beam both increases the return reflected or scattered signal that can be transmitted through the single mode fiber and increases the spatial resolution due to the reduced extent of the focused beam. The changing of the focus of the sample OCT beam can be accomplished independently of changing the path length of the reference path <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Because of the fundamental differences in how the sample portion <b>102</b> (e.g., 810 nm to 850 nm wavelengths) and the UF laser pulse beam <b>66</b> (e.g., 1020 nm to 1050 nm wavelengths) propagate through the shared optics <b>50</b> and the patient interface <b>52</b> due to influences such as immersion index, refraction, and aberration, both chromatic and monochromatic, care must be taken in analyzing the OCT signal with respect to the UF laser pulse beam <b>66</b> focal location. A calibration or registration procedure as a function of X, Y, and Z can be conducted in order to match the OCT signal information to the UF laser pulse beam focus location and also to the relative to absolute dimensional quantities.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">There are many suitable possibilities for the configuration of the OCT interferometer.

The illumination may also be in a dark-filed configuration such that the illumination sources are directed to the independent surfaces outside the capture numerical aperture of the image portion of the video system. Alternatively the illumination may also be in a bright field configuration. In both the dark and bright field configurations, the illumination light source can be used as a fixation beam for the patient.

The lateral dimensions of the volume are defined by a Y contour anterior to the limbus and by an X contour posterior to the limbus. The treatment volume shown can be determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the teachings described herein. The lateral positions of optical breakdown for ZL fixed to 30 mm and ZL fixed to 20 mm are shown. These surfaces that extend transverse to the axis <b>99</b> along the Z-dimension correspond to locations of optical scanning of the X and Y galvos to provide optical breakdown at lateral locations away from the axis <b>99</b>. The curved non-planner shape of the scan path of optical breakdown for ZL-30 mm and ZL-20 mm can be corrected with the mapping and look up tables as described herein. The curved shape of the focus can be referred to as a warping of the optical breakdown depth and the look up tables can be warped oppositely or otherwise adjusted so as to compensate for the warping of the treatment depth, for example.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The treatment region is shown for setting the laser beam energy about four times the threshold amount for optical breakdown near the center of the system. The increased energy allows the beam system to treat the patient with less than ideal beam focus.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The placement of the posterior surface of the optically transmissive structure of the patient interface away from the surface of the cornea can provide the extended treatment range as shown, and in many embodiments the optically transmissive structure comprises the lens.
