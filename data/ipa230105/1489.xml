The rotary tool can be assembled with an extension rod so as to be used in a narrow space. Conventionally, the extension rod has a quick-release mechanism so as to be quickly assembled to and disassembled from the rotary tool.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Specifically, the quick-release mechanism of the extension rod is switched between a locking state and a release state by operation of a sleeve sleeved to a rod body of the extension rod. However, the sleeve is easy to be damaged due to unexpected collisions that may also cause unsmooth operation of the quick-release mechanism. In addition, it is inconvenience and high cost to provide at least one of the sleeve and the rod body with an identified structure or a reinforcing structure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is, therefore, arisen to obviate or at least mitigate the above-mentioned disadvantages.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The main object of the present invention is to provide a quick-release tool connecting rod, which provides stable assembling and good structural strength.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention provides a quick-release tool connecting rod, including: a rod body, a quick-release mechanism and a second sleeve member.

A quick-release tool connecting rod <b>1</b> of the present invention includes a rod body <b>10</b>, a quick-release mechanism <b>20</b> and a second sleeve member <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The rod body <b>10</b> includes an inner space <b>11</b> extending in an axial direction and a through hole <b>12</b> communicated with the inner space <b>11</b>. The quick-release mechanism <b>20</b> includes a push rod <b>21</b> received within the inner space <b>11</b>, a locking member <b>22</b> disposed within the through hole <b>12</b> and a first sleeve member <b>23</b> sleeved to the rod body <b>10</b>. The first sleeve member <b>23</b> is movable relative to the rod body <b>10</b> in the axial direction to drive the push rod <b>21</b> to move between a locking position and a release position. The second sleeve member <b>30</b> is co-movably sleeved to the first sleeve member <b>23</b>, and the first sleeve member <b>23</b> is partially embedded within an inner peripheral wall of the second sleeve member <b>30</b>. Therefore, the second sleeve member <b>30</b> is stably assembled with the first sleeve member <b>23</b> to provide good structural strength and protect the first sleeve member <b>23</b> from external collisions. The first sleeve member <b>23</b> has a first hardness, and the second sleeve member <b>30</b> has a second hardness which is smaller than the first hardness so that the inner peripheral wall of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> is urged to deform by an outer peripheral wall of the first sleeve member <b>23</b>. When the push rod <b>21</b> is in the locking position, the locking member <b>22</b> is radially urged by the push rod <b>21</b> and partially protrudes out of the rod body <b>10</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>); and when the push rod <b>21</b> is in the release position, the locking member <b>22</b> is radially retractable without protruding out of the rod body <b>10</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) for quick release and stable assembling.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The rod body <b>10</b> further includes a first assembling portion <b>13</b> and a second assembling portion <b>14</b> opposite to the first assembling portion <b>13</b>. In this embodiment, the quick-release mechanism <b>20</b> is disposed on the first assembling portion <b>13</b>, and the first assembling portion <b>13</b> includes a polygonal column <b>131</b> configured to be sleeved with a rotated member, such as sockets, tool connecting rods, screws or the like. The second assembling portion <b>14</b> includes a polygonal hole <b>141</b> configured to be sleeved with a rotary tool, such as wrenches, adapters, or the like. Specifically, the rod body <b>10</b> has a sliding groove <b>15</b> radially disposed therethrough and communicated with the inner space <b>11</b>, and the quick-release mechanism <b>20</b> further includes a sliding rod <b>24</b> movably disposed within the sliding groove <b>15</b>. The first sleeve member <b>23</b> has a penetrating hole <b>231</b> corresponding to the sliding groove <b>15</b>, and the sliding rod <b>24</b> is connected with the push rod <b>21</b> and penetrates within the through hole <b>231</b>. The second sleeve member <b>30</b> is radially blockable with the sliding rod <b>24</b>. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when the second sleeve member <b>30</b> is moved in the axial direction, the first sleeve member <b>23</b> drives the sliding rod <b>24</b> to axially move along the sliding groove <b>15</b> and drives the push rod <b>21</b> to move to the release position, which has a simple structure and is easy to operate. Preferably, the quick-release mechanism <b>20</b> further includes an elastic member <b>25</b> received in the inner space <b>11</b>, and the elastic member <b>25</b> is axially abutted against and between the push rod <b>21</b> and the rod body <b>10</b> so that the push rod <b>21</b> has a tendency to move in a direction toward the locking position. Therefore, the push rod <b>21</b> can return automatically to the locking position for stable engagement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A difference between an outer diametrical dimension of the first sleeve member <b>23</b> and an inner diametrical dimension of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> is between 0.01 mm and 1.00 mm, which allows the first sleeve member 23 to be effectively embedded radially to the second sleeve member <b>30</b> and avoids relative movement. Preferably, the outer peripheral wall of the first sleeve member <b>23</b> has a plurality of convex portions <b>232</b> disposed thereon and spaced apart from one another so as to provide deformation space therebetween, and at least a portion of the plurality of convex portions <b>232</b> extends to an end surface of the first sleeve member <b>23</b> for easy assembling. The first sleeve member <b>23</b> is preferably non-rotatable relative to the second sleeve member <b>30</b> so as to directly drive the push rod <b>21</b> and have good force transmission effect. A density of the first sleeve member <b>23</b> is preferably larger than a density of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> so that the first sleeve member <b>23</b> has good structural strength and is easy to urge the second sleeve member <b>30</b> to deform during assembling. In the axial direction, a length of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> is larger than or equal to a length of the first sleeve member <b>23</b> so that the second sleeve member <b>30</b> can entirely cover the first sleeve member <b>23</b> and radially block the sliding rod <b>24</b>, which is easy to assemble and provides good reinforcement effect. In this embodiment, the first sleeve member <b>23</b> is formed with the through hole <b>231</b> at first, and then the plurality of convex portions <b>232</b> is formed so as to avoid dislocation during drilling and damage of the structure of the plurality of convex portions <b>232</b>. The plurality of convex portions <b>232</b> may be formed by rolling, which provides surface densification, good structural strength and no chips during processing. Preferably, the difference between the outer diametrical dimension of the first sleeve member <b>23</b> and the inner diametrical dimension of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> is between 0.05 mm and 0.15 mm so that the first sleeve member <b>23</b> is easy to be assembled with and stably engaged with the second sleeve member <b>30</b>. The first sleeve member <b>23</b> may be made of steel to have a sufficient hardness, and the second sleeve member <b>30</b> may be made of aluminum alloy so as to have a light weight and be easy to process to form anti-slip or/and identified structures. An outer periphery wall of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> has at least one embossing portion <b>32</b>, which provides anti-slip effect and preferable appearance. However, the length of the second sleeve member may be smaller than the length of the first sleeve member; the first sleeve member and the second sleeve member may be made of other materials; and the plurality of convex portions may be formed by cutting or other processing methods.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Moreover, each of the plurality of convex portions <b>232</b> extends continuously between two end surfaces of the first sleeve member <b>23</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, adjacent two of the plurality of convex portions <b>232</b> define a concave portion <b>233</b> therebetween, and a gap G is formed between each said concave portion <b>233</b> and the inner peripheral wall of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> so as to have sufficient deformation space and prevent the outer periphery wall of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> from deformation. A radial width of each said gap G is smaller than &#x2154; of a maximum depth of one said concave portion <b>233</b> relative to one of the plurality of convex portions <b>232</b> so that the second sleeve member <b>30</b> and the first sleeve member <b>23</b> are stably engaged and non-rotatable relative to each other. Each of the plurality of convex portions <b>232</b> includes an arcuate surface <b>234</b> and two extension surfaces <b>235</b>, and the two extension surfaces <b>235</b> extend from two opposite sides of the arcuate surface <b>234</b> and obliquely away from each other so that each of the plurality of convex portions <b>232</b> has a smooth surface to avoid deformation and broken during assembling with the second sleeve member <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, the first sleeve member and the second sleeve member may entirely contact with each other without the gap; and each of the plurality of convex portions may be a ribs with a flat top surface or an acute angle.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the inner peripheral wall of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> includes a guiding portion <b>31</b> adjacent to an end opening of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), and a diametrical dimension of the guiding portion <b>31</b> is larger than the outer diametrical dimension of the first sleeve member <b>23</b> for easy assembling. In this embodiment, the guiding portion <b>31</b> is an annular inclined surface radially extending outward. In assembling, the guiding portion <b>31</b> is axially abutted against an end of the first sleeve member <b>23</b>, and the second sleeve member <b>30</b> is sleeved to the first sleeve member <b>23</b> by exerting force from another end of the second sleeve member <b>30</b> opposite to the guiding portion <b>31</b>, which is easy to manufacture and processing and is low cost. However, the guiding portion may be an arcuate surface or an annular step.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
