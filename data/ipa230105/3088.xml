The work string comprises a drill bit at its very lowest end and which is rotated from surface by a string of drill pipe. Additional lengths of drill pipe are connected at the upper end of the work string at surface to allow the lower end of the work string to drill deeper into the subterranean earth.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a conventional vertical bore drilling setup, a drill bit is connected to a drill string made up of tubular members. The weight of the drill string located above the drill bit provides weight on bit (WOB) such that rotation of the drill string in turn rotates the drill bit which penetrates deeper into the earth.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this arrangement the weight on bit is reduced as the bore deviates from the horizonal. The drill string may lie on the lower side of the bore resulting in friction, drag and wear to the drill string and reducing the force applied to the drill bit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Downhole tractors are known which are used to convey downhole tools along the borehole in highly deviated wellbore. These devices pull the downhole tool on a cable down the well such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,954,131, 6,179,055 and 6,629,568.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are various mechanisms used by traction device such as rollers, wheels or chains which act on the borehole wall to drive the downhole tool along. For example, US2014/158432 discloses a roller for mounting on a downhole apparatus. The roller engages a wall of a borehole or bore-lining tubular and urges the apparatus along the wall of the borehole or bore-lining tubular as the roller rotates on the body.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, these systems develop small areas of high friction and high-pressure zones with the bore wall which may induce whirling behaviour of the drill string causing forward whirl, backward whirl or intermittent bouncing behaviour and lead to scraping, gouging and damage to the wellbore.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of an aspect of the present invention to obviate or at least mitigate the foregoing disadvantages of prior art downhole traction tools.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a robust and reliable downhole traction tool which can provide a downhole traction force with low friction and enhanced efficiency against the bore wall to mitigate damage to the bore wall.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a downhole traction tool which can move drill cuttings settled on the lower side of the borehole to enable the traction tool to grip the wellbore and mitigate the risk of drill string whirl.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a downhole borehole traction apparatus comprising:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a body comprising a borehole engaging section;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">wherein the borehole engaging section comprises an outer surface with at least one thread wherein the at least one thread comprises;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a crest surface;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a leading surface; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">a trailing surface having a curvilinear shape;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">wherein the crest surface and the leading surface are configured to engage an inner surface of the borehole to urge the apparatus along the inner surface of the borehole in response to rotation of the body and/or apparatus.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The crest and leading surface may form a wellbore traction section or zone.
