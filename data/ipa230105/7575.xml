Such devices now include computers, smart phones, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, cars, medical devices factory equipment, etc. An end-user network-connected device typically cannot directly access a public network such as the Internet. Instead, an end-user network device establishes a network connection with an access network, and the access network communicates with a core network that is connected to one or more packet data networks (PDNs) offering services. There are several different types of access networks currently in use. Examples include Radio Access Networks (RANs) that are access networks for <b>3</b>rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks, trusted and untrusted non-3GPP networks such as Wi-Fi or WiMAX networks, and fixed/wireline networks such as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Passive Optical Network (PON), and cable networks. The core network may be that of a mobile service provider network, such as a 3G, 4G/LTE, or 5G network.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, the disclosure describes techniques for controlling different types of access networks and merging capabilities of different access networks. As noted above, different end user devices may use different types of access networks to access a core network. These different access networks have different capabilities, functions, network stacks, application programming interfaces (APIs) etc. Further, each type of access network is typically configured and controlled by different management entities, making it difficult to provide consistent services, consistent reporting, and common user interfaces across the different access networks.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This lack of consistency can be a barrier to providing new services and integrated services across different access networks. As an example, authentication entities may be different across different access networks. Thus, an operator of different access networks may require users that migrate from a first access network owned by the operator to a second access network owned by the operator to reauthenticate before being allowed to use the second access network. The authentication requirements of the second network may be different from the first network, requiring the user to maintain multiple authentication credentials for each of the different access networks. This can be frustrating for the user, leading to a poor user experience.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The lack of consistency of service interfaces can be a barrier to providing new services, or extending existing services to different access networks. As an example, network slicing is an end-to-end service that involves an access network. In network slicing, a network operator multiplexes multiple independent virtual networks on the same physical network infrastructure. Network slices can be optimized according to capacity, coverage, connectivity, security and performance requirements of various users and applications. Because the slices can be isolated from each other, as if they are physically separated both in the control and user planes, the user experience of the network slice can be the same as if it was a separate physical network. However, current systems are limited with respect to the scope of network slicing. For example, current systems are typically limited to providing slices across a single access network.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The techniques disclosed herein include an access network intelligent controller that provides a platform for applications that can provide various services across different types of access networks. The applications of the access network intelligent controller described herein can interface with various controllable functions of access network control functions. The access network control function can expose a service model that describes the services provided by the access network control function and its controllable functions. Applications can subscribe to the services. The techniques can enable network operators to achieve unified control in different access networks, in some cases simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The techniques disclosed herein can provide a technical advantage over previous systems by enabling applications of an access network intelligent controller to control many different types of access networks using common interfaces. As a practical application of the techniques described in this disclosure, the access network intelligent controller and access network agent enable applications that provide services using the resource of multiple access networks managed by an operator. As an example, applications integrated with the access network intelligent controller can provide fine-grained common control to authentication services, network slicing services, resource management services etc. that can utilize resources provided by multiple access networks rather than just one access network. Thus, the access network intelligent controller can provide a platform for applications that can control both the access side and core side stack of multiple types of access networks and core networks, such as 5G core networks. As but one example, the service-oriented view of access networks and core networks facilitates software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) that allow the implementation of flexible and scalable network services on top of differing underlying network infrastructures.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one example, a system includes an access network intelligent controller comprising processing circuitry configured to communicate with a 3GPP access network control function and a non-3GPP access network control function, wherein: the non-3GPP access network control function comprises a first plurality of controllable functions; the 3GPP access network control function comprises a second plurality of controllable functions; and the access network intelligent controller is configured to execute one or more applications, each application of the one or more applications configured to: issue a subscription request for a subscription to a first controllable function of the first plurality of controllable functions of the non-3GPP access network control function or a second controllable function of the second plurality of controllable functions of the 3GPP access network control function, and exchange messages with the first controllable function or the second controllable function in accordance with the subscription.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another example, a method includes instantiating, by an access network intelligent controller comprising processing circuitry configured to communicate with a 3GPP access network control function and a non-3GPP access network control function, one or more applications; issuing, by an application of the one or more applications, a subscription request for a subscription to a first controllable function of a first plurality of controllable functions of the non-3GPP access network control function or a second controllable function of a second plurality of controllable functions of the 3GPP access network control function; and exchanging messages with the first controllable function or the second controllable function in accordance with the subscription.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

The example network system <b>100</b> implements control plane user plane separation (CUPS). CUPS refers to the separation between network management functions from network traffic forwarding functions. For example, control plane functions can include user connection management, route determination, Quality of Service (QoS) policy definition and enforcement, user authentication, etc. User plane functions typically include functions that forward network traffic from one node to another. CUPS can be beneficial because it can facilitate scaling of use plane functionality separately from control plane functionality.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, components of a control plane and a user plane of network system <b>100</b> conform to 5th generation mobile network (&#x201c;5G&#x201d;) specifications as published by 3GPP. The user plane can include components that communicatively attach user equipment (UE) <b>101</b> to data network <b>140</b>. In some aspects, data network <b>140</b> can be the Internet. UE <b>101</b> can be an end-user network device that communicates with other network devices on data network <b>140</b> via an operator's access network.

For example, each of gNodeB <b>314</b>, N3IWF <b>316</b>, TNGF <b>318</b> and W-AGF <b>311</b> may utilize authentication services. However, some of the access network control functions may utilize different authentication mechanisms than others of the access network control functions. Thus, while gNodeB <b>314</b>, N3IWF <b>316</b>, TNGF <b>318</b> and W-AGF <b>311</b> may all utilize authentication services, they may do so in different ways. Similarly, gNodeB <b>314</b>, N3IWF <b>316</b>, TNGF <b>318</b> and W-AGF <b>311</b> may all utilize session management services, slicing services, policy services, etc., but may do so in different ways. The information elements in the service models associated with the respective access network control functions can reflect these differences. An application <b>191</b> can use the service model of an access network control function to determine the services provided and consumed by the access network control function.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0062">An application <b>191</b> can use controllable function application protocol <b>203</b> to interface with services across disparate access networks regardless of service implementation differences across the access networks. Such services can include authentication services, slicing services, mobility management services, and resource management services.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0063">As an example, an operator of multiple types of access networks can configure application <b>191</b> to provide common control of authentication services across disparate access networks. As an example, an application <b>191</b> may be an authentication application that can subscribe to receive a report of when authentication events occur within each of the different access networks managed by the network operator. The authentication application can utilize an insert service and control service provided by controllable functions of each of the access network control functions to perform or control authentication operations. The authentication application can provide for common authentication across the different access network types, thereby providing an improved user experience to the users of the different access networks. For example, the user may be able to use a single set of authentication policies across the different access networks managed by the network operator instead of having to manage multiple sets of authentication policies, one for each access network.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">As an additional example, an operator of multiple types of access networks can configure an application <b>191</b> as a Software Define Networking (SDN) controller. SDN platforms typically facilitate a configuration of overlay and underlay networks. The underlay network is made up of physical devices and connections over which the overlay network provides network virtualization. In some aspects, the SDN controller application can configure nodes reachable by multiple types of access networks as nodes of an underlay network.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0065">As another example, an operator of multiple types of access networks can configure an application <b>191</b> as a slicing optimization application that implements network slicing optimization across multiple disparate access networks. Current systems are typically limited to implementing control on slicing on a single access network. Using the techniques disclosed herein, a slicing optimization application can subscribe to, and intervene in, slicing control messages exchanged between an access network control function and a slicing control function of a core network (e.g., NSSF <b>159</b>). The slicing optimization application can configure network slices across the different types of access networks, thereby providing more control and better service to the network operator with respect to network slicing.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0066">As a further example, an operator of multiple types of access networks can configure an application <b>191</b> as an access and mobility management application that controls user equipment access and handoff on the disparate networks. For example, an end-user working at home may connect a laptop to a work network via a home wireless access point that connects to a wired access network, perhaps through a residential gateway. The user may then decide to go to the office via public transportation. While on the public transportation, the user may connect the laptop to the work network via a 3GPP mobile network. Finally, upon arriving to the office, the user may connect to the work network via a trusted non-3GPP network. The access and mobility management application may handle connection and session management handoffs as the user changes between the different types of access networks.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0067">As a still further example, an operator of multiple types of access networks can configure an application <b>191</b> as a resource management application to monitor resource usage across the different types of access networks. The resource management application can allocate processing resources across the different types of access networks depending on how the control messages indicate the access networks are being used. For example, a resource management application can subscribe to receive duplicates of connection control messages, session management control messages etc. to determine usage of the different access networks managed by the operator. Processing resources can be shifted from one access network to another access network as the number of connections or number of sessions on an access network increases or decreases.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0068">The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes four instances of example access network control functions, gNodeB <b>314</b>, N3IWF <b>316</b>, TNGF <b>318</b> and W-AGF <b>311</b>.
