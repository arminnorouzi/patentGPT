The borescopes can be introduced into the regions of interest through small openings and offer a view of otherwise not visually accessible areas either directly using an optical unit or by way of a display of a video image recorded by a suitable sensor system at the borescope tip, also referred to as a video borescope. The shaft of the borescope can here be rigid or be flexible so as to even better pass into difficult-to-access areas.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore borescopes may have two image sensors that are arranged at the borescope tip, whose recording regions overlap such that three-dimension (3D) information, specifically the distance of the individual image points from the borescope tip, can be derived in principle from simultaneously recorded images with the aid of triangulation methods. The 3D information acquired from different positions using a corresponding borescope can be combined with the associated image information to form a 3D model, with the aid of which a detailed assessment of the recorded object can then be performed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, in cases in which the region to be captured by the borescope is low-contrast, errors may occur when ascertaining 3D information from the recorded images of the two image sensors by way of triangulation, or a corresponding ascertainment is not possible at all, since, in order to be able to acquire 3D information by way of triangulation, it is necessary to be able to in each case uniquely identify individual object points on simultaneously recorded images of the two image sensors in order to estimate the distance of the object point from the image sensors based on the distance of the object points represented on the two images in the case of superposition. If individual object points cannot be identified due to a lack of contrast, no 3D information can be acquired either.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A pattern of individual points can be projected onto the surface to be recorded, which are then used as support points for the triangulation. Interpolation is subsequently performed between the ascertainable pieces of 3D information for the individual points. The resolution of the 3D data in this embodiment is discernible and inadequate for example for inspecting engine blades of an aircraft engine using a borescope.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Alternatively, the 3D information may be ascertained by structured-light scanning, although it is here absolutely necessary that the relative pose between the borescope and the region to be recorded, and the region to be recorded itself do not change during the capturing time period. This results in a significant expenditure of time in particular in the case of larger equipment to be inspected.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the present disclosure provides a borescope that includes an electronic image capture unit having two image capture sensors as a borescope lens at an end of a shaft that is designed for being inserted into a borescope opening, a position and alignment of the image capture sensors in relation to one another being suitable for ascertaining three-dimension (3D) information using triangulation; and a pattern projector configured to project a pattern into a common recording region of the image capture sensors.

By the light-guide bundle being optically imaging in principle, for which the individual light-guide fibers need to have a sufficiently small diameter, it is ensured that the individual pattern points generated by the pattern projector have a sufficiently small resolution, frequently comparable to the resolution of the image capture sensors.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The actual projected pattern is here mainly generated by the light-guide bundle itself. By virtue of the fact that the individual optical fibers have differing transmittances and that they are statistically distributed in the light-guide bundle, a random light intensity distribution is already obtained at the output surface in the case of a uniform light introduction at the input surface by way of the light source, which light intensity distribution on the surface, at which the output surface is directed, a contrast pattern that improves the ascertainment of 3D information using triangulation for low-contrast surfaces in terms of accuracy or makes it possible in principle in the first place in the case of no-contrast surfaces. In this case, the speed advantages of triangulation compared to the structured-light scanning fully come into effect.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is here already sufficient to use optical fibers having only two differing transmittances because a sufficiently detailed pattern can be projected due to the statistic distribution and the small diameters of the optical fibers resulting from the requirement relating to optical imaging. Some of the optical fibers can also have a transmittance of zero.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The differing transmittances of the individual optical fibers can be achieved by suitably selecting different core-to-cladding ratios (cladding to core diameter ratio; CCDR) of the optical fibers. Due to the core-to-cladding ratio, which relates to the internal structure of an optical fiber, the transmittance of an optical fiber can be changed while keeping the outer diameter constant and when using the same materials for the core and cladding. The light-guide bundle can have a diameter from 0.5 mm to 1.10 mm, preferably from 0.89 mm to 0.90 mm, and/or comprise 6500 to 10,000, preferably 7700 to 7900, optical fibers. The individual optical fibers can have a diameter of from 8 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Due to the small diameter of the light-guide bundle, the pattern projector provided according to an aspect of the present disclosure can as a rule be integrated into the tip of a borescope without difficulty, alongside the image capture sensors. In particular, the outer diameter of the borescope does not need to be enlarged compared to known borescopes. The pattern projector is here integrated in accordance with the present disclosure together with the image capture sensors into the tip of a borescope, wherein the pattern projector and the image capture sensors are aligned in relation to one another such that 3D information can be ascertained using triangulation on the basis of the pattern projection recorded by the image capture sensors.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In principle, it is possible to guide the light-guide bundle through the shaft of the borescope and to connect an externally arranged light source to the input surface of the light-guide bundle. However, it is preferred if the light source comprises an LED. The use of an LED as the light source makes sufficient miniaturization of the pattern projector possible so that the latter can be arranged in its entirety, that is to say including the light source, in the tip of the borescope. A sufficient number of light-intense LEDs with low heat generation are known from the prior art, wherein the LEDs are preferably designed in particular for coupling light into the light-guide bundle and/or are selected with respect to good light efficiency.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">If the heat generation of the light source is not sufficiently low, the light source of adjacent electronic components can be thermally decoupled.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At least one optical element for beam deflection, such as for example a prism, can be provided between the light source and the input surface. With a corresponding optical element, the design and the dimensions of the pattern projector can be adapted to the circumstances of a borescope.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively or in addition, at least one optical element for beam influencing, for example a stop and/or a lens element, can also be provided. With one or more optical elements for beam influencing, the properties of the projected pattern can be influenced. For example, a collimator optical unit can be provided in order to make the light from the light source more uniform before it enters the light-guide bundle. Such a collimator optical unit aligns the light from the light source as homogeneously as possible over the entire surface of the light-guide bundle before it enters the light-guide bundle. The projected pattern is then generated practically solely by the differing transmittances of the individual optical fibers.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The light source is designed for emitting light in a wavelength range that is in principle capturable by the image capture sensors. The light source can in particular be designed for emitting white light and/or infrared light.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The recording cones of the image capture sensors are preferably aligned at a specified viewing angle with respect to the shaft. If this viewing angle is 90&#xb0;, regions laterally of the image capture unit can be captured. With a different selection of the viewing angle in deviation from 90&#xb0;, regions located in the insertion direction of the borescope in front of it (angular range 30&#xb0;-90&#xb0;) or regions located therebehind (angular range 90&#xb0;-150&#xb0;) can be captured. However, it is also possible to provide a plurality of pairs of image capture sensors provided for triangulation on an individual borescope, which each have different viewing angles. In particular, two pairs of image capture sensors can be provided, wherein the recording cones of both image capture sensors of one pair are aligned at a different viewing angle with respect to the shaft axis than the recording cones of both image capture sensors of the other pair. In this case, a plurality of pattern projectors can be provided, or a pattern projector is configured such that it projects a pattern into the respective recording regions of the image capture sensor pairs.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The image capture unit can comprise at least one image capture sensor for capturing color images. Here, the color images captured by this at least one image capture sensor can be used directly for triangulation, in particular in the case of active pattern projection. However, it is also possible that 3D information, ascertained on the basis of grayscale images recorded by a pair of image capture sensors, is supplemented with the color information of a color image capture sensor in order to obtain colored 3D information or a colored 3D model in this way. Using grayscale image capture sensors for ascertaining 3D information can be advantageous due to the higher resolution in the case of identical sensor size compared to color image capture sensors. For capturing the color image, in this case the pattern projection is preferably temporarily interrupted so as not to falsify the color information. For this case, a separate alternative light source can be provided for temporarily uniformly illuminating the recording region of the color image capture sensor.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The image capture sensors are preferably charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors or complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors, preferably with global shutter. The image capture sensors preferably have a resolution of 400&#xd7;400 pixels to 2400&#xd7;2400 pixels, a frame rate of up to 240 recordings per second, and/or an image field opening angle of 30&#xb0; to 120&#xb0;, preferably 35&#xb0; to 65&#xb0;, with further preference of 40&#xb0;, 50&#xb0; or 60&#xb0;, in each case &#xb1;5&#xb0;, preferably in each case &#xb1;3&#xb0;. With corresponding image capture sensors, in particular continuous recording of image information is also possible.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The shaft of the borescope can be rigid or flexible. If the shaft is flexible, the borescope can be guided for example through a guide tube. The guide tube can in this case be part of the borescope or of a separate guide apparatus. Using the guide tube, the fundamental position of the borescope or of the image capture unit thereof in the interior of the region to be inspected with the borescope can then be defined. The shaft can also be provided with wire pulleys, which make direct control of the shaft possible. However, it is also possible to guide the borescope with a flexible shaft loosely through a region to be recorded and to create the desired recordings in particular when the borescope is pulled out.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows the tip <b>2</b> of a borescope <b>1</b>, which can be introduced into the regions to be examined of a technical piece of equipment, such as for example an aircraft engine. The borescope <b>1</b> comprises a flexible shaft <b>3</b>, which is controllable via wire pulleys. The axis of symmetry of the shaft <b>3</b> forms the shaft axis <b>3</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Provided at the tip <b>2</b> of the borescope <b>1</b> on the shaft <b>3</b> is an electronic image capture unit <b>10</b>, which, in the used state of the borescope <b>1</b>, is surrounded by a transparent protective housing <b>4</b>, which is merely indicated by dashes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The image capture unit <b>10</b> comprises two spaced-apart grayscale image capture sensors <b>11</b>, the recording cones of which overlap such that 3D information can be derived from the images of the two image capture sensors <b>11</b> for the overlap region using triangulation. Moreover, a color-image image capture sensor <b>12</b> is provided, which likewise captures the overlap region of the two other image capture sensors <b>11</b>. The color image information of the image capture sensor <b>12</b> can be used to enrich the 3D information acquired by way of the two other image capture sensors <b>11</b> with color information. Corresponding methods herefor are known in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The image capture sensors <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are furthermore arranged such that their recording cones or their recording axes <b>11</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2032; are aligned at a specified viewing angle of 90&#xb0; with respect to the shaft axis <b>3</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order to make capture of a color image possible by way of the corresponding image capture sensor <b>12</b>, an LED is provided as an alternative light source <b>13</b>, with which the recording region of the image capture sensor <b>23</b> can be temporarily illuminated sufficiently for capturing a color image.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, the image capture unit <b>10</b> comprises a pattern projector <b>20</b>, with which a pattern is provided in the common recording region of the image capture sensors <b>11</b> provided for triangulation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pattern projector <b>20</b> comprises a light-guide bundle <b>21</b> having approximately 7800 optical fibers <b>22</b>, which each have a diameter of approximately 9 &#x3bc;m. Due to the multiplicity of optical fibers <b>22</b> and their diameters, the light-guide bundle <b>21</b> is in principle considered to be optically imaging. However, the optical fibers <b>22</b> of the light-guide bundle <b>21</b> have differing transmittances, wherein the optical fibers <b>22</b> either belong to a first group having a high transmittance or to a second group having a significantly lower transmittance. Since the corresponding optical fibers <b>22</b> are statistically distributed, a pattern <b>50</b>, as is illustrated by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, is obtained at the output surface <b>24</b> of the light-guide bundle <b>21</b> or in the projection when light is uniformly introduced into the input surface <b>23</b>. The individual points of the pattern <b>40</b> here substantially correspond to the resolution of the image capture sensors <b>11</b>. The brightness of the points is determined solely by the transmittance of the respective optical fibers <b>22</b>.
