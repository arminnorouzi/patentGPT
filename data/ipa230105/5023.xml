The &#x201c;Content Producer&#x201d; gives content to a &#x201c;Content Consumer&#x201d;. The &#x201c;Content Consumer&#x201d; gives their attention to an &#x201c;Advertiser&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Advertiser&#x201d; gives money to the &#x201c;Content Producer.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the first transaction the &#x201c;Content Producer&#x201d; exchanges content for the attention of the &#x201c;Content Consumer&#x201d;. In the second transaction the &#x201c;Content Producer&#x201d; sells the consumer's attention to an &#x201c;Advertiser&#x201d;. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. In this example, the &#x201c;Content Consumer's&#x201d; attention is the product in the second transaction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are problems for all three stakeholders with existing Ad serving systems. The &#x201c;Content Producer&#x201d; is often dissatisfied with the amount of money the advertising market is willing to pay for the consumer's attention. The &#x201c;Content Consumer&#x201d; often values the time it &#x201c;costs&#x201d; to watch an advertisement more than they value the content they are receiving in exchange. This results in the consumer skipping the content experience to the detriment of all stakeholders. The &#x201c;Advertiser&#x201d; is often doing damage to its brand by polluting the culture with ineffective ads.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Using the national minimum wage of $7.25/hour as a guide, a consumer's time is worth 12 cents a minute. Ad market rates that pay fractions of a cent per view are valuing the consumer's attention at less than 1 penny per minute. This disparity is exacerbated if the &#x201c;Content Consumer&#x201d; values their time at a rate hirer that $7.25/hour. Because there is exponentially more content produced than advertisers willing to advertise, the price the &#x201c;Advertiser&#x201d; pays to the &#x201c;Content Producer&#x201d; is lower than the value of the content to &#x201c;Content Producers&#x201d; and &#x201c;Content Consumers.&#x201d;</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> shows existing media content delivery models that are unsatisfactory to media content providers, consumers, and advertisers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an Ad serving model <b>100</b> where a content provider/producer <b>102</b> receives a payment from and advertiser <b>106</b> (Step <b>1</b>) in exchanges for consumer <b>104</b>'s attention (Steps <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>) when the consumer receives media content (Step <b>2</b>). The consumer's attention is typically in the form of viewing an electronic Ad that is sent to the consumer <b>104</b>. The electronic Ad may have a duration of 5 seconds to 30 seconds, or longer. None of the parties <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> are satisfied with model <b>100</b> because the consumer <b>104</b> is forced to watch an electronic Ad for a period of time, i.e., the consumer's attention is distracted from the desired media content for a period of time. This may create a negative impression by the consumer <b>104</b> of the advertiser <b>106</b> and/or advertiser's product. Furthermore, the consumer <b>104</b> may not request further content from the media content provider <b>102</b> in the future, resulting in lost revenue to the media content provider <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows an alternative existing model <b>150</b> where the consumer <b>104</b> purchases a subscription to media content from the media content provider <b>102</b> (Step <b>1</b>).

For example, the consumer <b>104</b> may purchase access to NETFLIX, Disney+, the New York Times, and so on. Unfortunately, the consumer <b>104</b> may only desire access to a small amount of media content, e.g., movies, shows, articles, videos. The consumer is forced to overpay for additional unwanted content. The advertiser <b>106</b> is completely excluded from any opportunity to provide an Ad and obtain the target consumer's attention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Unfortunately, none of the existing Ad serving systems or models provide a way to serve Ads and facilitate related transactions in a way that enables efficient distribution of media content with electronic advertisements that is satisfying to all three parties to a media content delivery transaction such as the consumer, advertiser, and the media content provider/producer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The application addresses deficiencies associated with the existing advertisement servicing systems and models by, in various implementations, recognizing that advertising serving involves a three-party transaction among stakeholders including the content producer of the media content, an advertiser, and consumer of the media content. For harmony to exist in the ad market, all of the stakeholders need to agree to the value of what is being traded. The reason consumers and advertisers wildly disagree on the value of the consumer's time is because the consumer is not able to participate in the market for their own time. By allowing the consumer to participate in the market for their own time, i.e., decide whether to view an electronic Ad, the three things being traded (money, content, and consumer attention) begin to be valued in a similar way by all parties.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advertising is sold in units of <b>1000</b> views, (Cost Per Thousand or CPM). A CPM of $5 means the advertiser is paying one half penny per view. In one example. the &#x201c;Advertiser&#x201d; bids one penny for the &#x201c;Content Consumer's&#x201d; attention. If the &#x201c;Content Consumer&#x201d; values the media content at more than one penny but less than the cost of 15 seconds of time to watch the Ad, they can bid more than one penny in the ad market, pay directly to the &#x201c;Content Producer,&#x201d; and skip viewing the Ad. In this example, the &#x201c;Content Producer&#x201d; benefits from a higher price and the &#x201c;Content Consumer&#x201d; benefits from a lower cost. The &#x201c;Advertiser&#x201d; benefits from avoiding damage done to their brand from the resentment from the other two stakeholders. People watching interruption advertising value their units of attention in an exponential way. Other stakeholders in the market might be tempted to value 30 seconds of consumer attention at 6 times the value of 5 seconds of consumer attention, but to the content consumer 30 seconds costs exponentially more than 5 seconds of attention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a second example, the advertiser bids a dollar per viewer for a desirable audience. The viewer values the content at less than the dollar bid but more than 15 second &#x201c;cost&#x201d; in their own time watching the ad. This viewer would choose to watch the 15 second Ad and the &#x201c;Advertiser&#x201d; would pay one dollar to the &#x201c;Content Producer.&#x201d; In this second example, the &#x201c;Advertiser&#x201d; would develop goodwill with the &#x201c;Content Consumer&#x201d; by paying for wanted content. The &#x201c;Content Consumer&#x201d; would receive media content they valued more than their 15 seconds of their time, and the &#x201c;Content Producer&#x201d; would benefit from the higher price they receive because of the new competition for the consumer's attention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A monopoly is a market where a single producer has the ability to influence the price of goods or services because the consumer has no other choice. There is no competition among producers. A monopsony is a market where a single consumer has the ability to influence the price of goods or services because the producers have no other choice. An example of a monopsonistic market is a single employer, like a coal mine, that employs an entire region of employees. Many producers of labor but only one consumer of labor. A lack of competition in that situation gives the coal mine an unfair ability to determine the price of labor.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Advertising markets are neither a monopoly or a monopsony. There are many people willing to trade their attention and many advertisers willing to buy that attention. However, advertising markets behave in a similar way to monopsonistic markets because content producers and advertisers typically view all consumer's attention and/or time as having the same value. By introducing competition for the consumer's time, the consumer's time, i.e., what is being traded, can be valued equally by all stakeholders.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">This application describes exemplary systems and methods that allow for responses to the market from all stakeholders. For example, a newspaper could make an article available to non-subscribers for a specific minimum price and leave it to the advertiser and consumer to bid against each other.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The disclosure describes, in some implementations, an electronic bidding system having a media content provider and/or producer that facilitates a bidding process between a consumer client device and advertiser server for the consumer's attention related to an advertisement. An advertiser server may submit an advertiser bid, e.g., an advertiser Ad payment limit, and a consumer device may submit a consumer bid, e.g., a consumer Ad payment limit, to a content provider server. If the consumer outbids the advertiser, then the consumer pays the content producer directly. If the advertiser wins the bid for the consumer's attention, then the advertiser pays the media content producer and the consumer watches the Ad.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Consumers such as consumer <b>104</b> could predetermine how much money or time they are willing to pay for media content that they value and assign different amounts for different levels of subjective value to them. Advertisers such as advertiser <b>106</b> could assign different bid amounts based on the media content and demographics of the consumer <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one aspect, an advertisement (Ad) serving system includes a media content server arranged to: receive media content from a media database, receive an electronic advertisement from an advertisement database, receive a consumer Ad payment limit; receive an advertiser Ad payment limit.

Consumer client devices <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> may include any type of computing device such as, without limitation, a personal computer (PC), mobile computing device, mobile telephone, multimedia device, television, NextGen TV (e.g., ATSC <b>3</b>.<b>0</b>), data streaming device, and any device capable of receiving and playing media content and/or electronic advertisements.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">System <b>300</b> may operate as an Ad serving system including media content server <b>302</b> that is arranged to: receive media content; receive an electronic advertisement from an advertiser such as via advertiser server <b>304</b> and/or <b>306</b>; receive a consumer Ad payment limit from a consumer via consumer device <b>308</b> and/or <b>310</b>; and receive an advertiser Ad payment limit via advertiser server <b>304</b> and/or <b>306</b>. Media content server <b>302</b> may then compare the consumer Ad payment limit to the advertiser Ad payment limit and if the consumer Ad payment limit is greater than or equal to the advertiser Ad payment limit, then output the media content without an Ad to the consumer client device <b>308</b> or <b>310</b> that requested the media content and made the consumer bid, i.e., submitted the consumer Ad payment limit. If the consumer Ad payment limit is less than the advertiser Ad payment limit, then the media content server <b>302</b> outputs the media content with the electronic Ad. A consumer client device such as device <b>308</b> may be arranged to: transmit the consumer Ad payment limit to the media content server <b>302</b>, receive the media content from the content server <b>302</b>, and receive the electronic Ad with the media content when the consumer Ad payment limit is less than the advertiser Ad payment limit.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">In some implementations, an advertiser server, e.g., server <b>304</b>, may engage in a bidding process with a consumer device, e.g., device <b>308</b>, to determine whether media content sent to the consumer device <b>308</b> should include an electronic Ad. Hence, an advertiser server <b>304</b> and/or <b>306</b> may be configured to send one or more advertiser Ad payment limits to the media content server <b>302</b>. For example, the advertiser server <b>304</b> and consumer client device <b>308</b> may bid and counterbid with each other until a final one of the parties has the highest bid. The advertiser server <b>304</b> wins when the final advertiser Ad payment limit is greater than a final consumer Ad payment limit. The consumer client device <b>308</b> wins when the final consumer Ad payment limit is greater than or equal to the final advertiser Ad payment limit. In other words, when the content server <b>302</b> does not receive from an advertiser Ad payment limit in response to and greater than the latest consumer Ad payment limit sent from the consumer device <b>308</b>, then the latest and/or final consumer Ad payment limit wins. In this implementation, the ties goes to the consumer client device <b>308</b>. In other implementations, the tie can go to the advertiser server <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">A consumer may use their web browser running on client device <b>308</b> to watch a home improvement video on YouTube, e.g., media content server <b>302</b>. At some point while the video is playing, a 20 second electronic advertisement may be designated to be played. The advertisement may be for a window product from a window manufacturer via advertiser server <b>304</b>. Arbitrator application <b>314</b> of media content server <b>302</b> compares the advertiser Ad payment limit which may be 10 cents for the 20 second video with the consumer Ad payment limit which may be 20 cents. The arbitrator application <b>314</b> determines that the consumer Ad payment limit is greater than the advertiser Ad payment limit and skips or removes the advertisement from the video being played so that the consumer avoids watching the electronic advertisement. The consumer also pays YouTube, e.g., the media content server <b>302</b> the 20 cents to skip the electronic advertisement.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">In some implementations, the media content server <b>302</b> and/or arbitrator application <b>314</b> includes a user portal arranged to receive payment information from a consumer. The portal may include a web server interface that interfaces with a web browser and/or arbitrator client application <b>320</b> of a consumer client device <b>308</b>. The consumer may be able to set up an account with YouTube via the portal that enables the user to input Ad serving configuration settings such as a consumer Ad payment limit to be applied when skipping electronic advertisements associated with media content viewed on the YouTube website. The portal may also enable an advertiser using an arbitrator client <b>316</b> of advertiser server <b>304</b> to set up an account with the media server <b>302</b>, e.g., YouTube server, via the portal that enables the advertiser to input Ad serving configuration settings such as an advertiser Ad payment limit to be applied for electronic advertisements that are played associated with media content viewed on the YouTube website.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">In some implementations, multiple advertisers may simultaneously or concurrently bid against a consumer for the consumer's time to view an Ad. For example, advertiser server <b>304</b> associated with a first advertiser may bid 10 cents to present a first Ad to a consumer while advertiser server <b>306</b> associated with a second advertiser may bid 25 cents to present a second Ad to the consumer. If the consumer bid is 20 cents, then the consumer wins against the first advertiser but loses against the second advertiser, in which case, the consumer views the second Ad and the second advertiser pays the media content provider via media content server <b>302</b>. In some implementations, media content server <b>302</b> and/or arbitrator application <b>314</b> determine in real-time whether to skip or play an advertisement and/or which advertisement to display among multiple Ads.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">In some implementations, the arbitrator application <b>314</b> is preconfigured with the consumer Ad payment limit and the advertiser Ad payment limit, and performs the comparison either before or in real-time as the Ad is expected to be delivered to and/or played by a consumer device and/or client application. In other implementations, the arbitrator application <b>314</b> requests and/or retrieves the consumer Ad payment limit and/or the advertiser Ad payment limit from the arbitrator client <b>320</b> and/or <b>316</b> in real-time before comparing the values and determining whether an advertisement will be delivered to a consumer client device with a media content item.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is block diagram of a computer system <b>400</b> arranged to perform processing associated with an Ad serving system.

Media content server <b>502</b> may then compare the consumer Ad payment limit to the advertiser Ad payment limit and if the consumer Ad payment limit is greater than or equal to the advertiser Ad payment limit, then output the media content form media content database <b>508</b> without an Ad to the consumer client device <b>504</b> that requested the media content and made a the consumer bid, i.e., submitted the consumer Ad payment limit. If the consumer Ad payment limit is less than the advertiser Ad payment limit, then the media content server <b>502</b> outputs the media content from the media content database <b>508</b> with the electronic Ad from the Ad database <b>510</b>. A consumer client device <b>504</b> may be arranged to: transmit the consumer Ad payment limit to the media content server <b>502</b>, receive the media content from the media content database <b>508</b> via the media content server <b>502</b>, and receive the electronic Ad with the media content when the consumer Ad payment limit is less than the advertiser Ad payment limit.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">In some implementations, the consumer client device <b>504</b> may include a user interface arranged to enable a user and/or consumer to configure multiple consumer Ad payment limits with each limit being associated with a different Ad payment category such as, without limitation, a product, a service, a manufacturer, food producer, a vendor and/or advertiser, a technology, product category, and so on. For example, a consumer may input to the consumer client device a higher value for a consumer Ad payment limit for a first Ad payment category that the consumer is less interested in to ensure that it is more likely that any Ads associated with an undesirable category are more likely to be skipped or avoided. The consumer may set a lower or no consumer Ad payment limit for a category that the consumer is more likely to be interested so that it is more likely that an Ad in such as category is delivered and/or played with a media content item. For instance, a consumer who likes BMW automobiles, but not Audi automobiles, may configure a consumer Ad payment limit for BMW Ads at 0 cents, while setting a consumer Ad payment limit for Audi Ads at 20 cents. A consumer who is a vegan may set an Ad payment limit for Ads in the category of meat products to 30 cents and set an Ad payment limit for Ads in the category of vegetarian products at 10 cents. The consumer client device <b>504</b> may send one or more consumer Ad payment limits based on different Ad payment categories to the media content server <b>502</b>, <b>302</b>, and/or arbitrator <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">In certain implementations, an advertiser may use consumer demographic data such as in database <b>512</b> to increase the likelihood that certain target consumers will be delivered their Ads.
