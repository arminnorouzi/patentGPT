to a material appropriate for construction machinery and the like, and more particularly, to a wear-resistant steel having excellent low-temperature impact toughness and high hardness and a manufacturing method therefor.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">As lightweightedness and high performance in industrial machines such as a bulldozer or a power shovel, mining equipment such as a crusher or a chute, a large dump truck, and the like are demanded, a wear-resistant steel is being used for worn areas.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular, in order to extend the durable years of the areas, the wear-resistant steel used herein increasingly shows a tendency of having high hardness, and due to concerns about defects such as crack occurrence by high hardness, high toughness is also required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, a high hardness wear-resistant steel having excellent toughness is widely used as a bulletproof steel.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, the following technologies have been suggested for a wear-resistant steel used in industrial machines, construction machinery, or the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 1 discloses manufacturing of steel, in which certain amounts of Ti, B, and the like with C, Si, and Mn are contained in the steel and a cooling end temperature in the reheating and quenching of a steel sheet having a limited content of H is limited to 300&#xb0; C. or lower, thereby manufacturing a steel having excellent integrity and a Brinell hardness of 450 or less.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Document 2 discloses that a steel sheet to which Cr, Mo, and B are added in addition to C, Si, and Mn is reheated and quenched to manufacture a steel having a Brinell hardness grade of 500.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, Patent Document 3 discloses that a steel containing limited contents of Cr, Mo, Ti, Nb, B, and the like with C, Si, and Mn therein, and if necessary, further containing Cu, Ni, V, Ca, and the like is hot rolled and then cooled to 100&#xb0; C. or lower, and is continuously subjected to a tempering treatment, thereby manufacturing a steel having low-temperature toughness and a Brinell hardness grade of 500.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Besides, Patent Document 4 discloses a high-elasticity and high-strength steel fora special purposes, which has impact resistance and wear resistance secured by tempering a steel appropriately containing a relatively low content of C, a relatively low content of Si, and other elements.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, Patent Document 1 does not satisfy a hardness level required in a real environment, Patent Document 2 satisfies the hardness level but has poor toughness, while Patent Document 3 contains a large amount of relatively expensive elements, and thus, is economically unfavorable and has limitations in application. In Patent Document 4, it is difficult to secure low-temperature toughness and manufacturing costs thereof are still high.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, development of a wear-resistant steel having excellent low-temperature toughness together with wear resistance without including a large amount of expensive elements by an economical method, is demanded.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0012">(Patent Document 1) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 1989-010564 B2</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0013">(Patent Document 2) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 1989-021846 B2</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0014">(Patent Document 3) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 1996-041535g</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0015">(Patent Document 4): Korean Patent Registration Publication No. 10-0619841</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0016">An aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a wear-resistant steel having high impact toughness at a low temperature together with wear resistance while having high hardness, and a manufacturing method therefor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">An object of the present disclosure is not limited to the above description.
