Basic component Shape Code is simple and clear, a Shape Code double-alphabets corresponds to a Basic Component. Chinese character Shape Code has no repetitive code. The coding includes all the Basic Component information in a Chinese character, there is no duplicate code, and it is intuitive and simple. Chinese character category input method is easy to remember and use. Component category uses shape as the only classification standard, it does not involve sound and character meaning, and it is as intuitive and simple for users who know Chinese characters and those who do not know Chinese characters. The grouping of components in the key makes the components easier to remember. The typing method is simple, and you can start typing with almost zero learning. Basically, this input method does not require special learning when getting started, and the entire input process is very natural without many rules. Blind typing and fast typing can be realized. As you become familiar with the components, the input speed will become faster and faster, which can achieve the speed of blind typing and professional typists.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to the &#x201c;GB13000.1 Character Set Chinese Character Components Specification for Information Processing&#x201d; and its attached &#x201c;Chinese Character Basic Components Table&#x201d;, the standard defines 560 Chinese character Basic Components as the basic structure of Chinese characters in a standard way. The 20902 Chinese characters in the GB13000.1 character set are all composed of these components.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to the above Chinese character component specification, component is a character structure unit composed of strokes and having the function of assembling Chinese characters. The Basic Component (ie the Basic Component of Chinese character) is the smallest component that is no longer split, divided into basic character-forming component (itself is a character, referred to as character-forming component) and basic non-character component (not a character itself, referred to as non-character component). Chinese characters can be composed of Basic Components. With the standards for Basic Components, the core issue of Chinese character encoding and input has shifted to how to use these 560 Basic Components, analyzing and categorizing them will help to use them better.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">This invention classifies the 560 Basic components according to their shape characteristics of the Basic Components. For this reason, enter up the concept of a shape category guiding component (that is, the category guiding component below, or the guiding component for short), that is, a component can guide or by representative a set of components according to their shape characteristics. Through a certain amount (such as more than twenty) of these guiding components, the shape characteristics of all components can be expressed. With guiding components as the standard of the category, all components are classified into these guiding components, and you can effectively classify 560 Basic Components according to the shape of the components.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">After repeated test of the invention, one guiding components implement example determined the following 25 shape category guiding components: <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="2.79mm" wi="28.62mm" file="US20230004730A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="2.46mm" wi="23.28mm" file="US20230004730A1-20230105-P00002.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003" he="2.79mm" wi="21.51mm" file="US20230004730A1-20230105-P00003.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>&#x201d; Most of them are the most commonly used character components. The shape of these character components is relatively stretched full and representative. Since they are almost all commonly used characters and people are relatively familiar with them, they are very suitable as guiding components. There are five main stroke components among them, which can be used in places that need to use the strokes.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In order to mark and store each of the above 560 Basic Components in a computer, in consideration of applications such as keyboard typing, it should be very convenient if they can be represented by Roman letters. However, a total of 26 letters from A to Z, including only 52 in total even with lower cases, which is certainly not enough. With two letters, there are 26&#xd7;26=676 combinations, which can meet the needs of 560 components, and there are more 116 spaces for expansion.

Then, in order, find each component and the component Category Code (that is, the letter in the first column of the row) to which it belongs in the Basic Component Shape Code table and enter the component Category Code from the keyboard. If the total number of components of the character is only one or two, additional stroke Category Codes are required. In the case of one component, find the stroke Category Codes of the stroke components corresponding to the first three strokes in the Basic Component shape code table and enter them. If there is no corresponding stroke component, enter &#x201c;B&#x201d; stroke Category Code. When there are two components, find the stroke component categories of the stroke components corresponding to the first two strokes of the second component in the Basic Component Shape Code table and type them in. If there is no corresponding stroke component, enter &#x201c;B&#x201d; stroke Category Code. After the above steps, the input character is generally displayed as the first selected character. The user presses the blank key or the number &#x201c;1&#x201d; to complete the input of the character. If there is a repetitive code, it may be regarded as a non-first choice.
