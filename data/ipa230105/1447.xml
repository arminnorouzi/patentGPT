Techniques are desired for automating this process as well as other paint applications (e.g., primer sanding, clear coat defect removal, clear coat polishing, etc.) amenable to the use of abrasives and/or robotic inspection and repair.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Prior efforts to automate the detection and repair of paint defects include the system described in US Patent Publication No. 2003/0139836, which discloses the use of electronic imaging to detect and repair paint defects on a vehicle body. The system references the vehicle imaging data against vehicle CAD data to develop three-dimensional paint defect coordinates for each paint defect. The paint defect data and paint defect coordinates are used to develop a repair strategy for automated repair using a plurality of automated robots that perform a variety of tasks including sanding and polishing the paint defect.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, like numerals may describe similar components in different views.

In particular, stereo deflectometry has recently been shown to be capable of providing images and locations of paint and clear coat defects at appropriate resolution with spatial information (providing coordinate location information and defect classification) to allow subsequent automated spot repair.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the term &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d; is intended to cover a broad range of mobile structures that receive at least one coat of paint or clear coat during manufacturing. While many examples herein concern automobiles, it is expressly contemplated that methods and systems described herein are also applicable to trucks, trains, boats (with or without motors), airplanes, helicopters, etc.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;paint&#x201d; is used herein to refer broadly to any of the various layers of e-coat, filler, primer, paint, clear coat, etc. of the vehicle that have been applied in the finishing process. Additionally, the term &#x201c;paint repair&#x201d; involves locating and repairing any visual artifacts (defects) on or within any of the paint layers. In some embodiments, systems and methods described herein use clear coat as the target paint repair layer. However, the systems and methods presented apply to any particular paint layer (e-coat, filler, primer, paint, clear coat, etc.) with little to no modification</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the term &#x201c;defect&#x201d; refers to an area on a worksurface that interrupts the visual aesthetic. For example, many vehicles appear shiny or metallic after painting is completed. A &#x201c;defect&#x201d; can include debris trapped within one or more of the various paint layers on the work surface. Defects can also include smudges in the paint, excess paint including smears or dripping, as well as dents.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Paint repair is one of the last remaining steps in the vehicle manufacturing process that is still predominantly manual. Historically this is due to two main factors, lack of sufficient automated inspection and the difficulty of automating the repair process itself. Paint and clear coat repair standards surround aesthetics judged by the human eye&#x2014;the dealership accepting the vehicle and the eventual customer who will inspect the vehicle prior to purchase. Robots are traditionally designed to provide a &#x201c;perfect,&#x201d; or highly &#x201c;regular&#x201d; repair&#x2014;with clear, defined edges and an even cut (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). Unfortunately, this causes the repair to be highly visible to the human eye. Systems and methods described herein address ways to add irregularity to the paint repair process, such that repaired defects better blend into a vehicle surface and are less detectable by a customer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic of a robotic paint repair system in which embodiments of the present invention are useful. System <b>100</b> generally includes two units, a visual inspection system <b>110</b> and a defect repair system <b>120</b>. Both systems may be controlled by a motion controller <b>112</b>, <b>122</b>, respectively, which may receive instructions from one or more application controllers <b>150</b>. The application controller may receive input, or provide output, to a user interface <b>160</b>. Repair unit <b>120</b> includes a force control unit <b>124</b> that can be aligned with an end-effector <b>126</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, end effector <b>126</b> includes two tools <b>128</b>, as further described in co-pending application Ser. Nos. 62/940,950 and 62/940,960. However, other arrangements are also expressly contemplated.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first of the two main challenges, inspection of vehicle <b>130</b> by inspection unit <b>110</b>, is interesting due to the nature of the underlying problem domain. In general, the surface of interest is very large in comparison to the defects themselves, with the difference being multiple orders of magnitude. This results in trade-offs between field of view and resolution when it comes to sensor selection. Additionally, each paint layer of the finishing process (e-coat, primer, paint, clear coat, etc.) differs in its visual appearance with specularity being particular noteworthy. Highly specular surfaces (i.e., high-gloss) pose unique imaging challenges). These issues together make inspection difficult. Recent progress in the last few years has been made in this area making use of increasing computational resources, resulting in the availability of several commercial solutions. The presence of a sufficiently capable inspection system <b>110</b> is important for identifying defects for repair by repair unit <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The current state of the art in vehicle paint repair is to use fine abrasive and/or polish systems to manually sand/polish out the defects, with or without the aid of a power tool, while maintaining the desirable finish (e.g., matching specularity in the clear coat). An expert human executing such a repair leverages many hours of training while simultaneously utilizing their senses to monitor the progress of the repair and make changes accordingly. Such sophisticated behavior is hard to capture in a robotic solution with limited sensing.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, abrasive material removal is a pressure driven process while many industrial manipulators, in general, operate natively in the position tracking/control regime and are optimized with positional precision in mind. The result is extremely precise systems with extremely stiff error response curves (i.e., small positional displacements result in very large corrective forces) that are inherently bad at effort control (i.e., joint torque and/or Cartesian force)). Closed-loop force control approaches have been used (with limited utility) to address the latter along with more recent (and more successful) force controlled flanges that provide a soft (i.e., not stiff) displacement curve much more amenable to sensitive force/pressure-driven processing. The problem of robust process strategy/control, however, remains and is the focus of this work.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic of a paint repair robot which may be useful in embodiments of the present invention. A robotic repair unit <b>200</b> has a base <b>210</b>, which may be stationary, in some embodiments. In other embodiments, base <b>210</b> can move in any of six dimensions, translations or rotations about an x-axis <b>212</b>, y-axis <b>214</b> and/or z-axis <b>216</b>. For example, robot <b>200</b> may have a base <b>210</b> fixed to a rail system configured to travel along with a vehicle being repaired. Depending on a defect location, robot <b>200</b> may need to move closer, or further away from a vehicle, or may need to move higher or lower with respect to the vehicle. A moveable base <b>200</b> may make repairing difficult to reach defects easier.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Robotic repair unit <b>200</b> has one or more tools <b>240</b> that can interact with a worksurface.

During an abrasive operation, tool <b>240</b> may have an abrasive disc, or other suitable abrasive article, attached using adhesive, hook and loop, clip system, vacuum or other suitable attachment system. However, as the abrasive article moves in conjunction with a backup pad <b>250</b> to which it is attached, the abrasive article is not necessarily considered as adding additional degrees of freedom to the movement of robotic repair unit <b>200</b>. As mounted to the robotic repair unit <b>200</b>, tool <b>240</b> has the ability to be positioned within the provided degrees of freedom by the robotic repair unit <b>200</b> (6 degrees of freedom in most cases) and any other degrees of freedom (e.g., a compliant force control <b>230</b> unit) with its reference frame depicted by axes <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> and <b>256</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Backup pad <b>250</b> is coupled to a tool <b>240</b> which has an orbit that provides some additional degrees of freedom.

The tool <b>240</b> shaft reference frame is depicted by axes <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>, and <b>246</b>. Tool <b>240</b> is coupled to a force control <b>230</b> unit output.

Method <b>300</b> is an overview of how a robotic repair system repairs a defect in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">In block <b>310</b>, instructions are received from a robot controller, such as application controller <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example.

Defect locations on a vehicle are known from an inspection system. Moving the abrasive article into place includes moving the article on top of, or near, the defect. This position may be referred to as the nominal pose of the backup pad.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">In block <b>330</b>, the abrasive article engages the defect. Engaging the defect may include sanding the defect area, as indicated in block <b>332</b>, or polishing the defect area, as indicated in block <b>334</b>. Engaging the defect also includes varying different repair parameters of the backup pad, with respect to the nominal pose, such as the velocity <b>332</b> of the backup pad, the force <b>334</b> imparted to the backup pad, an orientation offset <b>336</b> of the backup pad, and an eventual shape of repair <b>338</b> created by the sanding and polishing operation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">In block <b>340</b>, the defect area is cleaned. Cleaning may include wiping away any fluids used in sanding or polishing, as well as wiping away debris. As indicated in block <b>342</b>, after a cleaning step, the tool may re-engage the defect. For example, a dual mounted tool system may have a sanding unit and a polishing unit available such that, after cleaning is accomplished, the next repair step can be accomplished.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">In block <b>350</b>, the defect area is inspected, to determine whether the repair is sufficient. If additional repair is needed, method <b>300</b> may receive new instructions, as indicated by arrow <b>360</b>, and the method may repeat. Inspecting a defect repair may include capturing post-repair images <b>352</b>, which may be presented to a repair operator or saved as needed. Inspecting may also include validating the repair, as indicated in block <b>354</b>, which may include comparing pre- and post-repair images, detecting whether a defect will be visible/noticeable to the human eye, or another suitable validation technique.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> are images of defects present that may be on a vehicle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates a raised defect <b>410</b> on a work surface <b>400</b>. The raised defect <b>410</b> is likely caused by debris trapped under one or more layers of paint on work surface <b>400</b>. Also of note is the texture <b>420</b> on work surface <b>400</b>. When paint is applied to a worksurface in a manufacturing environment, environmental interferences (such as movement or vibration of the vehicle, movement of circulating air, and properties of the paint applied) cause a textured surface <b>420</b> that is commonly referred to as &#x201c;orange peel&#x201d; because of its appearance. Orange peel can also be added to a clearcoat surface intentionally so that different levels of orange peel texture and add to the aesthetics of different surfaces of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Unfortunately, repair conducted on a worksurface with orange peel will disrupt the texture and can create a highly visible repair area as illustrated in image <b>450</b>. The repair in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> clearly shows a circle outline <b>458</b> where an abrasive article contacted the surface. Additionally, an interior circle <b>454</b> which is an artifact of the repair strategy. Between a center <b>452</b> of the repair area, a wave effect is illustrated because of the force profile, with a surface height decreasing from center <b>452</b> to circle <b>454</b>, rising again to a high point <b>456</b> before decreasing again to rim <b>458</b>. The force profile can be understood as similar in shape to a &#x201c;Bundt-cake&#x201d; with a higher pressure applied in an annular ring area within the disc perimeter. The desired repair smoothly blends the polished surface with the orange peel around the edges of the repair to create a feathered result.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">In general, it is desired to &#x2018;perfectly&#x2019; repair any defects present in the paint, however, the notion of a perfect repair is largely subjective and thus a formal definition is elusive. Informally, a &#x2018;perfect&#x2019; repair as one in which the end result is visually indistinguishable to the human eye from an otherwise defect-free area of the work surface while the notion of an optimal repair is taken to mean the best repair possible given some starting state. For example, not all defects can be repaired to a perfect state. Additionally, time is a critical parameter for defect repair, as vehicle manufacturing is often an assembly line process. An efficient repair, then, can be characterized as a repair that makes the defect area indistinguishable in as short a time as possible.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">The human eye is highly adept at noticing &#x2018;perfect&#x2019; or &#x2018;regular&#x2019; items in nature as well as abrupt transitions in boundary or texture. This sensitivity to abrupt visual boundary transitions necessitates control of transitions between the repaired area and unrepaired area. Repairs such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> are highly visible for a number of reasons including the near-perfect circular nature of repair perimeter <b>458</b> as well as the annular center depression <b>452</b>. In the former case, such transitions are created by the change in surface texture (i.e., from the original paint texture (commonly referred to as orange peel due to its appearance) to the generally more smooth post-polished repaired area) and the latter by height alterations of the surface caused by the distribution of material removal during the repair process. In general, it is not possible to remove the defect without some local alteration to the surface texture and/or height. That said, there is utility in methods that repair sufficiently the defect while leaving as little alteration as possible and furthermore the alterations that are left are such that they are hard for the human eye to notice. In this respect we aim to maximize the concealment of the defect repair on the finished article. As described herein, concealing features are those that decrease the visual apparency of the repair and thus are less likely to be noticed by the human eye. Concealing features may include, for example, feathering around the edges of a boundary, a non-uniform repair area, repair depth profile, non-uniform cut rates, etc.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">A cut-modeling-driven approach to deriving repair strategies that aim to reduce the resulting visual appearance of the defect repair while managing boundary transitions is presented. It is important to note that care needs to be taken to not add perceived defects during the repair of the original defect. In some embodiments, a repair strategy starts by identifying desired properties of the cut distribution (i.e., one that sufficiently removes the defect while also exhibiting other desirable concealing characteristics such as blending/feathering) and find the robotic motion that results in said distribution. Such an approach is possible by leveraging predictive cut models of the abrasive/substrate interaction based on first principles and supplemented with measured results. Further discussion is below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Methods and systems herein operate under the assumption that the substrates are locally planar. This assumption results in no loss of generality as more sophisticated models that take into account the substrate geometry enable the same approach to be applied to locally non-planar surfaces. Such models are possible and are envisioned in some embodiments herein. In general, the defect can be present in any of the paint layers, at any depth and can assume various forms including: crater, hair, scratch, dust nib, drip, fish eye.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">One basis for understanding material removal (and a good first approximation) is the well-known Preston's equation of material removal (Equation 2, below) that expresses the instantaneous rate of material removal (cut) as a product of pressure, relative velocity, and a constant (Preston's constant) defined in part by the complex interaction between the abrasive, substrate, and any cutting fluid.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mfrac>      <mi>dh</mi>      <mi>dt</mi>     </mfrac>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>k</mi>       <mi>p</mi>      </msub>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <msub>       <mi>pv</mi>       <mi>rel</mi>      </msub>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Equation</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mn>2</mn>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">Here k<sub>p </sub>is a constant dependent on the abrasive/surface interaction, p is the pressure at any given point on the surface, and v<sub>rel </sub>is the relative velocity of the abrasive and the surface at that point. The term dh/dt is the rate at which material is removed. From Equation 2, along with the assumption that the abrasive and any cutting fluid is predetermined and held constant for the duration of a defect repair (i.e., k<sub>p </sub>fixed), the domain-specific inputs of instantaneous cut are applied force (and resulting pressure) and tool velocity (rotational, orbital, etc.). Total cut is determined via the integral of instantaneous cut over time distributed accordingly as a function of any macro motion of the end effector by the robot.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">In this respect, material removal over a surface can be expressed as an integral of the pressure distribution over the abrasive media (created by interaction with the substrate) scaled by the relative velocities between the abrasive and substrate and Preston's constant. Here we note that the pressure distribution is very much dependent on both the applied force but also the relative posturing of the abrasive/backup pad and the substrate (i.e., it is geometric in nature).

Equation <b>3</b><i>b </i>provides the material removed at a point on the substrate x after executing a repair strategy containing a robot motion path (X(t)).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0053">The pressure and relative velocity distribution terms are both functions of the orientation of the tool (X<sub>o</sub>(t)), as well as functions of time (force can be controlled in time which changes the pressure distribution, velocity can also change in time with orbital and/or rotary tool speed). The output of these distributions are the pressure and velocity at said point of interest (x) at time t. The constant term k<sub>p </sub>is adjusted between repairs as the disc life erodes. In our modeling below, we assume this is constant over the life of a single repair. Integrating these terms through time gives the total cut at that point. Thus, the remaining steps are to find and generate appropriate pressure distributions p(x, t) and macro motions of the end effector tooling x(t) depending on the desired outcome. With the aforementioned aim of generating a repair the both sufficiently removes the defect while simultaneously leaving as little visual impact as possible. Creating an irregular boundary between repaired and unrepaired surfaces makes the repair less visible to human inspection.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates variables of interest in a robotic paint repair system. Variables in system <b>500</b> can be manipulated in order to achieve irregularity in a robotic repair. Variables can be broken down generally into controllable variables <b>550</b> and dynamic constraints <b>560</b>. Controllable variables <b>550</b> include variables that can be set by a robot controller. Dynamic constraints either result from the controllable variables or are limits set on the robot itself, such as maximum acceleration, velocity or applied force.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0055">Trajectory variables <b>510</b> include controllable values of position <b>502</b> and orientation <b>504</b>. A position <b>502</b> of a backup pad can be defined in coordinate space (x, y, z). An orientation <b>504</b> of a backup pad can be defined by a roll, pitch and yaw (r, p, y). For example, the backup pad may be positioned flush with a work surface or may be tilted by some angle with respect to the workpiece. Trajectory variables can be programmed to adjust during a repair. For example, a backup pad may be moved from a first position (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>) at a first time to a second position (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>) at a second time. Similarly, the orientation (r, p, y) may change from the first point in time to the second point in time. This results in a dynamic pose, U(t), that changes over time. Pose is defined as the relative position and relative orientation of the backup pad to the surface of the team that is abrasive is doing the work against. A pose can position the backup pad in perfect surface alignment with the work surface or a pose can be offset to allow different types of contact with part of the abrasive.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0056">Tool variables <b>530</b> are also changeable during a repair. For example, an effective force <b>506</b> applied to a backup pad may be changed over time. Additionally, rotational velocity <b>508</b> of the backup pad may also change. For example, in the case of a random orbital tool setup performing a circular repair, it may have a first rotational velocity and/or force when moving between 0&#xb0; and 90&#xb0; of the circular repair motion, and a second velocity and/or force in the 90&#xb0; to 360&#xb0; range of the circular repair motion. In another example, it may have a first velocity for the first two seconds of motion and a second velocity in the last six seconds of motion.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0057">The robot motion combined with the rotational/orbital motion of the tool produce the relative velocity <b>566</b> between the abrasive media and the substrate over time. However, we note that in practice, the velocity of the robot (macro motion of the tool) is on a scale that is generally at least an order of magnitude slower than rotational velocity <b>508</b> and is, therefore, generally negligible when computing instantaneous cut in the presence of a powered tool. If necessary, however, the dynamic pose U(t) can be accounted for. Combining controlled force <b>506</b> and trajectory variables <b>510</b> also results in a dynamic pressure <b>564</b> over time due to the abrasive/backup pad interaction.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0058">Tool variables, in reality, cannot change instantaneously and are bounded by dynamic constraints. Therefore, any trajectory variables <b>510</b> and tool variables <b>530</b> must take into account dynamic constraints of the tool and the robot.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0059">While trajectory variables <b>510</b> and tool variables <b>530</b> can be adjusted during a repair, geometry variables <b>520</b> are generally only exchanged in between repairs. For example, a backup pad <b>522</b> has a given diameter that remains constant during a repair. Similarly, the orbit <b>524</b> of a tool connected to backup pad <b>522</b> is also set before a repair and is generally only changed in between repairs. The substrate surface <b>526</b> is also limited in that it is a function of the defect's location on the vehicle's body. Geometry variables <b>520</b> also contribute to experienced pressure <b>564</b> over time.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0060">Together, trajectory variables <b>510</b>, geometry variables <b>520</b> and tool variables <b>530</b> all result in a set of repair characteristics <b>570</b> for a given repair. In some embodiments, it is desired that at least one repair characteristic <b>570</b> contribute in some form to the concealment of the repair. In some embodiments, multiple characteristics <b>570</b> contribute in some for to the concealment of the repair.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0061">A repair boundary <b>572</b> refers generally to the perimeter of a repair. Many current robotic repairs are circular, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. In other words, they have a constant radius extending out from the center of the repair. In contrast, a non-circular boundary <b>572</b> refers to a boundary that has some non-constant radius. Non-circular boundaries are one form of concealment as they are generally less noticeable in many scenarios. Some examples include rotationally symmetric (periodic) shapes such as ellipsoids, stars, etc.; a-periodic and/or stochastic shapes with no symmetry (rotational, radial, bilateral, or otherwise); and arbitrary (open) curves in general.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">In particular we leverage rotational symmetry. Rotational symmetry of order n (i.e., n-fold rotational symmetry with respect to an origin or axis means that rotation by an angle of 360&#xb0;/n (30&#xb0;, 60&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 120&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, etc.) does not change the repair pattern. A &#x201c;1-fold&#x201d; symmetry is not considered symmetric by this definition as a rotation of 360&#xb0; effectively does not rotate the shape. Some examples include ellipses and lemniscates (2-fold), squares (4-fold), some petaled curves, etc. A circle is effectively infinity-fold (i.e., any rotation results in the same shape).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0063">A repair volume <b>574</b> refers to the volume of work surface (i.e., substrate material) removed. In general, this can be specified as a total volume or more usefully the volumetric distribution of removed material (i.e., cut depth as a function of substrate position). The above examples of concealment features extend naturally from the repair boundary case above to the repair volume distribution such as symmetry, etc. Additionally, we consider the profile of cut over some region of interest. For example, the cut depth as a function of distance from the center of repair or defect location. Here forms of concealment can be expressed as mathematical function properties such as monotonicity, convexity, etc.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064">One example of a volumetric concealment strategy is feathering <b>576</b> which involves gradually decreasing the cut depth with distance from the defect.
