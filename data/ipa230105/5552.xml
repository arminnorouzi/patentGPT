A memory sub-system can be a storage device, a memory module, or a hybrid of a storage device and memory module. Examples of storage devices and memory modules are described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In general, a host system can utilize a memory sub-system that includes one or more components, such as memory devices that store data. The host system can provide data to be stored at the memory sub-system and can request data to be retrieved from the memory sub-system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A memory sub-system can include high density non-volatile memory devices where retention of data is desired when no power is supplied to the memory device. One example of non-volatile memory devices is a negative-and (NAND) memory device. Other examples of non-volatile memory devices are described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A non-volatile memory device is a package of one or more dies. Each die can consist of one or more planes. For some types of non-volatile memory devices (e.g., NAND devices), each plane consists of a set of physical blocks and sub-blocks. Each sub-block consists of a set of pages. Each page consists of a set of memory cells (&#x201c;cells&#x201d;). A cell is an electronic circuit that stores information. Depending on the cell type, a cell can store one or more bits of binary information, and has various logic states that correlate to the number of bits being stored. The logic states can be represented by binary values, such as &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d;, or combinations of such values.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A memory device can be made up of bits arranged in a two-dimensional or a three-dimensional grid. Memory cells are etched onto a silicon wafer in an array of columns (also hereinafter referred to as bitlines) and rows (also hereinafter referred to as wordlines). A wordline can refer to one or more rows of memory cells of a memory device that are used with one or more bitlines to generate the address of each of the memory cells. The intersection of a bitline and wordline constitutes the address of the memory cell. A sub-block hereinafter refers to a unit of the memory device used to store data and can include a group of memory cells, a wordline group, a wordline, or individual memory cells.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A set of one or memory cells of the memory array can be programmed in accordance with a request from a host system. A programming operation can be performed to store information in the one or more of the memory device. During the programming operation, a series of programming pulses are applied to one or more wordlines associated with the memory cells to increase a voltage of the memory cells to a corresponding programming level. A first pulse corresponding to a first programming level is applied to all cells being programmed (e.g., all cells of a wordline). Subsequently, a program verify operation is performed to verify that the memory cells intended to be programmed to the first programming level reached the corresponding target voltage level. Those cells that pass the program verify operation are inhibited while a second pulse corresponding to a second programming level is applied to the remaining cells. Another program verify operation is performed, and this sequence continues with additional pulses and program verify operation until the programming is complete.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">During a programming operation of a set of target memory cells (e.g., single-level cells (SLC)), a dynamic start voltage (DSV) process can be initiated to perform a sampling operation on a first page or sub-block corresponding to each wordline to be programmed to identify a dynamic starting voltage (e.g., an initial voltage level) of an initial programming pulse (Vpgm <b>0</b>) applied to program the remaining pages or sub-blocks of each wordline. The DSV process (e.g., a Continuous-Predictive DSV process or other suitable process for dynamically adjusting a start voltage in connection with a stepped programming pulse process) includes a sampling operation including the application of a set of programming pulses and associated program verify operations to the sampled portion of memory cells. Based on the results of the sampling operation, offset information (e.g., a voltage offset level, also referred to as a &#x201c;DSV offset&#x201d;) is determined and used to dynamically adjust a start voltage of an initial programming pulse of a series of programming pulses applied to the one or more wordlines associated with memory cells to be programmed. In this approach, a programming pulse and DSV sampling including a program verify operation is performed with respect to the sampled portion.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Following the identification of the starting voltage for an initial programming pulse, a series of programming pulses are applied and corresponding program verify operations are performed for all of the remaining pages or sub-blocks of each respective wordline. Accordingly, for a given wordline having four sub-blocks (e.g., sub-block 0, sub-block 1, sub-block 2, and sub-block 3), the DSV sampling operation including corresponding program verify operations is applied to each sub-block for the given wordline, followed by the application of a programming pulse associated with an identified DSV level and corresponding program verify operations to all of the memory cells in the remaining sub-blocks (e.g., sub-block 1, sub-block 2, and sub-block 3). The execution of the respective program verify operations for each of the multiple programming pulses for each of the remaining portion of the wordline following the execution of the DSV sampling operation results in an extended time to program (Tprog) associated with the memory device. In addition, consumption of memory sub-system overhead associated with storing a DSV offset for each wordline is increased. Furthermore, this approach and the use of a program verify operations associated with each programming pulses for each wordline results in the over-programming of the memory cells which results in a reduction in the endurance levels due to stresses in the dielectric (e.g., oxide) layers of the memory cells.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Aspects of the present disclosure address the above and other deficiencies by implementing a programming operation including an intervallic dynamic start voltage (DSV) operation and corresponding program verify (PV) operations applied to a portion of a set of target memory cells to be programmed. In an embodiment, the intervallic DSV operation and corresponding set of PV operations are performed on a sampled or first portion (e.g., a first page of a sub-block) of a set of wordlines (e.g., a set of N wordlines). The intervallic DSV operation identifies a starting value for the programming voltage level (Vpgm <b>0</b>) of programming pulses to apply to a remaining portion (e.g., the sub-blocks or pages) of the wordline group (e.g., group of N wordlines). In an embodiment, the programming pulses at the identified Vpgm are applied without a corresponding program verify operation. In this regard, the program verify operation is skipped during the programming of the remaining pages of the wordline group.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment, the DSV is resampled on a first portion of a next wordline group (e.g., due to wordline variation) to recalculate the Vpgm to confirm above program verify levels for the next wordline group. Accordingly, the DSV operation and corresponding PV operations are sampled in an intervallic manner, such that the sampling or resampling of a portion of a group of wordlines is performed on only a first portion of each wordline group. In an embodiment, each group of N wordlines represents a corresponding interval (e.g., portion), wherein the DSV sampling or resampling is performed for a first portion of each group of wordlines.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Advantageously, program verify operations are performed in connection with the sampling of the initial or first portion of a wordline group, and program verify operations can be skipped during the programming of the remaining portion of the wordline group. The skipping of program verify operations results in a reduced time to program without a reduction in the read window budget (i.e., valley margins) corresponding to the programming levels of the memory cells. Advantages of this approach include, but are not limited to, improved performance in the memory sub-system. As fewer program verify operations are performed, the latency associated with program verify start and recovery times is minimized. In addition, the programming operation including the intervallic DSV operation enables the use of a same DSV offset for the entire wordline group which results in a reduction in the system overhead.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example computing system <b>100</b> that includes a memory sub-system <b>110</b> in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

Advantageously, the skipping of the program verify operations for the remaining memory cells associated with the wordline group results in an reduction in time-to-program and an improvement in endurance of the memory cells. In an embodiment, no program verify operations are performed during a first time period during which the remaining portion of the memory cells associated with the first wordline group are programmed.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">At operation <b>340</b>, a second group of wordlines is identified. For example, the processing logic identifies the second group of wordlines associated with a second subset of memory cells of the set of memory cells to be programmed. In one embodiment, the processing logic can identify a second group of N wordlines associated with the second subset of memory cells of the set of memory cells to be programmed (e.g., a second subset of the memory cells of memory array <b>250</b>, such as those memory cells associated with a certain wordline or multiple wordlines of memory array <b>250</b>). The second group of wordlines can be similar or identical to the exemplary second group of wordlines (WL group 2) of memory block <b>400</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and described in greater detail below. In an embodiment, the second subset of memory cells can include the memory cells associated with the first second group of wordlines (e.g., WL group 2 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In an embodiment, the second group of wordlines includes a set of N wordlines (e.g., WL<sub>N </sub>through WL<sub>2N-1</sub>), wherein N is a predetermined or default non-zero integer (e.g., N=1, N=2 . . .

For example, the processing logic can execute a second DSV operation including a third set of programming pulses and a second set of program verify operations on a first portion of the second subset of memory cells to identify a second dynamic start voltage level, the executing of the second DSV operation including causing the second set of programming pulses to be applied to at least a portion of the second group of wordlines. In an embodiment, the processing logic executes the second DSV operation to determine the programming pulse magnitudes for subsequent programming events. In an embodiment, the determined programming pulse magnitude is, for example, a second DSV level to be used for the subsequent programming events. In an embodiment, the first DSV sampling operation is executed using a first portion of the second group of wordlines to determine the first DSV level. For example, a third set of programming pulses and a second set of PV operations are applied using the first portion of the second group of wordlines to determine the second DSV level.

In an embodiment, a first DSV operation is performed for a portion of WL group 1, a second DSV operation is performed for a portion of WL group 2, a third DSV sampling operation is performed for a portion of WL group 3, and so on until a DSV level (Vpgm_0) has been identified for each respective wordline group. Advantageously, the DSV operation and corresponding program verify operation are performed with respect to only the sampled portion of memory cells associated with each wordline group, enabling the avoidance of the execution of further program verify operations in connection with the programming of the remaining portions of the memory cells associated with each of the wordline groups.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrate data structures (e.g., tables) showing the operations performed with respect to programming the set of memory cells associated with the respective wordlines of each wordline group having N wordlines.

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, N=10 (e.g., the wordline group includes 10 wordlines). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, for a first portion of a first subset of memory cells (e.g., memory cells in a first page or sub-block 0 of WL<sub>i</sub>), the processing logic causes one or more programming pulses (PP) to be applied as part of a DSV operation (DSV/PV) to identify the DSV level (Vpgm_0) for use in programming the remaining portion of the wordlines in each wordline group. For example, for WL<sub>i </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the DSV sampling operation executed with respect to sub-block 0 determines a Vpgm_0 (a first DSV voltage level or DSV1) that is used for the programming pulses (PP) for sub-block 1, sub-block 2, and sub-block 3 (e.g., the remaining portion) of the wordline group 1 (i.e., PP<sub>DSV1</sub>).

In an embodiment, the sampling or re-sampling operations are performed for each first portion of memory cells associated with each respective wordline group to identify the DSV level to be used for the programming pulses applied to the remaining portion of memory cells associated with each respective wordline group, without the execution of corresponding program verify operations.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates another example of a wordline group having 10 wordlines (e.g., N=10).

In this example, the DSV operation identifies a starting voltage (e.g., DSV1) to be used for the programming pulses (PP) for programming the remainder of memory cells associated with WL group 1 (e.g., the memory cells of sub-block 1 to sub-block 3 of WL<sub>i </sub>and all sub-blocks of WL<sub>i+1 </sub>through WL<sub>i+N-1</sub>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, a second DSV operation is performed for a first portion of the second group of wordlines (e.g., a second group of 10 wordlines starting with WL<sub>N</sub>). In an embodiment, the programming of the wordlines in each of the respective wordline groups continues until the programming operation is completed. In an embodiment, the DSV operation and corresponding program verify operations are executed on a first portion of the subset of memory cells associated with each wordline group, such that execution of program verify operations can be skipped or eliminated when programming to the remaining portion of the subset of memory cells associated with each wordline group.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example machine of a computer system <b>700</b> within which a set of instructions, for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein, can be executed.
