In battery, it is usually necessary to bend the adapter. In order to facilitate the bending, the adapter cannot be made too thick. It is usually a soft sheet structure. Due to the low overall hardness of the adapter, when bending, the adapter bends easily in non-predetermined areas, resulting in the offset of the crease, and the adapter that is not bent as predetermined will easily prevent the electrode assembly from being installed into the shell of the battery. If it is forcibly installed into the shell of the battery, it will cause the adapter to be overstressed locally, which will reduce the life of the adapter, and thereby affect the service life of the battery.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a battery cell, a battery and an electricity consuming device, which can bend the adapter between the electrode terminal and the tab along a predetermined position.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first aspect, the present disclosure provides a battery cell including a tab; an electrode terminal; and an adapter for electrical connection between the electrode terminal and the tab; the adapter includes a first connecting portion for electrical connection with the electrode terminal; a second connecting portion for electrical connection with the tab; a third connecting portion for connecting the first connecting portion and the second connecting portion; a bending portion, the third connecting portion is connected with the second connecting portion by the bending portion and the third connecting portion is connected with the second connecting portion by the bending portion; wherein, the third connecting portion includes a reinforcing portion, and the reinforcing portion is located at the side of the third connecting portion connected with the bending portion; The minimum distance L between an edge of the reinforcing portion and a center line of the bending portion satisfies: R&#x3c;L&#x3c;(R+2 mm), where L is the minimum distance between the edge of the reinforcing portion and the center line of the bending portion, and R is a bend radius of the bending portion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the reinforcing portion extends from a bending portion of the third connecting portion close to the first connecting portion to a bending portion of the third connecting portion close to the second connecting portion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the number of reinforcing portions is at least two, which are respectively located on a side of the third connecting portion close to the first connecting portion and a side of the third connecting portion close to the second connecting portion.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the reinforcing portion includes a protruding structure, disposed on at least one side surface of the third connecting portion along a thickness direction of the third connecting portion.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the protruding structure includes a plurality of protruding portions, and the protruding portions are arranged in a direction parallel to the centerline of the third connecting portion.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the thickness of the protruding structure is less than or equal to the bending radius of the bending portion.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the reinforcing portion includes an insulating layer covering at least a part of at least one side surface of the third connecting portion in a thickness direction of the third connecting portion.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the insulating layer covers two side surfaces of the third connecting portion along the thickness direction.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the thickness of the insulating layer is less than or equal to the bending radius of the bending portion.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a second aspect, the present disclosure proposes a battery including: the battery cell of the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a third aspect, the present disclosure proposes an electricity consuming device including the battery cell of the first aspect, and the battery cell is configured to provide electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the present disclosure, a reinforcing portion is provided on the connecting piece of the battery cell, and the position of the bending axis of the bending portion is limited by the reinforcing portion.

When the bending portion <b>244</b> is not bent, the bending portion <b>244</b> and the third connecting portion <b>243</b> are located on the same plane, and the center line of the bending portion <b>244</b> in this plane is the position of the crease after the bending portion is bent; After the bending portion <b>244</b> is bent, the bending portion <b>244</b> forms a bending axis, and the whole bending portion <b>244</b> is rotated and bent around the bending axis to form a curved surface.

Since the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> bends more difficultly than the bending portion <b>244</b>, when the bending portion <b>244</b> is bent, the edge of the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> can be bent so that the crease of the bending portion <b>244</b> is coincided with the preset crease so as to attain that the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> can position the bending portion <b>244</b>.

The thickness of the insulating layer in the embodiment of the present disclosure is less than or equal to the bending radius of the bending portion <b>244</b>, so that after the bending portion <b>244</b> is bent, the first connecting portion <b>241</b>, the third connecting portion <b>243</b> and the second connecting portion <b>242</b> form a three-layer layered structure, the first connecting portion <b>241</b> or the second connecting portion <b>242</b> is prevented from being upwarped, so that the battery cell <b>20</b> has a smaller axial dimension.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">It should be noted that, in the two electrodes of a battery cell <b>20</b>, each electrode is provided with a corresponding tab <b>21</b>, a corresponding adapter <b>24</b> and a corresponding electrode terminal <b>23</b>, and the adapter <b>24</b> of each electrode can use any of the above-mentioned embodiments to realize the limitation of the position of the bending axis of the bending portion <b>244</b>. For example, the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> of the adapter <b>24</b> of the positive electrode and the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> of the adapter <b>24</b> of the negative electrode are all convex structure forms; the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> of the adapter <b>24</b> of the positive electrode is in the form of a convex structure, the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> of the adapter <b>24</b> of the negative electrode is in the form of an insulating layer; the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> of the adapter <b>24</b> of the positive electrode is in the form of an insulating layer, the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> of the adapter <b>24</b> of the negative electrode is in the form of a convex structure; the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> of the adapter <b>24</b> of the positive electrode and the reinforcing portion <b>245</b> of the adapter <b>24</b> of the negative electrode are both in the form of insulating layers.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In view of the above, the battery cell <b>20</b>, the battery and the electricity consuming devices provided by the above-mentioned embodiments of the present disclosure are provided with a reinforcing portion <b>245</b> on the third connecting portion <b>243</b> to limit the position of the bending axis of the bending portion <b>244</b>, so that the bending axis can be bent at a predetermined position, the bending crease of the bending portion <b>244</b> is prevented from being offset, so that the electrode terminal <b>23</b> can be smoothly installed in the shell <b>22</b> of the battery cell <b>20</b>, reducing the possibility of damage to the adapter <b>24</b> due to the offset of the crease and increasing the service life of the adapter <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The present disclosure may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit and essential characteristics. For example, the algorithms described in particular embodiments may be modified without departing from the basic spirit of the present disclosure.
