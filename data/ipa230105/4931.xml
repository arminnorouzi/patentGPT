If a shipment component becomes separated from the aggregate group of components of the shipment during transit, there is no way to automatically and accurately identify when and where the shipment component separation occurred. With current technologies, shippers can only identify separated shipment components when the components of the shipment are scanned at a waypoint and verified against the waybill. Shippers who rely on waypoint checks for their shipment status are incapable of identifying precisely where a shipment component has disappeared. With current approaches, it is only possible to determine that a shipment component disappeared between two discrete waypoints of the shippers supply chain. Therefore, with current consolidated shipment tracking systems, the highest precision by which a location can be determined where a shipment component was lost is between two discrete waypoints of the shippers supply chain. And, with increasing globalization, the two discrete waypoints of the shippers supply chain between which the shipment component is lost can be substantially far apart, such as in two different countries. Therefore, with current consolidated shipment tracking systems, it can be difficult to locate lost components of consolidated shipments. It is within this context that the present invention arises.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an example embodiment, a system for monitoring a consolidated shipment is disclosed.

It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Systems and associated methods and wireless communication protocols are disclosed herein for wirelessly linking multiple shipment components to each other, where the multiple shipment components collectively form a consolidated shipment. The term &#x201c;shipment component&#x201d; as used herein refers to any parcel and/or any item of any type that is included as a physically separate part of a consolidated shipment. The wireless linking of the multiple shipment components to each other provides for monitoring of the proximity of individual ones of the multiple shipment components to each other during shipping of the consolidated shipment. In various embodiments, wireless devices are respectively attached to the multiple shipment components of the consolidated shipment prior to, or as part of, packaging and consolidation of the consolidated shipment. The wireless devices are configured to implement and utilize a secure communication protocol to create a Proximity Monitoring Mobile Network (PMMN) that is uniquely assigned to the consolidated shipment and to a waybill associated with the consolidated shipment. During creation of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment, i.e., during a shipment commissioning process, a unique identifier is assigned to the PMMN. In some embodiments, the wireless technology utilized by the wireless devices within the PMMN is selected to be globally ubiquitous, license free, and operate with batteries, packaging, and processor control suitable for operation on commercial passenger aircraft.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The systems and associated methods and wireless communication protocols disclosed herein monitor and maintain the status of the consolidated shipment by using wireless signals to verify that shipment components are in proximity to each other throughout shipping of the consolidated shipment. Data transferred between shipment components while making proximity measurements from one shipment component to another shipment component can also be used for other monitoring purposes. For example, data transferred between shipment components can include one or more of environmental conditions associated with a given shipment component, wireless device battery state associated with a given shipment component, in-transit shock measurements associated with a given shipment component, and vibration measurements associated with a given shipment component, among essentially any other measurable/observable condition/parameter associated with a given shipment component. At least one of the wireless devices within the PMMN of the consolidated shipment includes a global positioning system (GPS) device to enable global position tracking of the consolidated shipment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">If a shipment component of the consolidated shipment becomes separated from the other shipment components of the consolidated shipment during shipping, the systems and associated methods and wireless communication protocols disclosed herein are capable of identifying which shipment component has been separated, i.e., has gone missing, and at what time and at what location the separation of the shipment component occurred. Also, the systems and associated methods and wireless communication protocols disclosed herein are configured to transmit notifications of shipment faults, e.g., lost/missing shipment components, to users in near real-time. For example, if a shipment component is separated from the other shipment components of the consolidated shipment during shipping, the time and location of the shipment component separation is recorded and reported in near real-time utilizing Internet communication protocols. In some embodiments, the PMMN status is reported to a central server via wireless networks and/or cellular communication. Separation of a given shipment component from the consolidated shipment can be detected by an absence of the wireless device associated with the given shipment component within the PMMN. An alert can be transmitted by at least one wireless device remaining in the PMMN upon determining that the given shipment component has been separated from the consolidated shipment. This near real-time notification of shipment fault(s) provides user's, e.g., companies, with advance notice so that corrective action can be taken in a timely manner to resolve the shipment fault(s). It should be appreciated that the systems and associated methods and wireless communication protocols disclosed herein assist users with maintaining the security of their consolidated shipment, and with maintaining a reliable supply chain, and with keeping manufacturing processes on schedule.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example consolidated shipment <b>101</b> that includes multiple shipment components <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>(<i>n</i>), where (n) can be any number, in accordance with some embodiments. It should be understood that the systems and associated methods and wireless communication protocols disclosed herein can be used with consolidated shipments that include any number of shipment components. Each shipment component <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>(<i>n</i>) has a respective wireless device <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) that is either attached to the shipment component <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>(<i>n</i>) (such as within a packing slip/pouch) or placed inside the shipment component <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>(<i>n</i>), such that the wireless device <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) goes wherever the associated shipment component <b>103</b>A-<b>103</b>(<i>n</i>) goes. Each wireless device <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) includes a wireless transceiver to provide for wireless communication between the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) associated with different shipment components. In some embodiments, the wireless transceivers of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) are Local Area Network (LAN) radios. The wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) collectively form a PMMN for the consolidated shipment <b>101</b>. The transceivers within the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) provide the primary communication between wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) within the PMMN. In some embodiments, the transceiver within one or more of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) is configured to communicate with an Internet gateway <b>111</b> and/or with other devices that may be used to configure device operation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">At least one of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) in the PMMN of the consolidated shipment <b>101</b> is a battery powered Full-Function-Device (FFD) wireless device that includes GPS tracking technology configured to autonomously determine the global position, i.e., terrestrial location, of the FFD wireless device on a periodic basis. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the wireless device <b>105</b>A is a FFD wireless device. In the event of separation of a given shipment component from the consolidated shipment, the FFD wireless device records the global position when the given shipment component was detected missing. Also, the FFD wireless device is configured to include a Wide Area Network (WAN) communication capability, such as cellular and/or satellite communication capability. The WAN interface of the FFD wireless device provides Internet access for the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) in the PMMN of the consolidated shipment <b>101</b>. In this manner, the wireless device <b>105</b>A (at least one of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) in the PMMN of the consolidated shipment <b>101</b>) is a FFD wireless device that provides location tracking, i.e., global position tracking, and network connectivity for all of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) in the PMMN of the consolidated shipment <b>101</b>. The FFD wireless device architecture includes a GPS device for global position determination and a cellular modem and/or a satellite communication device for WAN (Internet) connectivity. The FFD wireless device architecture also includes the transceiver device for radio communication with the other wireless devices <b>105</b>B-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) in the PMMN of the consolidated shipment <b>101</b> and with the Internet gateway <b>111</b> and with other devices that may be used to configure device operation. In some embodiments, the transceiver device includes an IEEE Standard 802.15.4 radio for managing the PMMN and for communicating with the local Internet gateway <b>111</b> when available, i.e., when in range. In some embodiments, the FFD wireless device has a form factor substantially similar to that of a credit card.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other wireless devices <b>105</b>B-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) in the PMMN of the example consolidated shipment <b>101</b> can be either a FFD wireless device or a Reduced-Function-Device (RFD) wireless device. The RFD wireless device operates as a shipment component proximity monitoring device. The RFD wireless device is a battery powered device that includes a transceiver device, i.e., a bi-directional LAN radio, for communication with transceiver devices of the other wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) within the PMMN. In some embodiments, the transceiver device of the RFD wireless device is an IEEE Standard 802.15.4 radio. The RFD wireless device does not have GPS capability and does not have WAN connection capability. The RFD wireless devices function to report their proximity to the FFD wireless device <b>105</b>A, that is the managing FFD(0) wireless device of the PMMN, on a periodic basis and/or requested basis. In some embodiments, RFD wireless devices communicate with the managing FFD(0) wireless device of the PMMN during configuration of the PMMN and while shipping of the consolidated shipment <b>101</b> is underway. In some embodiments, RFD wireless device can also communicate with other RFD wireless device of the PMMN, such as in a peer-to-peer manner. Each wireless device <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) has a unique identifier that is used by the PMMN. Each wireless device <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) provides for reading/acquiring of its unique identifier when the wireless device <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) is physically associated with (i.e., attached to or put inside of) a shipment component. In various embodiments, different techniques can be used to read/acquire the unique identifier of a given wireless device <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>). For example, in some embodiments, the unique identifier of a given wireless device <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) can be read/acquired using a barcode scanner, a passive radiofrequency identification (RFID), and/or some other optical device to record the unique identifier when the given wireless device <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) is installed on a shipment component. In some embodiments, the RFD wireless device has a form factor substantially similar to that of a key fob.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A server computing system <b>107</b> is configured to communicate with the managing FFD(0) wireless device, i.e., with the wireless device <b>105</b>A, through the Internet at any location of the managing FFD(0) wireless device in the world. The server computing system <b>107</b> is configured to maintain a database of archived shipment data. The server computing system <b>107</b> is also configured to provide historical map and location information for shipments, and real-time map and location information for shipments. The server computing system <b>107</b> is also configured to provide web services for displaying historical and real-time global positions (terrestrial locations) of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>). The server computing system <b>107</b> is also configured to perform operations to enable command and control of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>). For example, the server computing system <b>107</b> is configured to generate a guaranteed unique broadcast address for the PMMN to be used by all wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) of the PMMN, which enables creation of the PMMN. A unique broadcast address is generated for each consolidated shipment for use in creating the PMMN for the consolidated shipment. The unique broadcast address for the consolidated shipment is transmitted from the server computing system <b>107</b> to the managing FFD(0) wireless device of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment. The server computing system <b>107</b> is also configured to compute and send waypoints to the managing FFD(0) wireless device of the PMMN for purposes of tracking the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) and controlling behavior of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) and controlling reporting of data by the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>). The server computing system <b>107</b> is also configured to monitor the operational states of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>), including monitoring of battery charge levels, cellular usage, and network performance.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The server computing system <b>107</b> is also configured to determine when alert conditions exist with regard to a monitored/tracked consolidated shipment. For example, the server computing system <b>107</b> is configured to manage computations associated with overdue departures of the consolidated shipment, overdue arrivals of the consolidated shipment, separation of shipment components from the consolidated shipment, and failed deliveries of the consolidated shipment, such as delivery of the consolidated shipment to a wrong location. The server computing system <b>107</b> is also configured to provide a web services interface for users to interact with the consolidated shipment monitoring and tracking system, i.e., to control creation of the PMMN and to control wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) of the PMMN and to control acquisition and output of data associated with PMMN. The server computing system <b>107</b> is also configured to provide secured user access and electronically transmit reports to users.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, an Internet gateway <b>111</b> converts data received through an Internet communication protocol into a communication protocol for the PMMN so as to improve the commissioning process, i.e., the PMMN setup process, when configuring a consolidated shipment. It should be understood that the commissioning process includes acquisition and assignment/storage of the unique broadcast address generated for the PMMN, and registering of the unique identifiers of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) with the PMMN, among other operations required to configure the PMMN and make sure the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) of the PMMN are in communication with each other and are uniquely associated with the consolidated shipment. In some embodiments, the Internet gateway <b>111</b> is a local network gateway that uses a direct, high-speed commanding path between the server computing system <b>107</b> and the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) to enable efficient configuration of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) in order to establish the PMMN for the consolidated shipment. The Internet gateway <b>111</b> can be deployed at any location along a shipping route, but is particularly useful at origination locations where consolidated shipments are prepared for shipping, such as at factories, distribution centers, and the like, where consolidated shipments are configured on a regular basis.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Also, it should be understood that in some embodiments the commissioning process can be done without use of the Internet gateway <b>111</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the network <b>109</b> can be used to establish data communication between the server computing system <b>107</b> and the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) to enable acquisition and assignment/storage of the unique broadcast address for the PMMN and registering of the unique identifiers of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) with the PMMN, among other operations required to configure the PMMN and make sure the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) of the PMMN are in communication with each other and are uniquely associated with the consolidated shipment. The network <b>109</b> can be configured to include essentially any type of data communication network, such as a cellular communication network, a satellite communication network, an optical data communication network, among others, or any combination thereof. Also, in some embodiments, barcode scanner technology can be used as part of the commissioning process to establish the PMMN for a consolidated shipment. For example, a barcode scanner configured to be in data communication with the server computing system <b>107</b> can be used to scan barcodes on the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) in order to obtain and transmit the unique identifiers of the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) to the server computing system <b>107</b> for purposes of associating the wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) with the PMMN of the consolidated shipment. In some embodiments, a barcode scanner device can include a LAN radio, such as an IEEE Standard 802.15.4 radio, to enable communication with the server computing system <b>107</b> by way of the network <b>109</b> and/or the Internet gateway <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a flowchart of a method for operating wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) to establish a PMMN for a consolidated shipment, in accordance with some embodiments. The method includes an operation <b>201</b> in which a unique identifier of a managing FFD(0) wireless device, of the wireless <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>), is transmitted to the server computing system <b>107</b>. The operation <b>201</b> also includes transmission of a unique identifier of a shipment component to which the managing FFD(0) wireless device is attached to the server computing system for association with the unique identifier of the managing FFD(0) wireless device. For example, in some embodiments, the unique identifier of the managing FFD(0) wireless device can be acquired from a label on an exterior of the managing FFD(0) wireless device using a scanning device (such as a barcode scanning device, or QR code scanning device, or passive RFID, among others) that communicates the unique identifier of the managing FFD(0) wireless device to the server computing system <b>107</b>. And, similarly, in some embodiments, the unique identifier of the shipment component to which the managing FFD(0) wireless device is attached can be acquired from a shipping label of the shipment component using a scanning device (such as a barcode scanning device, or QR code scanning device, or passive RFID, among others) that communicates the unique identifier of the shipment component to the server computing system <b>107</b>. It should be understood that in various embodiments, the unique identifier of the managing FFD(0) wireless device and the unique identifier of the shipment component to which the managing FFD(0) wireless device is attached can be acquired and transmitted to the server computing system <b>107</b> using means other than scanning devices. For example, in some embodiments, the unique identifier of the managing FFD(0) wireless device and the unique identifier of the shipment component to which the managing FFD(0) wireless device is attached can be entered, e.g., typed, into a computing device that is in data communication with the server computing system <b>107</b>. The server computing system <b>107</b> operates to associate the unique identifier of the managing FFD(0) wireless device with the unique identifier of the shipment component to which the managing FFD(0) wireless device is attached, and to store this association within a database.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">From the operation <b>201</b>, the method proceeds with an operation <b>203</b> in which a unique identifier of an additional RFD/FFD wireless device (RFD or FFD wireless device) is transmitted to the server computing system <b>107</b>. The operation <b>203</b> also includes transmission of a unique identifier of a shipment component to which the additional RFD/FFD wireless device is attached to the server computing system for association with the unique identifier of the additional RFD/FFD wireless device. The above-mentioned techniques for acquiring and transmitting the unique identifiers (of the managing FFD(0) wireless device and of the shipment component to which the managing FFD(0) is attached) to the server computing system <b>107</b> in operation <b>201</b> can also be used to acquire and transmit the unique identifier of the additional RFD/FFD wireless device and the unique identifier of the shipment component to which the additional RFD/FFD wireless device is attached to the server computing system <b>107</b> in the operation <b>203</b>.

The method then proceeds with an operation <b>209</b> in which the managing FFD(0) wireless device operates to send an acknowledgement request to each RFD/FFD wireless device in the PMMN for the consolidated shipment using the unique broadcast address for the PMMN as received from the server computing system <b>107</b>. The method then proceeds with an operation <b>213</b> in which a determination is made as to whether or not an acknowledgement response (ACK) has been received from each RFD/FFD wireless device in the PMMN for the consolidated shipment.

The instruction to proceed with commissioning of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment would be received by the server computing system <b>107</b> after the operations <b>305</b> and <b>307</b> have been performed for the final shipment component of the consolidated shipment. In some embodiments, the instruction to proceed with commissioning of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment can be transmitted to the server computer system <b>107</b> by having the user initiate transmission of a signal that the shipment component entries are complete, such as by scanning a special barcode, or by pressing a button on the scanner, or by selecting a control in graphical user interface, e.g., in a webpage, among other ways. If the operation <b>309</b> determines that the instruction to proceed with commissioning of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment has not been received, the method reverts back to the operation <b>305</b>. If the operation <b>309</b> determines that the instruction to proceed with commissioning of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment has been received, the method continues with an operation <b>311</b> in which the server computing system <b>107</b> generates a unique broadcast address for the PMMN and transmits the unique broadcast address for the PMMN to the managing FFD(0) wireless device of the PMMN. It should be understood that in some embodiments the unique broadcast address for the PMMN can be generated by the server computing system <b>107</b> at any time after receiving the unique identifier of the managing FFD(0) wireless device in operation <b>301</b>. The operation <b>311</b> also includes operation of the server computing system <b>107</b> to generate a listing of each unique identifier of RFD/FFD wireless devices within the PMMN for the consolidated shipment. Also, in the operation <b>311</b>, the server computing system <b>107</b> operates to transmit the listing of each unique identifier of RFD/FFD wireless devices within the PMMN for the consolidated shipment to the managing FFD(0) wireless device of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment. The managing FFD(0) wireless device transmits the unique broadcast address for the PMMN to each RFD/FFD wireless device within the PMMN, thereby notifying each RFD/FFD wireless device within the PMMN as to which unique broadcast address they belong and should respond.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">After the operation <b>311</b>, the server computing system <b>107</b> monitors for receipt of a communication from the managing FFD(0) wireless device of the PMMN indicating whether or not all RFD/FFD wireless devices of the PMMN have acknowledged data communication with the managing FFD(0) wireless device.

The method proceeds with an operation <b>403</b> in which a determination is made as to whether or not an acknowledgement response (ACK) has been received from each RFD/FFD wireless device in the PMMN for the consolidated shipment within a set time window following transmission of the acknowledgment request in operation <b>401</b>. The set time window used in operation <b>403</b> can be user-prescribed/programmed in the managing FFD(0) wireless device by a user via the server computing system <b>107</b> during establishment of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment. Also, in some embodiments, the set time window used in operation <b>403</b> can be re-programmed, i.e., adjusted, in the managing FFD(0) wireless device by a user via the server computing system <b>107</b> during shipping of the consolidated shipment. If it is determined that an acknowledgement response has been received from each RFD/FFD wireless device in the PPMN for the consolidated shipment within the set time window following transmission of the acknowledgment request in operation <b>401</b>, the method reverts back to operation <b>401</b>. If it is determined that an acknowledgement response has not been received from a given RFD/FFD wireless device in the PMMN within the set time window following transmission of the acknowledgment request in operation <b>401</b>, an acknowledgement response failure event has occurred and the method proceeds with an operation <b>405</b> to process the acknowledgement response failure event.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the operation <b>405</b>, the managing FFD(0) wireless device is operated to determine and record the unique identifier(s) of the RFD/FFD wireless device(s) in the PMMN of the consolidated shipment that did not provide an acknowledgment response within the set time window following transmission of the acknowledgment request in operation <b>401</b>. Also, in the operation <b>405</b>, the managing FFD(0) wireless device is operated to determine and record the time and location at which the acknowledgement response failure event occurred. Also, in the operation <b>405</b>, the managing FFD(0) wireless device is operated to transmit a data communication to the server computing system <b>107</b> notifying of the acknowledgement response failure event and providing information on which RFD/FFD wireless devices failed to provide an acknowledgment response within the set time window following transmission of the acknowledgment request in operation <b>401</b>. In some embodiments, prior to performing the operation <b>405</b>, the managing FFD(0) wireless device can be configured to retry transmission of the acknowledgement request to all RFD/FFD wireless devices within the PMMN for the consolidated shipment using the unique broadcast address of the PMMN a set number of times, with performance of operation <b>403</b> after each of the transmission retries. The set number of times to retry transmission of the acknowledgement request to all RFD/FFD wireless devices within the PMMN for the consolidated shipment before continuing on with the operation <b>405</b> can be user-prescribed/programmed in the managing FFD(0) wireless device by a user via the server computing system <b>107</b> during establishment of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment, and in some embodiments can be changed by a user via the server computing system <b>107</b> during shipping of the consolidated shipment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Also, it should be understood that the managing FFD(0) wireless device can be directed to request various types of parametric data (such and temperature, humidity, etc.) from the RFD/FFD wireless devices within the PMMN for the consolidated shipment at any time during shipping of the consolidated shipment, with the RFD/FFD wireless devices operating to respond to the managing FFD(0) wireless device to provide the requested parametric data. Additionally, in some embodiments, the RFD/FFD wireless devices within the PMMN for the consolidated shipment can be configured to continuously monitor for various conditions (such as impact forces, vibrational forces, temperature thresholds, humidity thresholds, etc.) and provide an unprompted data communication to the managing FFD(0) wireless device of the PMMN when such conditions occur. The managing FFD(0) wireless device of the PMMN of the consolidated shipment can in turn record the condition occurrence in association with the RFD/FFD wireless devices that experienced the condition along with the time and location when the condition occurred. And, in some embodiments, the managing FFD(0) wireless device of the PMMN of the consolidated shipment can communicate data to the server computing system <b>107</b> during shipping notifying of the occurrence of the condition and of the RFD/FFD wireless device that experienced the condition.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The PMMN data resident on the server computing system <b>107</b> has multiple purposes. For example, the PMMN data provides for association of the unique identifier of each of the RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN with unique identifier(s) of one or more shipment component(s) with the consolidated shipment. Also, the PMMN data enables the server computing system <b>107</b> to build an RFD/FFD wireless device list for the PMMN. And, this RFD/FFD wireless device list for the PMMN can be used to create the PMMN tracking network for the consolidated shipment. Also, when a given RFD/FFD wireless device fails to report during shipping, i.e., fails to provide an acknowledgement response to the managing FFD(0) wireless device, the PMMN data enables determination of which shipment component(s) correspond to the non-reporting RFD/FFD wireless device, thereby enabling a recording and notification of when and where the shipment component(s) were separated (missing/lost).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, only one wireless device <b>105</b>A may be used. In these embodiments, the one wireless device <b>105</b>A will be a FFD wireless device. As discussed above, if multiple wireless devices <b>105</b>A-<b>105</b>(<i>n</i>) are to be associated with multiple shipment components, additional RFD/FFD wireless devices can be used. The FFD wireless device has the benefit of being a fully independent wireless device, but can be more costly and have a larger size. As discussed above, in some embodiments, if the consolidated shipment includes many shipment components, a single managing FFD(0) wireless device can be used to track and manage the RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN for the consolidated shipment. In these embodiments, additional shipment components can be tracked using RFD wireless devices that are networked through PMMN with the managing FFD(0) wireless device.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">After departure of the consolidated shipment from a shipment origin, the managing FFD(0) wireless device uses the unique broadcast address of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment to simultaneously communicate with all RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN for the consolidated shipment. In some embodiments, a typical communication with the RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN is a periodic broadcast of a network beacon with the unique broadcast address of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment as the destination. All RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN for the consolidated shipment are required to respond with an acknowledgement response. To establish the PMMN for the consolidated shipment, a wireless protocol is defined to group all RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN for the consolidated shipment into an independent functioning mobile network. In some embodiments, the PMMN for the consolidated shipment uses peer-to-peer communication to establish proximity of RFD/FFD wireless devices to each other by electronic &#x201c;roll call.&#x201d; Peer-to-peer communication methods can consume significant power from participating RFD/FFD wireless devices, particularly if the PMMN includes a large number of RFD/FFD wireless devices. Minimizing power consumption by the RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN for the consolidated shipment is important to ensure that the RFD/FFD wireless devices remain operable through completion of the shipping process. To achieve power management goals, the PMMN for the consolidated shipment can be operated to reduce peer-to-peer communication between RFD/FFD wireless devices of the PMMN by over 99%. For example, by assigning a unique broadcast address to the PMMN and by using a managing FFD(0) wireless device, significant reduction in power consumption can be realized by the RFD/FFD wireless devices within the PMMN. The entire group of RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN can respond as one device by using the unique broadcast address of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment. When the consolidated shipment departs its origination location and tracking begins, the managing FFD(0) wireless device can periodically query all RFD/FFD wireless devices within the PMMN for the consolidated shipment with a single transmission using the unique broadcast address of the PMMN. Only the RFD/FFD wireless devices within range of the managing FFD(0) wireless device that have the same unique broadcast address of the PMMN will respond. All responding RFD/FFD wireless devices are considered to be in range and not separated (missing/lost).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The managing FFD(0) wireless device is configured to utilize an onboard schedule to maintain the PMMN status for the consolidated shipment. All RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN should respond on a periodic basis with minimal retries or peer-to-peer communication. RFD/FFD wireless devices that continuously fail to respond are interpreted as out of range and missing/lost from the PMMN. Missing RFD/FFD wireless devices are considered a network fault and are considered alarm conditions to be reported to the server computing system <b>107</b> through an available network connection (LAN or WAN). In some embodiments, if multiple FFD wireless devices are in a consolidated shipment, the first FFD wireless device that has its unique identifier communicated to server computing system <b>107</b> can be set as the managing FFD(0) wireless device. After departure of the consolidated shipment from its shipment origin, the managing FFD(0) wireless device can begin to periodically transmit a radio beacon using the unique broadcast address of the PMMN for the consolidated shipment. In some embodiments, each RFD/FFD wireless devices receiving the radio beacon that includes the unique broadcast address of the PMMN are required to acknowledge receipt of the radio beacon with a packet containing their address, battery status, and other state of health data. The managing FFD(0) wireless device can be configured to accumulate the acknowledgements received from the RFD/FFD wireless devices and compare them to the listing of RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN to determine which, if any, RFD/FFD wireless device(s) are not responding. In some embodiments, upon receipt of acknowledgement from all RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN, a timer is reset by the managing FFD(0) wireless device for notification of when the next radio beacon should be transmitted by the managing FFD(0) wireless device, and to indicate that all RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN have responded. It should be appreciated that the systems and methods disclosed herein optimize the proximity maintenance process by minimizing the number of transmissions required to determine which RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN are in-range. In some embodiments, the managing FFD(0) wireless device limits utilization of peer-to-peer communication to when particular RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN continuously fail to respond. For example, prior to initiating a tracking failure alert, the managing FFD(0) wireless device can automatically transition to a peer-to-peer command mode. The peer-to-peer command mode verifies that a particular RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN is out of range (missing/lost). If the periodic radio beacon broadcast and the peer-to-peer commands fail with a particular RFD/FFD wireless devices in the PMMN, the managing FFD(0) wireless device executes a lost device event protocol which can be defined by a user. Also, if a separated shipping component is no longer separated, i.e., rejoins the PMMN by responding to an acknowledgement request, the time and location at which the separated shipping component rejoined the PMMN is recorded and can be reported to the server computing system <b>107</b> by the managing FFD(0) wireless device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description.
