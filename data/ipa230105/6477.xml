No. 17/365,852 titled &#x201c;SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR POWER DISTRIBUTION FOR AMPLIFIER ARRAYS&#x201d; filed on Jul. 1, 2021. This incorporated reference is co-owned by the present application's applicant and has several common inventors. This incorporation is intended to provide additional enabling disclosure of some features described herein. However, there may be differences in the terms used for similar or identical elements between the present application and the incorporated reference. Where different terms may describe an identical or substantially identical component, feature, or operation, it is understood that a person of skill would find appropriate equivalence such that the incorporated reference can clearly provide disclosure of a corresponding component, feature, or operation described herein. In particular, the incorporated reference provides additional technical details on power distribution units and especially their proximity to a load (e.g., an antenna). In addition to providing technical features related to efficient power distribution and stability, such &#x201c;Point of Load&#x201d; (PoL) concepts facilitate the compactness of the disclosed systems discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a compact directed energy system mounted to an unmanned aerial vehicle. The compact directed energy system <b>110</b> can be configured to generate directed energy beam(s). As used herein, the term &#x201c;compact directed energy system&#x201d; refers to the overall system and any components that may or may not be directly related to the generation of RF energy. For example, &#x201c;compact directed energy system can comprise housings, mounting hardware, or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the compact directed energy system can be configured to be mounted to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) <b>10</b> and configured to generate directed energy beams during a flight of the unmanned aerial vehicle. The antenna(s) <b>120</b> and their RF generating system(s) <b>130</b> described herein can be contained in a housing <b>140</b> that can be mounted to the UAV. The compact sizes of the housings and power densities (in terms of delivered RF power versus housing volume) are described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In other embodiments, the compact directed energy system <b>110</b> can be sufficiently compact to be handheld by a user or be contained in a backpack. For example, certain implementations of the compact directed energy system can have a volume less than 16 ft.<sup>3 </sup>and/or have a weight less than 300 pounds. In other implementations, the compact directed energy system to move on less than 4 ft.<sup>3 </sup>and have a weight less than 100 pounds.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The compact directed energy system can comprise a radio frequency system configured to provide a directed energy beam. In some embodiments, the directed energy beam can be in a frequency range between 500 MHz to 20 Ghz. Conventional RF generation systems utilize amplifiers and circuit designs that are not suitable for generating the power required a system for compact applications such as UAV-mounted, handheld, etc. Complications include the high power level, managing thermal loading of the amplifier, providing the pulsed DC power to the amplifiers and shielding the EMI of an Electromagnetic Pulse Phased Array Emitter in a small package.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the term &#x201c;radio frequency system&#x201d; refers to any components utilized for the generation and delivery of RF energy. For example, the radiofrequency system can comprise batteries, signal conditioning electronics, amplifiers, sensors, antennas, etc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Also as used herein, the term &#x201c;directed energy beam&#x201d; refers to RF output (e.g., from the radio frequency system) in a frequency range between 500 MHz and 20 GHz. As such, in other embodiments can be in frequency range between 500 MHz and 5 GHz or between 500 MHz and 1 GHz. The term &#x201c;directed&#x201d; is not excluding of other embodiments and is instead intended to mean directed at a target or directed outward such that the generated RF energy may affect a potential target. For example, the compact directed energy system can be configured as a phased array system comprising a RF signal/waveform generator, high-power amplifiers configured to amplify the generated RF signal and one or more antennas to radiate the amplified RF signal as a directed energy beam. In various implementations, the RF signal/waveform generator can generate a plurality of phase shifted RF signals which are amplified and provided as an input to an antenna array. The output from the antenna array can be spatially combined to form a directed energy beam. In some implementations, the phase difference between the plurality of phase shifted RF signals can be configured such that the generated beam can have nulls (reduced/minimum energy) in certain spatial regions and peaks (increased/maximum energy) in other spatial regions. In some implementations, the phase difference between the plurality of phase shifted RF signals can be configured such that the generated beam doesn't have any nulls within the beam width. In some implementations, the compact directed energy system can be configured to generate multiple directed energy beams which may be in different directions.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, the compact directed energy system can generate a directed energy beam in the form of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) such that the generated RF can be delivered over a substantial portion of a sphere (i.e., 4&#x3c0; steradians) surrounding the antenna(s). The delivered RF energy (either as a beam or as an EMP) can be delivered in a single burst or in multiple bursts such as part of a pulse train.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a schematic view depicting a centered mounting of a radio frequency system. The mounting shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> can be used to realize the compact directed energy system <b>110</b> discussed above. Certain embodiments of the present disclosure can comprise radiofrequency systems having a center of gravity as close as possible to a geometric center of the compact directed energy system. Some embodiments can comprise the radio frequency system having amplifiers <b>210</b> connected to a backplane configured to support portions of the radiofrequency system. Such portions comprise, for example, amplifier <b>210</b>, antenna <b>212</b>, and/or driver amplifier board <b>214</b>. Though three of the above assemblies are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, is also indicated that there may be any number of such assemblies depending on the desired configuration. For example, there can be 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, etc. assemblies. The backplane can comprise one or more circuit boards or other such substrate (e.g., a printed circuit board (PCB)). In some embodiments, depending on the number of amplifiers/antennas utilized, the backplane can comprise a central backplane <b>220</b> and one or more backplane extensions configured to support additional portions of the radiofrequency system. The central backplane (and the components disposed thereon) can be configured to perform a variety of functions including, but not limited to, RF signal conditioning, distribution of the RF signals to the amplifiers, power distribution, and distribution of digital control to the amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the central backplane and the backplane extensions can be approximately centered along an axis extending through a center of gravity of the compact directed energy system. To facilitate maintaining the center of gravity in a desired location, backplane extensions can be symmetrically disposed about the central backplane. For example, certain embodiments can comprise a left extension <b>222</b> and/or right extension <b>224</b>. The table below provides exemplary system configurations where there are two rows of antennas and 3 to 6 columns of antennas (see also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, clearly depicting a 2&#xd7;3 configuration&#x2014;having 6 assemblies/antennas). The table below illustrates certain combinations of where antennas can be connected to a respective backplane or extension. Embodiments are depicted in bold and underline where either no extension is utilized, or the extensions are symmetric about the central backplane. Other configurations are also disclosed where the extensions result in a nearly centered configuration.
