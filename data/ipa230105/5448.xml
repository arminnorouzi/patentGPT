A higher refresh rate can improve image quality in applications in which the image changes, such as video applications or video game applications. A lower refresh rate can reduce power consumption.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Rows of pixels can be refreshed sequentially during a frame. When a computing device and/or display transitions from a first refresh rate to a second refresh rate, the time delay for refreshing rows can be different for different rows, as shown graphically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. The different time delays can cause different rows to have different average luminances, causing the display to appear to flicker. To maintain same average luminances, and/or reduce the appearing of flickering, the computing device can adjust the signals sent and/or provided to the rows of pixels. The adjustment can vary based on which row the signals are sent to.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The average luminance may be an average taken across the time period between the at least one pixel in the second row receiving the adjusted peak signal in the transitional frame and the at least one pixel in the second row receiving the peak signal in the next frame in the sequence. The next frame in the sequence may be the second frame. The average luminance may be an average across a transitional frame (described below) and the next frame in the sequence. The average luminance may be an average across the transitional frame and the frame after and/or following the transitional frame.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a diagram of a computing device <b>100</b> according to an example implementation.

In some examples, the display <b>102</b> can include a touchscreen display that receives touch input, such as a capacitive touchscreen display and/or a resistive touchscreen display.

The display <b>102</b> can include an array of pixels having rows and columns. The display <b>102</b> can include multiple horizontal signal lines <b>110</b>. Horizontal may refer to their position when the computing device <b>100</b> is in the orientation in which it is intended to be used. The horizontal signal lines <b>110</b> can provide signals to rows of pixels. The horizontal signals lines <b>110</b> and/or rows of pixels can be numbered sequentially from a top portion <b>106</b> of the display <b>102</b> to a bottom portion <b>108</b> of the display <b>102</b>. The top portion <b>106</b> of the display <b>102</b> refers to the top portion of the display <b>102</b> when the display <b>102</b> is in the orientation in which it is to be viewed by a user.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">During each frame, the horizontal signal lines can sequentially and/or successively provide signals to the rows of pixels, with the first and/or topmost row of pixels receiving signals at or near a beginning of the frame and the last and/or the lower-most and/or bottommost row of pixels receiving signals at or near an end of the frame.
