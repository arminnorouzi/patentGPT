end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A distance measurement device typically has a casing, inside of which an irradiation unit that radiates light and a detection unit that detects reflected light are stored. In a front portion of the casing, a transparent window through which the radiated light and the reflected light pass is provided.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, if snow, rainwater, or the like, is attached to the transparent window, there is a case where measurement accuracy of the distance measurement device may degrade.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, US 2014/0320845 A1 discloses providing at a transparent window, a heater that heats the transparent window to remove snow, rainwater, or the like, attached to the transparent window.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present inventors studied a configuration in which a flexible substrate on which a heater wire is formed is adhered to a transparent window as a configuration of a distance measurement device with a heater provided on the transparent window. In this case, there is a possible configuration in which a portion in which a wiring to the heater wire is formed (hereinafter, referred to as a wiring portion) on the flexible substrate is drawn out from a drawing hole provided in a rear portion of a casing to outside of the casing to electrically connect the heater wire to a power supply provided outside on a rear side of the casing. In a case of such a configuration, if an attempt is made to insert the wiring portion into the drawing hole in a state where a portion in which the heater wire is formed (hereinafter, referred to as a heater portion) on the flexible substrate is adhered to the transparent window, the wiring portion is pulled when the wiring portion is inserted into the drawing hole, and force is also applied to the heater portion, which may lead to a risk of partial peeling of the heater portion from the transparent window.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To avoid such a situation, there is a possible method in which a fixing member for fixing the wiring portion is provided to fix the wiring portion within the casing, for example, by adhering the wiring portion on an inner surface of the casing with an adhesive tape.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Meanwhile, stray light may be generated inside the casing as a result of radiation light or reflected light being reflected at an optical window, or the like. As a result of study, the present inventors have found that there is a problem of decrease in distance measurement accuracy due to stray light being reflected at a fixing member for fixing the wiring portion and detected at the detection unit.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In view of the foregoing, it is desired to have a distance measurement device for which degradation in distance measurement accuracy due to stray light is prevented.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">One aspect of the present disclosure is a distance measurement device that measures a distance to an object, the distance measurement device including a detection module, a casing, a transparent window, and a flexible substrate. The detection module includes an irradiation unit and a detection unit. The irradiation unit radiates radiation light for performing scanning along a scanning direction set in advance. The detection unit detects reflected light from an object, arriving from a scanning region. The casing stores the detection module. The transparent window, which is part of the casing, is disposed to face the detection module. The radiation light and the reflected light pass through the transparent window. A heater wire that heats the transparent window is formed on the flexible substrate. Further, the flexible substrate includes a heater portion and a wiring portion. The heater wire is formed in the heater portion. The heater portion is fixed to the transparent window. A wiring to the heater wire is formed in the wiring portion. The wiring portion extends to a rear side of the casing in a case where a side on which the transparent window is provided in the casing is set as a front side. The distance measurement device further includes a fixing member and a light shielding member. The fixing member fixes the wiring portion within the casing. The light shielding member is configured to shield stray light from the fixing member toward the detection unit.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to such a configuration, a distance measurement device for which degradation of distance measurement accuracy due to stray light is prevented is provided.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure will be described below with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">1.
