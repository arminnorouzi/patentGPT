However, the innovations described herein can be embodied in a multitude of different ways, for example, as defined and covered by the claims. In this description, reference is made to the drawings where like reference numerals can indicate identical or functionally similar elements. It will be understood that elements illustrated in the figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. Moreover, it will be understood that certain embodiments can include more elements than illustrated in a drawing and/or a subset of the elements illustrated in a drawing. Further, some embodiments can incorporate any suitable combination of features from two or more drawings.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Certain system level linearity specifications have stringent second order harmonic emissions (H2) specifications. As one example, a stringent specification can be that a radio frequency system achieves H2 of less than &#x2212;90 decibels relative to the carrier (dBc). In bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters, H2 emission can be generated from a main mode, a lateral mode, a recessed frame a mode, the like, or any suitable combination thereof. Even with techniques to reduce H2 emissions from BAW resonators, such as BAW resonator splits and/or cancellation, additional H2 reduction can be desired to meet certain system level H2 specifications. With post filter matching and a post antenna switch second harmonic trap circuit, H2 can be further reduced after the BAW filter. However, such post filter further reductions together with the techniques to reduce H2 emissions from BAW resonators can still be 10 dB to 15 dB short of meeting certain system level H2 emissions. This disclosure provides technical solutions related to providing an additional H2 emission reduction. With techniques disclosed herein, a radio frequency system can meet stringent H2 specifications, such as achieving H2 of less than &#x2212;90 dBc.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Aspects of this disclosure relate to a circuit topology to reduce acoustic wave filter harmonic distortion by using a trap circuit that includes an acoustic wave resonator and an inductor. H2 can be a bottleneck for a power amplifier with duplexer module, especially when it covers multiple bands and wide frequencies. By designing a harmonic short circuit at an antenna side, a trap at a second harmonic (2fo) frequency can be formed to help reject power generated by an acoustic filter at the second harmonic. An acoustic assisted trap circuit can include a shunt resonator of one acoustic wave filter of a multiplexer in series with an inductor, and the acoustic assisted trap circuit can provide H2 rejection for another filter of the multiplexer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Inductor-capacitor (LC) trap circuits at an antenna side can reject H2. Such LC trap circuits can add costs by using extra surface mount devices (SMDs). LC trap circuits can also consume area on a module. Steepness of a frequency response of such an LC trap circuit may not be sufficient such that there is a loss tradeoff.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">This disclosure provides technical solutions that use an acoustic assisted trap circuit to achieve better steepness for the trap than certain LC trap circuits. Also, for a multiplexer with multiple filters ganged and/or switch-plexed together, acoustic wave resonators can be on a separate filter die so that acoustic resonator based trap circuits do not add significant area to a module. By using an acoustic assisted trap, acoustic wave resonators can be implemented on filter dies to avoid using extra SMD components for such trap circuits. In some instances, inductor(s) of acoustic trap circuit(s) can also be formed on one or more of the filter dies. Due to better steepness from acoustic wave resonance, a sufficiently deep trap can be formed while reducing the loss penalty on carrier aggregation bands.

For instance, a wireless communication device <b>120</b> can be a mobile phone, such as a smart phone. As illustrated, the wireless communication device <b>120</b> includes a baseband system <b>121</b>, a transceiver <b>122</b>, a front end system <b>123</b>, one or more antennas <b>124</b>, a power management system <b>125</b>, a memory <b>126</b>, a user interface <b>127</b>, and a battery <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The wireless communication device <b>120</b> can communicate using a wide variety of communications technologies, including, but not limited to, 2G, 3G, 4G (including LTE, LTE-Advanced, and/or LTE-Advanced Pro), 5G NR, WLAN (for instance, Wi-Fi), WPAN (for instance, Bluetooth and/or ZigBee), WMAN (for instance, WiMax), and/or GPS technologies.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The transceiver <b>122</b> generates RF signals for transmission and processes incoming RF signals received from the antennas <b>124</b>. Various functionalities associated with the transmission and receiving of RF signals can be achieved by one or more components that are collectively represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> as the transceiver <b>122</b>. In one example, separate components (for instance, separate circuits or dies) can be provided for handling certain types of RF signals.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The front end system <b>123</b> aids in conditioning signals provided to and/or received from the antennas <b>124</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the front end system <b>123</b> includes antenna tuning circuitry <b>130</b>, power amplifiers (PAs) <b>131</b>, low noise amplifiers (LNAs) <b>132</b>, filters <b>133</b>, switches <b>134</b>, and signal splitting/combining circuitry <b>135</b>. However, other implementations are possible. The front end system <b>123</b> can include one or more harmonic trap circuits in accordance with any suitable principles and advantages disclosed herein. For example, the filters <b>133</b> can include one or more acoustic assisted trap circuits in accordance with any suitable principles and advantages disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The front end system <b>123</b> can provide a number of functionalities, including, but not limited to, amplifying signals for transmission, amplifying received signals, filtering signals, switching between different bands, switching between different power modes, switching between transmission and receiving modes, duplexing of signals, multiplexing of signals, or any suitable combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In certain implementations, the wireless communication device <b>120</b> supports carrier aggregation, thereby providing flexibility to increase peak data rates. Carrier aggregation can be used for Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) and/or Time Division Duplexing (TDD), and may be used to aggregate a plurality of carriers and/or channels.

For example, in the context of signal transmission, the amplitude and phases of the transmit signals provided to the antennas <b>124</b> are controlled such that radiated signals from the antennas <b>124</b> combine using constructive and destructive interference to generate an aggregate transmit signal exhibiting beam-like qualities with more signal strength propagating in a given direction. In the context of signal reception, the amplitude and phases are controlled such that more signal energy is received when the signal is arriving to the antennas <b>124</b> from a particular direction. In certain implementations, the antennas <b>124</b> include one or more arrays of antenna elements to enhance beamforming.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The baseband system <b>121</b> is coupled to the user interface <b>127</b> to facilitate processing of various user input and output (I/O), such as voice and data.
