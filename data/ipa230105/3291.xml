In one such an actuator, a housing has a breathing passage, and a filter unit is installed at an outer side of the breathing passage. The filter unit includes a holding member, a filter and a cap. The holding member is shaped in a tubular form and is press-fitted to an outer wall of the housing. The filter is in a form of a film and is installed at an end portion of the holding member. The cap is shaped in a bottomed tubular form and is installed at an outer side of the holding member such that the cap covers the filter.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As in the actuator described above where the filter unit is installed such that the filter unit projects at the outside of the housing, and a protective wall is formed at the housing to protect the filter unit from high-pressure liquid, in order to ensure a clearance relative to a component of the installation destination device, to which the actuator is installed, it may be necessary to form a recess at a corresponding location of the component of the installation destination device, or it may be necessary to place the actuator spaced from the component of the installation destination device. Therefore, the installability of the actuator may be deteriorated. In view of this, it is conceivable to directly install the filter to the housing to avoid the projection of the filter unit at the outside of the housing. However, in such a case, when the high-pressure liquid is directly applied to the filter, the filter may possibly be removed from the housing or may possibly be damaged.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the present disclosure, there is provided a breather structure configured to be provided to a housing of an actuator. The breather structure includes a breathing hole, a filter and a blocker. The breathing hole extends through the housing between an inside and an outside of the housing. The filter is configured to permit a flow of gas through the breathing hole via the filter while limiting a flow of liquid and a flow of solid through the breathing hole between the inside and the outside of the housing. The blocker is configured to block a portion of a path extending from an outer opening, which is an opening of the breathing hole opened to an outside space, to the filter to limit arrival of the liquid and the solid from the outside space to the filter.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the present disclosure, the filter is placed on the side of the outer opening of the breathing hole where the inside of the housing is located, so that the projection of the filter to the outside of the housing can be avoided. Therefore, the installability of the actuator is improved. Furthermore, when the high-pressure liquid tries to flow into the breathing hole, the blocker weakens the pressure of the liquid, so that the filter can be protected.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Hereinafter, a plurality of embodiments of an actuator will be described with reference to the drawings. The same reference signs are given to substantially the same portions among the embodiments, and the redundant description thereof will be omitted for the sake of simplicity.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an actuator <b>10</b> of a first embodiment is fixed to an outer wall of a case <b>12</b> of a vehicle transmission <b>11</b> and is used as a drive device of a shift-by-wire system <b>13</b>. The actuator <b>10</b> is controlled and is driven by a control device <b>15</b> based on a command signal outputted from a shift operation device <b>14</b> to change a shift range by driving a shift range change mechanism <b>16</b> of the transmission <b>11</b>.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">(Actuator)</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">First of all, an overall structure of the actuator <b>10</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

The front housing <b>21</b> and the rear housing <b>22</b> are joined together by bolts <b>23</b> in a state where an opening of the front housing <b>21</b> and an opening of the rear housing <b>22</b> are opposed to each other. A metal plate <b>24</b>, which is shaped in a bottomed tubular form, is embedded in the front housing <b>21</b>. The rear housing <b>22</b> has a tubular projection <b>28</b> which projects toward a side that is opposite to the front housing <b>21</b>. A bracket <b>29</b> is fixed to an outer wall of the rear housing <b>22</b>. The actuator <b>10</b> is installed to the case <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the transmission <b>11</b> through the bracket <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The electric motor <b>30</b> includes a stator <b>31</b>, a rotor <b>34</b> and a shaft <b>37</b>. The stator <b>31</b> includes a stator core <b>32</b> and coils <b>33</b>. The stator core <b>32</b> is shaped in a ring form and is fixed to the metal plate <b>24</b> by, for example, press-fitting. The coils <b>33</b> are wound around the stator core <b>32</b>. The rotor <b>34</b> is rotatably installed on an inner side of the stator <b>31</b>. The shaft <b>37</b> is supported by a motor side bearing <b>35</b> and a speed reducer side bearing <b>36</b> such that the shaft <b>37</b> is rotatable about a rotational axis AX<b>1</b>. The shaft <b>37</b> is rotated together with the rotor <b>34</b> and outputs a torque of the electric motor <b>30</b>. The motor side bearing <b>35</b> is installed to the metal plate <b>24</b>. The speed reducer side bearing <b>36</b> is installed to an output member <b>44</b> described later.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The speed reducer <b>40</b> includes an eccentric shaft <b>41</b>, a ring gear <b>42</b>, an eccentric gear <b>43</b>, the output member <b>44</b> and a transmission mechanism <b>45</b>. The eccentric shaft <b>41</b> is placed on an eccentric axis Ax<b>2</b>, which is eccentric to the rotational axis AX<b>1</b>, and the eccentric shaft <b>41</b> is formed integrally with the shaft <b>37</b> in one-piece. The ring gear <b>42</b> is coaxial with the rotational axis AX<b>1</b> and is fixed to the rear housing <b>22</b>. The eccentric gear <b>43</b> has external teeth <b>47</b>, which are meshed with internal teeth <b>46</b> of the ring gear <b>42</b>. The eccentric gear <b>43</b> is supported by a bearing <b>48</b> installed to the eccentric shaft <b>41</b> so as to make a planetary motion. The planetary motion is a motion that revolves around the rotational axis AX<b>1</b> while rotating around the eccentric axis AX<b>2</b>. A rotational speed of the eccentric gear <b>43</b> at the time of planetary motion is reduced relative to a rotational speed of the shaft <b>37</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The output member <b>44</b> is placed coaxially with the rotational axis AX<b>1</b> and is rotatably supported by a bearing <b>49</b> installed to the rear housing <b>22</b>. The output member <b>44</b> is an output portion that outputs the torque of the electric motor <b>30</b> to a control shaft <b>18</b> which serves as a drive subject. The transmission mechanism <b>45</b> includes: an engaging projection <b>51</b>, which is formed at the eccentric gear <b>43</b>; and an engaging hole <b>52</b>, which is formed at the output member <b>44</b> and receives the engaging projection <b>51</b>. The transmission mechanism <b>45</b> transmits rotation of the eccentric gear <b>43</b> about the eccentric axis Ax<b>2</b>, to the output member <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the actuator <b>10</b>, a rotating magnetic field is generated by switching the energizing phase of the coils <b>33</b>, and the rotor <b>34</b> is rotated when the rotor <b>34</b> receives a magnetic attraction force or a magnetic repulsion force generated by the rotating magnetic field. When the eccentric shaft <b>41</b> is rotated about the rotational axis AX<b>1</b> together with the rotor <b>34</b>, the eccentric gear <b>43</b> makes the planetary motion. Therefore, the rotation of the eccentric gear <b>43</b>, a rotational speed of which is reduced relative to a rotational speed of the rotor <b>34</b>, is outputted to the outside from the output member <b>44</b>.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">(Breather Structure)</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, the breather structure of the actuator <b>10</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>6</b></figref>.

The blocker <b>81</b> is configured to block a portion of a path extending from an outer opening <b>63</b>, which is an opening of the breathing hole <b>61</b> opened to an outside space <b>57</b>, to the filter <b>71</b> to limit arrival of the liquid and the solid from the outside space <b>57</b> to the filter <b>71</b>. With this breather structure <b>60</b>, it is possible to avoid the projection of the filter <b>71</b> at the outside of the housing <b>20</b>, so that the installability of the actuator <b>10</b> is improved. Furthermore, when the high-pressure liquid tries to flow into the breathing hole <b>61</b>, the blocker <b>81</b> weakens the pressure of the liquid, so that the filter <b>71</b> can be protected.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, according to the first embodiment, the blocker <b>81</b> includes: at least one primary blocking portion <b>84</b>, which is placed in a middle of the path extending from the outer opening <b>63</b> to the filter <b>71</b>; and at least one secondary blocking portion <b>85</b>, which is placed between the at least one primary blocking portion <b>84</b> and the filter <b>71</b>. The at least one secondary blocking portion <b>85</b> completely overlaps with at least one opening, which is other than the at least one primary blocking portion <b>84</b>, when a side, at which the filter <b>71</b> is placed, is viewed from the outer opening <b>63</b>. As a result, the at least one primary blocking portion <b>84</b> and the at least one secondary blocking portion <b>85</b> are arranged such that the filter <b>71</b> cannot be seen from the outer opening <b>63</b>. Therefore, it is possible to limit the liquid from the outside space <b>57</b> from directly colliding the filter <b>71</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, according to the first embodiment, the blocker <b>81</b> is configured to extend in a vertical direction in an installed state of the actuator <b>10</b> where the actuator <b>10</b> is installed on an installation destination (specifically, the vehicle in the first embodiment).

Therefore, the inflow of liquid from the upper side of the breathing hole <b>61</b> into the breathing hole <b>61</b> can be limited. Furthermore, even when the liquid flows into the breathing hole <b>61</b>, the liquid can flow out toward the ground along the cutout <b>92</b>.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the filter <b>71</b> is fixed to an inner wall surface of the rear housing <b>22</b> such that the filter <b>71</b> closes the inner opening <b>62</b>.
