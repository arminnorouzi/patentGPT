For example, a cell phone may be used in one or two-way communication with the route information facility <b>3904</b>. An example of two-way communication may be when the cell phone is used to connect with the route information facility and facilitate communication of a query (e.g. dialing 411 and requesting information pertaining to a location) and the phone is also be used to receive information pertaining to the query. For example, the route information facility may communicate directions to a location from a present location of the traveler through audio communication (e.g. directions the traveler can listen to on his cell phone). The route information system may also communicate directions, or other route information, through display signals. For example, the directions <b>4010</b> information may be communicated to be displayed on the display facility <b>4006</b> of the cell phone or pda or other facility. This way the traveler has a visual indication of the directions.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">In embodiments, the cell phone, or other portable communication facility, may be used in one-way communications, either sending or receiving. For example, the cell phone may be used to facilitate an initial query (e.g. get me directions to the location) but the directions may be sent to another facility. For example, a vehicle may be equipped with a travel information system, LCD screen, or other facility with a display facility and the direction information may be sent to the vehicles display. In an embodiment, an association between a user's cell phone and vehicle system may be made to facilitate communications to the vehicle following a cell phone initiated communication.

For example, a national retailer, such as the Gap, has stores throughout the US and a national call center may receive a call, assess the location of the caller, and present information (e.g. store locations) based on stores in close proximity to the caller's location. For example, the information provided may include directions, store hours, and or sale information and the information may be presented for the store(s) nearest to the caller.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">While the invention has been disclosed in connection with the embodiments shown and described in detail, various equivalents, modifications, and improvements will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from the above description.
