through a reactor <b>12</b> in which a burner <b>11</b> is installed, passes through a wet absorption unit <b>13</b>, and then is discharged externally. The waste gas flowing into the reactor <b>12</b> is combusted by the burner <b>11</b> to primarily remove harmful substances contained in the waste gas, and then the waste gas flowing into the wet adsorption unit <b>13</b> is accommodated in treatment liquid sprayed through a nozzle <b>13</b><i>a, </i>so that harmful substances are secondarily removed. Thereafter, harmful substances are removed once again while passing through an adsorbent <b>14</b> containing an absorbing material, and waste gas passing through the adsorbent is accommodated in the treatment liquid sprayed through the nozzle <b>13</b><i>a </i>so that the harmful substances are finally removed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The treatment liquid may be provided to the wet adsorption unit <b>13</b> after passing through a heat exchanger <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As described above, the gas from which harmful substances are removed is finally discharged externally of the scrubber facility <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic configuration diagram illustrating a reactor apparatus according to example embodiments of the present inventive concepts.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a reactor apparatus <b>100</b> may include a reactor chamber <b>110</b>, a burner <b>120</b>, a guide member <b>130</b>, a reservoir <b>140</b> (for example, a water reservoir) and/or a cover member <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The reactor chamber <b>110</b> has an interior space. In addition, the reactor chamber <b>110</b> is formed to extend from an upper surface thereof, and has an inlet <b>112</b> through which treatment liquid containing by-products is introduced from the wet adsorption unit <b>13</b> (please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) described above. The reactor chamber <b>110</b> has a shape in which the treatment liquid flowing into the inlet <b>112</b> flows to a lower end portion and is discharged externally. For example, the reactor chamber <b>110</b> may have a funnel shape with an upper end portion wider than a lower end portion. In addition, an outlet <b>114</b> is provided in the reactor chamber <b>110</b> so that the treatment liquid and water supplied from the water reservoir <b>140</b> can be discharged externally. As an example, the outlet <b>114</b> may be disposed below the burner <b>120</b>. As described above, since the outlet <b>114</b> is provided in the reactor chamber <b>110</b>, the treatment liquid, water, and by-products flowing into the reactor chamber <b>110</b> may be discharged externally of the reactor chamber <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, a waste gas supply pipe <b>116</b> through which waste gas is supplied to the burner <b>120</b> may be connected to a bottom surface of the reactor chamber <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The burner <b>120</b> is disposed at a lower end portion of the reactor chamber <b>110</b>, and is connected to a waste gas supply pipe <b>116</b>. In addition, the burner <b>120</b> is disposed below the guide member <b>130</b>, and is disposed below a hollow of the water reservoir <b>140</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce or prevent the treatment liquid flowing in from the inlet <b>112</b> from falling toward the burner <b>120</b>. The waste gas supplied from a lower portion of the burner <b>120</b> is combusted in the burner <b>120</b>, and thus, harmful substances contained in the waste gas are primarily removed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The guide member <b>130</b> is disposed above the burner <b>120</b>, and serves to allow the treatment liquid to flow externally of the burner <b>120</b>. As an example, the guide member <b>130</b> is disposed below the inlet <b>112</b> of the reactor chamber <b>110</b>, and allows the treatment liquid to flow externally of the water reservoir <b>140</b>. To this end, the guide member <b>130</b> may have a size sufficient to cover the entire water reservoir <b>140</b>.
