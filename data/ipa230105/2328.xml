The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements project and subsequent analyses showed that only 1-2% of our genome encodes for protein yet about 80% of it is transcribed into RNA (ENCODE, 2012). Although the majority of transcribed RNAs are non-coding, many non-coding RNAs are functionally involved in modulating cell activities and disease states. Such functional, non-coding RNAs represent a potential therapeutic target.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Indeed, RNA structures have been shown to be key players in important biological processes and in diseased states. Because RNA biology is often mediated by the structures that it forms, approaches to target structured RNAs could be advantageous. Currently, the approach to target RNA has been the use of oligonucleotide compounds that preferentially target unstructured regions<sup>1 </sup>Thus, the development of therapeutics that target RNA has mostly centered on using oligonucleotides.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Small molecules interacting with a RNA's three-dimensional structure could allow one to preferentially target RNA structure. However, interactions between RNA and small molecule compounds are poorly understood which has led to the perception that RNA is &#x201c;undruggable&#x201d;. (Guan &#x26; Disney, 2012; Thomas &#x26; Hergenrother, 2008). Nevertheless, small molecules have shown an ability to target RNA. For example, small molecules have been investigated for targeting the three-dimensional structure of ribosome, riboswitches, certain viral RNA and nucleotide repeat expansions. (Blount and Breaker, 2006; U.S. Pat. No. 9,586,944 B2; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2016/0188791 A1).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One class of structured RNAs that play roles in disease biology are non-coding microRNAs (miRs). They are produced from highly structured precursors that are processed in the nucleus (pri-miRs) and cytoplasm (pre-miRs) by the nucleases Drosha and Dicer, respectively see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>. Many miRs play significant roles in human disease biology, see D. P. Bartel, MicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function. <i>Cell </i>116, 281-297 (2004). For example, miR-21's expression negatively correlates with survival in triple negative breast cancer patients and is expressed in solid tumors, see A. M. Krichevsky, G. Gabriely, miR-21: a small multi-faceted RNA. <i>J. Cell. MoL Med </i>13, 39-53 (2009).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, an object of the present invention is the development of small molecules that achieve modification, amelioration and/or negation of miR-21 activity. Another object of the present invention is the development of small molecules that selectively inhibit pre-miR-21 so as to silence, modify and/or ameliorate the expression of miR-21. Yet another object is to target pre-miR-21 for enzymatic cleavage. A further object is to develop an inhibitory and degradation small molecule module that displays high binding and selectivity targeting of pre-miR-21.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other objects are achieved by embodiments of the present invention that are directed to a small molecule compound comprising Formula 1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="23.20mm" wi="114.64mm" file="US20230002329A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">For Formula 1, R<sup>8 </sup>is hydrogen or methyl, R<sup>9 </sup>is hydroxyl, H<sub>2</sub>N&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub>&#x2014;NH&#x2014; or N<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub>&#x2014;NH&#x2014;, designator q is an integer of 2 to 6 and designator r is an integer of 2 to 6.

The approach enabled the design small molecules that target the three-dimensional folds in pre-miR-21 RNA. This approach is depicted conceptually in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>. Inforna uses the output of folded RNA structures that bind small molecules. The small molecule models are derived from a library-versus-library screening approach, see S. P. Velagapudi, S. M. Gallo, M. D. Disney, Sequence-based design of bioactive small molecules that target precursor microRNAs. <i>Nat. Chem. Biol. </i>10, 291-297 (2014). This analysis identified a small molecule compound of Formula 1 for further investigation. Modules based on Formula 1 were then designed and assayed for their ability to arrest growth of neoplastic cells such as triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). These modules demonstrated a significant ability to arrest neoplastic cell growth. Additionally, the inhibitory activity of these modules toward the metastasis behavior of MDA-MD-231 cells implanted in mice was investigated and found to be successful.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0034">Explanation of the methods and use of the RIBOTAC and Inforna protocols in connection with the development and identification of the small molecule compound embodiments according to the invention and the features of the small molecule compound embodiments of the invention are set out in the following sections.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0035">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0036">The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; as used herein, when referring to a numerical value or range, allows for a degree of variability in the value or range, for example, within 10%, or within 5% of a stated value or of a stated limit of a range.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0037">All percent compositions are given as weight-percentages, unless otherwise stated.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0038">All average molecular weights of polymers are weight-average molecular weights, unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0039">The term &#x201c;may&#x201d; in the context of this application means &#x201c;is permitted to&#x201d; or &#x201c;is able to&#x201d; and is a synonym for the term &#x201c;can.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;may&#x201d; as used herein does not mean possibility or chance.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0040">It is also to be understood that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, for example, the term &#x201c;X and/or Y&#x201d; means &#x201c;X&#x201d; or &#x201c;Y&#x201d; or both &#x201c;X&#x201d; and &#x201c;Y&#x201d;, and the letter &#x201c;s&#x201d; following a noun designates both the plural and singular forms of that noun.

Adherence may be via absorption, e.g., into a fluid component of the gel solvent system, or may be via adsorption, e.g., to a surface of the gel, or a combination thereof. As another example, adherence may be the result of, e.g., thermodynamic and/or kinetic stabilization, van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions, solvation, or combinations thereof. In some cases, adherence may be the result of hydrogen bonding. In some cases, adherence may be described functionally or empirically, for example, adherence may be described by compounds which exhibit minimal diffusion, such that the compounds remain within discrete locations on a microarray gel. As another example, adherence may be described by compounds which remain substantially adhered when the microgel is washed or incubated. Groups of compounds may be considered non-covalently adhered when, as examples, at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9% are adhered to the gel without forming any covalent linkages.

Adhered also does not include compounds which are spatially separated from the gel, such as where the gel has wells and compounds are dissolved or suspended in a solvent which is physically contained in the well. As another example, adhered does not include compounds which are contained with a discrete droplet which sits upon the gel but does not mix with the gel. For example, adhered does not include compounds which are immobilized as discrete droplets which are then contacted with the RNA motif library using aerosol deposition technology). Further, adhered does not include compounds which simply rest upon the microarray as a dry chemical microarray. For example, a dry chemical microarray has the disadvantage that, if subjected to washing, incubation, or both, the deposited compounds would mix or be removed completely from the discrete locations they were spotted to.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0094">The term &#x201c;binding interaction&#x201d;, as used herein, is meant to refer to binding or other stabilized association between a small molecule and an RNA molecule or RNA motif.

The members may differ from one another (i) in the identity of the bases in the RNA internal loop and/or (ii) in the identity of the base pairs adjacent to the RNA internal loop (the so-called loop closing base pairs). Suitable RNA motif libraries can be prepared by conventional transcription techniques (e.g., those employing T7 RNA polymerase, as described, for example, in Milligan et al., &#x201c;Synthesis of Small RNAs Using T7 RNA Polymerase,&#x201d; <i>Methods Enzymol., </i>180:51-62 (1989), which is hereby incorporated by reference) from DNA templates, such as DNA templates that are commercially available from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa)).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114">In various embodiments, the plurality of small molecule compounds adhered to the microarray as described above can be contacted with the RNA library, or RNA motif library, by a variety of methods.

Additional steps can include incubating the plurality of compounds with one or more chase oligonucleotides such as stem chase oligonucleotides, hairpin chase oligonucleotides, DNA chase oligonucleotides, or any combination thereof. The chase oligonucleotides may include oligonucleotides that are designed to ensure that the compound interacts with the RNA motif (i.e., with the RNA motif library's variable region) and not with those nucleic acid regions that do not vary from member to member (e.g., invariant stem regions, invariant hairpin loop regions, etc.). The design of such stem chase and hairpin oligonucleotides may depend on the sequences used in the nucleic acid regions that do not vary from member to member.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0117">These methods enable identification of small molecule compounds which interact with particular RNA motifs, such as motifs that have common properties among many RNA kinds and types. Since the nucleic acid sequences of many biologically important nucleic acid molecules are known, one can readily ascertain which biologically important nucleic acid molecules have the particular RNA motifs with which a particular compound interacts.

The informa methods utilize and compare datasets of information, providing an output of which RNA structural secondary structures will likely bind to which small molecule. Those datasets include (a) a dataset of RNA secondary structures to be queried; and (b) a dataset of identified RNA motif-small molecule interactions (e.g., as identified by two-dimensional combinatorial screening (2DCS)). For example, Sequences of all miRNA precursors in the human transcriptome may be downloaded from miRBase (Griffiths-Jones et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 36, D154-158 (2008)) and their secondary structures predicted via RNAstructure (Mathews et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101, 7287-7292 (2004)). The secondary structural elements may be extracted from each query RNA and those secondary structures compared to a database of RNA motif-small molecule interactions identified by two-dimensional combinatorial screening (2DCS). Such a dataset can be generated, for example, by use of the microarray of the present invention in a two-dimensional combinatorial screening (2DCS) process. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0188377 A1; Childs-Disney et al., <i>ACS Chem. Biol. </i>2, 745-754 (2007); Disney et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>130, 11185-11194 (2008), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0121">A dataset of RNA secondary structures to be queried can be generated from one or more RNA sequences alone. For example, RNA secondary structures can be identified as the lowest free energy secondary structures formed by an RNA as it folds back upon itself to form double-stranded regions as well as single-stranded loops and mismatched &#x2018;bubbles&#x2019; in the double-stranded regions. Such low free energy secondary structures can be predicted by programs such as RNAstructure (Mathews et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A </i>101, 7287-7292 (2004), which are specifically incorporated by reference in their entireties).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0122">The output of RNA sequences and secondary structures that will likely bind to a small molecule can be further analyzed by other prediction processes and by chemical and biological assays (e.g., binding assays). For example, a StARTS statistical method can be used to further refine predictions. The StARTS method predicts the affinities and selectivities of RNA motif-small molecule interactions by comparing the rate of occurrence of small structural features (a guanine adjacent to an adenine, for example) in selected RNA motifs to its rate of occurrence in the entire RNA library. The StARTS method therefore facilitates identification of which RNA secondary structures and motifs are most unique or distinctive in populations of RNA molecules. StARTS is a statistical approach that can be paired with informa to further evaluate the binding affinity of RNA secondary structures for the small molecule partner(s) identified by informa. StARTS identifies features in RNA motifs that positively and negatively contribute to binding (see, Velagapudi et al., <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. </i>49, 3816-3818 (2010); Velagapudi et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>133, 10111-10118 (2011); Paul et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>37 (17): 5894-5907 (2009), each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">In the StARTS approach, sequences of one or more RNA secondary structures identified as binding a small molecule are compiled, and the occurrence rate of each sequence feature in the RNA secondary structures may be compared to the occurrence rate of that feature in a larger population of RNA motifs. A sequence feature is any short RNA sequence (for example, a 5&#x2032;GC step) that may or may not be different from the sequence features that are present in a larger population of RNA sequences. However, the sequence features are those sequences that are present in the population of RNA secondary structures that bind to a small molecule. By comparing these two populations, the relative enrichment for a specific feature in RNA secondary structure for binding to a small molecule can be computed. Thus, the StARTS method identifies which sequence features are more prevalent in a selected population of RNA sequences than in a larger population of RNA sequences.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124">The more distinctive sequence features may be assigned a statistical significance, or a Z-score and a corresponding two-tailed p-value. The Z scores can be determined by statistical analysis using a RNA Privileged Space Predictor (RNA-PSP) program that determines which features occur in the selected RNA secondary structures with greater than 95% confidence (see, Paul et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>37 (17): 5894-5907 (2009)). The confidence intervals are associated with a Z-score, where a larger value corresponds to a higher confidence level. Each RNA secondary structure can have multiple features that contribute to it being different from a larger population of RNA motifs and a sum of the Z-scores for all features in an RNA secondary structure can be computed (&#x3a3;Z) as an indicator of the total structural distinctiveness of an RNA motif.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">To complete the StARTS analysis, the Z-scores can then plotted against the measured binding affinities of the RNA secondary structure for a compound, and this relationship can be fitted to an inverse first-order equation, which allows prediction of the affinity of a compound for a RNA library member.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126">These methods were used with libraries of various drug classes including kinase inhibitors, pre-mRNA splicing modulators, and topoisomerase inhibitors that bound RNA avidly. Lead molecules were identified. Structure-Activity-Relationships among the molecules and the binding indications with RNA motifs were identified.

In certain such embodiments, the binding may be reversible or irreversible.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0150">The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutical compositions are capable of acting as &#x201c;inhibitors&#x201d; of pre-miR-21 which means that they are capable of blocking or reducing the expression of pre-miR-21, for example, inhibition of various activities of pre-miR-21. An inhibitor can act with competitive, uncompetitive, or noncompetitive inhibition. An inhibitor can bind reversibly or irreversibly, and therefore the term includes compounds that can cause nuclease degradation the structured RNA or it can cause a conformational change elsewhere on the structured RNA so as to prevent its function.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0151">The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutical compositions function as therapeutic agents in that they are capable of preventing, ameliorating, modifying and/or affecting a disorder or condition refers to a compound that, in a statistical sample, reduces the occurrence of the disorder or condition in the treated sample relative to an untreated control sample, or delays the onset or reduces the severity of one or more symptoms of the disorder or condition relative to the untreated control sample.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0152">The ability to prevent, ameliorate, modify and/or affect in relation to a condition, such as a local recurrence (e.g., pain), a disease such as cancer, a syndrome complex such as heart failure or any other medical condition, is well understood in the art, and includes administration of a composition which reduces the frequency of, or delays the onset of, symptoms of a medical condition in a subject relative to a subject which does not receive the composition. Thus, prevention of cancer includes, for example, reducing the number of detectable cancerous growths population, and/or delaying the appearance of detectable cancerous growths in a treated population versus an untreated control population, e.g., by a statistically and/or clinically significant amount. Prevention of an infection includes, for example, reducing the number of diagnoses of the infection in a treated population versus an untreated control population, and/or delaying the onset of symptoms of the infection in a treated population versus an untreated control population. Prevention of pain includes, for example, reducing the magnitude of, or alternatively delaying, pain sensations experienced by subjects in a treated population versus an untreated control population.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0153">The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutical compositions are capable of functioning prophylactically and/or therapeutically and include administration to the host of one or more of the subject compositions. If it is administered prior to clinical manifestation of the unwanted condition (e.g., disease or other unwanted state of the host animal) then the treatment is prophylactic, (i.e., it protects the host against developing the unwanted condition), whereas if it is administered after manifestation of the unwanted condition, the treatment is therapeutic, (i.e., it is intended to diminish, ameliorate, or stabilize the existing unwanted condition or side effects thereof).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0154">The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutical compositions are capable of prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. If a compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered prior to clinical manifestation of the unwanted condition (e.g., disease or other unwanted state of the host animal) then the treatment is prophylactic, (i.e., it protects the host against developing the unwanted condition), whereas if it is administered after manifestation of the unwanted condition, the treatment is therapeutic, (i.e., it is intended to diminish, ameliorate, or stabilize the existing unwanted condition or side effects thereof). As used herein, the term &#x201c;treating&#x201d; or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; includes reversing, reducing, or arresting the symptoms, clinical signs, and underlying pathology of a condition in manner to improve or stabilize a subject's condition.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0155">The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutical compositions can be administered in &#x201c;therapeutically effective amounts&#x201d; with respect to the subject method of treatment. The therapeutically effective amount is an amount of the compound(s) in a pharmaceutical composition which, when administered as part of a desired dosage regimen (to a mammal, preferably a human) alleviates a symptom, ameliorates a condition, or slows the onset of disease conditions according to clinically acceptable standards for the disorder or condition to be treated or the cosmetic purpose, e.g., at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Administration</heading><p id="p-0168" num="0156">Compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutical compositions prepared as described herein can be administered in various forms, depending on the disorder to be treated and the age, condition, and body weight of the patient, as is well known in the art.

This is accomplished by preparing an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation, or solid particles containing the composition. A nonaqueous (e.g., fluorocarbon propellant) suspension could be used. Sonic nebulizers are preferred because they minimize exposing the agent to shear, which can result in degradation of the compound.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0188">Ordinarily, an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of a compound of the invention together with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular composition, but typically include nonionic surfactants (Tweens, Pluronics, sorbitan esters, lecithin, Cremophors), pharmaceutically acceptable co-solvents such as polyethylene glycol, innocuous proteins like serum albumin, oleic acid, amino acids such as glycine, buffers, salts, sugars, or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from isotonic solutions.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0189">Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the agent in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the inhibitor(s) across the skin.

Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0191">These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include tonicity-adjusting agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0192">In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a compound of the invention, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. For example, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0193">Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of inhibitor(s) in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0194">The pharmaceutical compositions may be given orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally.

S<b>47</b></figref><i>b</i>). Force field parameters for these moieties were created using the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF)<sup>34</sup>. RESP charges for the binding module were derived using the resp protocol: the molecule was first minimized and then electrostatic potentials at a set of grid points were calculated at the HF/6-31G* basis set<sup>35,36</sup>. The calculations were performed using Gaussian09<sup>37</sup>. The atomic charges for the linker were produced by AM1-BCC method<sup>38 </sup>built-in Antechamber program<sup>39</sup>. All the force field parameters and charge information for the binding module and the linker are available in Tables S<b>6</b> &#x26; S<b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0276">Binding studies. Two RNA molecules, r(5&#x2032;-CGCG<u style="single">A</u>CGCG-3&#x2032;/5&#x2032;CGCGCGCG-3&#x2032;) and r(5&#x2032;-GCGU<u style="single">U</u>GCGC/GCGCACGC-3&#x2032;), representing model A- and U-bulges were generated by the nucgen module in AMBER16<sup>40 </sup>to conduct the binding studies. The Amber99 force fields<sup>41 </sup>with revised &#x3c7;<sup>42 </sup>and &#x3b1;/&#x3b3;<sup>43 </sup>torsional parameters were used to describe the RNAs. Watson-Crick (WC) base pairing, torsional, and chirality restraints were imposed on the system to maintain the A-form geometry. All the simulations for the binding study were conducted under the conditions of the modified implicit solvent model (GB<sup>OBC</sup>)<sup>4 </sup>with 0.3 M salt concentrations. The previously used dynamic docking methodology<sup>45-47 </sup>was applied to investigate the bound states of the binding module to the A- and U-bulge RNAs. First, initial structures were created for each system by placing the binding module at 40 &#x212b; away from the bulge RNA site. The distance between the center of mass of the heavy atoms of the adjacent bases to the bulge region and the heavy atoms of the binding module was used as the reaction coordinate during the initial binding process. The binding module was slowly moved toward the bulge-region in 1 &#x212b; increments until the reaction coordinate approached to 0 &#x212b;. During the so-called &#x2018;move-close&#x2019; process, WC base pairing, torsional, and chirality restraints representing A-form geometry were imposed on the RNA except the bulge region. This allowed the bulge site to re-orient itself while interacting with the binding module. Once at 0 &#x212b;, the binding module was moved away from the bulge-site in increments of 1 &#x212b; until the distance reached to 40 &#x212b;. During this so-called &#x2018;move-away&#x2019; process, WC base pairing, torsional, and chirality restraints representing A-form geometry were imposed on all the RNA residues. This process was repeated 50 times sequentially to provide 50 different initial bound states to be used in MD simulations for the binding studies. Using these initial bound states, 50 independent implicit-solvent MD simulations were conducted. In these MD simulations, again, the WC base pairing, torsional, and chirality restraints were imposed on the RNA except in the bulged region so that the binding module was free to move around the bulge site. Each MD simulation was run for 120 ns yielding a total of 6 &#x3bc;s combined MD trajectory, which was used in cluster analysis for the binding module/A-bulge RNA complex.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0277">Cluster Analysis. An in-house code was utilized in cluster analyses. The combined MD trajectories contained 60K snapshots. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was investigated through the whole snapshots, and the snapshots with RMSD &#x3c;=1 &#x212b; were clustered into the same group. The symmetry of ring atoms of the binding module was considered while calculating the RMSD.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0278">Relative binding free energy calculations using MM-PBSA. MM-PBSA analyses were performed on each cluster to determine the lowest binding free energy states for the binding module/bulge RNA complexes.

In all cases, with an FDR of 1% and variance of S<sub>0</sub>(0.1) (dashed lines), miR-21 is the most significantly inhibited miRNA. b, The Gini coefficient (GC), a measure of statistical dispersion, was applied as a measure of reactive selectivity. The Gini index has previously been applied as a measure of kinase selectivity with values closer to zero indicating little to no selectivity, while values closer to one indicating higher selectivity. That is, non-selective inhibitors, such as staurosporine have a GC of 0.150, while highly selective compounds that affect less than 10 kinases amongst the kinome, such as the selective PD184352 inhibitor, have a GC of 0.905<sup>18</sup>.
