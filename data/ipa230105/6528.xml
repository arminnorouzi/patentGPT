The invention also relates to a method for operating such a transport device.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Planar motors are well known in the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,202,719 B2 discloses the basic design and mode of operation of such a planar motor. A planar motor essentially has a stator forming a transport plane in which one or more transport units can be moved at least two-dimensionally. The stator is usually made up of one or more transport segments. In order to move the transport units in the transport plane, a driving force acting on the transport unit is generated by a magnetic field of the stator (of the transport segment(s)) interacting with a magnetic field of the transport unit. In order to effect a movement of the transport unit in a specific movement direction, at least one of the magnetic fields, i.e., that of the stator and/or that of the transport unit, must be temporally changeable in order to follow the movement of the transport unit. In most cases, however, only one magnetic field, usually that on the stator, is temporally changeable and the respective other magnetic field (that on the transport unit) is usually constant, i.e., it is not temporally changeable.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Temporally changeable magnetic fields can be generated, for example, by coils (electromagnets) that can be arranged both on the transport unit and on the stator, in particular on the transport segment. The coils are frequently also called drive coils.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Temporally unchanging, i.e., constant, magnetic fields are typically generated by means of permanent magnets. These components are frequently called drive magnets. Depending on the embodiment of the planar motor, they can also be arranged both on the transport unit and on the transport segment. Due to the simpler control, the drive coils are often arranged on the transport segment of the planar motor and the drive magnets are arranged on the transport unit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The drive coils are usually controlled by a control unit in order to generate a moving magnetic field in the desired movement direction. The drive magnets, which interact with the moving magnetic field, are distributed at least two-dimensionally on the transport unit, so that a driving and levitation force can be generated on the transport unit. Due to the levitation force, the transport unit can be held in a constant position, e.g., an air gap can be created or adjusted and maintained between the transport unit and the transport segments. The additionally acting driving force can be used to move the transport unit in the desired movement direction and tilting forces or tilting moments can be generated. In order to make possible the two-dimensional movement of the transport unit, which is characteristic of the planar motor, a two-dimensional interaction of the magnetic fields of the transport segments and the transport units is required, wherein one of the two magnetic fields must be temporally changeable in at least two dimensions or both magnetic fields must be temporally changeable in at least one dimension (complementary to the respective other dimension). The drive coils and the drive magnets are advantageously arranged such that, in addition to a one-dimensional movement along the axes spanned by the transport plane, more complex two-dimensional movements of the transport unit in the transport plane are also possible.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A planar motor can be used, for example, as a transport device in a production process, wherein very flexible transport processes with complex movement profiles can be realized. In EP 3 172 156 B1 and EP 3 172 134 B1, for example, such applications of a planar motor as a transport device are shown.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The stators of such planar motors can have different arrangements of drive coils, and the arrangement of the drive magnets on the transport units can also be very different. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,202,719 B2 discloses a planar motor with a multi-layer structure of the stator with a plurality of coil planes lying one above the other. The drive coils in adjacent coil planes are orthogonal to one another in order to form two main movement directions in which the transport units are movable. On average, the coil planes are therefore at different distances from the drive magnets of the transport unit. This results in different efficiencies of the planar motor in the two main movement directions. In order to compensate for this fact, it is proposed for generating the driving force that a higher coil current is applied to the drive coils of a coil plane further away from the drive magnets of the transport unit than is applied to the drive coils of a closer coil plane.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the publication J. M. M., Rovers, et. al, 2013. Design and measurements of the Double Layer Planar Motor. In: International Electric Machines &#x26; Drives Conference. Chicago, 05/12-15/2013. IEEE. a planar motor with a layered arrangement of two coil planes is disclosed. In order to compensate for the different efficiencies that result from the different distances from the magnets of the transport unit, it is proposed that drive coils of different heights are used for the two coil planes.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a transport device in the form of a planar motor, and a method for operating a transport device in the form of a planar motor, which allow for a more efficient operation of the transport device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention, the object is achieved in that the at least one transport segment is arranged in a position that is different from a horizontal position, in that a force component of a loading force acting on the transport unit, during operation of the transport device, is greater in the first main direction of movement than a force component of the loading force in the second main direction of movement, wherein the loading force at least includes the transport unit gravitational force of the transport unit.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advantageous embodiments of the transport device are specified in the dependent claims <b>2</b> to <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the object is achieved by a method according to claim <b>10</b>.

The drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b> are arranged one behind the other in a specific direction, in this case in the X-direction, in order to form the first main movement direction H<b>1</b> for the movement of the transport unit TE, which in this case extends along the X-axis. The drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b> are arranged one behind the other in a specific direction, in this case the Y-direction, in order to form a second main movement direction H<b>2</b> for the transport unit TE, which in this case extends along the Y-axis. The drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b> of the first and second coil groups SG<b>1</b>, SG<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, are preferably arranged relative to one another such that the two main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> are perpendicular to one another. Of course, another relative arrangement of the main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> would also be conceivable, for example, an angle between the main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> that deviates from a right angle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b> and the drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b> are in this case each designed as elongated, conventionally wound coils. The drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b> each have a longitudinal extension LAS<b>1</b> in the Y-direction and, relative thereto, a smaller transverse extension QAS<b>1</b> in the X-direction and are arranged one behind the other in the direction of their transverse extension QAS<b>1</b>, in this case in the X-direction. The transverse extension QASi of a drive coil ASi typically depends on the pole pitch Ti of the drive magnets <b>4</b> of the magnet group MGi interacting therewith and/or the winding scheme of the drive coils ASi, i.e., whether it is, for example, a concentrated winding (single-tooth winding) or a distributed winding. The winding schemes are known in the prior art. The direction in which the drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b> are arranged one behind the other thus defines the first main movement direction H<b>1</b> for the movement of the transport unit TE. The drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b> are designed as so-called &#x201c;long coils.&#x201d; This means that its longitudinal extension LAS<b>1</b> is greater than the extension of the transport unit TE in the respective direction (in this case the Y-direction), in this case, e.g., greater than a transport unit width BTE of the transport unit TE. In the example shown, the longitudinal extension LAS<b>1</b> is essentially the same size as the extension of the transport segment <b>2</b> in the Y-direction. A movement of a transport unit TE in the X-direction, i.e., in the first main movement direction H<b>1</b>, is thus possible at essentially any point in the Y-direction.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b> also have a longitudinal extension LAS<b>2</b>, which in this case is shorter than the longitudinal extension LAS<b>1</b> of the drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b>. In this case, the longitudinal extension LAS<b>2</b> of the drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b> runs in the X-direction. The drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b> also each have a smaller transverse extension QAS<b>2</b>, in this case in the Y-direction, relative to their longitudinal extension LAS<b>2</b>. The transverse extension QAS<b>2</b> is in this case essentially the same size as the transverse extension QAS<b>1</b> of the drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b>, but could also be larger or smaller. The drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b> are also arranged one behind the other in the direction of their transverse extension QAS<b>2</b>, in this case in the Y-direction. The direction in which the drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b> are arranged one behind the other thus defines the second main movement direction H<b>2</b> for the movement of the transport unit TE.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b> are designed as so-called &#x201c;short coils.&#x201d; This means that its longitudinal extension LAS<b>2</b> is smaller than or equal to the extension of the transport unit TE in the respective direction (in this case the X-direction), in this case, for example, the transport unit length LTE of the transport unit TE. In order to still allow for a movement of a transport unit TE in the second main movement H<b>2</b> in the entire transport plane <b>3</b>, the drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b> are arranged in a plurality of rows next to one another in the X-direction, in this case, e.g., in three rows. However, a reverse arrangement would also be possible, i.e., &#x201c;long&#x201d; coils for the second main movement direction H<b>2</b> and &#x201c;short&#x201d; coils for the first main movement direction H<b>1</b>. It would also be possible to use either &#x201c;long&#x201d; or &#x201c;short&#x201d; coils for both main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>. For example, it can be advantageous in terms of cost savings if identical drive coils AS<b>1</b>=AS<b>2</b> are used for both coil groups SG<b>1</b>, SG<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Of course, the embodiment shown is only to be understood as an example and a person skilled in the art could also provide a different arrangement of the coil groups SG<b>1</b>, SG<b>2</b> and/or other designs of drive coils. For example, so-called PCB coils could be used in a known manner. PCB stands for &#x201c;printed circuit board&#x201d; and means that the coils are integrated directly into a printed circuit board. The two embodiments are known in the prior art and therefore no further detailed description is provided at this point. Another arrangement of the coil groups SG<b>1</b>, SG<b>2</b> relative to one another and/or to the transport segment <b>2</b> would also be conceivable and/or further coil groups SGi with drive coils ASi could also be provided, which form a further main movement direction Hi. However, in the most common case, two differently oriented coil groups SG<b>1</b>, SG<b>2</b>, each with a plurality of drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b>, are sufficient, wherein each coil group SG<b>1</b>, SG<b>2</b> defines a main movement direction H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>. However, the at least two main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> are, as shown, preferably perpendicular to one another, as a result of which the transport segment <b>2</b> can be designed in a structurally simpler manner.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For a modular design of a transport plane <b>3</b> consisting of a plurality of transport segments <b>2</b>, it is also advantageous if the transport segments <b>2</b> each have a square or rectangular transport plane <b>3</b>. The transport segments <b>2</b> can then be lined up in a simple manner, so that the respective first main movement direction H<b>1</b> of a transport segment <b>2</b> runs parallel or normal to the first main movement direction H<b>1</b> of the respective adjacent transport segment <b>2</b>. A transport plane <b>3</b> can thus be built up easily and flexibly from a plurality of transport segments <b>2</b>. It is also not absolutely necessary for adjacent transport segments <b>2</b> to be aligned with one another; instead, an offset would also be possible.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With the transport device <b>1</b> shown, an essentially unrestricted movement of a transport unit TE in the two main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> would be possible, for example, in the transport plane <b>3</b> of the transport segment <b>2</b>. It could be possible that the transport unit TE can only be moved, for example, along the X-axis or only along the Y-axis. The transport unit TE can naturally be moved simultaneously in both main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>, e.g., with a two-dimensional movement path BP lying in the transport plane <b>3</b> with an X-coordinate and a Y-coordinate, as indicated on the transport unit TE in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>. With a corresponding structural design of the transport segment <b>2</b> and the respective transport unit TE, the other four degrees of freedom can also be used in a known manner at least to a limited extent (translational movement in the vertical direction Z and rotation about the three axes X, Y, Z).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A control unit <b>5</b> is also provided in the transport device <b>1</b>, with which the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b> of the transport segment <b>2</b> can be controlled, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>.

An unequal number of first and second magnet groups MGa, MGb would also be conceivable, for example, two first magnet groups MGa and one second magnet group MGb.

An essentially moving magnetic field is generated in the first main movement direction H<b>1</b> by an appropriately temporally offset activation of the first drive coils AS<b>1</b>. The moving magnetic field in the first main movement direction H<b>1</b> mainly interacts electromagnetically with the drive magnets <b>4</b> of the first magnet group(s) MGa in order to generate the driving force for setting a predefined movement state of the respective transport unit TE in the first main movement direction H<b>1</b>, e.g., an acceleration, a constant speed, or a deceleration to standstill.

The amount of the levitation force FS corresponds essentially to the vectorial sum of the weight force FG and the process force FP (in the gravitational direction), so that a static equilibrium state of the transport unit TE is achieved while maintaining the air gap. Driving force refers to the part of the electromagnetically generated force that leads to a change in the movement state of the transport unit TE (e.g., constant speed, acceleration, deceleration, etc.) or the part that must be applied in addition to the levitation force FS in order to keep the transport unit TE at a standstill in the case of a process force FP not acting in the gravitational direction. In addition to the two-dimensional movement in the transport plane <b>3</b>, a specific movement of the transport unit TE in the vertical direction is also possible, i.e., normal to the transport plane <b>3</b>.

Coil geometry refers in particular to the longitudinal extension LASi and the transverse extension QASi of the drive coils ASi parallel to the transport plane <b>3</b>, as well as a coil height h<sub>ASi </sub>of the drive coils ASi normal to the transport plane <b>3</b>, as indicated on the drive coils AS<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>. Furthermore, the winding scheme also influences the coil geometry of the drive coils ASi, i.e., whether it is a concentrated winding or a distributed winding. The magnetic properties of the drive magnets <b>4</b> of the transport unit TE influencing the magnetic field refer to, for example, a remanent flux density of the drive magnets <b>4</b>, a relative orientation between the drive magnets <b>4</b> and the drive coils ASi interacting therewith, a pole pitch Ti of the drive magnets <b>4</b>, and a magnetic geometry of the drive magnets. The magnet geometry relates in particular to a magnet length LMi, the magnet width MBi, and the magnet height HMi, as shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the following, some exemplary measures are listed as to how the efficiency &#x3c1;Hi of the electromagnetic force formation in a main movement direction Hi of the transport device <b>1</b> can be increased by means of the magnetic properties influencing the magnetic field and/or the coil properties influencing the magnetic field. Of course, several magnetic properties and/or coil properties can also be changed.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The relative orientation between the drive magnets <b>4</b> and the drive coils ASi should be such that the conductor orientation of the drive coils ASi is orthogonal to the magnetic field generated by the drive magnets <b>4</b>. In practice, this is achieved, for example, by using elongated drive coils ASi and elongated drive magnets <b>4</b>, arranged as parallel as possible to the longitudinal extension LASi, of the magnet group MGi interacting therewith (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>). In addition, the relative orientation between the drive coils ASi of a coil group SGi (e.g., SG<b>1</b>) and the magnet group MGi (e.g., MGb), which predominantly interacts with the drive coils ASi of the respective other coil group SGi (e.g., SG<b>2</b>), should be as orthogonal as possible, so that few or no coupling effects can develop. In the example according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, this is achieved, for example, in that the drive magnets <b>4</b> of the second magnet groups MGb are arranged as parallel as possible to the transverse extension QAS<b>1</b> of the drive coils ASi of the first coil group SG<b>1</b>. The distance between a conductor of a drive coil ASi and the drive magnet <b>4</b> interacting therewith (corresponds to the average coil spacing S<b>1</b> in the examples shown) should be as small as possible, since the flux density decreases exponentially with the normal distance.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The conductor resistance of the drive coil ASi should be as low as possible. Options for reducing the conductor resistance are, e.g., providing a so-called &#x201c;covered length&#x201d; of a drive coil ASi that is as high as possible and/or increasing the cross section of the conductors of a drive coil ASi. The &#x201c;covered length&#x201d; is the part of the conductor which is located in the range of influence of the magnetic field of the drive magnets <b>4</b>. The &#x201c;covered length&#x201d; should preferably correspond to the entire extension of the conductor or the drive coil ASi. If a plurality of conductors is used to generate the driving force/levitation force, which is usually realized by using drive coils ASi, a high copper fill factor is advantageous (the definition of the copper fill factor is generally known and essentially corresponds to the ratio between the sum of the cross-sectional surface of the individual conductors of a coil to the total cross-sectional surface of the coil). Since the specific resistance of a conductor increases with temperature, the efficiency of a conductor can be increased by reducing the temperature, e.g., by dissipating heat.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The maximum force that can be generated on the transport unit TE (both in the movement direction and in the vertical direction) can be influenced, for example, by the maximum coil current that can be applied to the drive coils ASi (which is essentially limited by the power electronics) and/or by the coil geometry and the number of windings. The accuracy of the positioning of the transport unit TE can be influenced, for example, by the size of the coil pitch TASi. The coil pitch TASi designates the distance between adjacent drive coils ASi, usually between the coil axes, as indicated by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>on the drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b>. From this, it can be seen that there is a wealth of parameters with which the efficiency &#x3bc;Hi of the movement of the transport unit TE, the maximum force that can be generated on the transport unit TE and/or the positional accuracy of the movement of the transport unit TE can be influenced. Of course, it would be possible to try to optimize all or the highest possible number of the coil properties of the drive coils ASi influencing the magnetic field and the magnetic properties of the drive magnets <b>4</b> influencing the magnetic field. However, this is often not possible or desirable, e.g., for reasons of cost efficiency. For cost reasons, for example, it can be advantageous to use coils of identical design for the drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b> and the drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b>, which means that, for example, in the case of different average coil spacings S<b>1</b>&#x2260;S<b>2</b> of the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b>, the result would be an essentially automatic difference in efficiency. In the following, using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>, different average coil spacings S<b>1</b>&#x2260;S<b>2</b> of the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b> will be addressed, wherein the remaining coil properties influencing the magnetic field and the magnetic properties influencing the magnetic field are uniform in both main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b> are spaced apart from the first magnet group MGa in the normal direction (in this case in the Z-direction) on the transport plane <b>3</b> at an average first coil spacing S<b>1</b>, and the drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b> are spaced apart from the second magnet group MGb, relative to the average first coil spacing Si, at a greater average second coils spacing S<b>2</b> in the normal direction on the transport plane <b>3</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>.

A basic distinction is made between a so-called 1D arrangement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>f</i></figref>) and a 2D arrangement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>). In the 1D arrangement, as already described in detail, at least one first magnet group MGa with a plurality of drive magnets <b>4</b> for the first main movement direction H<b>1</b> (in this case X-axis) and at least one second magnet group MGb with a plurality of drive magnets <b>4</b> for the second main movement direction H<b>2</b> (in this case Y-axis) are provided. The magnet groups MGa, MGb each have a specific number of drive magnets <b>4</b>, in particular permanent magnets, arranged one behind the other in a specific arrangement direction (in this case MGa in the X-direction and MGb in the Y-direction). Adjacent drive magnets <b>4</b> have a different magnetization direction. For example, the magnetization direction of adjacent drive magnets <b>4</b> can be rotated by 180&#xb0; to one another, i.e., alternating magnetic north and south poles, as indicated by the shaded and not shaded drive magnets <b>4</b>. As mentioned above, the drive magnets <b>4</b> of a magnet group MGi can also be arranged in the known Halbach arrangement, wherein a drive magnet <b>4</b> with a magnetization direction rotated by 90&#xb0; is provided, for example, between drive magnets <b>4</b> with opposite magnetization directions (north pole, south pole). The Halbach arrangement has the advantage that the magnetic flux on one side of the magnet group MGi (preferably on the side facing the transport plane <b>3</b>) is greater than on the opposite side. A particularly advantageous, sinusoidal magnetic field image of the magnetic field of a magnet group MGi can be achieved if the respective outermost drive magnets <b>4</b> of the magnet group MGi have a reduced, in particular half the magnet width MBi than the interjacent drive magnets <b>4</b> of the magnet group MGi, as is shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The Halbach arrangement is known in the prior art and therefore no further details are provided at this point.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">In the 2D arrangement, individual drive magnets <b>4</b> with different magnetization directions are arranged on the transport unit TE essentially in the manner of a chessboard. The drive magnets <b>4</b> with different magnetization directions are arranged alternately and offset in two arrangement directions (in this case X- and Y-direction). The two directions are preferably oriented to one another in the same way as the two main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>, i.e., they are, for example, perpendicular to one another. It is immediately apparent that there is a large number of different options for the arrangement, wherein the most common variants of the 1D arrangement are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>f </i></figref>and the most common variants of the 2D arrangement are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>. In the 2D arrangement, the first magnet group MGa corresponds to the drive magnets <b>4</b> arranged alternately in one direction (e.g., in the X-direction) and the second magnet group MGb corresponds to the drive magnets <b>4</b> arranged alternately in the respective other direction (e.g., in the Y-direction). The magnet groups MGa, MGb are therefore not separate in the 2D arrangement, as in the 1D arrangement, but the drive magnets <b>4</b> are both part of the first magnet groups MGa and part of the second magnet groups MGb.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">For example, in order to achieve different efficiencies &#x3bc;H<b>1</b>, &#x3bc;H<b>2</b> and/or different maximum forces and/or different positioning accuracy of the transport unit TE in a &#x201c;single-layer&#x201d; arrangement of the coil groups SG<b>1</b>, SG<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>+<b>2</b><i>b</i>) on a transport segment <b>2</b> (with otherwise identical coil properties of the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b> influencing the magnetic field), the magnetic properties of the drive magnets <b>4</b> of the transport unit TE influencing the magnetic field can also be changed, as already mentioned. For example, one option provides that the pole pitch Ta of the first magnet group(s) MGa differs from the pole pitch Tb of the second magnet group(s) MGb, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d</i></figref>+<b>3</b><i>f </i>for the 1D arrangement and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c</i></figref>+<b>4</b><i>d </i>for the 2D arrangement.

This is advantageous because the magnetic field generated by the drive magnets <b>4</b> penetrates further into the transport segment <b>2</b> with increasing pole pitch Ti in the Z-direction. Therefore, the magnet group MGi with the greater pole pitch Ti interacts more efficiently with the drive coils ASi of the more distant coil group SGi.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">As initially mentioned, attempts have been made in the prior art to compensate for the difference in efficiency between the two main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> in order to achieve main movement directions that are as equivalent as possible in terms of the available electromagnetic force. However, in the case of the present invention, the difference in efficiency between the two main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> is used in a targeted manner, as will be explained in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">In order to maintain the air gap L, i.e., the state of levitation of the transport unit TE, it is necessary that the levitation force FS (which is generated by the electromagnetic interaction of the drive coils AS<b>1</b> with the drive magnets <b>4</b> of the first magnet group(s) MGa and the drive coils AS<b>2</b> with the drive magnets <b>4</b> of the second magnet group(s) MGb) opposing gravitation compensates for the weight force FG of the transport unit TE plus any constant process forces FP (in the gravitational direction). Depending on the installation situation of the transport segment <b>2</b> of the transport device <b>1</b>, the levitation force FS does however not necessarily act in the normal direction on the transport plane <b>3</b> of the transport segment <b>2</b>. as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>to <b>5</b><i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">In a horizontal installation situation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>), the levitation force FS acts normal to the transport plane <b>3</b> of the transport segment <b>2</b> (in this case, vertically in the direction of the Z-axis); in a vertical installation situation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c </i>to <b>5</b><i>e</i></figref>), the levitation force FS acts substantially parallel to the transport plane <b>3</b> of the transport segment <b>2</b>.

In addition, the transport segment <b>2</b> is rotated at an angle of rotation &#x3b3; with respect to the vertical axis normal to the transport plane <b>3</b>, in this case the Z-axis, wherein the angle of rotation &#x3b3; is measured between the lower side of the rectangular, in particular square, transport plane <b>3</b> and the horizontal plane. The levitation force FS is divided into a force component FSx in the X-direction (which also corresponds to the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> in this case) and a force component FSy in the Y-direction (which also corresponds to the second main direction of movement H<b>2</b> in this case). The same of course also applies to the case of an inclination (not shown) of the transport segment <b>2</b> at an angle of inclination &#x3b2; with respect to the X-axis and an additional rotation at an angle of rotation &#x3b3; about the Z-axis.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">In the example according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>e</i></figref>, the transport segment <b>2</b> is aligned in the same way as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>d</i></figref>. In addition, however, the transport unit TE is rotated at a relative angle &#x3c6; with respect to the transport segment <b>2</b> about the vertical axis (Z-axis), which is normal to the transport plane <b>3</b>. This changes the properties that influence the magnetic field of the drive magnets <b>4</b> interacting with the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b> of the two coil groups SG<b>1</b>, SG<b>2</b>.

Depending on the coil properties of the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b> that affect the magnetic field and the magnetic properties of the drive magnets <b>4</b> that affect the magnetic field, a rotation of the transport unit TE by a relative angle &#x3c6; could also result in the main directions of movement H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> being reversed, for example H<b>2</b> in the X-direction and H<b>1</b> in the Y-direction, where &#x3bc;H<b>1</b>&#x3e;&#x3bc;H<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">In general, if the transport segment <b>2</b> is in a position that deviates from the horizontal at an angle of inclination &#x3b1; with respect to the Y-axis and/or an angle of inclination &#x3b2; with respect the X-axis and/or an angle of rotation &#x3b3; about the Z-axis, this produces corresponding components of the levitation force FS, FSH<b>1</b> in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> (in this case, FSx in the X-direction), FSH<b>2</b> in the second main direction of movement H<b>2</b> (in this case, FSy in the Y-direction), and FSz in the Z-direction in accordance with the angles &#x3b1;, &#x3b2;, &#x3b3;. The levitation force FS thus compensates for the weight force FG caused by the mass of the transport unit TE and a force component of any process force FP in the gravitational direction, which is generated, for example, by a transported object O, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>, and/or which is generated by a work process acting on the transport unit TE, which work process is carried out in a process station (not shown) of the transport device <b>1</b>. Due to the levitation force FS, the position of the transport unit TE relative to the transport segment <b>2</b> can thus be kept constant during operation. As initially mentioned, a specific movement of the transport unit TE in the vertical direction (in this case in the Z-direction) can also take place, which can be achieved by appropriate control of the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">The force component FSz of the levitation force FS normal to the transport plane <b>3</b>, in this case in the Z-direction (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>), can generally be applied both by the drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b> and by the drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b>. The force component FSH<b>1</b> of the levitation force FS in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> (in this case, FSx in the X-direction) is generally only applied by the drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b> for an inclination of the transport segment <b>2</b> at an angle &#x3b1; about the Y-axis (for example, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>).

The same naturally also applies to an inclination with respect to the X-axis and/or the Y-axis, and an additional rotation of the transport segment <b>2</b> by an angle of rotation &#x3b3; about the vertical axis, in this case the Z-axis.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">In an asymmetrically designed transport segment <b>2</b> with a first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> with an efficiency &#x3bc;H<b>1</b> and a second main direction of movement H<b>2</b> with a relatively lower efficiency pH2&#x3c;&#x3bc;H<b>1</b> (and/or with a higher maximum force in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> relative to the second main direction of movement H<b>2</b>), in order to achieve an operation which is as efficient as possible, it is provided according to the invention that a force component of a loading force acting on the transport unit TE during operation of the transport device <b>1</b> is greater in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> than a force component of the loading force FB in the second main direction of movement H<b>2</b>. The loading force at least includes the transport unit gravitational force FG of the transport unit TE.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">However, the loading force FB can also include the process force FP, wherein the process force FP in turn can comprise an object weight force of an object O that can be transported with the transport unit TE and/or a work process force acting at least temporarily during a work process on the transport unit TE. For example, at least one process station (not shown) for carrying out a work process on the transport unit TE or on an object O that can be transported with the transport unit TE could be provided in the transport device <b>1</b>, wherein a work process force can act as part of the process force FP at least temporarily while the work process is being carried out the transport unit TE. The work process force can of course act on the transport unit TE in any direction in space, whereas the object weight force acts in the direction of gravitation. It can therefore be advantageous for the transport segment <b>2</b> to be arranged relative to the process station in such a way that the loading force lies predominantly in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b>. In general, the loading force corresponds to a vector sum of the process force FP and the gravitational force FG of the transport unit TE, with the process force FP containing the work process force and/or the object weight force.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">Preferably, when the transport segment <b>2</b> is in a non-horizontal position, the inclination of the transport segment <b>2</b> is set such that the force component of the loading force FB in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> is at least 5% greater than the force component of the loading force FB in the second main direction of movement H<b>2</b>, preferably at least 10% greater, more preferably at least 20% greater. For example, the inclination of the transport segment <b>2</b> can be set so that the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> is at an angle of 90&#xb0;&#xb1;45&#xb0; to the horizontal, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c</i></figref>, in which the transport segment <b>2</b> is tilted at an angle &#x3b1;=90&#xb0; from the horizontal with respect to the Y-axis.

The inclination (angle &#x3b1;, &#x3b2;, &#x3b3;) of the transport segment <b>2</b> is advantageously set in such a way that the force component FSH<b>1</b> of the levitation force FS in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> is at least 5%, preferably at least 10%, particularly preferably at least 20% greater than the force component FSH<b>2</b> of the levitation force FS in the second main direction of movement H<b>1</b>. The efficiency of the operation of the transport device <b>1</b> can thus increase at least up to a certain degree in proportion to how much greater the force component FSH<b>1</b> of the levitation force FS in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> is relative to the force component FSH<b>2</b> of the levitation force FS in the second main direction of movement H<b>2</b>. If the levitation force FS lies completely in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b>, this corresponds, for example, to the arrangement according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c</i></figref>, that is an inclination of the transport segment <b>2</b> at an angle of inclination &#x3b1;=90&#xb0; only with respect to the Y-axis. However, the ohmic losses of the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b>, which occur during operation of the transport device <b>1</b> and which are proportional to the square of the electrical coil currents, must also be taken into account. If, for example, all or almost all of the levitation force FS is applied by the drive coils AS<b>1</b> in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> (such as in the arrangement according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c</i></figref>), then the coil currents in the drive coils AS<b>1</b> are relatively high compared to the coil currents in the drive coils AS<b>2</b> in the second main direction of movement H<b>2</b>. This can mean that although the loading force FB substantially acts entirely in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b>, the efficiency of the transport device <b>1</b> cannot be increased, or can only be increased to a small extent, because the ohmic losses in the drive coils ASi increase disproportionately. For the most efficient possible operation of the transport device, it can therefore be advantageous to fix the inclination of the transport segment <b>2</b> in favor of the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b>, but only to a certain extent. From this it can be seen that the definition of an advantageous inclination of the transport segment <b>2</b> also depends on the specific structural configuration of the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">The specification of a specific inclination is therefore at the discretion of the person skilled in the art, depending on the application.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">A further advantageous embodiment of the transport device <b>1</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> in a plan view of the transport plane <b>3</b>.

Analogous to the example according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b> of the first and second coil groups SG<b>1</b>, SG<b>2</b> in the example shown are each designed as elongated coils with a longitudinal extension LAS<b>1</b>, LAS<b>2</b> and a transverse extension QAS<b>1</b>, QAS<b>2</b> perpendicular and relatively smaller thereto. In order to achieve different coil properties influencing the magnetic field, the drive coils AS<b>1</b> of the first coil group SG<b>1</b> can be closer to the transport plane <b>3</b> in the normal direction to the transport plane <b>3</b> (in this case in the Z-direction) than the drive coils AS<b>2</b> of the second coil group SG<b>2</b>. The first main movement direction H<b>1</b> thus runs orthogonally to the longitudinal extension LAS<b>1</b> of the first drive coils AS<b>1</b>, in this case normal to the first edge K<b>1</b> of the transport segments <b>2</b>. The second main movement direction H<b>2</b> runs orthogonally to the longitudinal extension LAS<b>2</b> of the second drive coils AS<b>2</b>, in this case normal to the second edge K<b>2</b> of the transport segments <b>2</b>. In the example shown, the second main movement direction H<b>2</b> consequently runs at a rhombus angle &#x3c9; to the first main movement direction H<b>1</b>. The rhombus shape can advantageously be provided for the case when a desired angle between the main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> is less than 90&#xb0;. This would be equally possible with a rectangular shape of the transport segment <b>2</b> (e.g., according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>) but for this purpose, the drive coils AS<b>1</b>, AS<b>2</b> of at least one main movement direction H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> would have to be arranged such that their longitudinal extension no longer runs parallel to the edge of the rectangular transport plane <b>3</b>, which would be structurally more complex.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">First magnet groups MGa and second magnet groups MGb, each with a plurality of drive magnets <b>4</b> of different magnetic orientation, are once again arranged on the transport unit TE. The drive magnets <b>4</b> can be arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> in the form of a 1D arrangement with a plurality of elongated drive magnets <b>4</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>f</i></figref>). Of course, a 2D arrangement with a chessboard-like arrangement of drive magnets <b>4</b> would also be possible (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>). The 1D and 2D arrangement has already been described in detail and therefore no further details are provided at this point. In the example according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the first magnet groups MGa are preferably arranged such that the longitudinal direction of the drive magnets <b>4</b> of the first magnet group MGa runs as normal as possible to the first main movement direction H<b>1</b>. Analogously, the second magnet groups MGb are preferably arranged such that the longitudinal direction of the drive magnets <b>4</b> of the second magnet groups MGb runs as normal as possible to the second main movement direction H<b>2</b>. Of course, the movement of the transport unit TE, in particular due to a rotation of the transport unit TE about the vertical axis (in this case the Z-axis), can in turn result in deviations which, e.g., can lead to a reduction in the efficiencies &#x3bc;H<b>1</b>, &#x3bc;H<b>2</b> of the two main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>, as has already been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>e</i></figref>. However, if the magnet groups MGa, MGb have the same magnetic properties influencing the magnetic field, the assignment of the two main movement directions H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b> does not change.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">The arrangement of the transport segments <b>2</b> according to the invention, which has already been described in detail, of course also applies to the example of an embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, which is why a detailed description is not included at this point. The stator consisting of the four transport segments <b>2</b> is therefore preferably arranged in a position that deviates from a horizontal position, such that a force component of the loading force FB acting on the transport unit TE during operation of the transport device <b>1</b> is greater in the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> than a force component of the loading force FB in the second main direction of movement H<b>2</b>. If the loading force FB includes, for example, only the gravitational force FG of the transport unit TE and, if applicable, the object weight force of a transported object O, the transport segments <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> could, for example, be arranged in such a way that the first main direction of movement H<b>1</b> is at an angle of 90&#xb0;&#xb1;45&#xb0; with respect to the horizontal. If the loading force also includes a work process force, another advantageous arrangement of the transport segments <b>2</b> can of course also be produced, according to the magnitude and direction of the work process force.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230006529A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="11.60mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230006529A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
