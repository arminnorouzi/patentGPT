Then, the battery is held loosely between two clamps of a testing machine, one of the clamp being movable to bend the battery. Next, the first edge, the second edge, the third edge and the fourth edge of the battery are bent to and fro up to 250 times at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. The battery can be bent using the device at an angle ranging from 45 degrees to 60 degrees.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, it is not common in the battery exposed to repeated bending of high frequency in practical applications. Therefore, the described test method does not accurately and properly simulate a common condition when the battery is subjected to bending force, and cannot reasonably evaluate the safety performance in practical applications, thus failing to meet expectations of the safety test.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Another method is further provided by the existing art. Two metal blocks are placed horizontally, on which Teflon tapes are applied; the battery is tightly wrapped with Teflon bands followed by being placed between the two metal blocks to ensure that the battery does not slide between the blocks. Then, the battery is pressed vertically downward by using a pressing head.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">However, the applicant found that the battery clamped with metal blocks applied with Teflon bands could not be held securely. During the practical testing process, the battery and the metal blocks slide over each other easily, and thus the test cannot run smoothly. Moreover, the contact edges between the metal blocks and the battery are seamed edges that are likely to render the battery bearing a shear force, which does not conform to the practical condition of the battery. In addition, because the battery is pressed downward along a direction perpendicular to the horizontal plane according to the existing test methods, the control over the battery only provides a bending angle of a small range from about 45 degrees to 60 degrees. If a greater range of the bending angle is desired to achieve, such as about 0 degree to 90 degrees, or about 0 degree to 120 degrees, or about 0 degree to 180 degrees, it is difficult to attain with existing test methods or systems. Furthermore, the accurate control over the bending angle and bending morphology of the battery is not achievable with two described methods.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In view of the above, the embodiments of the present application provide a novel battery bending test system and method by which the battery is bendable to a predetermined angle, or subjected to a predetermined pressure, or can achieve a predetermined displacement, so that precise control over the bending angle, displacement of the battery, and pressure exerted thereon are achieved to effectively and reasonably evaluate the safety performance of the battery based on a feasible battery bending test. In addition, by virtue of the system provided by the embodiments of the application, the battery can be firmly held to prevent the battery and the fastening device from sliding over each other during the testing process, and thus the test can be conducted more conveniently and efficiently. Further, by means of the system provided by the embodiments of the present application, the battery can bend at an angle ranging from about 0 degree to 180 degrees instead of being limited to about 45 degrees to 60 degrees.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic perspective view showing a battery bending test system <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a top view showing the battery along a Z direction of the battery bending test system <b>10</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic lateral view showing the battery bending test system <b>10</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, which illustrates a state of the battery bending test system <b>10</b> without holding the battery. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic lateral view showing the battery bending test system <b>10</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, which illustrates a state of the battery bending test system <b>10</b> when holding the battery. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic enlargement view of portion A-A of the battery bending test system <b>10</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic perspective view showing the fastening device of the battery bending test system <b>10</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.
