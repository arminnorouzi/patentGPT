More particularly, the present disclosure provides a method for enabling user-preferred trick-play mode based at least on attributes of a content item.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Consuming content using trick-play mode, e.g., at faster or slower speeds than normal playback speed, can be seen widely among content consumers. Most content platforms, e.g., YouTube, Netflix, etc., provide trick-play experiences for content consumers. For example, today, users can fast-forward, skip through segments, jump to specific chapters (if chapter metadata is available), play the video at a faster speed, e.g., 1.5&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, etc., or play the video at a slower speed, e.g., 0.75&#xd7;. Typically, conventional trick-play modes are made available on content platforms in a unified manner, resulting in a singular user experience, with the same trick-play mode applied for all the types of content, regardless of content type or genre, for example. Many video OTT services, e.g., Netflix, and video-sharing platforms, e.g., YouTube, seek to provide users with a personalized experience and control over the content, e.g., on-demand or pre-recorded content, consumed by users.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While conventional trick-play modes provide users with visual feedback, e.g., the low resolution frames or thumbnails of the content item, as the content is subjected to a trick-play operation, there is typically no indication of context around attributes of the content item, or segments, that is subjected to the trick-play operation. Thus, it may be beneficial for a user to experience different trick-play modes based on the content being consumed by the user. Furthermore, the user may wish to experience personalized trick-play modes based on the content being consumed. Thus, in view of the foregoing, methods and systems are disclosed herein for enabling user-preferred trick-play modes based on the attributes of content items and user preferences with respect to trick-play modes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to a first aspect, a method is provided for presenting a content item using one or more trick-play modes. The method comprises a step of receiving a master playlist for a content item comprising a plurality of segments, the master playlist comprising trick-play mode identifiers associated with corresponding segment identifiers (e.g., references via URLs to individual content item segments). The method further comprises a step of determining, based on the trick-play mode identifiers and the corresponding segment identifiers, respective trick-play modes made available for the segments based on at least one of a user preference or attributes of the segments and a step of generating the segments of the content item for presentation at a computing device by using the respective determined trick-play modes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the trick-play mode identifiers comprise any one or more of seek-based trick-play mode identifier; hop-based trick-play mode identifier; frame-based trick-play mode identifier; and thumbnail-based trick-play mode identifier.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the respective trick-play modes are made available for the segments further based on metadata associated with the content item.

For example, it may be a stand-alone application wholly implemented on user equipment device <b>100</b>. In such an approach, instructions for the application are stored locally (e.g., in storage <b>108</b>), and data for use by the application is downloaded on a periodic basis (e.g., from an out-of-band feed, from an Internet resource, or using another suitable approach). Control circuitry <b>104</b> may retrieve instructions for the application from storage <b>108</b> and process the instructions to generate any of the displays discussed herein. Based on the processed instructions, control circuitry <b>104</b> may determine what action to perform when input is received from input interface <b>110</b>.

Data for use by a thick or thin client implemented on user equipment device <b>100</b> is retrieved on demand by issuing requests to a server remote from the user equipment device <b>100</b>. In one example of a client/server-based guidance application, control circuitry <b>104</b> runs a web browser that interprets web pages provided by a remote server. For example, the remote server may store the instructions for the application in a storage device.

This way, the processing of the instructions is performed remotely by the server while the resulting displays are provided locally on equipment device <b>100</b>. Equipment device <b>100</b> may receive inputs from the user via input interface <b>110</b> and transmit those inputs to the remote server for processing and generating the corresponding displays. For example, equipment device <b>100</b> may transmit a communication to the remote server indicating that an up/down button was selected via input interface <b>110</b>. The remote server may process instructions in accordance with that input and generate a display of the application corresponding to the input (e.g., a display that moves using a cursor up/down). The generated display is then transmitted to equipment device <b>100</b> for presentation to the user.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is downloaded and interpreted or otherwise run by an interpreter or virtual machine (run by control circuitry <b>104</b>).

The media guidance application may have the same layout on various different types of user equipment or may be tailored to the display capabilities of the user equipment. For example, on user computer equipment <b>304</b>, the guidance application may be provided as a website accessed by a web browser.

Content source <b>316</b> may also include a remote media server used to store different types of content (including video content selected by a user), in a location remote from any of the user equipment devices. Systems and methods for remote storage of content, and providing remotely stored content to user equipment, are discussed in greater detail in connection with Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,761,892, issued Jul. 20, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A media guidance data source may also be provided that provides media guidance data, such as the media guidance data described above. Media guidance data may be provided to the user equipment devices using any suitable approach. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be a stand-alone interactive television program guide that receives program guide data via a data feed (e.g., a continuous feed or trickle feed). Program schedule data and other guidance data may be provided to the user equipment on a television channel sideband, using an in-band digital signal, an out-of-band digital signal, or any other suitable data transmission technique. Program schedule data and other media guidance data may be provided to user equipment on multiple analog or digital television channels.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Media guidance applications may be, for example, stand-alone applications implemented on user equipment devices. For example, the media guidance application may be implemented as software or a set of executable instructions, which may be stored in storage <b>108</b> and executed by control circuitry <b>104</b> of a user equipment device <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, media guidance applications may be client/server applications where only a client application resides on the user equipment device, and server application resides on a remote server. For example, media guidance applications may be implemented partially as a client application on control circuitry <b>104</b> of user equipment device <b>100</b> and partially on a remote server as a server application running on control circuitry of the remote server (not separately shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). When executed by control circuitry of the remote server, the media guidance application may instruct the control circuitry to generate the guidance application displays and transmit the generated displays to the user equipment devices.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Content and/or media guidance data delivered to user equipment devices <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, and <b>306</b> may be over-the-top (OTT) content. OTT content delivery allows Internet-enabled user devices, including any user equipment device described above, to receive content that is transferred over the Internet, including any content described above, in addition to content received over cable or satellite connections. OTT content is delivered via an Internet connection provided by an Internet service provider (ISP), but a third party distributes the content. The ISP may not be responsible for the viewing abilities, copyrights, or redistribution of the content, and may only transfer IP packets provided by the OTT content provider. Examples of OTT content providers include YOUTUBE, NETFLIX, and HULU, which provide audio and video via IP packets. YouTube is a trademark owned by Google Inc.; Netflix is a trademark owned by Netflix Inc.; and Hulu is a trademark owned by Hulu, LLC. In addition to content and/or media guidance data, providers of OTT content can distribute media guidance applications (e.g., web-based applications or cloud-based applications), or the content can be displayed by media guidance applications stored on the user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Media guidance system <b>300</b> is intended to illustrate various approaches, or network configurations, by which user equipment devices and sources of content and guidance data may communicate with each other for the purpose of accessing content and providing media guidance. The embodiments described herein may be applied in any approach that does not deviate from the teachings of this disclosure, for example in a system employing an approach for delivering content and providing media guidance.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an example approach, user equipment devices may operate in a cloud computing environment to access cloud services. In a cloud computing environment, various types of computing services for content sharing, storage or distribution (e.g., video sharing sites or social networking sites) are provided by a collection of network-accessible computing and storage resources, referred to as &#x201c;the cloud.&#x201d; For example, the cloud can include a collection of server computing devices, which may be located centrally or at distributed locations, that provide cloud-based services to various types of users and devices connected via a network such as the Internet via communications network <b>314</b>. These cloud resources may include one or more content sources and one or more media guidance data sources and one or more databases. In addition or in the alternative, the remote computing sites may include other user equipment devices, such as user television equipment <b>302</b>, user computer equipment <b>304</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>306</b>. For example, the other user equipment devices may provide access to a stored copy of a video or a streamed video.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The cloud provides access to services, such as content storage, content sharing, or social networking services, among other examples, as well as access to any content described above, for user equipment devices. Services can be provided in the cloud through cloud computing service providers, or through other providers of online services. For example, the cloud-based services can include a content storage service, a content sharing site, a social networking site, or other services via which user-sourced content is distributed for viewing by others on connected devices. These cloud-based services may allow a user equipment device to store content to the cloud and to receive content from the cloud rather than storing content locally and accessing locally stored content.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Cloud resources may be accessed by a user equipment device using, for example, a web browser, a media guidance application, a desktop application, a mobile application, and/or any combination of access applications. The user equipment device may be a cloud client that relies on cloud computing for application delivery, or the user equipment device may have some functionality without access to cloud resources. For example, some applications running on the user equipment device may be cloud applications, i.e., applications delivered as a service over the Internet, while other applications may be stored and run on the user equipment device. In some embodiments, a user device may receive content from multiple cloud resources simultaneously. For example, a user device can stream audio from one cloud resource while downloading content from a second cloud resource. Or a user device can download content from multiple cloud resources for more efficient downloading. In some embodiments, user equipment devices can use cloud resources for processing operations such as the processing operations performed by processing circuitry described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Various trick-play mode identifiers are available in conventional systems. Typically, a dedicated trick-play mode is commonly defined by content platforms or based on content devices. Some examples of trick-play modes currently available to users include, for example, seek-based trick-play mode, hop-based trick-play mode, frame-based trick-play mode and thumbnail-based trick-play mode.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a seek-based approach, as the user commands, e.g., via a user interface, a trick-play operation, the image frame of the content item is moved to a predetermined position in the content item being consumed. For example, the video playlist of the content item may jump every 20 seconds during a fast-forward operation, displaying the respective image frame of the content item during the trick-play operation. In a hop-based approach, as the user commands the trick-play operation, the image frame of the video playlist at a current playback position is maintained, e.g., as a still image, and the time bar is moved during the trick-play operation. In a frame-based approach, as the user commands the trick-play operation, subsequent image frames of the content item are displayed at predefined intervals, e.g., using I-frames, during the trick-play operation. In a thumbnail-based approach, as the user commands the trick-play operation, smaller resolution frames of the content item are generated and made available for display for the user during the trick-play operation. It will be appreciated that other forms of trick-play modes may also be available to the user. Furthermore, enhanced trick-play modes may also be available to the user, which will be described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Many video OTT service platforms, e.g., Netflix, and video-sharing platforms, e.g., YouTube, provide users with control over the content, e.g., on-demand content or prerecorded content, being consumed by the user. For example, users may skip scenes or segments, jump to specific chapters (if chapter metadata is available), play the video at a faster speed by fast-forwarding the content, e.g., 1.5&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, etc., or play the video at a slower speed, e.g., 0.75&#xd7;.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Typically, one of the above-mentioned trick-play modes is made available for a content item resulting in a unified user experience, with the trick-play mode being applied to all content types provided by a content platform or video-sharing platform, for example. While conventionally trick-play modes provide users with visual feedback, e.g., the low-resolution frames or thumbnails of the content item, as the content is subjected to a trick-play operation, there is typically no indication of context around attributes of the content item or segments that are subjected to the trick-play operation. Thus, it may be beneficial for a user to experience different trick-play modes based on the content being consumed by the user.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In view of the foregoing, the present disclosure proposes a method for enabling user-preferred trick-play mode based at least on attributes of a content item. In example embodiments, methods and systems are provided for varying the user experience with respect to trick-play operation. For example, the user experience may vary based on attributes of the content being consumed or based on a combination of content and computing device. For example, for educational content, or other conversation-based content, the user may wish to experience seek-based trick play, as it may be unnecessary to go through every frame during trick-play operation. In another example, for sports content, or other fast-paced content, the user may wish to experience thumbnail-based trick-play mode as the user may wish to visually experience the flow of the content even during trick-play operation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the system may determine, at a server, for a content item comprising a plurality of segments, content attributes, e.g., a content classification, associated with the content item or associated with each of the segments of the content item. For example, content attributes may be associated with the genre, topic, length, and/or parental rating associated with the content item, or segments thereof. In some embodiments, the system may determine content attributes based on content identification or image analysis, for example. In some embodiments, the system may determine content attributes associated with each of the segments based on metadata available for each of the segments. For example, metadata of scenes may be readily available, e.g., via dedicated JSON files, or generated in substantially realtime based on content identification or image analysis, e.g., analysis of frames in an I-frame playlist or the full frames of the content item. Typically, full frames comprise more metadata associated with the content item, enabling analysis of image frames as well as audio segments, for example. Similarly, in some embodiments, the content item or segments of the content item may be summarized based on parsing the closed caption text, or other timed-text data.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, the system may determine, at the server, a trick-play mode for the content item. In some embodiments, the system may determine, at the server, trick-play modes for segments of the content item. In some embodiments, the trick-play modes may be any of seek-based trick-play mode, hop-based trick-play mode, frame-based trick-play mode, or thumbnail-based trick-play mode. It will be appreciated that any other suitable trick-play mode may also be available for the user based on attributes of the content item.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, trick-play modes may be determined based at least on the content attributes. In some embodiments, trick-play modes may be determined further or solely based on a user preference of one or more trick-play modes, e.g., based on attributes of content items. For example, user preferences may be determined based on user profile information. For example, the user may provide, manually, an indication, e.g., via user preference settings, that thumbnail-based trick-play mode be made available for sports content regardless of the device type used for consuming the content. In another example, the user may indicate that thumbnail-based trick-play mode is preferred for all sports content and that frame-based trick-play mode is preferred for all other types of content, for example. In yet another example, the user may indicate a preference to consume horror films in trick-play mode being a seek-based trick-play mode and animation films in trick-play mode being a thumbnail-based trick-play mode.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, trick-play modes may be determined further based on metadata associated with the content item. For example, the metadata associated with the content item may be closed-caption text or other timed-text data.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, trick-play modes are determined further based on the user device. For example, as well as by content attributes or segment attributes, trick-play modes may be determined further based on the size of the computing device. For example, a sports content item being consumed on a 4K TV may be associated with thumbnail-based trick-play mode, whereas the same sports content item being consumed on a mobile phone may be provided with frame-based trick-play mode, as thumbnail-based trick-play mode may be redundant due to the screen size of the mobile device, for example.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an illustration of an example master playlist, master playlist <b>1</b>, <b>402</b>, for a content item having a trick-play mode associated with a video playlist of the master playlist, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the master playlist comprises at least a video playlist <b>406</b> comprising one or more bitrate variants, such as bitrate variants <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>412</b>. In some embodiments, the master playlist may further comprise an audio playlist <b>404</b>. Furthermore, the one or more bitrate variants, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>, and <b>412</b>, may comprise video playlist segments or segment identifiers, such as segment identifiers <b>414</b>, <b>416</b>, <b>418</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>422</b> for each segment of the content item. In some embodiments, a trick-play mode identifier may be associated with the video playlist of the master playlist. In order to provide users with different trick-play modes for different content items based on their content attributes, a master playlist may be provided comprising the trick-play mode identifier for that content item, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an illustration of an example master playlist, master playlist <b>2</b>, <b>502</b>, for a content item having trick-play mode identifiers associated with segment identifiers, such as segment identifiers <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, of each bitrate variant of the video playlist, such as bitrate variants <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, in some embodiments, a trick-play mode may be made available for each segment identifier of a master playlist. In some examples, although different content items may be provided with different playlists of trick modes, based on the determined attributes of each content item, each content item may also be provided with varying trick modes. For example, a content item may be provided with different trick-modes based on the bitrate variant of the master playlist. In another example, a content item may contain different types of content, e.g., a soccer match comprising two halves of the match and a half-time panel interview with hosts of a particular program. In such an example, the content item may be provided with different types of trick modes for the different portions or segments of the content item, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, when a user consumes a recording of a soccer match, the user may wish to experience a thumbnail-based trick-play operation for the first and second halves of the soccer match since they are fast-paced. On the other hand, during the half-time interval of the soccer match, as the content becomes conversational (as typically panel discussions are had during this time), the user may wish to experience a frame-based trick-play operation. Therefore, based on the content and the user preferences, for example, the trick-play mode made available for the content item may vary portion by portion as well by individual content items, thereby providing a dynamic variation of trick-play modes, e.g., based on image analysis or content identification, or in some examples, based on an analysis of closed-caption text-timed files.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows a flowchart of illustrative steps involved in an example method for enabling a user-preferred trick-play mode based on a content item, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

The user device includes both a video output device (e.g., an integrated screen or a port through which video data can be sent to an external display) and an audio output device (e.g., one or more integrated speakers or a port through which audio data can be sent to an external speaker or headphones). Video and audio of &#x201c;Family Guy&#x201d; are thus output by the user device. The user device may also receive commands from a user input device or user interface (e.g., touchscreen user interface). The media device may receive a command from the user to initiate a trick-play operation in a trick-play mode, e.g., based on a determined trick-play mode identifier. In some embodiments, when performing the requested trick-play operation, a visual playback status indicator may indicate that a trick-play operation is currently being executed. During the trick-play operation, the user device or server may identify one or more segments that will be subjected to the trick-play operation and plays back an audio portion or audio description at normal speed, or displays a textual description or a still image associated with the one or more segments of the content item being subjected to the trick-play operation.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some embodiments, the user device may display a textual description of the content item, e.g., a portion of timed-text data or a textual description summarizing the segments of the content item subjected to the trick-play operation. For example, the user device may display the textual description based on the significance or importance of each segment of the content item subjected to trick-play operation, e.g., based on content identification and knowledge of timed-text data. For example, the user device may access metadata of the content item being displayed on the user device, which describes the content item, e.g., timed-text data, and, based on textual or any other form of analysis, determine each segment's importance with respect to the content item.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">For example, as the user commands a fast-forwarding operation, in thumbnail-based trick-play mode, through a content item, the text description may be displayed above the low-resolution thumbnails. In some embodiments, the textual description may include a summary associated with the low-resolution thumbnails displayed during the trick-play operation. For example, one or more topics may be associated with segments of the content item subjected to trick-play operation, e.g., a group of low resolution frames (typically 1 frame/second). Therefore, the trick-play operation may be titled for the group of low resolution frames with the topic or provided with textual description of the segments subjected to the trick-play operation.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">For example, in a scene of &#x201c;Family Guy&#x201d; in which Stewie Griffin and Brian Griffin discuss Stewie's plan to go back in time using the time travel machine that Stewie has rebuilt, Stewie tells Brian that &#x201c;I need this machine to alter the past for the better.&#x201d; The user device may determine a suitable description or summary of the scene, such as &#x201c;Stewie has rebuilt his time machine&#x201d; because of its significance to the segment of the particular episode of &#x201c;Family Guy.&#x201d; The user device may therefore display the textual description or summary associated with the segment of significance while continuing to play back the video at the speed of the trick-play operation.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some examples, the description could also be in the form of audio, e.g., representing a character's voice, which may be pre-recorded or segmented from the content item, that outputs, e.g., via the output circuitry, an audio description or summary of the segments subjected to the trick-play operation. In some embodiments, the user device may play back a clip of the content item, e.g., with audio at normal speed. For example, the user device may select which clips or portions of audio to play back at normal speed based on the significance or importance of each portion. For example, the user device or server may access metadata of the content item being displayed on the user device, which describes the audio content, e.g., timed-text data, and, based on textual or any other form of analysis, determine each segment's importance with respect to the content item. In some embodiments, in order to enable the audio description feature, audio segments associated with I-frame playlists may be represented in their own playlist.

For example, the image of the main character in the scene may be shown alongside the audio description and/or the textual description of the segments of the content item subject to the trick-play operation. In some embodiments, an animation of images depicting the segments of the content item may be generated for display upon determining that the volume output is low (or the audio playout occurs on the physical remote or app-based remote), for example, to indicate the topic/segment/scene change to the user.

For example, the control circuitry may access a timestamp of an image frame of the video content currently being displayed.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">At <b>1006</b>, the system identifies a plurality of portions of audio/text/images associated with the content item following the current playback position that will be subject to the trick-play operation. For example, the control circuitry may access, e.g., using transceiver circuitry, metadata of the content item describing segments of the content item subject to trick-play operation. The system may determine, based on the current playback position, which segments of the content item will be subject to the fast-forward operation. At <b>1008</b>, the system may access metadata of the content item comprising an importance level of each portion of audio/textual description/images of segments of the content item that will be subjected to the fast-forward operation.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">At <b>1010</b>, the system initiates the trick-play operation, e.g., thumbnail-based trick-play operation, upon user request. At <b>1012</b>, the system, e.g., using output circuitry, plays back video of the content item at an increased or decreased speed, as requested based on the user-commanded trick-play operation.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Upon playback of the video of the content item during the trick-play operation, at step <b>1014</b>, the system may playback one or more portions of the plurality of portions of audio based on the importance level. Additionally or alternatively, at step <b>1016</b>, the system may display, during the trick-play operation, one or more text portions, e.g., portions of closed-caption text or a textual description summarizing the segments of the content item subject to the trick-play operation, based on the importance level. Additionally or alternatively, at step <b>1018</b>, the system may display, during the trick-play operation, one or more still images, e.g., image frames of the video playlist or any other still image depicting the segments of the content item subject to the trick-play operation, such as images of the characters present in the segments of the content item, based on the importance level.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> may be used with any other embodiments of this disclosure. In addition, the process described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> may be carried out in suitable alternative orders or in parallel to further the purposes of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In some embodiments, the user may navigate through the content item, e.g., using the time-progress bar displayed with respect to the content item being consumed by the user. In some embodiments, when the user ends the navigation, in order to resume playback in normal speed, a predetermined number of image frames or segments that precede the current I-frame, if I-frames are used to begin playback, or current playback position, may be played at a faster or slower rate (any rate that's faster or slower than the normal playback speed) as a transition into the frame/scene indicated by the user. For example, the transition may play back the content item from 5 seconds before the playback position the user has requested playback in normal speed, in order to allow the user to transition from previous scenes to the current scene or to transition from trick-play operation to normal operation. In some embodiments, the transition time may be a predetermined time, for example.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In some embodiments, haptic feedback may be generated by the remote control or the user device in order to indicate scene changes within the content item during the playback of segments during trick-play operation. In some embodiments, the characteristic of the feedback may differ or change based on the content classification of each segment of the content item. For example, fast-forwarding through an action scene may generate a strong vibration or multiple consecutive pulses of vibration. Such haptic signals may be communicated to the media player local to the remote or from a server, e.g., in the case when an application on a phone is being used for navigation.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The processes discussed herein are intended to be illustrative and not limiting.
