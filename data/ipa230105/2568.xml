Polyolefin-based resins are generally inexpensive, have excellent processability and chemical resistance, are unlikely to generate harmful gases when incinerated, and have high recyclability. Because of these and other advantageous characteristics, polyolefin-based resins attract attention as matrix resins for fiber-reinforced resins. Particular attention is drawn to polypropylene-based resins that are inexpensive, low in specific gravity and relatively high in heat resistance, and have excellent characteristics such as molding properties and chemical resistance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because of low polarity, polypropylene-based resins tend to be poor in interfacial adhesion with reinforcing fibers. A known approach to improving the interfacial adhesion with reinforcing fibers is to use an unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified polypropylene-based resin.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified polypropylene-based resin is usually obtained by introducing unsaturated carboxylic acid units into an unmodified polypropylene-based resin using an unsaturated carboxylic acid component. Unfortunately, an acid-modified polypropylene-based resin thus obtained tends to contain a certain amount of an unreacted unsaturated carboxylic component that, if remaining in a large amount in the resin, may adversely affect physical properties of fiber-reinforced resin molded bodies.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, Patent Literature 1 suggests that the deterioration in properties is suppressed by using a fiber-sizing agent that includes an acid-modified polypropylene-based resin and is such that the amount of an unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer in a dry residue of the fiber-sizing agent is 10,000 ppm or less.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 1: JP-A-2016-006245</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present inventor intends to further improve the strength such as, in particular, creep resistance of a conventional fiber-reinforced polypropylene-based resin composition containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid-modified polypropylene-based resin.
