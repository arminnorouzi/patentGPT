id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of manufacturing a redistribution layer includes: forming an insulating layer on a wafer, delimited by a top surface and a bottom surface in contact with the wafer; forming a conductive body above the top surface of the insulating layer; forming a first coating region extending around and above the conductive body, in contact with the conductive body, and in contact with the top surface of the insulating layer in correspondence of a bottom surface of the first coating region; applying a thermal treatment to the wafer in order to modify a residual stress of the first coating region, forming a gap between the bottom surface of the first coating region and the top surface of the insulating layer; forming, after applying the thermal treatment, a second coating region extending around and above the first coating region, filling said gap and completely sealing the first coating region.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

phase (back end of line, BEOL), the individual devices are interconnected by conductive metal lines. In particular, due to the complexity of modern IC layouts and high density of individual devices, the back end of line process comprises manufacturing several stacked metal layers, electrically insulated from one another by dielectric layers; vias through the dielectric layers allow connecting any metal layer to the metal layers below and/or the one above.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a third phase of the IC manufacturing process, a redistribution layer (RDL) is patterned above the last metal interconnection layer.
