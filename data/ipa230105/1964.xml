In the second case, the support ring is generally packed between the rolling bearing and the collar, above a groove of the journal or shaft end which has the function of reducing the fatigue stresses. In a second case, the support ring is centered on the journal by means of a sleeve portion that projects axially outwards from an axial volume of the groove and that is seated inside an annular seat formed in an inner ring of the rolling bearing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Problems arising from a high-interference coupling (i.e. no clearance) result in high stresses with consequent risks of damage to the collar itself due to the frequent bearing maintenance assembly and disassembly operations as well as an obvious risk of structural damage to the support ring.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a support ring complex or assembly or unit which overcomes the drawbacks of known support ring assemblies, is simple and low cost to produce, and has small overall dimensions.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Based on this disclosure, a support ring assembly for railway axles having characteristic features described herein is therefore provided, in which the support ring assembly can be coupled on the axle at a widened section or collar of the railway axle, of a larger diameter, situated upstream of the journal or shaft end of the axle, so as to act as a shoulder for a rolling bearing mounted on the shaft end.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular, the support ring assembly according to this disclosure can be mounted correctly on a collar of a railway axle with a wide range of tolerances that are subject to high loads and therefore necessitate a very long working life, during which they are be subject to numerous maintenance operations.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, a support ring assembly <b>1</b> may configured to be coupled, during use, on a journal or shaft end <b>3</b> of a railway axle <b>2</b> so as to act as an axial shoulder for a rolling bearing <b>4</b> mounted in a known manner on shaft end <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Rolling bearing <b>4</b> may form part of a railway bushing <b>5</b>, shown only partly for simplicity of illustration, that supports in an idle manner railway axle <b>2</b> and on which one or more wheels <b>6</b> of a railway carriage (not shown) are keyed during use.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Wheels <b>6</b> may be connected so as to be angularly integral with railway axle <b>2</b> on opposite shaft ends <b>3</b> thereof.

Such embodiments may be referred to as an inboard application. Although not described in this disclosure, it should be appreciated that embodiments consistent with this disclosure may be for an outboard application. In embodiments consistent with an outboard application, rolling bearing <b>4</b> may be mount fitted onto end portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>of shaft end <b>3</b> while wheel <b>6</b> may be supported by railway axle <b>2</b> at an axially inward position relative to rolling bearing <b>4</b> and immediately beyond collar <b>7</b>.

In some embodiments, annular insert <b>16</b> is formed integrally as one piece annular shield <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Elastomeric annular element <b>19</b> may be configured to be interposed, during use, between annular shield <b>18</b> and a radially outer, cylindrical side surface <b>20</b> of collar <b>7</b> and configured to engage in close contact with collar <b>7</b>. In various embodiments, elastomeric annular element <b>19</b> is configured to completely occupy radial clearance G over a first radial volume exceeding a second radial volume occupied by annular shield <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In various embodiments, an annular shield <b>18</b> may be made of a sheared and folded metal sheet, typically made of steel, and may have a substantially L shaped radial cross-section.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Annular shield <b>18</b> may include a sleeve portion <b>21</b> force-fitted, e.g., with radial interference, into seat <b>12</b> and in contact with a surface of side wall <b>13</b>. Annular shield <b>18</b> may further include and a flange portion <b>22</b> that extends radially on an outside of sleeve portion <b>21</b>. In various embodiments, flange portion <b>22</b> may extend from sleeve portion <b>21</b> at first axial end <b>11</b> of support ring <b>10</b>. Flange portion <b>22</b> may further be engaged in axial abutment against a first front face <b>23</b> of first end <b>11</b> of support ring <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In various embodiments, an annular element <b>19</b> may be made of an elastomeric material covering at least a majority of a radially inner, cylindrical side surface <b>24</b> of sleeve portion <b>21</b> and extends over at least part of a front face <b>25</b> of flange portion <b>22</b>. In various embodiments, front face <b>25</b> may have away from first front face <b>23</b> of first end <b>11</b> of support ring <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Throughout this disclosure, the expression &#x201c;most&#x201d; referring to an axial or radial or superficial extension of an entity must be understood as being a quantity greater than 50% and preferably greater than 70% of this entity. Therefore, for example, an elastomeric element <b>19</b> occupies more than 50% and preferably more than 70% of an axial extension of a side surface <b>24</b> of a sleeve portion <b>21</b>, calculated from an edge of a flange portion <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Annular element <b>19</b> may be formed integrally as a single piece with shield <b>18</b>. In various embodiments, annular element <b>19</b> may be integrally fixed as a single piece with sleeve portion <b>21</b> and flange portion <b>22</b> of annular shield <b>18</b> by means of bonding during vulcanization.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Annular element <b>19</b> may further include a radially inner annular surface <b>26</b> facing, during use, collar <b>7</b> and provided with at least two annular protuberances <b>27</b>. In various embodiments, at least two annular protuberances may be arranged in tandem with each other (i.e. axially in sequence) and may be configured to always make engaging contact with collar <b>7</b> irrespective of a range of pre-set constructional tolerances of collar <b>7</b> and annular insert <b>16</b> and seat <b>12</b>. Annular protuberances <b>27</b> may have a curved radial profile with a predefined first radius of curvature R.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In other words, annular protuberances <b>27</b> may be configured to ensure a minimum residual interference with collar <b>7</b> so that annular insert <b>16</b> may act as, during use, a static hydraulic sealing element between support ring <b>10</b> and collar <b>7</b> in relation to rolling bearing <b>4</b>. In various embodiments, a minimum residual interference may be equal to 0 mm.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this way, a support ring assembly <b>1</b> according to this disclosure reduces high stresses and increased risk of damage to collar <b>7</b> arising from a high-interference coupling. A support ring assembly <b>1</b> further performs a sealing function to seal off external environmental contaminants such as water, dust, and mud, as well as other contaminants, such as friction materials (resulting from e.g., a braking system), washing liquids, oi, and rust (caused by external surfaces of carriage members).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In particular, if annular insert <b>16</b> were not present, water may infiltrate and reach a transition zone between collar <b>7</b> and a seat of rolling bearing <b>4</b>. This transition zone may be a critical zone in which stresses due to loads increase. For this reason, a discharge groove <b>9</b> (e.g., regulated according to Commonwealth Standard Network (CSN) European Standard (EN) 13103) may be inserted between collar <b>7</b> and the seat of rolling bearing <b>4</b>. Oxidation and resulting rust in this transition zone may result in fatigue breakages of railway axle <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In various embodiments, radially inner annular surface <b>26</b> of annular element <b>19</b> may include two distal cylindrical end sections <b>28</b> immediately adjacent to and on opposite sides of annular protuberances <b>27</b> and may include at least one central section <b>29</b> interposed between annular protuberances <b>27</b> and arranged flush with cylindrical end sections <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Central section <b>29</b> may be cylindrical and connected to the curved radial profile of the annular protuberances <b>27</b> by a curved section having a second predefined radius R<b>1</b>. In various embodiments, R<b>1</b> may have a same absolute value but opposite curvature as R. In other embodiments, R<b>1</b> may not have a same absolute value as R without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Under conditions causing minimum interference, protuberances <b>27</b> may be configured to adhere to side surface <b>20</b> and exert a hydraulic sealing action to seal off collar <b>7</b> from external contaminants. Under conditions causing maximum interference, protuberances <b>27</b> may be configured to compress elastically without being completely radially compressed, improving the quality of the sealing action and ensuring a small degree of friction with collar <b>7</b> both during assembly and disassembly of axle <b>2</b>. In this way, a support ring assembly <b>1</b> according to the present disclosure improves upon known support ring assemblies.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, protuberances <b>27</b> may recompact along central section <b>29</b> to avoid damage to support ring assembly <b>1</b> both during assembly and during disassembly.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Annular protuberances <b>27</b> may further be axially spaced apart by central section <b>29</b> with a constant pitch P and such that the ratio of the radius of curvature R to the pitch P is approximately 1:3.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In various embodiments, sleeve portion <b>21</b> may have an axial length such that the annular element <b>19</b> may have more than two annular protuberances <b>27</b>, for example three annular protuberances. In embodiments in which there are three protuberances <b>27</b>, protuberances <b>27</b> may be spaced from each other by pitch P alongside surface <b>26</b>, separated by two central sections <b>29</b>, and disposed between two distal end sections <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In various embodiments, annular element <b>19</b> may be provided with a portion <b>30</b> that covers at least part of front face <b>25</b> of flange portion <b>22</b>. A bevel <b>31</b> may be provided on portion <b>30</b>, facing away from flange portion <b>22</b> and extending until flush with radially inner annular surface <b>26</b> of annular element <b>19</b>. Thus, bevel <b>31</b> may face collar <b>7</b> during use.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Bevel <b>31</b> may facilitate mounting of support ring assembly <b>1</b> on collar <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Annular element <b>19</b> may have suitable dimensions and be made of a suitable material to be configured to have an elasto-plastic behavior, improving optimum behavior of support ring assembly during use.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, a support ring <b>10</b> may have an axial end <b>32</b> arranged axially opposite to a first end <b>11</b> and have a flange-shaped, which extends radially on an outside of a radially outer side surface <b>33</b> of the first axial end <b>11</b>. Second axial end <b>32</b> may be provided with an annular seat <b>34</b> axially opposite to a seat <b>12</b> and defined by an annular front groove formed on a front face <b>35</b> of axial end <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In various embodiments, support ring assembly <b>1</b> may further include an annular spacer <b>36</b> made of a synthetic plastic material, e.g., a polyamide, and have a substantially Z-shaped radial cross-section.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A radially outer edge <b>37</b> of spacer <b>36</b> may snap-engage inside annular seat <b>34</b>. In various embodiments, spacer <b>36</b> may be configured to remain interposed, during use, between support ring <b>10</b> and rolling bearing <b>4</b> and to engage, during use, with a radially inner opposite edge <b>38</b> inside a radially inner front seat <b>39</b> of rolling bearing <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">During assembly, support ring assembly <b>1</b> may first be formed by force-fitting insert <b>16</b> inside seat <b>12</b> and engaging spacer <b>36</b> inside annular seat <b>34</b>. Due to spacer <b>36</b> support ring assembly <b>1</b> may be pre-assembled on rolling bearing <b>4</b> by inserting radially inner opposite edge <b>38</b> inside radially inner front seat <b>39</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, a resulting sub-unit formed by support ring assembly <b>1</b> and rolling bearing <b>4</b> (or only the assembly <b>1</b>) may be assembled on the axle <b>2</b> by pushing along arrow F shown in in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Alternatively, a sub-unit may be formed by support ring assembly <b>1</b> only, and support ring assembly <b>1</b> still assembled on axle <b>2</b> by pushing along arrow F.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">During this assembly step, insert <b>16</b> may be firmly fixed in axial abutment inside seat <b>12</b> so that it cannot be displaced in direction opposite to arrow F. Insert <b>16</b> may be inserted by means of pushing, and if necessary by means of forcing, onto cylindrical side surface <b>20</b> of collar <b>7</b>, where the annular element <b>19</b> adapts to clearance G due to the curved-annular profile of annular protuberances <b>27</b>. A size of clearance G may be related to machining tolerances and/or any re-machining with stock removal of side surface <b>20</b> of collar <b>7</b>. This may include, but is not limited to, scoring caused during maintenance disassembly operations or similar damage due to wear. Due to the geometry of the support ring assembly <b>1</b> described herein, the insertion action may be gentle and have a small amount of friction.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The same occurs during any disassembly for maintenance purposes, in which support ring assembly <b>1</b> is extracted by means of pushing the direction opposite arrow F, thus eliminating risk of damage to both support ring <b>10</b> and railway axle <b>2</b>. All of this without any loss of efficiency during the secondary, but no less important.
