For example, a service business may have unhappy customers and/or lack profitability if it does not have a sufficient understanding of its customers and/or its operations. However, it may be difficult for a service business to gain a sufficient understanding of its customers and/or its operations. For example, it may be difficult for a service business to determine identifying information associated with all of its customers. This difficulty may be especially prevalent for those service businesses that have a large number of customers and/or one or more large properties to oversee. Therefore, improvements in service management techniques are needed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following detailed description may be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings.

Embodiments of the present disclosure comprise systems and methods for tracking customers that are unknown (e.g., unregistered) to the service business. Other embodiments of the present disclosure comprise systems and methods for determining existing relationship between known customers of the service business.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A service business may include any type of business, including but not limited to, casino properties, hotel properties, resort properties, time share properties, vacation properties, amusement parks, food and beverage businesses, vineyards, car dealerships, office buildings, universities, and/or any other business that manages assets associated with a business that includes multiple different operational aspects. A service business may be associated with a single property or multiple properties. If a service business is associated with multiple properties, each of these properties may be located in different locations and/or on-line.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example platform <b>100</b> for determining identifying information associated with customers of a service business. The platform <b>100</b> may comprise a processor <b>102</b>, one or more property databases <b>104</b>, and one or more client devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. The processor <b>102</b>, one or more property databases <b>104</b>, and one or more client devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may communicate with each other via one or more networks <b>108</b>. The network <b>108</b> may comprise a variety of network devices, such as routers, switches, multiplexers, hubs, modems, bridges, repeaters, firewalls, proxy devices, and/or the like. The network <b>108</b> may comprise physical links, such as coaxial cable links, twisted pair cable links, fiber optic links, a combination thereof, and/or the like. The network <b>108</b> may comprise wireless links, such as cellular links, satellite links, Wi-Fi links and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The processor <b>102</b> may process tasks associated with the platform <b>100</b>. For example, the processor <b>102</b> may comprise a customer tracking module <b>106</b>. The customer tracking module <b>106</b> may be configured to determine identifying information associated with customers of a service business. The processor <b>102</b> and/or the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may be associated with an entity other than the service business itself. For example, an entity that is not the service business may utilize the customer tracking module <b>106</b> to determine identifying information associated with customers of a service business.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The customer tracking module <b>106</b> may determine identifying information associated with customers of a service business using data collected and/or maintained by one or more properties of the service business. The customer tracking module <b>106</b> may receive, from one or more property databases <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, data indicative of assets associated with the service business. Assets associated with the service business include customers and/or devices (e.g. machines) associated with the service business. For example, if the service business is a casino, assets associated with the service business may include customers of the casino and/or devices (e.g. slot machines, casino tables, etc.) of the casino.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine identifying information associated with customers of the service business. For example, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to tie disparate pieces of information to a single customer, that may or may not be known. In an embodiment, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to draw a relationship mapping between two different customers, each of which may or may not be known. In another embodiment, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to draw a relationship mapping between a set of data and an unknown customer.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">If the customer tracking module <b>106</b> utilizes the received data to draw a relationship mapping between two different customers, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine if two different, known customers are related. Two different customers may be related if they are likely to visit a property of the service business at the same time as each other. For example, if the service business is a casino, two customers may be related if they tend to visit a property of the casino on the same days or times and/or if they tend to play in the same area, such as banks of machines or tables, at the same time.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">If the customer tracking module <b>106</b> utilizes the received data to draw a relationship mapping between a set of data and an unknown customer, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to track an unknown customer. An unknown customer may be a customer that is not known to the service business. A customer may not be known to the service business, for example, if the customer has not visited a property of the service business before, if the customer has not registered as a known customer of the service business and/or the customer has not yet been identified.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, if the service business is a casino, a customer may be an unknown customer if the customer is an uncarded player. An uncarded player may be a player that has not registered to become a carded player with the casino. A carded player may be a player associated with a casino card. A casino card may allow the carded player to earn points when he or she plays (slot machines, table games, poker, etc.). The casino card may additionally offer various advantages depending on volume of the carded player's play (e.g., discounts on restaurants, bars rooms for your next stay, etc.). Points earned using the casino card may also be converted into casino credits.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, to draw a relationship mapping between a set of data and an unknown customer, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine whether a plurality of interactions with a single device (e.g., a machine) are each associated with a particular unknown customer. For example, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine whether the particular unknown customer interacted with the single device over an extended period of time.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To determine whether a plurality of interactions with a single device (e.g., a machine) are each associated with a particular unknown customer, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine a time associated with each interaction of the plurality of interactions. If the amount of time between each interaction of the plurality of interactions with the device satisfies a threshold, it may be determined that each of the plurality of interactions with the device is associated with the same unknown customer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, if the service business is a casino, a first interaction with the device may be a ticket having credits associated with the ticket being entered into the device. A second, later interaction with the device may be a new bill being entered into the device (without a ticket being output from the device since the ticket was input). If there is only a short amount of time (e.g., around a few seconds to a minute) between the credit expiring and the insertion of a new bill, it may be determined that the same unknown customer is continually interacting with the device, i.e., after having used up the credit the unknown customer has not input new money into the machine. If the amount of time is longer before new money is input, that may indicate that the unknown customer has left the machine and someone else has started to play at the machine.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The threshold may be any predetermined amount of time (e.g., any number of seconds and/or minutes). The amount of time between each interaction of the plurality of interactions with the device may satisfy the threshold if the amount of time between each interaction of the plurality of interactions is less than or equal to the threshold. For example, if the threshold is one minute, and the amount of time between each interaction of the plurality of interactions is less than or equal to one minute, each of the plurality of interactions with the device may be associated with the same unknown customer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine that it was not a single unknown customer that interacted with the single device over the extended period of time. For example, if the amount of time between each interaction of the plurality of interactions with the device does not satisfy the threshold, each of the plurality of interactions with the device may not be associated with the same unknown customer. Rather, at least one of the plurality of interactions with the device may be associated with a different customer than the remainder of the plurality of interactions. As a result, it may be determined that the particular unknown customer was not the only customer that interacted with (e.g., played) that device over the period of time that includes the plurality of interactions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As discussed above, the threshold may be any predetermined amount of time (e.g., any number of seconds and/or minutes). The amount of time between each interaction of the plurality of interactions with the device may fail to satisfy the threshold if the amount of time between each interaction of the plurality of interactions exceeds the threshold. For example, if the threshold is one minute, and the amount of time between each interaction of the plurality of interactions is greater than one minute, each of the plurality of interactions with the device may not be associated with the same unknown customer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another embodiment, to draw a relationship mapping between a set of data and an unknown customer, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine whether a plurality of interactions with a plurality of devices (e.g., machines) are each associated with a particular unknown customer. For example, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine whether the particular unknown customer interacted with the plurality of devices over an extended period of time.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To determine whether a plurality of interactions with a plurality of devices (e.g., machines) are each associated with a particular unknown customer, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine that a first device has output a ticket (e.g., an indicator) associated with a particular unknown customer. The customer tracking module <b>106</b> may also utilize the received data to determine that a second, different device (e.g., another machine, a cashier, etc.) has received, at a later time, the ticket that was output by the first device. If the customer tracking module <b>106</b> determines that the second, different device has received the ticket that was output by the first device, the customer tracking module may determine that the single, unknown customer interacted with the first device and then moved to interact with the second device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, to draw a relationship mapping between a set of data and an unknown customer, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine whether a plurality of interactions share a common behavioral pattern. For example, if the service business is a casino, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine whether the plurality of interactions share a common pattern of play. There may only be a certain number of players on a casino floor at one time, and each may play in a slightly unique fashion (e.g., level of risk, numbers of credits played, patters of play, etc.). If the customer tracking module <b>106</b> determines that the plurality of interactions with one or more devices share a common behavioral pattern the customer tracking module may determine that a single, unknown customer is associated with each of the plurality of interactions.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As discussed above, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may additionally or alternatively utilize the received data to draw a relationship mapping between two different known customers or unknown customers. To draw a relationship mapping between two different known or unknown customers, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine whether a plurality of interactions with one or more devices (e.g., machines) tie or link the two different customers together.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, to determine whether a plurality of interactions with one or more devices (e.g., machines) tie or link the two different known customers together, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine that a first device has received a ticket and an indication (e.g., player ID) associated with a first known customer. The customer tracking module <b>106</b> may additionally utilize the received data to determine that the first device has output the ticket. The customer tracking module <b>106</b> may additionally utilize the received data to determine that a second device has received, as input, the first ticket and an indication (e.g., player ID) associated with a second known customer. The second device may be the same as or different than the first device. If the customer tracking module <b>106</b> determines that a second device has received, as input, the first ticket and an indication (e.g., player ID) associated with the second known customer, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may determine that the first and second known customers are related to one another. If the first and second known customers are related to one another, this may indicate that the first and second known customers are likely to visit a property of the service business at the same time and/or are likely to be friends, acquaintances, family members, associates, etc.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment, to determine whether a plurality of interactions with one or more devices (e.g., machines) tie or link the two different known customers together, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine a quantity of times that a first known customer and a second known customer are simultaneously located proximate to at least one device. The received data may include, for example, geolocation data collected through a phone application.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">If the quantity of times satisfies a threshold, this may indicate that the first known customer and the second known customer are likely to be located near each other when located on a property of the service business. If the first known customer and the second known customer are likely to be located near each other when located on a property of the service business, this may indicate that the first and second known customers are related to one another. As discussed above, if the first and second known customers are related to one another, this may indicate that the first and second known customers are likely to visit a property of the service business at the same time and/or are likely to be friends, acquaintances, family members, associates, etc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In yet another embodiment, to determine whether a plurality of interactions with one or more devices (e.g., machines) tie or link the two different known customers together, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine a first plurality of time periods during which a first known customer interacted with at least one device of the service business. The customer tracking module <b>106</b> may additionally utilize the received data to determine a second plurality of time periods during which the second customer interacted with the at least one device of the service business.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">If an overlap between the first plurality of time periods and the second plurality of time periods satisfies a threshold, this may indicate that the first known customer and the second known customer are likely to visit a property of the service business at the same time. If the first known customer and the second known customer are likely to visit a property of the service business at the same time, this may indicate that the first and second known customers are related to one another. As discussed above, if the first and second known customers are related to one another, this may indicate that the first and second known customers are likely to visit a property of the service business at the same time and/or are likely to be friends, acquaintances, family members, associates, etc.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another embodiment, to determine whether a plurality of interactions with one or more devices (e.g., machines) tie or link the two different known customers together, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine one or more attributes associated with a first known customer and a second known customer of the service business. The attributes may include, by way of example and without limitation, address(es) and/or phone number(s). If a first known customer and a second known customer of the service business share a common address and/or phone number, this may indicate that the first and second known customers are related to one another.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment, to determine whether a plurality of interactions with one or more devices (e.g., machines) tie or link the two different known customers together, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine one or more social media attributes associated with a first known customer and/or a second known customer of the service business. For example, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine that the first known customer and the second known customer are &#x201c;friends&#x201d; with one another on social media. If a first known customer and a second known customer of the service business interact with each other on social media (e.g., are &#x201c;friends), this may indicate that the first and second known customers are related to one another, truly are friends, etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another embodiment, to determine whether a plurality of interactions with one or more devices (e.g., machines) tie or link the two different known customers together, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine whether two different known customers are likely staying in the same hotel. For example, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine that a first known customer checks into a hotel using an indication (e.g., player ID) associated with the second known customer. If the first known customer checks into a hotel using the indication (e.g., player ID) associated with the second known customer, this may indicate that the first and second known customers are related to one another or otherwise connected. Additionally, or alternatively, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine how many key cards for a hotel are issued (e.g., two key cards may indicate that two people are staying in the room). If two customers are staying in the same hotel room, this may indicate that they are related to one another.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data in any other manner to tie or link the two different known customers together. For example, if the customer tracking module <b>106</b> receives data from a food and beverage database (e.g., F&#x26;B database <b>104</b><i>c</i>), the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine that multiple player IDs are listed on a single food/beverage check and may show they are related. If the indications (e.g., player IDs) associated with the first and second known customers are both listed on a single food/beverage check, this may indicate that the first and second known customers are related to one another. Additionally, or alternatively, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may utilize the received data to determine that, although food and/or a beverage was paid for by a first known customer, a player ID of a second known customer was used to facilitate the purchase. This may indicate that the first and second known customers are related to one another.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the same manners that the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may tie or link two different known customers together, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may also tie or link a known customer to an unknown customer or tie or link two unknown customers. For example, the spouse or friend of a known customer may not want to be known by the service business, but may accompany a known player on a frequent basis. The service business may be tempted to invite the known player to an event or to give the known player some type of perk or comp, but doing so without also inviting the unknown player may inhibit the known player in some manner, so the known player may be given two invitations or double perks or comps so the known player can possibly share with the unknown player and both will participate.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The customer tracking module <b>106</b> may use the determined identifying information to determine one or more tasks that need to be completed with respect to one or more customers of the service business. For example, if the customer tracking module <b>106</b> determines that a particular unknown customer interacted with one or more devices over an extended period of time, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may determine that an employee of the service business needs to interact with that particular unknown customer. For example, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may determine that an employee of the service business needs to greet the particular unknown customer and/or attempt to convert the unknown customer into a known (e.g., carded) customer. Alternatively, if the unknown customer indicates that he or she does not wish to be converted into a known (e.g., carded) customer, the employee may be able to ascertain why the customer does not want to be carded, which information may be entered in a database with information about the unknown customer so if identified in the future, the unknown customer is not approached again. Additionally, or alternatively, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may determine that an employee of the service business needs to extend an offer or promotion to the unknown customer. For example, the employee may offer a three-night hotel night stay, buffet tickets, etc., to the unknown customer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As another example, if the customer tracking module <b>106</b> determines that a relationship between a first customer of the service business and a second customer of the service business exists, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may determine that an employee of the service business needs to invite the second customer to any event that the first customer is also invited to. If the first customer and second customer are related, this may indicate that the first customer may not want to attend an event without the second customer (and vice versa).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">If the customer tracking module <b>106</b> determines one or more tasks that need to be completed with respect to one or more customers of the service business, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may cause output of a message indicative of the at least one task that needs to be completed. For example, the customer tracking module <b>106</b> may cause output of a message indicative of the at least one task that needs to be completed via an interface of one or more client devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. The one or more client devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be associated with (e.g., belong to) the service business and may be accessible by employees of the service business. One or more employees may utilize the one or more client devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>to view tasks that need to be completed, and to accept and/or deny one or more of these tasks.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The client devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may comprise any type of computing device, such as a mobile device, a tablet device, laptop, a desktop computer, a smart television or other smart device (e.g., smart watch, smart speaker, smart glasses, smart helmet), a gaming device, a set top box, digital streaming device, robot, and/or the like. The client devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be associated with one or more users. A single user may use one or more of the client devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>to access the platform <b>100</b>. The client devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may travel to a variety of locations and use different networks to access the platform <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The processor <b>102</b> may be implemented as one or more computing devices, one or more processors, one or more virtual computing instances, a combination thereof, and/or the like. The processor <b>102</b> may be implemented by one or more computing devices. The one or more computing devices may comprise virtualized computing instances. The virtualized computing instances may comprise a virtual machine, such as an emulation of a computer system, operating system, server, and/or the like. A virtual machine may be loaded by a computing device based on a virtual image and/or other data defining specific software (e.g., operating systems, specialized applications, servers) for emulation. Different virtual machines may be loaded and/or terminated on the one or more computing devices as the demand for different types of processing services changes. A hypervisor may be implemented to manage the use of different virtual machines on the same computing device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The data in the property databases <b>104</b> may be stored in disparate formats. For the customer tracking module <b>106</b> to be able to utilize the received data and analyze it, such as in the manner described above, the data from the property databases <b>104</b> may be integrated into a single format. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example system <b>200</b> including a CMS for ingesting data in disparate formats from a service business. The data in disparate formats may come from a variety of different systems <b>202</b>. For example, the systems <b>202</b> that generate data may include food &#x26; beverage systems, sportsbooks systems, slot systems, on-line gaming systems, hotel systems, casino systems, table systems, cashless systems, central credit systems, and/or any other system used to manage services at a property. The platform <b>100</b> may need to connect to all of these systems <b>202</b> and gather and store data from all of the systems <b>202</b> in a way that provides the platform <b>100</b> with the ability to leverage the data to provide insights and action to the user(s) of the platform <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">However, connecting to all of these systems <b>202</b> and gathering data from the systems <b>202</b> may be challenging. Bringing all of the systems <b>202</b> together and connecting them back to an asset may be difficult at least in part because all of the data sources may be different in many ways. In an embodiment, the data may be extracted from each of the systems <b>202</b>, transformed as necessary, and loaded into the platform <b>100</b> all in one step. For example, if the data associated with player wagers is desired, a query may be run to get that specific data from a source system <b>202</b>, and a database associated with the platform <b>100</b> may be populated and presented to a user of the platform <b>100</b>. However, this &#x201c;one-step&#x201d; treatment may prevent the platform <b>100</b> from being scalable and may lead to various data engineering issues. For example, any time any component or step in this one-step treatment needed to be modified, an entirely new version of the platform <b>100</b> may have to be reinstalled at each property that uses the platform <b>100</b>. Accordingly, it may be desirable to connect disparate systems and gather data from them in different manner.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, it may be desirable to stage the disparate data in a staging database <b>212</b> separated from the systems <b>202</b> by a protective firewall <b>203</b>. The staging database <b>212</b> may also be a replication database that replicates and stores any data received from the systems <b>202</b>. A replication database may be necessary when the platform <b>100</b> is receiving data from a customer in a regulated industry, such as gaming, so that the data in the database may be made available to regulators without requiring it to be separated from other data and to insure all of the data is made available. The staging database <b>212</b> may also receive and store input data from the systems <b>202</b> so the data is separated from other portions of the platform <b>100</b> as well as from data input from other customers. There may also be a protective firewall (not shown, but the same as firewall <b>203</b>) between the staging database <b>212</b> and other portions of platform <b>100</b>. This separation of data from portions of the platform <b>100</b> facilitates the provisioning of custom input solutions to different customers, including outside of the gaming context. The separation and storage may be in physically different databases or in separated storage of a cloud-based service. Additionally, or alternatively, the staging database <b>212</b> may function as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW) for customers that desire this feature. The staging database <b>212</b> may also facilitate the return of customer data when a relationship with a customer terminates (e.g., the end of a contract), as the staging database <b>212</b>, or at least its contents, may just be returned to the customer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The data stored in the staging database <b>212</b> may be an exact replica of the source data. To get the data to stage in the staging database <b>212</b>, various different techniques may be used. For example, a VPN tunnel <b>204</b> may be utilized to tunnel to each of the client systems <b>202</b>. A VPN gateway <b>206</b> may be a connection point for the VPN tunnel <b>204</b>. The VPN gateway <b>206</b> may contain the information that a device needs to establish the VPN tunnel <b>204</b> between a virtual network, such as Azure virtual network <b>210</b>, and an on-premises location <b>208</b>, such as a client property, over the public Internet.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">To collect the data from the client systems <b>202</b> for storage in the staging database <b>212</b>, change data capture (CDC) may be utilized. Alternatively, if the staging database <b>212</b> is a replication database, CDC may be utilized between the replication database and other portions of the platform <b>100</b>. CDC is a set of software design patterns used to determine and track data that has changed so that actions can be taken using the changed data. CDC may be used to incrementally extract changed or new records from a client system <b>202</b> or replication database so that the whole database does not need to be downloaded for further processing each time. In an embodiment, CDC may read from logs in order to detect changes. While reading from logs may provide more details, it may impact performance as it puts more resource requirements on the client systems <b>202</b> and/or may result in the platform <b>100</b> receiving more data than the client wants the platform <b>100</b> to receive.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another embodiment, CDC may read from tables in order to detect changes. Reading from tables may be similar to a database lookup and may require very little resources from the client systems <b>202</b>. Reading from tables may also prevent the platform <b>100</b> from receiving more data than the client wants the platform <b>100</b> to receive. Each table may be timestamped so that CDC may look at each row in the table, compare it to the prior row in the table, and detect any change to the data. If a change to the data is detected, that change may be pulled into the staging database <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">One or more databases from which the CDC reads tables may be relational databases that use &#x201c;rowversion&#x201d;. Rowversion is a data type that exposes automatically generated, unique binary numbers within a database. It may make it possible to version-stamp rows in a table with a unique sequential value that helps to maintain the integrity of the database when different users are updating rows at the same time. A relational database that uses rowversion may enable a different rowversion to be created each time there is a change to data. Accordingly, it may be easier to determine when changes have occurred to the data and what those changes are. If data has been changed multiple times, only the last (most recently created) rowversion may be sent for storage in the staging database <b>212</b>. If a change to the data is detected, such as by detecting that a new sequence number has been created, that change may be pulled into the staging database <b>212</b>. Alternatively, data may be pulled into the staging database <b>212</b> from intermediary rows if necessary or desired. For example, data may be pulled from intermediary rows into the staging database <b>212</b> if more details regarding the data change are desired. Additional details regarding the data change may be desired, for example, if there is a substantial amount of time in between the times when the CDC reads from the tables to detect changes.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additionally, or alternatively, to collect the data from the client systems <b>202</b> for storage in the staging database <b>212</b>, a slowly changing dimension (SCD) may be utilized. A SCD is a dimension that stores and manages both current and historical data over time in a data warehouse. A SCD allows for the maintenance of data changes in the data warehouse. These data changes may be related to dimensions that gradually change with time, rather than changing on a regular basis. Utilizing a SCD may be a way to apply updates to the staging database <b>212</b> so that the original source data is preserved. Some sources may maintain slot machine meters in one table. For example, when you insert a bill the meter gets updated from a previous value to a new value. Some source systems may only maintain the new value. A SCD may be utilized to both capture a previous value and a new value and have a trace of how the values are changing over time. For example, if a customer or player moves and gets a new address, some source systems may not track the previous addresses and when the address was changed. A SCD enables the new address and the previous address to be obtained and to make it clear that the customer as moved. As a result, more insight and useful information may be provided via the platform <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Additionally, or alternatively, data may need to be collected from the client systems <b>202</b> in real-time. Data may need to be collected from the client systems <b>202</b> in real-time if it is the type of data that changes frequently. For example, data associated with slot machine meters may change frequently and may need to be collected in real-time. The rows from real-time checks may go into ASAP tables in the platform <b>100</b>. For example, if a property has software as a service (SaaS) data captured and stored in a server, this data may be taken directly from the feed of SaaS data and inserted into ASAP tables in the platform <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Once data is stored in the staging database <b>212</b>, it may be integrated into a format that may be utilized by other portions of the platform <b>100</b>. To integrate the data into this new format, different integration jobs <b>214</b> may be written. The integration jobs <b>214</b> may transfer data from the staging database <b>212</b>, convert it into a different format for use within the platform <b>100</b>, and populate a database associated with the platform <b>100</b>, such as the database <b>216</b>. A staging controller may manage jobs and keep metadata regarding which client source systems <b>202</b> are being tapped and which tables were checked. For example, the staging controller may indicate which job(s) are running, whether a job was successful or a failure, how long each job takes to run, etc.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The schema of the database associated with the platform <b>100</b>, such as the database <b>216</b>, may stay consistent irrespective of who the client is (e.g., which client is associated with the client source systems <b>202</b> and/or what the client source systems <b>202</b> are.) The schema may remain unchanged for different clients, but each instance of the platform <b>100</b>'s application may be different. One advantage of this design lays in the segregation between the staging database <b>212</b> and the integration schema. Each client of the platform <b>100</b> will each have its own staging schema, integration schema, and schema of the database associated with the platform <b>100</b>. The data from various clients does not need to be commingled.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an embodiment, at least some of the client data (e.g., the data from the client source systems <b>202</b>) may be input into a data stream. The data stream may combine the client data with data from one or more other sources. The one or more other sources may provide data associated with various different topics, such as traffic, weather, or any other topic. The data stream combining the client data and the data from the one or more other sources may be used in an artificial-intelligence (AI) system to make predictions about why certain things occurred and/or to learn enough to plan for future events that might occur. For example, customer traffic during a certain period of time may be higher or lower than expected for reasons that are not clear based just on data provided from the systems <b>202</b>, but could become clear when combined with data about the weather, traffic or other news sources. The client source data, such as the data from the client source systems <b>202</b>, may need to be managed so that it is feed into the data stream in the correct order and can be time matched to the other source data.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example process <b>300</b> performed by a customer tracking module (e.g., customer tracking module <b>106</b>). The customer tracking module may perform the process <b>300</b> to determine identifying information associated with one or more customers of a service business. For example, the process <b>300</b> may be performed to determine whether a plurality of interactions with one or more devices (e.g., machines) of the service business over a period of time are each associated with a single unknown customer. Although depicted as a sequence of operations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that various embodiments may add, remove, reorder, or modify the depicted operations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">At <b>302</b>, data indicative of assets associated with a service business may be received. For example, the data indicative of assets associated with a service business may be received from one or more property databases <b>104</b>. The received data may be utilized to determine whether a plurality of interactions with a single device (e.g., machine) or a plurality of different devices are each associated with a single, unknown customer. For example, the received data may be utilized to determine whether the single unknown customer interacted with the device(s) over an extended period of time, or whether several different customers interacted with the device(s) over the extended period of time.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">To determine whether the plurality of interactions with the device(s) are each associated with a single unknown customer, the received data may be utilized to determine a time associated with each interaction of the plurality of interactions. At <b>304</b>, a first time associated with a first interaction with a first device of the service business may be determined. The first time may be determined based at least on the data indicative of assets associated with the service business. A second time associated with a second interaction with a second device of the service business may additionally be determined. The second time may be determined based at least on the data indicative of assets associated with the service business. The first and second devices may be the same device or may be different devices associated with the service business.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">If the amount of time between each interaction of the plurality of interactions with the device satisfies a threshold, it may be determined that each of the plurality of interactions with the device is associated with the same unknown customer. At <b>306</b>, a difference between the first time and the second time may be determined. For example, if the first time occurred at noon on Jan. 1, 2021 and the second time occurred at 12:01 on Jan. 1, 2021, the difference between the first time and the second time may be one minute.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">At <b>308</b>, the difference may be compared to a threshold. The threshold may be any predetermined amount of time (e.g., any number of seconds and/or minutes). The amount of time between the first and second times may satisfy the threshold if the amount of time between the first and second times is less than or equal to the threshold. If the difference satisfies the threshold, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to <b>310</b>. At <b>310</b>, it may be determined that the first and second interactions are both associated with the same unknown customer of the service business. For example, if the threshold is one minute, and the amount of time between the first and second times is less than or equal to one minute, both of the first and second interactions with the device may be associated with the same unknown customer.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Conversely, if the difference fails to satisfy the threshold, the method <b>300</b> may proceed to <b>316</b>. At <b>316</b>, it may be determined that the first and second interactions are not both associated with the same unknown customer of the service business. For example, if the threshold is one minute, and the amount of time between the first and second times exceeds one minute, both of the first and second interactions with the device may not be associated with the same unknown customer. Rather the first and second interactions with the device may be associated with different unknown customers. As a result, it may be determined that the single unknown customer was not the only customer that interacted with (e.g., played) that device over the period of time that includes the first and second interactions. Nevertheless, data associated with the first and second interactions might be maintained in case either or both of those interactions can be associated with another interaction at a later point in time.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The determined identifying information may be used to determine one or more tasks that need to be completed with respect to the single unknown customer of the service business. At <b>312</b>, at least one task that needs to be completed with respect to the single unknown customer of the service business may be determined. For example, it may be determined that an employee of the service business needs to interact with that single unknown customer. The task may indicate that the employee needs to greet the particular unknown customer and/or attempt to convert the unknown customer into a known (e.g., carded) customer. If the unknown customer indicates that he or she does not wish to be converted into a known (e.g., carded) customer, the employee may be able to understand why. Additionally, or alternatively, the task may indicate that an employee of the service business needs to extend an offer or promotion to the single unknown customer. For example, the employee may offer a three-night hotel night stay, buffet tickets, etc. to the single unknown customer.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">If one or more tasks that need to be completed with respect to one or more customers of the service business are determined, output of a message indicative of the at least one task that needs to be completed may be caused. At <b>314</b>, output indicative of the at least one task may be caused. For example, output of a message indicative of the at least one task that needs to be completed may be caused via an interface of one or more client devices (e.g., client devices <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>). The one or more client devices may be associated with (e.g., belong to) the service business and may be accessible by employees of the service business.

The received data may be utilized to determine whether a plurality of interactions with a single device (e.g., machine) or a plurality of different devices are each associated with a single, unknown customer. For example, the received data may be utilized to determine whether the single unknown customer interacted with the device(s) over an extended period of time, or whether several different customers interacted with the device(s) over the extended period of time.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">At <b>404</b>, a first behavioral pattern corresponding to a first interaction with at least one device of the service business may be determined. The first behavioral pattern may be determined based at least on the data indicative of assets associated with the service business. A second behavioral pattern corresponding to a second interaction with the at least one device may also be determined. The first interaction and the second interaction may be with the same device(s) or with different device(s). If the service business is a casino, the first behavioral pattern may include, for example, a first level of risk associated with the first interaction and the second behavioral pattern may include a second level of risk associated with the second interaction. While the first and second behavioral patterns may each indicate a level of risk, any other pattern of play may additionally or alternatively be indicated by the first and second behavioral patterns.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The first and second behavioral patterns may be utilized to determine whether the first and second interactions share a common behavioral pattern. For example, if the service business is a casino, the first and second behavioral patterns may be utilized to determine if the first and second interactions share a common pattern of play, such as a common level of risk. There may only be a certain number of players on a casino floor at one time, and each may play in a slightly unique fashion (e.g., level of risk, etc.). At <b>406</b>, a similarity between the first and second behavioral patterns may be determined. The similarity may be determined using any known tool, technique, or method.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">At <b>408</b>, the similarity may be compared to a threshold. The threshold may be a predetermined threshold. The threshold may be indicative of a similarity level that, if satisfied, indicates that the first and second interactions are associated with the same customer. If the similarity satisfies the threshold, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to <b>410</b>. The similarity may satisfy the threshold if the similarity meets or exceeds the threshold. At <b>410</b>, it may be determined that the first and second interactions are both associated with the same unknown customer of the service business. For example, it may be determined that the first and second interactions with one or more devices share a common behavioral pattern, such as a common level of risk (e.g., high level of risk, medium level of risk, or low level of risk), common betting practices, etc.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Conversely, if the similarity fails to satisfy the threshold, the method <b>400</b> may proceed to <b>416</b>. At <b>416</b>, it may be determined that the first and second interactions are not both associated with the same unknown customer of the service business.
