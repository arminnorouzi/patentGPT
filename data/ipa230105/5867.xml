However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present disclosure can be implemented without one or more of these details. In other examples, in order to avoid confusion with the present disclosure, some technical features known in the art are not described. That is, all the features of the actual embodiments are not described here, and the well-known functions and structures are not described in detail.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the accompanying drawings, the sizes and relative size of layers, regions, and elements may be exaggerated for clarity. The same reference numerals denote the same elements from beginning to end.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It should be understood that, when an element or layer is described as being &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;adjacent to&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on, adjacent to, connected to, or coupled to the other element or layer, or there can be an intermediate element or layer. In contrast, when an element is described as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d;, &#x201c;directly adjacent to&#x201d;, &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intermediate element or layer.

These terms are used merely to distinguish an element, component, region, layer, or portion from another element, component, region, layer, or portion. Therefore, a first element, component, region, layer, or portion discussed below may be described as a second element, component, region, layer, or portion without departing from the teachings of the present disclosure.

It should be understood that, in addition to the orientations shown in the figures, the spatial relation terms are intended to include different orientations of devices in use and operation. For example, if the devices in the figures are turned over, then the element or feature described as &#x201c;under&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; or &#x201c;below&#x201d; another element or feature would then be oriented as &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other element or feature.

As shown in the figure, the semiconductor structure includes a first substrate <b>11</b>, a first bonding structure <b>12</b> formed in the first substrate <b>11</b>, a first conductive via <b>13</b> formed in the first substrate <b>11</b> and connected to the first bonding structure <b>12</b>, a second substrate <b>21</b>, a second bonding structure <b>22</b> formed in the second substrate <b>21</b>, and a second conductive via <b>23</b> formed in the second substrate <b>21</b> and connected to the second bonding structure <b>22</b>. A material of the first bonding structure <b>12</b> is copper, and a material of the second bonding structure <b>22</b> is also copper. The first bonding structure <b>12</b> and the second bonding structure <b>22</b> form copper-copper bonding.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, the copper-copper bonding needs to be mutually bonded under a high temperature condition of 400&#xb0; C. Since the bonding temperature is relatively high, the selection of many material and processes is limited, disadvantages of shift of element characteristics may occur. In addition, the copper-copper bonding has a relatively high requirement of the surface flatness, which increases the difficulty of the process.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Based on this, the following technical solutions of the embodiments of the present disclosure are provided.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a semiconductor structure. The semiconductor structure includes a first substrate, and a first bonding structure and a first conductive via which are formed in the first substrate. The first bonding structure includes a first metal layer and a second metal layer with a melting point lower than a melting point of the first metal layer. The first metal layer includes a first surface and a second surface arranged opposite to each other. The first surface of the first metal layer includes a first groove, and the second metal layer is arranged in the first groove. The first conductive via is in contact with the second surface of the first metal layer. A projection of the first conductive via coincides with a projection of the first groove in a direction perpendicular to the first surface of the first metal layer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first bonding structure provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure includes the second metal layer with a relatively low melting point. Compared with other bonding structures only including the first metal layer, the first bonding structure provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure may perform bonding at a lower temperature. Meanwhile, the projection of the first conductive via coincides with the projection of the first groove in the direction perpendicular to the first surface of the first metal layer. During bonding, the first conductive via is heated and expanded, which promotes the fusion between the second metal layer in the first groove and other bonding structures to form an intermetallic compound. Therefore, even if there is a small gap between the first bonding structure and other bonding structures, the first bonding structure and other bonding structures can be successfully fused, which lowers the requirement of the flatness of the bonding surface during bonding.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to make the foregoing objectives, features and advantages of the present disclosure more apparent and lucid, various embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.
