2021, and all the benefits accruing therefrom under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an image sensor. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to an image sensor including a photodiode and a charge storage region formed in a substrate.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, an image sensor is a semiconductor device that converts an optical image into electrical signals and may be classified or categorized as a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) or a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Image Sensor (CIS). The CIS may include unit pixels, each including a photodiode and MOS transistors. The CIS sequentially detects the electrical signals of the unit pixels using a switching method, thereby forming an image.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The photodiode may include a charge accumulation region in which charges generated by the incident light are accumulated. For example, the photodiode may include an N-type impurity region in which electrons are accumulated, and a P-type impurity region serving as a pinning region for reducing dark current may be formed on the N-type impurity region.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As an example, the image sensor may include a transfer gate electrode formed on a substrate, and the electrons may be transferred from the charge accumulation region to a charge detection region, for example, a floating diffusion region, through a channel region below the transfer gate electrode. As another example, an image sensor using a global shutter method may include a charge storage region for storing the electrons between the charge accumulation region and the floating diffusion region. In such cases, transfer gate electrodes may be formed on surface portions of the substrate among the charge accumulation region, the charge storage region and the floating diffusion region.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, when light enters the charge storage region or a region below the charge storage region, electrons may be generated in the charge storage region or below the charge storage region. In particular, when the electrons generated below the charge storage region move to the charge storage region, operating characteristics of the image sensor may be deteriorated by the electrons.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides an image sensor capable of inhibiting charges generated below a charge storage
