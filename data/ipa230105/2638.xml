The development of the electronics industry requires an increasingly considerable use of compositions for polishing various parts such as discs or dielectric compounds. These compositions, which are generally in the form of dispersions, must exhibit a certain number of characteristics. For example, they must offer a high degree of removal of material, which reflects their abrasive capacity. They must also have a defectuosity which is as low as possible; the term &#x201c;defectuosity&#x201d; is intended to mean in particular the amount of scratches exhibited by the substrate once treated with the composition. For reasons of stability and of ease of use, these dispersions must comprise particles of submicronic dimensions, i.e. generally less than 300 nm. In addition, the presence of particles that are too fine in these dispersions reduces their abrasive capacities, and particles that are too large can contribute to an increase in the defectuosity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this context, we believe that there is a need for cerium based particles having improved abrasive properties when used in a chemical mechanical polishing process. There is also a need for a making process thereof which is simple and easy to implement at an industrial scale.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These problems are solved by the present invention which offers inter alia new cerium based particles having a rough surface thanks to a specific core-shell morphology and a making process thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One object of the invention thus relates to a process for producing a dispersion of cerium based core-shell particles in a liquid, comprising the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">(a) providing an aqueous dispersion comprising particles of cerium oxide optionally doped with at least one metal (M); providing an aqueous solution comprising a cerium (III) salt; and optionally providing an aqueous solution comprising at least one metal (M&#x2032;) salt;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">(b) contacting, under oxidizing atmosphere, the aqueous dispersion with the aqueous solution(s) provided in step (a), while maintaining the temperature comprised between 0&#xb0; C. and 80&#xb0; C. and the pH lower or equal to 11, to produce the dispersion of cerium based core-shell particles;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0009">at least one of the steps (a) and (b) being carried out in the presence of nitrate ions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">The invention also relates to the cerium based core-shell particles and dispersions thereof obtainable or obtained by this process.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">A cerium based core-shell particle of the invention can be described as a core particle of cerium oxide optionally doped with at least one metal (M) and a shell consisting of a plurality of nanoparticles of cerium oxide optionally doped with at least one metal (M&#x2032;), said nanoparticles being formed on the surface of the core particle, wherein the ratio of the average size of the core-shell particles measured by TEM to the average size of the core-shell particles measured by BET is of at least 1.5.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">Advantageously, the specific core-shell morphology of the particles of the invention increases their surface roughness and thus their surface specific area by comparison with smooth cerium oxide particles not having a shell in accordance with the present invention. Accordingly, by increasing the contact surface between the particles and the substrate to be polished, the abrasive properties of the core-shell particles of the invention are improved, allowing to advantageously use them in a chemical mechanical polishing process. The core-shell particles dispersions of the invention especially allow a higher removal rate due to their rough surface while maintaining the same defectivity thanks to equivalent size distributions compared to dispersions of smooth surface cerium oxide particles having no shell in accordance with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">The dispersions of cerium based core-shell particles of the invention can be used to prepare powders of cerium based core-shell particles, as well as polishing compositions, as it will be detailed hereafter in the specification.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">Additionally, one advantage of the core-shell particles of the invention is that the nanoparticles from the shell are well attached to the core particle. It has notably been observed that they remain attached to the core during the whole chemical mechanical polishing process in which they are implemented. It is all the more important since the particles shells withstand the mechanical stress during the chemical mechanical polishing process. If the nanoparticles of the shell came off during the polishing, these small cerium oxide particles could remain attached to the substrate even after a washing step, which is not acceptable by the end users. It would result in unacceptable costs due to the substrate loss and the recurrent polishing composition replacement.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">Another advantage of the core-shell particles of the invention lies in the fact they have the adapted size range for the CMP application and are monodisperse.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a TEM pictures of a dispersion of the core-shell particles of the invention obtained by the process illustrated in example 1, having a cerium oxide core and a cerium oxide shell.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a TEM picture of a dispersion of particles of cerium oxide obtained by the process illustrated in counter example 1.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a SEM picture of a dispersion of the cerium oxide particles intended to be used as core particles in the process illustrated in examples 1, 2 and 4.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a SEM picture of a dispersion of the core-shell particles of the invention obtained by the process illustrated in example 1, having a cerium oxide core and a cerium oxide shell.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a SEM picture of a dispersion of the core-shell particles of the invention obtained by the process illustrated in example 2, having a cerium oxide core and a cerium oxide doped with lanthanum shell.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a SEM picture of a dispersion of the core-shell particles of the invention obtained by the process illustrated in example 3, having a cerium oxide core and a cerium oxide shell.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a SEM picture of a dispersion of the core-shell particles of the invention obtained by the process illustrated in example 4, having a cerium oxide core and a cerium oxide shell.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a TEM picture of a dispersion of particles of cerium oxide obtained by the process illustrated in counter example 2.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a TEM picture of a dispersion of the core-shell particles of the invention obtained by the process illustrated in example 5, having a lanthanum doped cerium oxide core and a cerium oxide shell.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a SEM picture of a dispersion of the core-shell particles of the invention obtained by the process illustrated in example 6, having a cerium oxide core and a cerium oxide shell.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0025" num="0026">Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected using JEM-<b>1400</b> (JEOL) operating at 120 kV.

The term &#x201c;cerium oxide doped with at least one metal&#x201d; means that metal ions partially replace the cerium ions in the CeO<sub>2 </sub>lattice.

In that case, the metal atoms are intimately diffused into the cerium oxide crystalline structure. Some impurities other than said metal can be present in the oxide. The impurities may stem from the raw materials or starting materials used in the process of preparation of the metal doped oxide.

Indeed, in the fabrication of integrated circuits and other electronic devices, multiple layers of conducting, semiconducting, and dielectric materials are deposited onto or removed from the surface of a substrate. As layers of materials are sequentially deposited onto and removed from the substrate, the uppermost surface of the substrate may become non-planar and require planarization. Planarizing a surface (or &#x201c;polishing&#x201d;) the surface, is a process where material is removed from the surface of the substrate to form a generally even, planar surface. Planarization is useful in removing undesired surface topography and surface defects, such as rough surfaces, agglomerated materials, crystal lattice damage, scratches, and contaminated layers or materials. Planarization also is useful in forming features on a substrate by removing excess deposited material used to fill the features and to provide an even surface for subsequent levels of metallization and processing.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0174">The substrate that can be polished with a polishing composition or a CMP composition may be for instance a silicon dioxide-type substrates, glass, a semiconductor or a wafer.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0175">The polishing composition or the CMP composition usually contains different ingredients other than the cerium based core-shell particles.
