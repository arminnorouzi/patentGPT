Once the relief valve discharges an over pressurized fluid, the relief valve will generally need to be replaced.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Refrigeration systems may utilize many relief valves such that it may be difficult to determine which of the many valves has discharged in an over-pressure condition so that the valve may be replaced if necessary. A labor-intensive investigation may often be required for determining which valve has discharged.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various systems and methods are known in the art including monitoring of flow, pressure, acoustics and vibration to detect a discharge. However such systems may provide false signals from valves that are in proximity to each other. Additional systems may include complex valve position sensors that significantly increase the cost and complexity of a refrigeration system and are, therefore, not desirable.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a sectional view of a pressure relief valve and indicator assembly, according to an implementation;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a sectional view of an exemplary pressure relief valve and indicator assembly, according to another implementation;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are enlarged sectional views of the cap assembly of the pressure relief valve and indicator assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, according to different implementations;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a top of a cap body, according to an implementation;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plan view of a bottom of the cap assembly of the pressure relief valve and indicator assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of an indicator assembly, according to an implementation;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of a pressure relief valve and indicator assembly, according to an implementation;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a sectional view of a pressure relief valve and indicator assembly including a strain sensor, according to another implementation;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a sectional view of a pressure relief valve and indicator assembly including a pressure sensor, according to another implementation;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> are partial sectional views of a pressure relief valve and indicator assembly including a stroke actuated trigger, according to another implementation;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> are partial sectional views of a pressure relief valve and indicator assembly including a pressure-actuated pop mechanism, according to another implementation;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a partial sectional view of a pressure relief valve and indicator assembly including a stroke actuated proximity sensor, according to another implementation;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a partial sectional view of a pressure relief valve and indicator assembly including a magnetic sensor, according to another implementation;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref> are partial sectional views of a pressure relief valve and indicator assembly including another magnetic sensor, according to another implementation;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary environment in which systems and/or methods described herein may be implemented; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an exemplary process for detecting a relief valve opening.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings.
