description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an air conditioning system for a cabin of an air or rail transport vehicle. The invention relates more particularly to an air conditioning system for a cabin of an air or rail transport vehicle using a hot and pressurized air source as a pneumatic and thermal energy source and mainly using outside air as an air conditioning source, that is to say as an air source which is intended to be supplied to the cabin.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Throughout the text, the term &#x201c;cabin&#x201d; denotes any interior space of an air or rail transport vehicle of which the pressure and/or temperature of the air must be controlled. This may be a cabin for passengers, the pilot's cockpit, a hold, and in general any area of the transport vehicle which requires air to be at a controlled pressure and/or temperature. This air at a controlled pressure and/or temperature is supplied by an air conditioning system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Usually, an air conditioning system for a cabin of a transport vehicle such as an aircraft (also referred to throughout the text as an air conditioning pack) comprises a device for bleeding compressed air, better known as bleed air, from at least one compressor of an aircraft engine (such as a propulsion engine or an auxiliary engine of the aircraft), an air cycle turbine engine comprising at least one compressor and a turbine which are mechanically coupled to one another, said compressor comprising an air inlet which is connected to said compressed bleed air device and an air outlet, and said turbine comprising an air inlet and an air outlet which are connected to said cabin in order to be able to supply it with air at a controlled pressure and temperature.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional air conditioning system also comprises heat exchangers which are accommodated in a channel for circulating ram air drawn from outside the aircraft. Throughout the following text, the concept of ram air refers to air drawn from outside the aircraft by all types of known means, such as a scoop or a low-drag air inlet, also known as a flush/NACA inlet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is also common for the air cycle turbine engine to carry, on its shaft, a fan which extends into the ram-air circulation channel to provide air circulation therein for the purpose of cooling the bleed air and the air compressed by the compressor of the turbine engine.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other words, a conventional air conditioning system uses bleed air as a thermal, pneumatic and conditioning energy source, that is to say fresh air intended to be supplied to the cabin.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The general problem which has arisen for some time with this type of air conditioning system is how to minimize bleeding air from compressors of the engines, so as in turn to minimize the impact of this air bleed on kerosene consumption and on engine performance. Another problem consists in being able to control the temperature and pressure in the cabin during all the operating phases of the aircraft, including during take-off, landing and on the ground.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Finally, another problem lies in the fact that the bleed air, bled from a compressor of a propulsion engine of the aircraft, forms the air conditioning source such that contamination of the air bled from the engines is transmitted to the cabin, which can be dangerous for the health of passengers in particular.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To overcome this disadvantage of the risk of contaminating the air conditioning, a more electrical solution has already been proposed which consists in using, as an air conditioning source, ram air drawn from outside the aircraft. In other words, according to this solution, the compressor of the air cycle turbine engine is rotated by an electric motor and is directly supplied with the ambient air drawn from outside the aircraft. This compressed air is then cooled by the heat exchangers and expanded by the turbine of the turbine engine before being supplied to the cabin. This solution is interesting but requires high electrical power to rotate the compressor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inventors have therefore sought to propose a new design for an air conditioning system for a cabin of a rail or air transport vehicle which makes it possible to overcome the various disadvantages of the various currently known solutions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">AIMS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention aims to provide an air conditioning system for the cabin of a transport vehicle, such as an aircraft, which makes it possible to limit the risk of contaminating the conditioning air which is supplied to the cabin while eliminating the need to resort to an electric drive of the compressor of the turbine engine.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention also aims to provide, in at least one embodiment of the invention, an air conditioning system for a cabin of an aircraft which has different operating modes depending on the flight conditions of the aircraft.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To this end, the invention relates to an air conditioning system for a cabin of an air or rail transport vehicle, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">a hot and pressurized air source, referred to as a bleed air source,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">a channel for circulating ram air drawn from outside the transport vehicle,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0016">a network of pipes and control valves which are configured to be able to control the flow of air circulating through said pipes on the basis of the conditions of use of the transport vehicle,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0017">an air cycle turbine engine comprising at least one compressor and a turbine, referred to as a power turbine, which are mechanically connected to one another, said compressor comprising an air inlet which is fluidically connected to an opening for drawing in outside air and an air outlet which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said cabin in order to be able to supply it with air at a controlled pressure and temperature, and said power turbine comprising an air inlet which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said bleed air source and an air outlet,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0018">at least one heat exchanger, referred to as a primary cooling exchanger, which is accommodated in said ram-air circulation channel and comprises a primary circuit supplied with the flow of air from said compressor in thermal interaction with a secondary circuit supplied with said ram air.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">The air conditioning system according to the invention is characterized in that said pipe network further comprises a pipe, referred to as a thermal power pipe, which is suitable for being able to fluidically connect, upon control of at least one control valve, said outlet of said power turbine and said ram-air circulation channel upstream of said primary exchanger such that said bleed air expanded by said power turbine can form a thermal energy source for said ram air being supplied to said primary circuit of said primary exchanger.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">An air conditioning system according to the invention makes it possible in an unprecedented way to use a bleed air source, which is for example air bled from a propulsion engine of the transport vehicle such as an aircraft, both as a pneumatic energy source for rotating the air cycle turbine engine, and as a thermal energy source for modifying the temperature of the air of the ram-air circulation channel upstream of the primary cooling exchanger, also referred to throughout the application by the acronym PHX for Primary Heat Exchanger.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">An air bleed system according to the invention thus makes it possible to give the primary cooling exchanger the function of heat exchanger, better known as intercooler, which makes it possible to reduce the temperature of the compressed air to increase its density.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">In addition, according to the conditions of use of the transport vehicle (that is to say according to the flight conditions when the transport vehicle is an aircraft), the supply of cold power upstream of the cold pass of the primary exchanger which results from the expansion of the bleed air by the power turbine makes it possible to reduce the flow of ram air which is required for cooling the air conditioning pack, and therefore reduce the drag of the transport vehicle.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">In other words, and if the system according to the invention is provided in an aircraft, said system contributes to reducing the drag of the aircraft by limiting the need to draw ram air from outside the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the thermal pipe opens to the outlet of the primary circuit of the primary exchanger, that is to say at the outlet of the hot pass of the heat exchanger. This alternative makes it possible to optimize heat exchanges between the primary and secondary circuits of the exchanger and optimize thermal stratification. In other words, said alternative makes it possible to lower the temperature of the air at the outlet of the hot pass when the air conditioning pack is cold (that is to say when it is in cooling mode) and to raise the temperature of the air at the outlet of the hot pass when the pack is hot (that is to say when it is in heating mode).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">Advantageously and according to the invention, the air conditioning system further comprises at least a second heat exchanger, referred to as the main cooling exchanger, which is arranged in said ram-air circulation channel upstream of said thermal power pipe and comprises a primary circuit supplied with said flow of air from said primary circuit of said primary exchanger in thermal interaction with a secondary circuit supplied with said ram air.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0026">According to this alternative, the air conditioning system can have a cooling mode during which the hot air supplied by the compressor is cooled successively by the PHX and the MHX, and is then conveyed to the cabin (after possibly passing through a water extraction loop and other devices of the air conditioning system).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">Advantageously and according to this alternative, said pipe network further comprises a bypass pipe which is suitable for being able to fluidically connect, upon control of at least one control valve, the outlet of the primary circuit of said primary cooling exchanger and the pipe network downstream of said main cooling exchanger so as to bypass said main cooling exchanger.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">According to this alternative, the air conditioning system can have a heating mode during which the air supplied by the compressor heats up through the PHX (the cold pass being supplied with hot air from the power turbine). This air is then directed to the hot outlet of the MHX via the bypass pipe such that the air bypasses the exchanger MHX in order to reach the outlet of the air conditioning pack without being subjected to cooling by the exchanger MHX. This therefore makes it possible to inject conditioned hot air into the cabin.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">Advantageously and according to the invention, said control valves are controlled in order to make possible at least the following operating modes:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0030">an operating mode, referred to as a routine mode, in which said inlet of said power turbine is supplied with said bleed air source in order to be able to rotate said compressor supplied with air drawn from outside the transport vehicle, and said air outlet of said power turbine supplies said ram-air channel with expanded bleed air,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0031">an operating mode, referred to as an emergency mode, in which said bleed air source is supplied directly to said cabin after cooling by said heat exchangers accommodated in the ram-air circulation channel, without passing through the air cycle turbine engine,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0032">an operating mode, referred to as an intermediate mode, in which said inlet of said power turbine is supplied with said bleed air source in order to be able to rotate said compressor supplied with air drawn from outside the transport vehicle, and said air compressed by said compressor is mixed with the bleed air expanded by said power turbine upstream of the primary circuit of the primary cooling exchanger or with bleed air directly from said bleed air source.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0026" num="0033">An air conditioning system according to this advantageous alternative thus makes it possible to present at least three operating modes&#x2014;routine, emergency and intermediate&#x2014;on the basis of the conditions of use of the air or rail transport vehicle.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0034">In particular, in the routine mode, the air supplied to the cabin is exclusively fresh air drawn from outside the transport vehicle and the bleed air is used solely as a pneumatic energy source for driving the compressor of the turbine engine and as a thermal energy source (for cooling or heating) as needed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0035">In the emergency mode, the bleed air is used as an air conditioning source, as a pneumatic energy source and as a thermal energy source. This mode makes it possible to overcome a possible failure of the air cycle turbine engine by allowing the turbine engine to be bypassed and the cabin to be supplied directly with bleed air cooled by the exchangers PHX and MHX accommodated in the ram-air circulation channel.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0036">Finally, in the intermediate mode, the bleed air can be mixed with the outside air compressed by the compressor of the turbine engine. This intermediate mode makes it possible in particular to reduce the energy consumption of the air conditioning pack. In this intermediate operating mode, the bleed air mixed with the air compressed by the compressor can be either the bleed air directly from the bleed air source, or the bleed air expanded by the power turbine, or a mixture of both.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0037">Advantageously and according to the invention, the system further comprises a turbofan which is arranged in said ram-air circulation channel downstream of said primary exchanger and is suitable for being able to be connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said bleed air source.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0038">According to this alternative, the air circulation in the ram-air circulation channel is provided by a turbofan supplied with the bleed air. According to another alternative, the turbine engine may comprise a fan mounted on the shaft which mechanically connects the power turbine engine and the compressor.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0039">Advantageously and according to the invention, said air cycle turbine engine further comprises:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0040">at least a second turbine which is mechanically connected to said compressor and to said power turbine, said second expansion turbine comprising at least a first air inlet which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said main cooling exchanger and an air outlet which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said cabin,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0041">a water extraction loop arranged between said main cooling exchanger and said second turbine so as to be able to extract the water present in the air fed by said main cooling exchanger before being fed to this second expansion turbine.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0033" num="0042">According to this advantageous alternative, the system comprises a water extraction loop and at least a second turbine mounted on the shaft of the turbine engine.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">Advantageously and according to the invention, said second expansion turbine comprises at least a second air inlet which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to an air outlet of said cabin, referred to as a recovery air outlet, such that this recovery air discharged from said cabin (<b>10</b>) can form a pneumatic energy source for driving said second turbine.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044">This advantageous alternative makes it possible to recover the air discharged from the cabin in order to provide an additional pneumatic energy source, thus making it possible to limit the need for bleed air in order to for the compressor to be driven via the power turbine. In other words, the second turbine participates in driving the compressor by using the recovery air as an additional pneumatic energy source.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">Advantageously and according to the invention, the system further comprises at least one heat exchanger, referred to as an intercooler, comprising a primary circuit which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said recovery air outlet of said cabin and to said second inlet of said second expansion turbine, in thermal interaction with a secondary circuit which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network to said air outlet of said compressor and to said primary cooling exchanger or to said pipe network downstream of said main cooling exchanger.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">This advantageous alternative combines the various advantages already discussed and also makes it possible, due to the presence of the intercooler, to cool the outlet of air compressed by the compressor. In particular, in flight, the supply of cold power upstream of the cold pass of the primary exchanger by the power turbine makes it possible to reduce the flow of ram air required for cooling the pack and consequently the drag of the transport vehicle. In addition, the cabin air, rejected by the pressurization system, is favorably directed through the intercooler in order to cool the outlet of the compressor (thermal recovery of cabin energy). This heated air is then expanded to the external pressure through the second turbine, the mechanical energy produced contributing favorably to the drive of the air cycle turbine engine (recovery of the pneumatic energy of the cabin). The cold air from the turbine is favorably injected into the cold pass of the MHX in order to contribute to its cooling and reduce the need for ram air (and therefore the drag of the aircraft if the system is provided in an aircraft).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">Advantageously and according to the invention, the air cycle turbine engine further comprises at least one third turbine which is mechanically connected to said compressor, to said power turbine and to said second expansion turbine, said third turbine comprising a first air inlet which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said air outlet of said second turbine and an air outlet which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said cabin.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048">According to this advantageous alternative, the air cycle turbine engine is a 4-wheel machine consisting of a compressor and three turbines, including a power turbine.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0049">Advantageously and according to this alternative, said third expansion turbine comprises at least a second air inlet which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said recovery air outlet such that this recovery air discharged from said cabin can form a pneumatic energy source for driving said third turbine.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0050">In other words, according to this alternative, said second and third expansion turbines each comprise at least a second air inlet which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said recovery air outlet so that this recovery air discharged from said cabin can form a pneumatic energy source for driving said second and third turbines. The second and third turbines thus participate in driving the compressor by using the recovery air as an additional pneumatic energy source.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">If the system comprises two expansion turbines in addition to the power turbine, said intercooler advantageously comprises a primary circuit which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network, upon control of at least one control valve, to said recovery air outlet of said cabin and to said second inlets of said second and third expansion turbines, in thermal interaction with a secondary circuit which is suitable for being able to be fluidically connected by said pipe network to said air outlet of said compressor and to said primary cooling exchanger or to said pipe network downstream of said main cooling exchanger.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">According to this advantageous alternative, the supply of cold power upstream of the cold pass of the primary exchanger by the power turbine makes it possible (depending on the conditions of use of the vehicle, that is to say when an aircraft is in flight) to reduce the flow of ram air required for cooling the pack and consequently the drag of the transport vehicle. In addition, the cabin air, rejected by the pressurization system, is favorably directed through the intercooler in order to cool the outlet of the compressor (thermal recovery of cabin energy). This heated air is then expanded to the external pressure through the second and third turbines, the mechanical energy produced contributing favorably to the drive of the air cycle turbine engine (recovery of the pneumatic energy of the cabin). The cold air from the turbines is favorably injected into the cold pass of the MHX in order to contribute to its cooling and reduce the need for ram air (and therefore the drag of the aircraft if the

conditioning a cabin of an air or rail transport vehicle comprising a hot and pressurized air source, referred to as a bleed air source, a fresh outside air source, a channel for circulating ram air drawn from outside the aircraft, a cooling exchanger, referred to as a primary exchanger (PHX), which is accommodated in said ram-air circulation channel, a cooling exchanger, referred to as a main

This pipe <b>53</b> is provided with the control valve <b>21</b>. This control valve <b>21</b> makes it possible to modulate the quantity of expanded bleed air mixed with the compressed air from the compressor <b>3</b>. Indeed, if this control valve <b>21</b> is partially opened, a portion of the bleed air expanded by the turbine <b>4</b> is directed through the pipe <b>54</b> in order to be mixed with the air from the pipe <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0077">Upstream of the control valve <b>25</b>, the system further comprises a pipe <b>55</b> that is provided with a control valve <b>24</b> which makes it possible to supply a turbofan <b>9</b> accommodated in the channel <b>12</b>.

This feature makes it possible that in the heating mode, the air from the compressor is heated through the PHX (the cold pass of the exchanger being supplied with the hot air from the power turbine <b>3</b>), bypasses the exchanger MHX (so as not to be cooled by this exchanger) by the pipe <b>57</b> in order to then be able to be supplied to the cabin directly (by opening the altitude valve <b>33</b>).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0081">If the control valve <b>20</b> closes, which corresponds to a cooling mode, the air from the primary circuit of the exchanger PHX is directed to the primary circuit of the exchanger MHX so as to be subjected to cooling there, then moves toward the cabin, after passing through a water extraction loop and the expansion turbines <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0082">The water extraction loop is formed by a condenser <b>63</b> and a water separator <b>64</b>. The operation of such a water extraction loop is known and is not explained here in detail. The air dried by the water extraction loop is expanded by the turbine <b>5</b> which comprises a first air inlet <b>5</b><i>a </i>supplied with the dried air from the water separator <b>64</b> and an air outlet <b>5</b><i>b </i>which is connected to the air inlet <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the third expansion turbine <b>6</b>.

Thus, the air recovered from the cabin is used to supply a surplus of pneumatic energy which is intended to drive the turbine engine. This recirculation circuit further comprises an intercooler-like heat exchanger <b>65</b>, which provides heat exchanges between the recovery air which circulates in the pipe <b>59</b> and the compressed air from the compressor <b>3</b> which circulates in the pipe <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0084">The system also comprises pipes <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> that are each provided with a control valve <b>29</b>, <b>32</b> and make it possible to fluidically connect the outlet of the turbines <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and the ram-air recirculation channel <b>13</b>. Thus, the air expanded by the turbines <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> can be favorably injected into the cold pass of the exchangers MHX and PHX in order to participate in the cooling of the air, which contributes to reducing the need for ram air, and consequently to reducing aircraft drag.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0085">An air conditioning system according to the invention thus makes it possible, by control of the control valves <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> associated with the pipes <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>59</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, to have at least one of the following operating modes:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0086">an operating mode, referred to as a routine mode, in which said inlet of said power turbine <b>4</b><i>a </i>is supplied with said bleed air source <b>12</b> in order to be able to rotate said compressor <b>3</b> supplied with the fresh air source <b>11</b>, and said air outlet <b>4</b><i>b </i>of said power turbine <b>4</b> supplies said ram-air channel <b>12</b> with expanded bleed air.
