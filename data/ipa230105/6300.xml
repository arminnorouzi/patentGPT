DE 10 2021 206 790.5, filed on Jun. 30, 2021 in Germany, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A battery pack for a hand-held power tool, comprising a cell connector, is described in DE 10 2014 217 991 A1.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure relates to a battery pack comprising a housing, comprising a cell holder, comprising at least one battery cell, the battery cell being at least partially received in the cell holder, comprising a cell connector, the cell connector being designed for electrical connection of the battery cell, and comprising a printed circuit board, the cell connector being electrically connected to the printed circuit board. It is proposed that the battery pack have a mounting element to support the connection of the cell connector to the printed circuit board, the mounting element being located in a cut-out of the printed circuit board. Advantageously, a very good interfacing of the cell connector to the printed circuit board can thereby be realized.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The battery pack is in particular part of a system composed of the battery pack and a load, the load being supplied with power during operation via the battery pack. The battery pack maybe realized, for example, as a hand-held power-tool battery pack or as an electric-bicycle battery pack. The battery pack is in particular realized as an interchangeable battery pack that is designed to be detachable from the load without use of tools. The battery pack is in particular designed to be connectable to a charging device for charging the battery pack. Alternatively or additionally, the battery pack may also be realized in such a manner that it can be charged when connected to the load.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The load may be realized, in particular, as a garden appliance such as, for example, a lawn mower or hedge trimmer, as a household appliance such as, for example, an electric window cleaner or hand-held vacuum cleaner, as a hand-held power tool such as, for example, an angle grinder, a screwdriver, a power drill, a hammer drill, etc., or as an electric means of transport such as, for example, and electric bicycle in the form of a pedelec or e-bike, or as a measuring tool such as, for example, a laser distance measuring device. Furthermore, it is also conceivable for the load to be realized as another device, in particular a portable device such as, for example, a construction site light, a suction extraction device or a construction site radio.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The housing of the battery pack is preferably realized as an outer housing. The battery pack, in particular the housing of the battery pack, can be detachably connected to the load and/or a charging device via a mechanical interface. The housing of the battery pack may have one or more housing parts. The housing has at least one housing part that is realized as an outer housing part. The outer housing part in this case delimits the battery pack outwardly and can be touched by a user. In addition, the housing may have at least one inner housing part that is fully enclosed by the at least one housing part. Preferably, the cell holder is realized as one of the housing parts, in which case the cell holder maybe realized as an outer housing part or as an inner housing part. The housing parts are connected to each other in a force-fitting, form-fitting and/or materially bonded manner.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The battery pack can be connected to the load in a force-fitting and/or form-fitting manner via a mechanical interface. Advantageously, the mechanical interface comprises at least one actuating element via which the connection of the battery pack to the load and/or to the charging device can be released. The actuating element maybe realized, for example, as a button, a lever or a key. In addition, the battery pack has at least one electrical interface via which the battery pack can be electrically connected to the load and/or to the charging device. The battery pack can be charged and/or discharged, for example, via the electrical connection. Alternatively or additionally, it is also conceivable that information can be transmitted from the battery pack to the load and vice versa via the electrical interface. The electrical interface is preferably realized as a contact interface in which the electrical connection is made via a physical contact between at least two conductive components. The electrical interface preferably comprises at least two electrical contact elements.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In particular, one of the electrical contact elements is realized as a plus contact and the other electrical contact element is realized as a minus contact. In addition, the electrical interface may have at least one additional contact that is designed to transmit additional information to the load and/or to the charging device. The additional contacts may be realized as signal contacts, coding contacts, temperature contacts, etc. The electrical contact elements may be realized, for example, as resilient contact elements in the form of contact tulips, or as flat contacts in the form of contact blades. Alternatively or additionally, the electrical interface may have a secondary charging coil element for inductive charging. Furthermore, the at least one battery cell that can be electrically connected to the load via the electrical contact device is located in the housing of the battery pack.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, the battery pack preferably comprises a set of electronics. The set of electronics may comprise, for example, a computing unit, a control unit, a transistor, a capacitor, and/or the memory unit. Additionally or alternatively, it is also conceivable for information to be ascertained by the set of electronics. The set of electronics is designed to control the battery pack and/or the load by open-loop or closed-loop control. The set of electronics comprises, in particular, a BMS (battery management system) designed to monitor the battery pack. The BMS is in particular realized to prevent overcharging and/or exhaustive discharging of the battery pack.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the BMS is realized for correct cell symmetrization, or cell balancing. The set of electronics may additionally comprise one or more sensor elements, for example a temperature sensor for ascertaining the temperature within the battery pack, or a motion sensor for ascertaining movements. The set of electronics may alternatively or additionally comprise a coding element such as, for example, a coding resistor. The electrical contact elements of the electrical interface of the battery pack may be located on or connected to the printed circuit board of the set of electronics. The printed circuit board may be realized as a rigid printed circuit board or a flexible printed circuit board. The printed circuit board may have an organic or an inorganic substrate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The cell holder is preferably made of a plastic, in particular a thermoplastic. The cell holder is preferably made of a temperature-resistant plastic, preferably a fiber-reinforced plastic. The cell holder is preferably realized as a single part or as a single piece. In the context of this application, as a single piece is to be understood to mean in particular a component that is realized from one piece and is not realized from a plurality of components that are connected to one another in a materially bonded and/or in a force-fitting and/or form-fitting manner. Accordingly, a single-piece component is composed of a single material. In the context of this application, as a single part is to be understood to mean in particular a plurality of components that are connected to one another via a material bond, for example by means of a two-component injection molding process. A single-part component may thus be composed of one material or of a plurality of materials. Alternatively, it is also conceivable for the cell holder to be of a multipart design, in which case the different parts are connected to one another in a force-fitting and/or form-fitting manner.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The cell holder has at least one battery cell receiver in which a single battery cell can be received. Alternatively, it is also conceivable for the battery cell receivers to be realized in such a manner that two or more battery cells can be received in them. The battery cell receiver is in particular realized in such a manner that, when connected to the battery cell, a large part of the outer surface, in particular a large part of the peripheral surface of the battery cell, is enclosed by the battery cell receiver. In particular, at least 60%, preferably at least 75%, preferably at least 90%, of the peripheral surface of the battery cell is enclosed against the battery cell receiver. Preferably, the battery cell receiver is realized in such a manner that the at least one battery cell bears against an inner surface of the battery cell and is fixed in place by the battery cell receiver. The cell holder has a wall between two battery cell receivers which spatially and electrically isolates the battery cell receivers from each other.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The battery cell may be realized as a galvanic cell, having a structure in which one cell terminal is located at one end and another cell terminal is located at an opposite end. In particular, the battery cell has a positive cell terminal at one end and a negative cell terminal at an opposite end. Preferably, the battery cells are realized as NiCd or NiMh, and particularly preferably lithium-based battery cells, or Li-Ion battery cells. Alternatively, it is also conceivable, exemplarily, for the battery cell to be realized as a pouch cell. The battery voltage of the battery pack is usually a multiple of the voltage of a single battery cell and results from the connection (parallel or serial) of the battery cells. In the case of common battery cells having a voltage of 3.6 V, this results in exemplary battery voltages of 3.6 V, 7.2 V, 10.8 V, 14.4 V, 18 V, 36 V, 54 V, 108 V, etc. Preferably, the battery cell is realized as an at least substantially cylindrical round cell, with the cell terminals located at the ends of the cylinder shape.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The cell connectors are designed to electrically connect the at least one battery cell to the printed circuit board The cell connectors can be of a single-piece, single-part or multipart design. The cell connectors can be connected in a force-fitting and/or form-fitting manner to the housing of the battery pack, in particular to the cell holder. It is also conceivable for the cell connector to be partially or fully encapsulated by the housing, in particular the cell holder. The cell connector is made of a metallic material. For example, the cell connector may be made of a pure copper (copper content &#x3e;95%), a copper alloy or a nickel compound. The battery cells are each connected at their cell terminals to a cell connector.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cell connector has a cell connecting element for electrical connection of the battery cells, and a printed-circuit-board connecting element for electrical connection to the printed circuit board. The cell connecting element in this case bears directly and immediately against the battery cell, in particular a cell terminal of the battery cell, and is preferably connected to the cell terminal in a materially bonded manner. The material bond may be effected by a soldering process or by a welding process, in particular by a resistance welding process or by a laser welding process. In this context, the welded joint differs from the soldered joint, in particular, in that, in the case of the welded joint, there is partial melting of the components to be connected. The material bond may be effected with the aid of a material bonding medium. In the case of a soldering process, the material bonding medium is realized as a solder. In the case of a welding process, the material bonding medium may be realized, for example, as a metal plate that locally increases the resistance. The printed-circuit-board connecting element may be connected directly to the printed circuit board, in particular to a conducting track of the printed circuit board, or indirectly to the printed circuit board via an electrical contact element.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The printed circuit board is preferably realized as a flat and rigid printed circuit board. The printed circuit board has an upper side and an underside, the underside facing toward the battery cells. The cut-out is realized in such a manner that a passage is formed between the upper side and the underside by means of the cut-out. The cut-out may be located at the edge of the printed circuit board or inside the printed circuit board. The cut-out may thus have a closed or an open edge.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The mounting element is preferably realized as a single piece or single part with the housing or the cell holder.
