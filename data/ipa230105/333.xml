More specifically the invention relates to a re-settable clamp for a bronchoscopic tube to repeatedly fix and release the tube to facilitate repositioning and stabilisation during the medical procedure.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Bronchoscopy is a procedure that allows a doctor to examine and operate in the upper airways, trachea, bronchi and smaller airways with a flexible multi-channel tube carrying a mini camera built into its tip. The tube is inserted into the airways, usually through the mouth, occasionally via the nose, a tracheostomy, or an endotracheal tube.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The doctor usually works with two assistants. One handles the bronchoscope passing it to the doctor who inserts and positions it in the patient's lung and who during the procedure repeatedly repositions it. This individual also assists the operator with transfer of instruments for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes via the working channel of the bronchoscope as well as the acquisition and preparation of samples where indicated. The second assistant secures the bronchoscope manually at the patient's mouth after each repositioning, in addition, keeping the patient's mouth clear of pooled secretions with a sucker, monitoring vital observations, and providing comfort and reassurance to the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Dependence on trained staff is a necessity. In developing countries and increasingly a resource-starved British NHS it is a problem for personnel management.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention seeks to provide a re-settable clamp which secures the bronchoscope in position at multiple sites selected by the doctor/operator, with the potential for reducing fatigue, repetitive strain, and dependence on assistants, and ultimately, ensuring patient safety.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">STATEMENT OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect there is provided a clamp for inter alia a bronchoscope, the clamp comprising a spine having at one end a frame, the frame having a defined channel through which a tube of inter alia the bronchoscope is received, the frame further having clamping means to grip the tube within the frame to fix it in position, the clamping means being releasable to allow further movement of the tube relative to the frame.</p><p id="p-0008"

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Whilst the description refers to two embodiments, the main clamp structure and clamping mechanism is the same for both embodiments and the features of the invention described are applicable for the clamp shown in either <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the present invention provides a clamp for a bronchoscope tube. The clamp comprises a spine <b>2</b> which is orientated substantially vertically from the mouth of a supine patient during use.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The spine <b>2</b> has a generally C-shaped profile consisting of horizontally orientated end arms connected by a curve stem. The stem is curved for comfort and ease of use but may be straight.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">One end (the top end <b>4</b> in use) has connected to it, a frame section <b>6</b> that extends generally horizontally from the end of spine <b>2</b>, generally perpendicular to its stem.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As can be seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the connection between the end face of the spine <b>2</b> and the respective end <b>8</b> of the frame section <b>6</b> defines a vertical extending through-channel <b>10</b> via which a tube <b>12</b> of a bronchoscope is passed during use. The tube <b>12</b> is shown in dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The entrance of the channel <b>10</b> is formed as a funnel <b>14</b> to receive and direct the tube <b>12</b> through the channel <b>10</b> to the base of the clamp and ultimately into the airway of a patient positioned below the clamp.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The frame section <b>6</b> and spine <b>2</b> may alternatively be formed integral with each other with the channel being defined by a through-aperture in the frame.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The distal end surface of the frame section <b>6</b> is formed as a push-button <b>16</b> to be depressed inwardly into the frame <b>6</b> by the user. As will be explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, depression of the button <b>16</b> causes the tube <b>12</b> to be gripped and retained in position at a desired height within the clamp.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The frame section <b>6</b> has a hollow tubular structure to house the clamping components. The components include, on one side of the tube <b>12</b>, the push button <b>16</b> and a first clamping member <b>18</b> slidable within the frame housing <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the first clamping member <b>18</b> is spring loaded by having a coiled spring <b>19</b> on each side of the member <b>18</b> and is biased against the button <b>16</b>. The springs <b>19</b> cause the button <b>16</b> to also be spring loaded.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a tubular sleeve <b>20</b> made of silicone rubber or similar material is provided within the channel <b>10</b> through which the bronchoscopic tube <b>12</b> extends at the junction between the frame section <b>6</b> and the spine <b>2</b>. The sleeve <b>20</b> forms the side walls of the channel <b>10</b> within the frame section <b>6</b>. The walls of the sleeve <b>20</b> are deformable so as to grip the tube <b>12</b> when squeezed from one or both sides.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The horizontally aligned arm section <b>22</b> at the top of the spine <b>2</b> includes a longitudinal channel through which extends a second clamping member <b>26</b> the end of which abuts the respective side of the sleeve <b>20</b>. The distal end of the second clamping member <b>26</b> has an integrally formed end cap <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The end cap <b>28</b> extends beyond the width of the second clamping member <b>26</b> such that it abuts against the outer wall of the arm section <b>22</b> of the spine <b>2</b> to limit the amount the second clamping member <b>26</b> can be depressed into the frame section <b>6</b>, thereby to restrict the extent that the sleeve <b>20</b> can be deformed from that side in order to protect the tube <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The outer face of the button <b>16</b> has a curved depression <b>34</b> to receive and accommodate the thumb of the user to provide comfort to the user when depressing the button <b>16</b> which is likely to be required many times during the procedure. It can also be seen that the outer surface of the button <b>16</b> has an outwardly protruding projection <b>36</b> which extends beyond the dimensions of the frame <b>6</b>. The projection <b>36</b> provides an abutment surface <b>38</b> which abuts, in use the end surface <b>40</b> of the frame <b>6</b> thereby to limit the depression distance of the button <b>16</b> into the housing <b>6</b> thereby to restrict the extent that the sleeve <b>20</b> can be deformed from that side in order to protect the tube <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Depression of the button <b>16</b> pushes the first clamping member <b>18</b> against the bias of the springs <b>19</b> into the frame section <b>6</b>. Movement of the first clamping member <b>18</b> causes the end <b>42</b> of the clamping member <b>18</b> to abut and press against the channel sleeve <b>20</b> to deform the sleeve <b>20</b> slightly thereby to grip the tube <b>12</b>, preventing any further vertical movement of the tube <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">To cater for tubes <b>12</b> of varying diameter the distance the second clamping member <b>26</b> extends into the channel <b>24</b> can be delicately adjusted by rotation of the end cap <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The materials of the clamping components are carefully chosen to provide a delicate clamping mechanism to avoid any damage to the bronchosopic tube <b>12</b>. Moreover, the grip of the tube <b>12</b> is such that it allows for rotation and manoeuvring of the tube <b>12</b> to vary the camera angle where necessary. The grip effectively acts as a gentle pivot point which allows for tube movement without affecting its height.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first clamping member <b>18</b> includes a circumferential flange with projections <b>44</b> that come to project out of an aperture <b>46</b> of the frame section <b>6</b>. The projections <b>44</b> have an abutment face <b>48</b> that abuts against the wall of the aperture <b>46</b> thereby locking the first clamping member <b>18</b> in position and preventing it from releasing but allowing further movement of the projection along the aperture towards the channel sleeve <b>20</b>. The other surface of the projections <b>44</b> opposite the abutment face <b>48</b> is angled so to allow further insertion of the first clamping member <b>18</b> subject to its maximum insertion depth.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the button <b>6</b> includes a T-shaped projection <b>49</b> that is received within a complimentary shaped recess in the first clamping member <b>18</b>. The connection allows the button <b>16</b> to be moved in a vertical direction whilst still remaining engaged with the clamping member <b>18</b>. The T-shaped projection <b>49</b> includes a locking tab (not shown) that extends through a further aperture <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b></figref>) in the frame section <b>6</b> when the button <b>16</b> is lifted by the thumb of an operator in order to lock the clamping member <b>18</b> in position.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The button <b>16</b> remains in such a position when the operator's thumb is removed from the button <b>16</b> and is only released when the operator pushes the button <b>16</b> downwardly to release the tab from the aperture <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The projections <b>44</b> and tab restrict the excursion of the first clamping member <b>18</b> preventing its ejection from the frame <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Whilst the first clamping member <b>18</b> is locked in position the tube <b>12</b> remains clamped in place, subject to its movement previously described. The clamp is reset when the operator fully releases the clamping member <b>18</b>. This allows the tube <b>12</b> to be re-positioned for fixing at a different height.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a hand grip <b>47</b> for connection to the clamp. The hand grip <b>47</b> is ergonomically designed to provide maximum comfort to both right-handed and left-handed users. The grip <b>47</b> has a smooth and sculptured surface. In an alternative embodiment, the surface of the grip may include a plurality of grooves to increase the grip.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The hand grip <b>47</b> is designed to be clipped on to the clamp by a push-fit mechanism to allow easy connection and disconnection. To this end the hand grip <b>48</b> has an arcuate structure to compliment the curvature of the stem of the spine <b>2</b> and has a U-shaped resilient clip connector <b>50</b> which, in use, clips around the base of the funnel <b>14</b> and a further U-shaped resilient clip connector that clips around spine <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the base of the clamp connected to a mouthpiece adapter <b>54</b> to be placed in use, within the mouth of the patient such that the clamp extends upwardly from the supine patient's face.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The adapter <b>54</b> is of a form commonly used on medical apparatus and includes a face guard <b>56</b> section and a middle section <b>58</b> with a throughbore <b>60</b> providing a guiding channel within the patient's mouth through which the bronchoscopic tube <b>12</b> passes before entering the airways.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the clamp of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with an endotracheal tube (ETT) adaptor <b>62</b> connected to the base of the spine <b>2</b>. This permits connection to a double swivel elbow-joint with bronchoscopy port (not shown in the figures). This for example, allows the clamp to be suitable for use with patients under general anaesthetic.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The clamp herein before described provides an effective way to continually fix and release the bronchoscopic tube requiring little effort and movement of the doctor and little discomfort to the patient, thereby allowing the doctor greater flexibility to provide an effective bronchoscopy without assistance.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Whilst the embodiments described specifically relate to a bronchoscope, the clamp may have utility with any device that requires a re-settable clamping mechanism of a tube element.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
