For example, authentication applications are known that can unlock a door using a mobile device. The authentication application can be installed on the mobile device in advance and can store the authentication data that replaces, for example, the uses of a physical card for access to a building, car, and the like. Using communication technology such as near-field communication (NFC) installed in the mobile device, by holding the mobile device over an authenticator installed next to the door, the authentication flow using the authentication data is started, and when the authentication is successful. The technology can be used to unlock the door, which replaces the flow realized by physical cards with mobile devices. In addition, as a technology that further develops this, it is also known to use communication technology such as Bluetooth installed in mobile devices to communicate with an authenticator or reader even from a remote position and unlock the door. However, in order to realize these, it is necessary to enable the NFC, Bluetooth, and GPS functions installed in the mobile device in advance.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Even when the door is not unlocked, it is necessary to enable NFC, Bluetooth, and GPS functions, etc. As a result, since the above functions operate in the background, power consumption during that period is required, and there is a risk of consuming the battery of the mobile device more than necessary. For such risks, workarounds such as enabling these functions only when the user wants to unlock the door and disabling these functions at other times can be considered, which can affect the user's convenience,</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In consideration of the above issues, it would be desirable to have a method and system that keeps the convenience of unlocking the door while reducing battery consumption when NFC, Bluetooth, and GPS functions are enabled in a mobile device such that by automatically changing the state of the location services, for example, the GPS function on a mobile device, communication with an authenticator that permits access to an authenticated mobile. In addition, it would be desirable that a system and method that can be implemented while suppressing battery consumption due to standby power of each function of the mobile device and without impairing the convenience of the user to access buildings and the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with an aspect, a method is disclosed for reducing battery consumption of mobiles devices with location settings, the method comprising: enabling a location setting on the mobile device, the location setting having an on state and an off state, the on state being a state in which location services are available to applications on the mobile device and the off state being a state in which location services are not available to applications on the mobile device; checking a battery life of the mobile device; and when the battery life of the mobile device is less than or equal to a preset threshold: changing a status of the location setting on the mobile device to the off state from the on state when the mobile device is not running an application that is using the location services; or maintaining the location setting in the on state when one or more applications are using the location services.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another aspect, a non-transitory computer readable medium storing computer readable program code executed by a processor for reducing battery consumption of mobiles devices with location settings, the process comprising: enabling a location setting on the mobile device, the location setting having an on state and an off state, the on state being a state in which location services are available to applications on the mobile device and the off state being a state in which location services are not available to applications on the mobile device; checking a battery life of the mobile device; and when the battery life of the mobile device is less than or equal to a preset threshold: changing a status of the location setting on the mobile device to the off state from the on state when the mobile device is not running an application that is using the location services; or maintaining the location setting in the on state when one or more applications are using the location services.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an aspect, a mobile device having a battery consumption application is disclosed, the mobile device comprising: a memory; and a processor configured to: enable a location setting on the mobile device, the location setting having an on state and an off state, the on state being a state in which location services are available to applications on the mobile device and the off state being a state in which location services are not available to applications on the mobile device; check a battery life of the mobile device; and when the battery life of the mobile device is less than or equal to a preset threshold: change a status of the location setting on the mobile device to the off state from the on state when the mobile device is not running an application that is using the location services; or maintain the location setting in the on state when one or more applications are using the location services.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the invention, and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.

The authentication application, for example, allows the user <b>130</b> to access (i.e., unlocks a door) the building <b>110</b> by bringing his mobile device <b>120</b> into contact with the authenticator <b>112</b> or within a define range or distance to the authenticator <b>112</b>. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the defined range can be based on the type of means of communication between the mobile device <b>120</b> and the authenticator <b>112</b>. For example, the mobile device <b>120</b> can be equipped with a global position satellite (GPS) module which can act as a means of identifying an authentication area and Bluetooth or NFC or both can be used as a means of communication for authentication. For example, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the GPS module can be used to trigger the on/off settings of the authentication communication to automatically switch the authentication application into an on state from an off state.

In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the applications <b>340</b> can include, for example, an authentication application <b>210</b> and a battery consumption application <b>220</b>. The processor or CPU <b>310</b> carries out the instructions of a computer program, which operates and/or controls at least a portion of the functionality of the mobile device <b>120</b>.

In the enabled or the on state, a receiver of the GPS function on the mobile device calculates a position and time based on data received from multiple GPS satellites. Each satellite carries an accurate record of its position and time, and transmits that data to the receiver. In the exemplary embodiment, the location service on the mobile device is preferably GPS.

For example, the preset threshold can be 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the remaining battery life of the mobile device <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In step <b>430</b>, if the battery life remaining on the mobile device <b>120</b> has fallen below the preset threshold, the process continues to step <b>440</b> where the application <b>340</b> is configured to determine if the application <b>340</b> is using the GPS function on the mobile device <b>120</b>. In step <b>450</b>, if the mobile device <b>120</b> is running the GPS function, the process continues to step <b>460</b> where the GPS function on the mobile device <b>120</b> is turned off. Alternatively, in step <b>450</b>, if the mobile device <b>120</b> is running the GPS function, the process continues to step <b>470</b> in which the GPS function of the mobile device <b>120</b> remains in the state of on.

In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the process can return, for example, to step <b>410</b>, at a predefined intervals.
