For example, servers may store financial or technology information that should be kept secret. In the case of data centers, servers are stored in a secured environment where it is difficult for a someone to tamper with a server or otherwise physically remove a server to obtain the stored data or to steal the server.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In many instances, a computing device, such as a server, may include a security feature for preventing data theft or tampering by physical intrusion. As an example, the computing device may include use of accelerometers and gyroscopic sensors to detect changes in orientation of the computing device. The accelerometers and sensors may detect motion that indicates that the device has been dismounted from a wall and transferred to a tabletop for inspection. When this motion is detected, the computing device may take steps to prevent access to its stored data.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Edge computing applications presents additional challenges for securing computing devices and their data. In these applications, there can be a greater likelihood of tampering, so there is a greater need to protect sensitive data and to prevent theft. In an example, a retail store may have need for a server capability with commensurate security requirements for the financial data of its customers, but it cannot typically provide as much site security as a dedicated data center can.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, there is an increasing need to prevent data access and tampering of computing device and other electronic devices.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Having thus described the presently disclosed subject matter in general terms, reference will now be made to the accompanying Drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of mobile equipment carrying an electronic device with a tamper detection system in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is another diagram of mobile equipment carrying an electronic device with a tamper detection system in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an example method for tamper detection of an electronic device in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of a tamper detection system in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram of another example method for tamper detection of an electronic device in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The presently disclosed subject matter relates to tamper detection systems and methods for electronic devices carried by mobile equipment.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the mobile equipment <b>100</b> is a truck with a cargo area <b>101</b>. The electronic device <b>102</b> is contained within the cargo area <b>101</b>. Further, the electronic device <b>102</b> can be suitably mounted or attached to an assembly within the cargo area <b>101</b>. In this example, the electronic device <b>102</b> is an edge computing device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A motion sensor <b>104</b> can be into the electronic device <b>102</b> or otherwise associated with the electronic device <b>102</b>. For example, the motion sensor <b>104</b> may be apart from the electronic device <b>102</b> but have a direct attachment to or at least a loose attachment to the electronic device <b>102</b> such that the motion of the motion sensor <b>104</b> is the same as or substantially matches the electronic device's <b>102</b> movement. In this example, the motion sensor <b>104</b> is resides within the electronic device <b>102</b>. Alternatively, for example, the motion sensor <b>104</b> can be attached to the mounting assembly that attaches the electronic device <b>102</b> to the mobile equipment <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The motion sensor <b>104</b> or any other motion sensor described herein can be any suitable device for detecting its motion and generating output data representative of the detected motion. The motion sensor can be used for determining a direction of movement, a velocity, a speed, acceleration, and/or the like. For example, a motion sensor can be an accelerometer operable to measure acceleration. In another example, a motion sensor can be a gyroscope operable to measure orientation and/or angular velocity. In another example, a motion sensor can be a GPS sensor for detecting a position. The output data of the motion sensor may be suitably communicated to another device for processing. In this example, the motion sensor <b>104</b> can detect the motion of the electronic device <b>102</b> and output data representative of the motion of the electronic device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The system includes another motion sensor <b>108</b> that is configured for attachment to the mobile equipment <b>100</b> and configured to detect motion of the mobile equipment <b>100</b>. In this example, the motion sensor <b>108</b> is positioned within the cargo area <b>101</b>. The motion sensor <b>108</b> can be attached to an interior wall of the cargo area <b>101</b> or any other suitable place for mounting. The motion sensor <b>108</b> is attached in this manner directly to the mobile equipment in order to accurately detect the motion of the mobile equipment <b>100</b>, rather than the electronic device <b>102</b>. Conversely, the other motion sensor <b>104</b> is attached directly to or is a part of the electronic device <b>102</b> in order to accurately detect the motion of the electronic device <b>102</b>, rather than the mobile equipment <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The electronic device <b>102</b> can include a tamper detection module <b>106</b>. The tamper detection module <b>106</b> may include suitable hardware, software, firmware, or combinations thereof for implementing the functionality described herein. For example, the tamper detection module <b>106</b> may include memory and one or more processors for implementing the functionality described herein. In some examples, the tamper detector module <b>106</b> may be implemented by a baseboard management controller (BMC) of a computer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates another diagram of mobile equipment <b>100</b> carrying an electronic device <b>102</b> with a tamper detection system in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, this system is similar to the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> except for the placement of the motion sensor <b>108</b> being distanced farther from the electronic device <b>106</b>. In this way, the comparison of the difference in the motion detected by the motion sensor <b>108</b> to motion sensor <b>104</b> can be more accurate. As described in further detail herein, the example methods for detecting tampering can include a comparison of the motion detected by the two sensors, such that an accurate comparison can better detect the tampering. In an example, the motion sensor <b>108</b> may be attached to a vehicle's chassis so that the effects of the suspension would be equal to both the electronic device <b>106</b> and the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram of an example method for tamper detection of an electronic device in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The method is described by example as being implemented by the system show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, although it should be understood that the method may be implemented by any suitable system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the method includes detecting <b>300</b> motion of an electronic device attached to mobile equipment. For example, the motion sensor <b>104</b> can detect the motion of electronic device <b>102</b> and output a signal representative of the detected motion. The tamper detection module <b>106</b> can receive the output signal and store the signal data. It is noted that the detected motion as described herein can be, for example, movement of the electronic device in a direction, acceleration of the electronic device, the like, or combinations thereof. The represented data may be any suitable measure of the detected motion. It is noted that suitable filtering may be used to reduce or eliminate noise from a motion sensor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes detecting <b>302</b> motion of the mobile equipment. Continuing the aforementioned example, the motion sensor <b>108</b> can detect the motion of mobile equipment <b>100</b> and output a signal representative of the detected motion. The tamper detection module <b>106</b> can receive the output signal and store the signal data. The motion sensor <b>108</b> may wirelessly communicate the output signal to the electronic device. For example, the wireless communication may be by use of Bluetooth, Zigbee or any other suitable wireless communication technique.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes determining <b>304</b> a difference between the detected motion of the electronic device and the detected motion of the mobile equipment. Continuing the aforementioned example, the tamper detection module <b>106</b> can determine a difference between the detected motion of the electronic device <b>102</b> and the detected motion of the mobile equipment <b>100</b>. For example, at a particular time or within a particular time period, the output data from the motion sensor <b>104</b> may indicate the movement or acceleration of the electronic device <b>102</b>. Further, at the same time or timer period, the output data from the motion sensor <b>108</b> may indicate the movement or acceleration of the mobile equipment <b>100</b>. Further, the tamper detection module <b>106</b> may subtract the indicated amount of movement or acceleration of the electronic device <b>102</b> from the indicated amount of movement or acceleration of the mobile equipment <b>100</b>. The result of the subtraction is the determined difference of motion and indicates the actual relative movement of the electronic device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes determining <b>306</b> a tamper condition for the electronic device based on the detected motion of the electronic device and based on the determined difference. Continuing the aforementioned example, the tamper detection module <b>106</b> can use the determined difference of the mobile equipment <b>100</b> and the electronic device <b>102</b> to determine whether the electronic device <b>102</b> has been tampered with. For example, the difference may indicate a change in orientation and/or position of the electronic device <b>102</b>. In this example, the orientation and/or position change can be compared to predetermined criteria. In response to meeting the criteria, the tamper condition can be determined. A tamper condition may be determined if, based on the orientation and/or position change, it may be deduced that the electronic device <b>102</b> has been removed from it mount or otherwise moved in an unauthorized manner. In an example, the motion change may indicate that the electronic device <b>102</b> has been moved from the wall of the cargo area to a table top. In an example, tampering may be detected based on a series of particular movements/orientations that have been detected. For example, the motions/orientations can indicate dismounting and opening of service panels or access to electronic access points (e.g., a USB port, Ethernet port, or other physical or electronic access point whereby device data can be extracted).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes implementing <b>308</b> a security action in response to determining the tamper condition.
