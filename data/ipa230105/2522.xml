The method comprises applying a dose of electron-beam irradiation to an (electron beam)-curable (EBC) polyolefin compound to give a cured polyolefin product. The method forms covalent bonds directly between polyolefin macromolecules of the EBC polyolefin compound. The electron-beam curing method may be used to cure various types of polyolefins including low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and high density polyethylene (HDPE).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">We introduce problems of: (a) how to improve hot creep (hot set) performance of electron-beam cured polyethylenes, (b) how to increase electron-beam irradiation curing of (electron beam)-curable (EBC) polyolefin compounds, and (c) how to make a power cable containing an electron beam-cured insulation layer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Crosslinked low density polyethylene (XLDPE) and crosslinked linear low density polyethylene (XLLDPE) are used in various industrial applications wherein they are exposed to high operating temperatures, such as hot water pipes and insulation layers of electrical power cables. For these applications the crosslinked polyethylenes should have adequate hot creep (hot set) performance (i.e., retain its shape at operating temperature). Hot creep performance of (electron beam)-crosslinked high density polyethylene is usually weaker than that of (electron beam)-crosslinked linear low density polyethylene. Thus, merely blending a high density polyethylene into a linear low density polyethylene followed by electron-beam curing of the blend would not be expected to improve hot creep performance relative to that of the linear low density polyethylene alone.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the dose of electron-beam irradiation is too high, undesirable side-effects occur. These include generating excessive amounts of heat, electrical charges, and/or H<sub>2 </sub>gas. Excessive heat can lead to oxidation or deterioration of the cured polyolefin product. Excessive H<sub>2 </sub>gas can lead to bubble formation in the cured polyolefin product. Excessive electrical charges can lead to electrical discharges from the cured polyolefin product. If the applied dose is too low, the compound does not adequately cure or reach a sufficient cure state (extent of curing or crosslink density), and the performance of the incompletely cured polyolefin product may be unsuitable for an intended purpose such protecting a cable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">We disclose a technical solution to one or more of the introduced problems of: (a) how to improve hot creep (hot set) performance of electron-beam cured polyethylenes, (b) how to increase electron-beam irradiation curing of (electron beam)-curable (EBC) polyolefin compounds, and (c) how to make a power cable containing an electron beam-cured insulation layer. The technical solution includes an (electron beam)-curable (EBC) formulation comprising an EBC polyolefin compound (&#x201c;host resin&#x201d;) having a crystallinity of from 0 to less than 50 weight percent (wt %) and/or having a density of 0.930 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) or less; and an alkenyl-functional monocyclic organosiloxane (&#x201c;silicon-based coagent&#x201d;).

The EBC formulation may be cured in absence of a heat-induced free-radical generator compound such as an organic peroxide. The EBC formulation can be cured at a lower dose of the electron-beam irradiation than the dose used to cure the EBC polyolefin compound without the silicon-based coagent. Also, by virtue of the additional crosslinking effect of multivalent crosslinking groups derived from the silicon-based coagent, the resulting cured polyolefin product can reach an equal or greater cure state than that of a comparative cured polyolefin product prepared without the silicon-based coagent at the same lower EB dose. All other things being equal, the higher the loading of the silicon-based coagent in the EBC formulation, the lower the dose of electron-beam irradiation that may be used to achieve a given cure state (extent of crosslinking or crosslink density).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The Summary and Abstract are incorporated here by reference.

The curing reaction is conducted in such a way that the (B) alkenyl-functional monocyclic organosiloxane does not give a polymerized siloxane (silicone polymer) or silsesquioxane. We believe that the (B) alkenyl-functional monocyclic organosiloxane functions as a coagent (crosslinking agent) during electron beam curing of the EBC formulation and that the resulting cured polyolefin product has both direct polyolefin-polyolefin bonds and polyolefins crosslinked via a multivalent crosslinking group derived from the (B) alkenyl-functional monocyclic organosiloxane. Without being bound by theory it is believed that the constituents of the EBC formulation are chosen such that during electron beam curing of the EBC formulation the (B) alkenyl-functional monocyclic organosiloxane does not ring-open to give a ring-opened silanol (S&#x2014;OH)-functional organosiloxane oligomer (linear or branched), and therefore a polymerized siloxane (silicone polymer) or silsesquioxane is not formed in situ. Without being bound by theory it is believed that the (B) alkenyl-functional monocyclic organosiloxane cannot undergo ring-opening at least in part because the EBC formulation does not contain, and thus because the curing reaction is conducted in the absence of, the (b) ring opening catalyst that is a phosphazene base. In the absence of the phosphazene base, the EBC formulation undergoes crosslinking of the (B) alkenyl-functional monocyclic organosiloxane to the polyolefin polymer via free-radical curing to form the cured polyolefin product. The crosslinking beneficially occurs without ring opening of the (B) alkenyl-functional monocyclic organosiloxane even in the presence of ambient moisture.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additive: a solid or liquid compound or substance that imparts a desired property to a host polymer, or to a formulation comprising a masterbatch and host polymer, or to a reaction product prepared therefrom.

Elongation of the test sample (distance between marker lines) under these conditions is then measured, and expressed as a percentage of the initial 20 mm distance. To illustrate, if the distance between marker lines widens to 40 mm, the hot creep is 100% (100*(40&#x2212;20)/20)=100%), if widens to 100 mm, the hot creep is 400%. All other things being equal, the lower the level of crosslinking in the test sample, the greater the extent of elongation thereof in the Hot Creep Test Method. Conversely, the higher the level of crosslinking in the test sample, the lesser the extent of elongation thereof. If the level of crosslinking in the test sample is low enough, the test sample can fail by breaking, which may occur within a few minutes or even seconds of start of its testing run. Although power cables may not experience operating temperatures as high as 200&#xb0; C., this test is a reliable way for the industry to evaluate materials for use in insulation layers thereof. The lower the hot creep percent, the better the performance of the material. In the power cable industry, a hot creep of less than 175% after the test sample has been held for 15 minutes at 200&#xb0; C. passes the hot creep test. And a hot creep of less than 100% after 15 minutes at 200&#xb0; C. is especially desirable. If the test sample is intact after 15 minutes, the weight is removed, the test sample is removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. Residual elongation of the test sample after cooling is measured. For a power cable, the residual elongation at room temperature should be less than 15% of the hot creep value measured at 200&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Melt Flow Rate (230&#xb0; C., 2.16 kilograms (kg), &#x201c;MFR&#x201d;) Test Method: for propylene-based (co)polymer is measured according to ASTM D1238-13, using conditions of 230&#xb0; C./2.16 kg, formerly known as &#x201c;Condition E&#x201d; and also known as MFR.
