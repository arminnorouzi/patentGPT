Landfill compactors crush and compact waste and refuse to reduce the size and bulk of the material in order to maximize the landfill's available capacity. To obtain maximum compaction and crushing of refuse and other materials, a typical landfill compactor will include specialized drum with a number of rigid compactor pads or cleats. The compactor pads are circumferentially mounted on the outer surface of the compactor wheels, and are arranged in rows that are generally evenly spaced longitudinally across the outer surface. During operation, residual waste and other materials such as soil can collect on the wheels and between the compactor pads, impeding subsequent compacting. To remove the residual material or soil, a cleaner finger assembly is typically used. The cleaner finger assembly, which includes a number of individual cleaner fingers, is mounted to the compactor proximate the wheel. As the wheel rotates, the cleaner fingers scrape residual material from between the rows of compactor pads or cleats.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 11,001,234 discloses a notched compactor cleaner finger. However, the cleaner finger is straight and has a consistent thickness.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As can be seen, there still exists a need for a cleaner finger system that avoids costly repair in situations where the cleaner finger is not straight or does not have a consistent thickness.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A scraper for use with a compactor wheel assembly is provided according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The scraper may comprise an attachment portion, a scraping portion, and a transition portion connecting the scraping portion to the attachment portion. The transition portion may define a stress concentrator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A replacement kit for a cleaner finger assembly is provided according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The kit may comprise a scraper including an attachment portion defining an elongated fastener receiving slot, a scraping portion that forms a first oblique angle with the attachment portion, and a transition portion connecting the scraping portion to the attachment portion, the transition portion defining a stress concentrator. The attachment portion may include a rectangular configuration defining a length and a width that is less than the length. The elongated fastener receiving slot may run parallel with the length of the attachment portion, and may define a slot width. A top mounting block may also be provided that defines a top mounting block width that is greater than the slot width, and may define two apertures that extend through the top mounting block.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A compactor wheel assembly according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may comprise a yoke subassembly, a compactor drum subassembly that is rotatably attached to the yoke assembly about an axis of rotation, and a scraper subassembly that is attached to the yoke subassembly proximate to the compactor drum subassembly. The scraper subassembly may include a plurality of scrapers, each of the plurality of scrapers including an attachment portion, a scraping portion that forms a first oblique angle with the attachment portion, and a transition portion connecting the scraping portion to the attachment portion.

Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. In some cases, a reference number will be indicated in this specification and the drawings will show the reference number followed by a letter for example, <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b </i>or by a prime for example, <b>100</b>&#x2032;, <b>100</b>&#x2033; etc. It is to be understood that the use of letters or primes immediately after a reference number indicates that these features are similarly shaped and have similar function as is often the case when geometry is mirrored about a plane of symmetry. For ease of explanation in this specification, letters and primes will often not be included herein but may be shown in the drawings to indicate duplications of features, having similar or identical function or geometry, discussed within this written specification.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A scraper of a drum associated with a work machine, such as a vibratory soil compactor, is disclosed. The scraper includes a geometric feature, which may be disposed on a bottom/top/side surface or combination thereof. Further, the geometric feature may be a hole or may be a round shape, V notch, square notch, or other variable geometry. Also, a different combination of geometric features may be used on the scraper. The geometric feature may be tuned for a desired loading condition, geometry, material, manufacturing method of the scraper, and/or a supporting structure. The geometric feature may allow the scraper to fracture at a point just prior to an event when damage may occur in a supporting scraper mounting structure, thereby minimizing the cost of repair. That is to say, it may be less expensive to replace the scraper than to repair the scraper mounting structure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An exemplary embodiment of a compactor machine <b>100</b> is shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
