A current heat-dissipating module is designed to be mainly formed of a metal diffusion structure and fins. The surface of the fins has no structural design; that is, the surface of the fins is a complete plane. Heat generated by a heating element may be diffused to a larger area through a thermal diffusion structure, and then the heat may be transferred to the fins through a heat transferring structure or may be directly transferred to the fins, and the heat is removed through natural convection or forced convection through air flow generated by a fan. However, in response to low noise requirements, it is necessary to increase the volume of the heat-dissipating module of a forced cooling device. The increased volume causes a product to become heavier, and problems such as lack of mobility or increased risk of installation also exist, creating inconvenience for users.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the described technology and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

The heat-dissipating fins include multiple first heat-dissipating fins and multiple second heat-dissipating fins. The first heat-dissipating fins and the second heat-dissipating fins are disposed in an interleaved manner and are spaced apart from each other and arranged in parallel in a first direction. Each of the first heat-dissipating fins has multiple first vias and multiple first breach holes.

The light source and the optical engine module are disposed in the case, and the optical engine module includes a light valve and a projection lens. The light source is configured to provide an illumination light beam to the optical engine module. The light valve is disposed on a transmission path of the illumination light beam and is configured to convert the illumination light beam into an image beam. The projection lens is disposed on a transmission path of the image beam and is configured to project the image beam to the outside of the projection device. The heat-dissipating module is disposed in the case, and the heat-dissipating module includes multiple heat-dissipating fins and multiple heat pipes. The heat-dissipating fins include multiple first heat-dissipating fins and multiple second heat-dissipating fins. The first heat-dissipating fins and the second heat-dissipating fins are disposed in an interleaved manner and are spaced apart from each other and arranged in parallel in a first direction. Each of the first heat-dissipating fins has multiple first vias and multiple first breach holes.

Any first breach hole forms an orthogonal projection on the second heat-dissipating fins along the first direction, and the position of the orthogonal projection and the position of the corresponding second breach hole are not overlapped or are partially overlapped, and are arranged in symmetry. In this way, when air flow passes through the heat-dissipating fins, the additional conduction path of the air flow is created, so that the flow resistance is reduced and the flow rate is increased under the system state of the same heat and fan speed, thereby improving the efficiency of heat-dissipation of the heat-dissipating module of the invention.
