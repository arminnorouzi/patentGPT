The host terminal <b>103</b> may register a visit reservation for a visitor of the visitor terminal <b>101</b> by inputting a visit time and a visit place through a visit reservation management page provided by the visit reservation management server <b>102</b>. In addition to the host terminal <b>103</b>, the visitor terminal <b>101</b> may also register such a visit reservation. When registering the visit reservation, the visitor's name, the visit time, and the visit place (e.g., conference room) and contact information of the visitor terminal may be input to the visit reservation management page.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this case, a host of the host terminal <b>103</b> may be a pre-registered user approved by the visit reservation management server <b>102</b>. Further, the host of the host terminal <b>103</b> may be a user belonging to an institution or business related to the visit place (e.g., employees).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The host may be a user having the authority to approve a visit reservation when the visitor of the visitor terminal <b>101</b> wants to visit the visit place. Therefore, when the host terminal <b>103</b> registers the visit reservation, a separate approval process for the visit reservation may not be required. However, when the visitor terminal <b>101</b> registers the visit reservation, a process for the host terminal <b>103</b> to approve the visit reservation may be required.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the visit reservation is registered, the visit reservation management server <b>102</b> may generate identification information of the visitor related to the visit reservation after registering the visit reservation. Here, the identification information of the visitor may include contact information of the visitor or an account of the visitor related to the visit reservation management server <b>102</b> or the message server <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The visit reservation management server <b>102</b> may transmit information about the visit reservation and the identification information of the visitor to the message server <b>105</b>. Then, the message server <b>105</b> may transmit a first instant message including information about the visit reservation and/or the identification information of the visitor to the visitor terminal <b>101</b>. For example, the identification information of the visitor is displayed as a code in the first instant message, and the door system <b>104</b> may acquire the identification information of the visitor from the visitor terminal <b>101</b> by recognizing the code. Further, the message server <b>105</b> may transmit a second instant message including information about the visit reservation and the identification information of the visitor to the host terminal <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The message server <b>105</b> may transmit the first instant message to the visitor terminal <b>101</b> through a chat room of a channel of an institution or business to which the host of the host terminal <b>103</b> belongs, or a chat room of a channel of the visit reservation management server <b>102</b>.

As an example, the first instant message transmitted to the visitor terminal <b>101</b> may include the identification information (e.g., QR code) of the visitor for recognizing the visitor terminal <b>101</b> to the door system <b>104</b> of the visit place.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The door system <b>104</b> (e.g., an access gate) disposed at the visit place may recognize the visitor terminal <b>101</b> to acquire the identification information of the visitor included in the first instant message.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As described above, the identification information may be included in the first instant message received from the message server <b>105</b> after the visit reservation for the visitor terminal <b>101</b> is registered. The visit reservation management server <b>102</b> may determine whether the visitor of the visitor terminal <b>101</b> recognized by the door system <b>104</b> through the identification information of the visitor is a visitor registered for the visit reservation. In other words, the visit reservation management server <b>102</b> may determine whether the visitor of the visitor terminal <b>101</b> recognized by the door system <b>104</b> has a valid right to visit the visit place through the identification information of the visitor.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The visit reservation management server <b>102</b> may transmit door opening/closing information to the door system <b>104</b> after checking whether the visitor is a registered user for the visit reservation using the identification information of the visitor received from the door system <b>104</b>. When the visitor of the visitor terminal <b>101</b> recognized by the door system <b>104</b> is a visitor registered for the visit reservation, the visit reservation management server <b>102</b> may transmit information notifying to open the door to the door system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Specifically, the door system <b>104</b> may recognize the visitor terminal <b>101</b> to acquire the identification information of the visitor included in the first instant message received by the visitor terminal <b>101</b>.

As described above, the process of determining whether the visitor of the visitor terminal <b>101</b> is a visitor registered as the visit reservation based on the identification information after recognizing the visitor terminal <b>101</b> to acquire the identification information of the visitor is a check-in process of the visitor terminal <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to an example embodiment, after the visit reservation of the visitor terminal <b>101</b> is registered, the third instant message related to a reminder of the visit reservation may be transmitted to the visitor terminal <b>101</b> through the message server <b>105</b> before the visitor terminal <b>101</b> checks in to the visit place.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to an example embodiment, when the visitor terminal <b>101</b> successfully checks in to the visit place, the visitor of the visitor terminal <b>101</b> may enter the visit place.

The message server <b>105</b> may transmit a fourth instant message including the result information about the check-in of the visitor terminal <b>101</b> to the visitor terminal <b>101</b>.
