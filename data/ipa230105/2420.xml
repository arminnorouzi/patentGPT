The borate is produced in an esterification reaction of boric acid with glycol ether. In general, the reaction mixture comprises the product triethylene glycol methyl ether borate, the byproduct water, the reactant triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, and also heavy-boiling components and metallic impurities. In conventional production processes this reaction mixture is separated by distillation, using either a sequence of distillation columns or a single distillation column with multiple side draws.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The document CN 104447829 A discloses a process for the preparation of triethylene glycol methyl ether borate in a single distillation column. The desired product is recovered via a side draw from the stripping section of the column. With this column design very pure triethylene glycol methyl ether borate can be produced since impurities and heavy component are separated as bottom product. The triethylene glycol monomethyl ether is withdrawn from a side draw in the rectifying section, while water is obtained as distillate. However, to achieve the required product specifications a large number of theoretical stages is needed in the distillation column. Furthermore, a high reflux ratio is needed resulting in a high energy demand of the process. The energy demand is further increased due to the evaporation of not only the not converted triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, but also the total borate product stream. To counter the high energy demand, the process is heat-integrated at several stages. The recovered triethylene glycol monomethyl ether is used to preheat the reaction mixture. Furthermore, the reaction mixture is preheated by the withdrawn triethylene glycol methyl ether borate. Subsequently, the triethylene glycol methyl ether borate is cooled down by the condensed water recovered at the column top. Even though the borate can be obtained in high purity, this process is characterized by a high energy demand, high capital costs, a complex process behavior due to heat integrations requiring a challenging process control strategy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The document EP 1 661 901 A1 discloses a process for producing boric acid esters from boric acid or boron trioxide by reaction with alcohols in a reactive distillation column wherein the distillation is at least partially superimposed by extraction inside the column. Specific alcohols disclosed are methanol, ethanol and propanol. The respective borates as products of this process form a light-boiling azeotrope with the alcohol which necessitates the design of the reactive distillation column with superimposed extraction and an extraction agent as a further substance. The borates are withdrawn from the top of the column, the extraction agent from the bottom of the column.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It was an object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of highly pure oligo ethylene glycol methyl ether borates that is characterized by a low overall energy demand, low capital costs and a smooth operational range.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This object is achieved according to the invention by a process for preparing oligo ethylene glycol methyl ether borates according to claim <b>1</b>.

Preferably, the solid boric acid is completely dissolved in and thoroughly mixed with the liquid oligo ethylene glycol monomethyl ether. The mixing and dissolving can be performed entirely in the reactor, for example by providing respective mixing devices like stirrers. The mixing and dissolving can also be performed partly or entirely in devices other than the reactor, for example pre-mixers like mixing pumps.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0029">In an esterification reaction the target product oligo ethylene glycol methyl ether borate is formed. Water is formed as a byproduct. The esterification reaction is equilibrium limited which means that in a conventional process a significant excess of boric acid would be required to shift the equilibrium towards the desired borate. However, according to the invention, only part of the reaction is performed in the reactor in step (a) whereas the remaining part of the reaction to full conversion of boric acid is performed in the reactive distillation device in step (b). Thus, the process according to the invention gives a degree of freedom with respect to the reaction regimes in the reactor and in the reactive distillation device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0030">In a preferred embodiment the reaction inside the reactor is performed to equilibrium conditions that result from the molar ratio of the reactants fed to the reactor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0031">In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention a low excess of alcohol is provided in the reactor. The molar ratio of oligo ethylene glycol monomethyl ether to boric acid fed to the reactor in step (a) is preferably from 3.01:1 to 3.4:1, more preferably from 3.25:1 to 3.35:1. One advantage of the excess of alcohol is a shift of the chemical equilibrium towards the desired borate which can be used to produce more borate in the reactor and thus in the feed to the reactive distillation device. A further advantage is that an excess of alcohol leads to a reduction of the bottom temperature of the reactive distillation column as the alcohol has a lower boiling point than the borate product and the unreacted alcohol is contained in the bottom product stream.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0032">The temperature in the reactor is preferably from 60&#xb0; C. to 90&#xb0; C., more preferably from 75&#xb0; C. to 85&#xb0; C.

The content of the reactor can be fed directly to the reactive distillation device. Preferably, the content of the reactor is discharged to a buffer tank and the reactive distillation device is fed from the buffer tank. In that case the reactor is available for further use immediately after the production of the raw product.

Due to the combined reaction and distillation the byproduct water is continuously removed from the reacting mixture. This enables a shift of the reaction equilibrium towards the desired borate product and a full conversion of the reactant boric acid. The water is obtained at the top of the reactive distillation device whereas the borate product is obtained at its bottom.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0043">The reactive distillation device is equipped with internals that facilitate the mass exchange between the liquid phase and the vapor phase.

In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention the reflux ratio, i.e. the mass ratio of the recycled condensed liquid stream to the distillate stream withdrawn from the top of the reactive distillation device, is from 0.2 to 0.5 by mass. This low reflux ratio leads to a significantly reduced energy consumption compared to processes known in the art, without compromising on the quality of the desired borate product.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0048">In a preferred variant of this embodiment the reactive distillation device comprises a further condenser. In the first condenser, hereinafter denoted as &#x201c;reflux condenser&#x201d;, the distillate stream from the top of the reactive distillation device is partly condensed. The condensed liquid stream is rich in organic compounds and is recycled to the top of the reactive distillation device as a reflux stream. The not condensed vapor stream is rich in water and is transferred to the further condenser. In this further condenser the water rich vapor stream is at least partly condensed enabling the withdrawal of water as a liquid condensate. This two-staged condenser concept enables the minimization of alcohol (ether) losses and the minimization of the TOC (Total Organic Carbon) content of the waste water withdrawn from the process.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0049">According to the invention, a bottom product stream containing mainly oligo ethylene glycol methyl ether borate is withdrawn from reactive distillation device (step (d)).
