In the simplest of optical ring resonators, the optical waveguides include a bus waveguide (i.e., an optical waveguide with discrete ends including an input end and an output end) and a closed-curve waveguide (i.e., an optical waveguide with a complete loop or ring shape having no discrete ends), which is spatially separated from but optically coupled to the bus waveguide. Light signals can enter the bus waveguide at the input end. Due to optical coupling, some light signals will pass into the closed-curve waveguide from the bus waveguide and some light signals will pass from the closed-curve waveguide into the bus waveguide. Light signals will also exit the bus waveguide at the output end. However, within the closed-curve waveguide, light signals of a specific resonant wavelength for that closed-curve waveguide will make repeated roundtrips through the closed-curve waveguide, building up intensity, due, for example, to constructive interference. As a result, the light signals that pass from the closed-curve waveguide into the bus waveguide will, predominantly, have the specific resonant wavelength. Thus, such a ring resonator can be effectively employed as a filter. However, depending upon the properties of the core material used, closed-curve waveguides can be thermally sensitive. That is, they can exhibit temperature-dependent resonance shifts (TDRS). For example, closed-curve silicon waveguides are known to be thermally sensitive and the potential TDRS can be, for example, approximately 70 picometers per Kelvin (pm/K) or more. To minimize TDRS, many photonic structures that include closed-curve waveguide(s) also include corresponding heater(s) to thermally tune (i.e., heat) the closed-curve optical waveguide(s). Unfortunately, currently available configurations for such photonic structures tend to exhibit performance degradation (e.g., optical power loss).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Disclosed herein are embodiments of a photonic structure.

For example, silicon has a refractive index that is a function of both temperature and wavelength. That is, given a wavelength of 1 micron, the refractive index of silicon can range from approximately 3.52 to approximately 3.57 at temperatures ranging from approximately 50K to approximately 295K, respectively. However, given a wavelength of 5 micron, the refractive index of silicon is lower and can range from approximately 3.39 to approximately 3.43 at temperatures ranging from approximately 50K to approximately 295K, respectively.

For purposes of illustration, the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> is shown in the figures as having an elliptical ring shape with no discrete ends. However, it should be understood that the figures are not intended to be limiting and that, alternatively, the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> could have any other complete loop or ring shape (e.g., a circular ring shape, an oval ring shape, a racetrack ring shape, etc.) with no discrete ends.

Thus, the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> can have a first height <b>125</b>, <b>225</b>, <b>325</b>, as measured from the top surface of the insulator layer <b>102</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> can have an outer curved sidewall <b>121</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>321</b>, which defines the outer boundary of the waveguide and which extends essentially vertically the full first height (i.e., from the top surface of the insulator layer <b>102</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> to the top surface of the waveguide). The closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> can also include an inner curved sidewall <b>122</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>322</b>, which is opposite the outer curved sidewall <b>121</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>321</b> and which defines the inner boundary of the waveguide. The dimensions of the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> can be customized to achieve desired results. For example, the height and width of the closed-curved waveguide can be customized to facilitate propagation of light signals having wavelengths within a given wavelength range. Furthermore, the circumference of the closed-curve waveguide can be customized to achieve a specific resonant wavelength and to set how often resonance occurs. As mentioned above, the resonant wavelength of a closed-curve waveguide refers to the wavelength of light signals that will make repeated roundtrips through the closed-curve waveguide, building up intensity. Techniques for customizing the dimensions of waveguides are well known in the art and, thus, the details have been omitted from this specification in order to allow the reader to focus on the salient aspects of the disclosed embodiments. It should be noted that having an outer curved sidewall that is essentially vertical from the top surface of the insulator layer <b>102</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> to the top surface of the closed-curve waveguide minimizes loss of signals with the specific resonant wavelength through the outer curved sidewall <b>121</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>321</b>. Low loss is extremely important for device performance when circumference is small resulting in tight bends.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the optical device <b>199</b>, <b>299</b>, <b>399</b> can be a ring resonator. As discussed above, a ring resonator can include a bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> positioned laterally adjacent and optically coupled to a closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, as described above. A &#x201c;bus&#x201d; waveguide refers to a waveguide with discrete ends including an input end <b>111</b>, <b>211</b>, <b>311</b> and an output end <b>112</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>312</b>. For purposes of illustration, the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> is shown in the figures as including an essentially linear path between the input end and the output end. However, it should be understood that the figures are not intended to be limiting and that, alternatively, the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> could include a non-linear path between the input end and the output end. That is, alternatively, the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> could include one or more curves. In any case, the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, like the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, can have a bottom surface that is immediately adjacent to the top surface of the insulator layer <b>102</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> and a top surface that is opposite and parallel to the bottom surface. The bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> can, for example, have the same first height as the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> and parallel sidewalls that extend essentially vertically the full first height (i.e., from the top surface of the insulator layer <b>102</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> to the top surface of the waveguide) (as shown). Alternatively, the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> can have a different height than the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> and parallel sidewalls that extend essentially vertically to this different height. In any case, the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> can be positioned laterally adjacent to a section of the outer curved sidewall <b>121</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>321</b> of the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>310</b> and, more particularly, can be spatially separated from but optically coupled to the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> at one section of the outer curved sidewall <b>121</b>, <b>221</b>, <b>321</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be noted that the section of the outer curved sidewall of the closed-curve waveguide that is optically coupled to the bus waveguide can be a curved section (as illustrated). Alternatively, the section of the outer curved sidewall of the closed-curve waveguide that is optically coupled to the bus waveguide can be a linear section (e.g., in the case of a racetrack shaped closed-curve waveguide) (not shown).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In such a ring resonator, light signals can enter the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> at the input end <b>111</b>, <b>211</b>, <b>311</b>. Due to optical coupling with the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, some light signals can pass from the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> into the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> and some light signals can pass from the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> into the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>. More specifically, the bus waveguide and the closed-curve waveguide can be placed sufficiently close to create an evanescent field between the two waveguides and this evanescent field allows some light signals to pass from the bus waveguide to the closed-curve waveguide and vice versa. The creation of such an evanescent field between the adjacent waveguides and thereby the likelihood of the optical coupling of the adjacent waveguides (i.e., coupling that facilitates the transmission of light signals between the adjacent waveguides) is dependent upon at least the distance between the waveguides, the coupling length (i.e., the length of the portions of the adjacent waveguides separated by the distance), and the refractive index of the medium between the waveguides. The closer the distance, the more likely the optical coupling; the longer coupling length, the more likely the optical coupling; etc. In any case, light signals can also exit the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> at the output end <b>112</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>312</b>. However, within the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>, only light signals of a specific resonant wavelength for that closed-curve waveguide will make repeated roundtrips through the closed-curve waveguide, building up intensity, due to constructive interference. As a result, the light signals that pass from the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> into the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> and out at the output end <b>112</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>312</b> of the bus waveguide <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> will, predominantly, have the specific resonant wavelength. However, as discussed above, closed-curve waveguides are known to be thermally sensitive. That is, they are known to exhibit temperature-dependent resonance shifts (TDRS). The potential TDRS can be, for example, approximately 70 picometers per Kelvin (pm/K) or more.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Therefore, to minimize temperature-dependent resonance shifts (TDRS) in the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> (i.e., to avoid temperature-dependent variations in the resonant wavelength of the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>) each photonic structure embodiment <b>100</b>A-<b>100</b>D, <b>200</b>A-<b>200</b>D, <b>300</b>A-<b>300</b>B can further include a heating element <b>140</b>, <b>240</b>, <b>340</b> and a thermal coupler <b>130</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>330</b>, which indirectly thermally couples the heating element <b>140</b>, <b>240</b>, <b>340</b> to the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b> <b>320</b> for thermal tuning.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">More specifically, each photonic structure embodiment <b>100</b>A-<b>100</b>D, <b>200</b>A-<b>200</b>D, <b>300</b>A-<b>300</b>B can further include a closed-curve thermal coupler <b>130</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>330</b> with a bottom surface immediately adjacent to the top surface of the insulator layer <b>102</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> and a top surface opposite and essentially parallel to the bottom surface.

More specifically, the closed-curve thermal coupler can be placed immediately adjacent to or sufficiently close to the inner curved sidewall of the closed-curve waveguide so that heat energy can pass from the closed-curve thermal coupler to the closed-curve waveguide, thereby raising the temperature of the closed-curve waveguide. The likelihood of the thermal coupling of the closed-curve thermal coupler to the closed-curve waveguide depends upon at least the distance between the closed-curve thermal coupler and closed-curve waveguide, the coupling length (length of the portions of the adjacent waveguides separated by the distance), and the thermal conductivity of any medium between the closed-curve thermal conductor and the closed-curve waveguide. The closer the distance, the more likely and the better the thermal coupling; longer coupling length, the more likely and the better the thermal coupling; etc. Furthermore, the closed-curve thermal coupler <b>130</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>330</b> can have a second height <b>135</b>, <b>235</b>, <b>335</b> (e.g., as measured from the top surface of the insulator layer <b>102</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> to the top of the thermal coupler) that is less than the first height <b>125</b>, <b>225</b>, <b>325</b> of the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b>.

For purposes of this disclosure, a &#x201c;heating element&#x201d; refers to a resistor made of any suitable conductive material through which electric current flows in response to a voltage differential at the contacts and is converted into heat energy. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the direction and amount of current flow will depend upon the voltage differential. Furthermore, the amount of heat generated per unit length will depend upon the material used and the current density (which is a function of the cross-sectional area of the heating element). Exemplary heating element materials are discussed in greater detail below with regard to the specific embodiments.

The likelihood of the thermal coupling of the closed-curve thermal coupler to the closed-curve waveguide depends upon at least the distance between the closed-curve thermal coupler and closed-curve waveguide, the coupling length (length of the portions of the adjacent waveguides separated by the distance), and the thermal conductivity of any medium between the closed-curve thermal conductor and the closed-curve waveguide.

As a result, mode confinement is improved, and signal loss is minimized. More particularly, conventional waveguides are typically either strip or rib waveguides. A strip waveguide refers to a waveguide that is formed, for example, by forming a mask with the desired shape on a waveguide core material layer and then performing an anisotropic etch process to etch completely through the waveguide core material layer so that all sidewalls of the resulting waveguide extend vertically the full height of the waveguide. A rib waveguide refers to a waveguide that is formed, for example, by forming a mask with the desired shape on a waveguide core material layer and then performing an anisotropic etch process to etch only partially through a waveguide core material layer so that recessed portions (also referred to as slab portions) of the waveguide core material extend laterally away from a lower portion of the resulting waveguide and so that the sidewalls of the resulting waveguide do not extend the full height of the waveguide but instead only extend from vertically from the recessed portion of the waveguide core material. Thus, a rib waveguide essentially has an inverted T-shape. The recessed portions of the waveguide core material in a rib waveguide allow for light signal leakage. Furthermore, in closed-curve rib waveguides, the potential for light signal leakage is greater along the outer curved sidewall.

Furthermore, the dimensions of the closed-curve waveguide <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> can be customized to achieve desired results. For example, the height and width of the closed-curved waveguide can be customized to facilitate propagation of light signals having wavelengths within a given wavelength range. Furthermore, the circumference of the closed-curve waveguide can be customized to achieve a specific resonant wavelength and to set how often resonance occurs. As mentioned above, the resonant wavelength of a closed-curve waveguide refers to the wavelength of light signals that will make repeated roundtrips through the closed-curve waveguide, building up intensity.
