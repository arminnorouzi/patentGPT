num="0000">Disclosed herein are compositions comprising an NSAID such as meloxicam and/or rizatriptan in combination with a cyclodextrin and/or a carbonate or a bicarbonate. These compositions may be orally administered, for example, to improve the bioavailability or pharmacokinetics of the NSAID for the treatment of pain such as migraine, arthritis, and other conditions. Also disclosed herein are methods of treating pain, such as migraine, comprising administering meloxicam and rizatriptan to a human being suffering from pain, such as migraine. For migraine, these methods may be particularly useful when the meloxicam and rizatriptan are administered while the human being is suffering from an acute attack of migraine pain or migraine aura. In some embodiments, the combination of meloxicam and rizatriptan may be administered in a manner that results in a T<sub>max </sub>of meloxicam of 3 hours or less.</p></abstract><drawings

The meloxicam mechanism of action may be related to prostaglandin synthetase (cyclo-oxygenase, COX) inhibition which is involved in the initial steps of the arachidonic acid cascade, resulting in the reduced formation of prostaglandins, thromboxanes and prostacylin.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0003">Meloxicam and some other NSAIDs have poor aqueous solubility which may reduce bioavailability and slow the onset of pain relief resulting from their use. One means of increasing the solubility and bioavailability of meloxicam is through the use of cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrin (also known as cycloamyloses) are generally cyclic polysaccharides which form a bucket-like shape. Cyclodextrins help to increase bioavailability of other molecules because cyclodextrins are hydrophobic on the inside and hydrophilic on the inside which helps to facilitate the transport of molecules. The naturally occurring cyclodextrins include six, seven, and eight glucose units (a, p, and y-cyclodextrin, respectively). However, synthetic cyclodextrins containing more or less glucose units are possible. In aqueous solutions, cyclodextrins can form complexes (i.e., an inclusion complex) with drugs by incorporating the drug into the center/hydrophobic portion of the cyclodextrin ring; although cyclodextrin compounds are also known to aggregate around a drug in a micelle-type structure. This ability of cyclodextrins may allow them to act as carriers to increase the bioavailability of less soluble drugs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">Some embodiments include a method of treating migraine comprising: selecting a human migraine patient with a history of inadequate response to prior migraine treatments, and orally administering a dosage form to the migraine patient, wherein the dosage form comprises a combination of: 1) a complex of meloxicam with a sulfobutyl ether &#x3b2;-cyclodextrin (SBE&#x3b2;CD), 2) a bicarbonate, and 3) a rizatriptan.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">Some embodiments include an inclusion complex of meloxicam in a cyclodextrin.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">Some embodiments include a dosage form comprising: 1) an inclusion complex of meloxicam and a cyclodextrin, or 2) meloxicam and a carbonate or a bicarbonate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">Some embodiments include a method of administering meloxicam orally, comprising orally administering a dosage form described herein to a patient in need of treatment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">Some embodiments include a method of administering meloxicam intravenously, comprising intravenously administering a dosage form described herein to a patient in need of treatment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">Disclosed herein are formulations for an inclusion complex of cyclodextrin and meloxicam with bicarbonate and methods of use thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">Disclosed herein are formulations and methods for delivering meloxicam with cyclodextrin to a subject by oral, enteral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal, or other parenteral means.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">Disclosed also are methods for treating pain and pain associated with conditions by delivering a dosage form with meloxicam, cyclodextrin, and bicarbonate by oral, enteral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal, or other parenteral means to a subject.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">A combination of rizatriptan and meloxicam (referred to herein for convenience as a &#x201c;subject combination&#x201d;) may be used to treat a variety of pain conditions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">Rizatriptan has the structure as shown below.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="36.07mm" wi="48.77mm" file="US20230000879A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0018" num="0014">Some embodiments include a subject combination comprising: 1) an inclusion complex of meloxicam and a cyclodextrin, 2) rizatriptan, and 3) a bicarbonate for treating migraine in a human being.

id="p-0054" num="0050">Provided herein are dosage forms with NSAIDs (such as meloxicam) and cyclodextrin (optionally in an inclusion complex), and/or bicarbonate, and methods of treatment using the dosage form.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0051">A dosage form may be given enterally including, but not limited to, oral, sublingual, or rectal delivery, or parenterally including, but not limited to, intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, or subcutaneous delivery.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0052">Some methods include administration of a product that combines an NSAID that is formulated with: a) a cyclodextrin and/or b) a buffering agent. In some embodiments, the method involves treating a patient with a pharmaceutical formulation comprising meloxicam and a cyclodextrin and/or a carbonate/bicarbonate. Method embodiments may also include treating a patient to increase the bioavailability of meloxicam in the patient or increase the rate at which the meloxicam becomes bioavailable.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0053">The combination of meloxicam, a cyclodextrin (such as SBE&#x3b2;CD), and a bicarbonate (such as sodium bicarbonate) may substantially increase the solubility and rate of absorption of meloxicam after oral administration, while maintaining its extended plasma concentration half-life in mammals, such as humans after oral administration.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0054">The combination of meloxicam, a cyclodextrin (such as SBE&#x3b2;CD), and a bicarbonate (such as sodium bicarbonate) may substantially increase the oral bioavailability of meloxicam in mammals, such as humans, after oral administration.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0055">Unless otherwise indicated, any reference to a compound herein, such as meloxicam or rizatriptan, by structure, name, or any other means, includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts, alternate solid forms, such as polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, enantiomers, tautomers, deuterium-modified forms, or any other chemical species, such as precursors, prodrugs, or any other chemical species that may rapidly convert to a compound described herein under conditions in which the compounds are used as described herein.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0056">A subject combination may be given enterally including, but not limited to, oral, sublingual, or rectal delivery, or parenterally including, but not limited to, intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, or subcutaneous delivery. In some embodiments, both meloxicam and rizatriptan are administered orally. In some embodiments, meloxicam is administered intravenously and rizatriptan is administered orally. In some embodiments, meloxicam is administered intramuscularly and rizatriptan is administered orally.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0057">Normally, the combination of meloxicam and rizatriptan is administered so that the human being receives the meloxicam and rizatriptan within a short period of time with respect to one another. For example, the meloxicam and rizatriptan may be administered within about 2 hours, within about 1 hour, within about 30 minutes, within about 20 minutes, within about 15 minutes, within about 10 minutes, within about 5 minutes, or within about 1 minute of one another. In some embodiments, the meloxicam and rizatriptan are administered simultaneously, which for the purpose of this disclosure includes administration within about 5 minutes. In some embodiments, the meloxicam and rizatriptan are administered in a single dosage form.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0058">The term &#x201c;treating&#x201d;, or &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; broadly includes any kind of treatment activity, including the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, or prevention of disease in man or other animals, or any activity that otherwise affects the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0059">The dosage form or the subject combination may be used to treat, or provide relief of, any type of pain including, but not limited to, migraine and other types of headache, inflammatory pain, musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, chronic pain, acute pain, localized pain, systemic pain, cancer-related pain, acute pain, pain due to injury, pain due to illness (e.g., fever), post-operative pain, etc. In some instances, pain relief may be palliative, or pain relief may be provided independent of improvement of the disease or condition or the underlying cause of the disease or condition. For example, although the underlying disease may not improve, or may continue to progress, an individual suffering from the disease may experience pain relief. In some embodiments, the pain affects a muscle, nerve, cartilage, bone, ligament, tendon, tendon sheaths, bursae, or joint.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">Migraine is a disabling neurological disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of pulsating head pain accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. This pain may be moderate to severe, but is often severe and incapacitating, requiring bed rest. The headaches may affect one half of the head, may be pulsating in nature, and may last from 2 to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light (photophobia), sound (phonophobia), or smell. The migraine pain may be accompanied by disturbed vision. The migraine pain can be made worse by physical activity. Migraines may be associated with an aura, which may be a short period of visual disturbance which signals that the headache will soon occur. Some migraine patients may not have aura.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061">In some embodiments, the human being who is being treated for migraine pain suffers from allodynia, such as cutaneous allodynia with their migraine attacks. Allodynia, such as cutaneous allodynia, which is pain from normally non-painful stimuli (such as brushing hair, wearing glasses, taking a shower, etc.). Patients having allodynia, such as cutaneous allodynia are believed to be less likely to respond well to triptan medications.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">Current treatments are suboptimal, with more than 70% of sufferers reporting dissatisfaction with existing acute treatments. The most commonly reported reasons for patient dissatisfaction are slow onset of pain relief, inconsistent pain relief, and recurrence of pain during the same day. Suboptimal acute treatment is associated with a significantly increased risk of new-onset chronic migraine, which may be prevented by improving acute treatment outcomes.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0063">Administering a subject combination to a human being suffering from migraine, such as an acute attack of migraine pain or aura, may quickly result in a reduction in a migraine symptom, such as pain, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, such as at or within about 5 minutes (intended as a shorthand for &#x201c;at about 5 minutes, or within about 5 minutes&#x201d;), at or within about 10 minutes, at or within about 30 minutes, at or within about 1 hour, at or within about 90 minutes, at or within about 2 hours, at or within about 2.5 hours, orator within about 3 hours. In some embodiments, a human being experiences a reduction of, or complete relief from, pain, such as headache pain or migraine pain, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and/or phonophobia, at or within about 1 hour, at or within about 90 minutes, at or within about 2 hours, at or within about 2.5 hours, or at or within about 3 hours. In some embodiments, the relief experienced, is greater than would be experienced by receiving the same amount of rizatriptan without meloxicam. In some embodiments, the relief experienced, is greater than would be experienced by receiving the same amount of meloxicam without rizatriptan.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0064">The subject combination may be administered at the earliest sign of migraine pain, or soon after the earliest sign of migraine, such as within about 1 minute, within about 5 minutes, within about 10 minutes, within about 15 minutes, within about 20 minutes, within about 30 minutes, or within about 1 hour. At this early state, the pain may still be mild, or before the pain progresses to moderate or severe intensity. For some methods, the subject combination may be administered when the migraine pain has reached moderate or severe intensity.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">In some embodiments, the combination of meloxicam and rizatriptan is administered to a human migraine patient having, or who is selected for having, functional disability. In some embodiments, the treatment results in the human migraine patient being able to return to normal activities within 24 hours after receiving the treatment.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">The combination of meloxicam and rizatriptan may have distinct dual mechanisms of action for the acute treatment of migraine. Meloxicam is a potent, COX-2 preferential NSAID which is limited by slow absorption. Rizatriptan is a potent 5-HT1<sub>B/D </sub>agonist believed to have efficacy in migraine.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067">Observation of relief or reduction in a symptom at a specific period of time, such as &#x201c;at 2 hours,&#x201d; is useful because it allows the effectiveness of the treatment to be evaluated at a specific or consistent time point, which facilitates comparison between patients. Observation of relief or reduction in a symptom within a specific period of time, such as &#x201c;within about 2 hours,&#x201d; is useful because it is desirable for relief or reduction of a symptom to occur as early as possible, and specifying that relief occur within a specified time sets a guideline in which it is desirable that relief occur.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068">For some methods, administration of the subject combination may achieve a reduction in migraine pain, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia that lasts at least about one hour, at least about two hours, at least about three hours, at least about four hours, at least about six hours, at least about eight hours, about 8-24 hours, about 24 hours, or more than 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0069">In some

Migraine is characterized by recurrent attacks of pulsating, often severe and disabling head pain associated with nausea, and sensitivity to light and or sound. It is estimated that migraine accounts for $78 billion in direct (e.g., doctor visits, medications) and indirect (e.g., missed work, lost productivity) costs each year in the United States [Gooch C L, Pracht E, Borenstein A R, The burden of neurological disease in the United States: A summary report and call to action. Ann Neurol. 2017 Apr; 81(4):479-484]. Published surveys of migraine sufferers indicate that more than 70% are not fully satisfied with their current treatment, that nearly 80% would try a new therapy, and that they desire treatments that work faster, more consistently, and result in less symptom recurrence [(1) Smelt A F, Louter M A, Kies D A, Blom J W, Terwindt G M, van der Heijden G J, De Gucht V, Ferrari M D, Assendelft W J, What do patients consider to be the most important outcomes for effectiveness studies on migraine treatment?

Eligible patients must have an age of 18 to 65 years, an established diagnosis (at least 1 year) of migraine with or without aura as defined by ICHD-3 criteria, an average of 2 to 8 moderate to severe migraines per month, had a history of inadequate response to prior acute migraine treatments, assessed by a score of 7 using the Migraine Treatment Optimization Questionnaire (mTOQ-4) (the average score was 3.6), corresponding to poor response to prior acute treatments. Exclusion criteria included cluster headaches or other types of migraines, chronic daily headache 15 non-migraine headache days per month), history of significant cardiovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension. In addition to a history of inadequate response, enrolled patients exhibited a high rate of characteristics that are strongly associated with poor treatment outcomes including cutaneous allodynia (75.4%), severe migraine pain intensity (41.2%), obesity (43.7%), and morning migraine (36.6%). A total of 1,594 patients were randomized in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to the monolayer tablet of Example 4 (20 mg meloxicam/10 mg rizatriptan, with SBE&#x3b2;CD and sodium bicarbonate), rizatriptan (10 mg), meloxicam (20 mg) with SBEBCD (MoSEIC Meloxicam), or placebo, to treat a single migraine attack of moderate or severe intensity. The two co-primary endpoints of the trial were the proportion of patients who are free from headache pain two hours after dosing, and the proportion of patients who no longer suffered from their most bothersome migraine-associated symptom (nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia) two hours after dosing, for meloxicam/rizatriptan as compared to placebo. Superiority of meloxicam/rizatriptan to the rizatriptan and meloxicam arms (component contribution) was to be established based on sustained freedom from headache pain from two to 24 hours after dosing (key secondary endpoint).

The rate at which patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events after dosing with Meloxicam/Rizatriptan versus any of the other tested treatments was approximately similar (Table 12).</p><p id="p-0250" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00011" num="00011"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE 12</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Meloxicam/</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Rizatriptan</entry><entry>Rizatriptan</entry><entry>Meloxicam</entry><entry>Placebo</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(N = 441)</entry><entry>(N = 434)</entry><entry>(N = 433)</entry><entry>(N = 218)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Any Treatment-</entry><entry>49 (11.1%)</entry><entry>67 (15.4%)</entry><entry>50 (11.5%)</entry><entry>13(6.0%)</entry></row><row><entry>Emergent Adverse</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Event</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Nausea</entry><entry>12 (2.7%)&#x2002;</entry><entry>21 (4.8%)&#x2002;</entry><entry>14 (3.2%)&#x2002;</entry><entry>8 (3.7%0</entry></row><row><entry>Dizziness</entry><entry>7 (1.6%)</entry><entry>9 (2.1%)</entry><entry>5 (1.2%)</entry><entry>5 (1.2%)</entry></row><row><entry>Somnolence</entry><entry>6 (1.4%)</entry><entry>9 (2.1%)</entry><entry>10 (2.3%)&#x2002;</entry><entry>6 (1.4%)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00003">Data presented as number of subjects (% of subjects)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0251" num="0326">The results of this trial demonstrate the ability of meloxicam/rizatriptan to provide unique benefits to migraine patients, with fast, strong, and durable relief of migraine pain as compared to a potent active comparator, rizatriptan, in a stringently designed trial enriched with patients with difficult-to-treat migraine. These results have potentially important implications for patient care based on the high rate of inadequate response to and patient dissatisfaction with current treatments.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0327">Meloxicam/rizatriptan incorporates multiple mechanisms of action to address various migraine processes with the goal of providing enhanced effectiveness. Meloxicam/rizatriptan is thought to act by inhibiting CGRP release, reversing CGRP-mediated vasodilation, and inhibiting neuro-inflammation, pain signal transmission, and central sensitization. The results of this trial validate this approach, demonstrating that meloxicam/rizatriptan can provide significant benefit that is greater than that of currently available treatments, even in patients with difficult-to-treat migraine.

It is remarkable that early treatment with meloxicam/rizatriptan prevented migraine pain progression in the vast majority of patients and enabled a similarly high percentage of patients to return to normal functioning,&#x201d; said Dr. Stewart Tepper, Professor of Neurology at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. &#x201c;The multiple mechanisms of meloxicam/rizatriptan address the many disordered physiological processes implicated in migraine attacks. These results, coupled with previous clinical data showing superiority of meloxicam/rizatriptan over an active comparator, provide clinical evidence that this synergistic, multi-mechanistic approach and the rapid absorption of meloxicam/rizatriptan may translate to important benefits for a wide range of patients. As clinicians continue to seek options for their patients with improved efficacy over currently available therapies, meloxicam/rizatriptan may offer an important new treatment for this disabling condition.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0270" num="0344">This Phase 3 trial confirmed the superior and durable efficacy of meloxicam/rizatriptan. The prevention of migraine pain progression, and the substantial increase in the rate of pain freedom demonstrated with early treatment with meloxicam/rizatriptan, expands and enhances its differentiated profile for the acute treatment of migraine. With this Phase 3 trial and the Phase 3 trial described in Example 11 in patients with a history of inadequate response to prior acute treatments, meloxicam/rizatriptan has now been evaluated in two positive well-controlled trials. These trials demonstrated the efficacy of meloxicam/rizatriptan against potent active and placebo comparators, across a spectrum of migraine attack settings, regardless of the timing of migraine treatment, disease severity, or baseline pain intensity.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0345">&#x201c;Migraine is one of the most disabling disorders, incapacitating sufferers and seriously damaging home life, social activity, and the ability to work. Published surveys have underscored that patients remain dissatisfied with the efficacy of currently available therapies,&#x201d; said Cedric O&#x2032;Gorman, MD, Senior Vice President of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs of Axsome. &#x201c;The results of [this] trial demonstrate for the first time that meloxicam/rizatriptan can halt migraine pain progression before reaching moderate or severe intensity. These data grow the body of clinical evidence in support of the potential of meloxicam/rizatriptan to be a multi-mechanistic treatment for migraine with efficacy that is superior to the current standard of care, and which can rapidly, robustly, and durably alleviate symptoms, and return patients to their normal daily activities.&#x201d;</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">EXAMPLE 13</heading><p id="p-0272" num="0346">A long-term, open-label Phase 3 trial of meloxicam/rizatriptan (20 mg meloxicam/10 mg rizatriptan, with SBE&#x3b2;CD and sodium bicarbonate as described in Example 4 above) was conducted.
