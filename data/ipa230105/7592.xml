Some of such computer-implemented tools, termed applications or apps, can be designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, a tablet, or a watch. Mobile devices can be configured to communicate over the Internet, as well as over short range wireless communication technology, such as, e.g., Bluetooth&#xae;. A Bluetooth&#xae; sensor, when enabled on a mobile device, scans for other Bluetooth&#xae;-enabled devices and, also, advertises its presence to other Bluetooth-enabled devices. A user can manually disable Bluetooth&#xae; scanning and advertising, as well as to manually re-enable Bluetooth&#xae; scanning and advertising, based on the user's needs for short range wireless communication.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, like numerals may describe similar components in different views.

An example of a co-location experience is a modification of the user interface to include an indication of co-location of the devices, a visual control actionable to activate a mini app or a game that is not otherwise made available to the users, an animated image with a transparent background, e.g., of a couple engaged in an activity that in non-virtual realm is only possible when two people are in close proximity, such as hugging or dancing, etc. A co-location event is detected based on information obtained using short range wireless communication component provided at the client devices.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The co-location connection service and the messaging client are provided by a messaging server system that maintains user profiles representing users of the co-location connection service. The co-location connection service is configured to selectively pair user profiles associated with respective client devices that can communicate with each other within a predetermined physical range, termed co-location distance for the purposes of this description, using short range wireless communication component. The client devices associated with respective paired user profiles are referred to as paired client devices. The operation of short range wireless communication component by a client device includes advertising the presence of the device to the paired device and/or scanning operation to discover the presence of the paired device within the communication range of the short range wireless communication component. The short range wireless communication component may utilize short range wireless communication technology, such as, e.g., Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth&#xae; (e.g., Bluetooth&#xae; Low Energy), a low frequency audio signal, radio-frequency identification (RFID), etc.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The process of advertising and scanning at the paired client devices, by the short range wireless communication component, is referred to as co-location detection. Continuous operation of the short range wireless communication component by a client device for the purpose of co-location detection requires expenditure of power resources. The availability of power resources, especially at a mobile device, may be limited.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The technical problem of reducing power consumption of paired client devices is addressed by providing a power optimization component in the messaging client executing at a paired client device. The power optimization component periodically queries location services available at its host paired client device to obtain location data indicating geographic location of the paired client device. The power optimization component communicates the obtained location data to the other paired client device. The power optimization component also receives location data indicating geographic location of the other paired client device. The power optimization component uses the location data indicating the geographic location of its host paired client device and the location data indicating the geographic location of the other paired client device to detect an optimization trigger event. The optimization trigger event indicates that the physical distance between the paired client devices is greater than a certain predetermined distance termed threshold distance for the purposes of this description. The threshold distance is greater than the co-location distance and, also, is great enough so that it can be inferred that the paired devices will not be within a co-location distance in the immediate future. The threshold distance may be a specified distance (e.g., a mile, or five miles, or three hundred feet). In some examples, the threshold distance may be periodically determined for paired client devices based on rules or using a predictive machine learning model that takes, as input, features indicative of behavior of the users, represented by respective paired user profiles, operating the respective paired client devices (e.g., features indicative of interactions with the collocation communication service of respective users represented by the first user profile and the second user profile). In response to detecting the optimization trigger event, the power optimization component disables co-location detection at its host paired client device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The power optimization component also uses the location data indicating the geographic location of its host paired client device and the location data indicating the geographic location of the other paired client device to detect a further optimization trigger event that indicates that the physical distance between the paired client devices is less than the threshold distance. In response to the further optimization trigger event, the power optimization component resumes co-location detection at its host paired client device. Examples of location services are the global positioning system (GPS) or a locating technology that uses relative network signal strength detected at network access points.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The paired client devices exchange their location data using the messaging server. For example, the messaging server may include a location data exchange component that receives location data from a paired client device and sends it to the other paired client device. The other paired client device receives the location data of is paired client device from the location data exchange component of the messaging server. While the power optimization methodology that uses location data obtained from location services, such as GPS, to determine whether to disable or to resume operation of short range wireless communication component, such as a Bluetooth&#xae; component is described in the context of co-location connection service, it can be used to reduce power consumption of paired devices that can communicate using short range wireless communication technology and that also have location detection capability, such as GPS sensors. The online power optimization for co-location connection service may be implemented in a networked computing environment, referred to as a messaging system, which is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Network Computing Environment</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing an example messaging system <b>100</b> for exchanging data (e.g., messages and associated content) over a network.

In various example examples, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone computer system, a client computer system, or a server computer system) or one or more hardware components of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware component that operates to perform certain operations as described herein. A hardware component may also be implemented mechanically, electronically, or any suitable combination thereof. For example, a hardware component may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. A hardware component may be a special-purpose processor, such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). A hardware component may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example, a hardware component may include software executed by a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor. Once configured by such software, hardware components become specific machines (or specific components of a machine) uniquely tailored to perform the configured functions and are no longer general-purpose processors. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware component mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software), may be driven by cost and time considerations. Accordingly, the phrase &#x201c;hardware component&#x201d;(or &#x201c;hardware-implemented component&#x201d;) should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering examples in which hardware components are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware components need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where a hardware component comprises a general-purpose processor configured by software to become a special-purpose processor, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special-purpose processors (e.g., comprising different hardware components) at different times. Software accordingly configures a particular processor or processors, for example, to constitute a particular hardware component at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware component at a different instance of time. Hardware components can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware components. Accordingly, the described hardware components may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware components exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) between or among two or more of the hardware components. In examples in which multiple hardware components are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware components may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware components have access. For example, one hardware component may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware component may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware components may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information). The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented components that operate to perform one or more operations or functions described herein. As used herein, &#x201c;processor-implemented component&#x201d; refers to a hardware component implemented using one or more processors. Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented, with a particular processor or processors being an example of hardware. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors <b>1004</b> or processor-implemented components. Moreover, the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a &#x201c;cloud computing&#x201d; environment or as a &#x201c;software as a service&#x201d; (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), with these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., an API). The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some examples, the processors or processor-implemented components may be located in a single geographic location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or a server farm). In other examples, the processors or processor-implemented components may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">&#x201c;Computer-readable storage medium&#x201d; refers to both machine-storage media and transmission media.
