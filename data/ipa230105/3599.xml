No. 63/217,947, filed on Jul. 2, 2021, the entirety of which application is incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to the field of fluid devices and systems. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to monitoring and relieving pressure in fluid devices and systems. Even more particularly, the present disclosure relates to single-use devices and systems such as tube sets and fluid bags, and monitoring and relieving pressure therein.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tube sets for fluid flow and fluid bags are well known for use in various systems in various industries. More particularly, tube sets may be used to fluidly connect various components of systems with fermenters, bioreactors, chromatography filters, pumps, etc. For instance, tube sets may be used between two or more fermenters and/or bioreactors; between a fermenter and/or bioreactor and an associated filter; between filters; from a filter to an exhaust port; to transport fluids to a collection container (e.g., bag, vessel, etc.); to direct fluid to or from a pump; etc. The tube sets often include a generally flexible tube, and at least one connector, such as a hose barb, a T connector, a Y connector, etc. The tubes used in environments or systems requiring a high degree of sterility may be made of a material capable of being sterilized (e.g., gamma irradiated), such as a metal (e.g., stainless steel) a polymer, thermoplastic elastomer, or thermoplastic (e.g., silicone). Moreover, tube sets used in environments or systems requiring a high degree of sterility often are made for single use applications. As such, the tubes may not be designed to withstand high degrees of pressure. However, fluid flow through tubes of a tube set may be controlled at various points to control or direct fluid as needed or desired. For instance, tubes are regularly clamped or pinched (e.g., with a pinch clamp squeezing the exterior of the tube). If one or more components of a system are coupled with a tube set which has been clamped or pinched, and one or more of the components are run without consideration of the state of fluid flow through the tube set, the maximum pressure through the tube may be exceeded and the tube may burst. Not only may sterility be lost, but caustic or toxic fluids may also be sprayed from the system with various deleterious consequences. Equipment may be damaged as well. For instance, if a pump is run at too high a rate and a tube coupled to the pump has been pinched or clamped, not only may the tube burst, but the pump may also be damaged. Even if there is no interference with fluid flow through the tube set or system in which the tube set is provided (in other words, even if tubes remain open for regular fluid flow therethrough), spikes in pressure may occur and may compromise the integrity or functioning of components of the tube set/system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the above, monitoring and relieving pressure, such as in a single-use system, is critical, such as for operator safety, maintaining desired yield, maintaining quality, preventing damage to system components, preventing system failure, maintaining integrity and continuity of system components and processes, etc. Although various sensors exist for monitoring pressure, such sensors must be monitored. And existing pressure gauges and indicators and relief valves are formed of stainless steel and not readily integrated into tube sets such as those used in sterile environments and/or for single use. The cost of existing pressure gauges and indicators and relief valves may be prohibitive, particularly in a single-use, disposable system. Various industries utilizing tube sets remain in need of pressure gauges and/or pressure relief valves (optionally with visual indicators and/or sensors) which are usable, in particular, in single use, disposable systems, such as in sterile environments. In addition or alternatively, it would be desirable for a pressure gauge to be designed for a sterile environment without a hold-up volume or dead leg in which fluid may build up and/or bacteria may proliferate.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This summary of the disclosure is given to aid understanding, and one of skill in the art will understand that each of the various aspects and features of the disclosure may advantageously be used separately in some instances, or in combination with other aspects and features of the disclosure in other instances. No limitation as to the scope of the claimed subject matter is intended by either the inclusion or non-inclusion of elements, components, or the like in this summary.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with various principles of the present disclosure, a pressure gauge with integrated relief valve is configured to measure and to relieve fluid within a fluid-containing structure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the pressure gauge with integrated relief valve includes a housing having a first end and a second end and having an inner surface defining a passage between the first end and the second end.

Various separate and independent features of a pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve are described herein which may be combinable or which may be provided separately from one another. Reference in this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments&#x201d;, &#x201c;other embodiments&#x201d;, etc. indicates that one or more particular features, structures, and/or characteristics in accordance with principles of the present disclosure may be included in connection with the embodiment. However, such references do not necessarily mean that all embodiments include the particular features, structures, and/or characteristics, or that an embodiment includes all features, structures, and/or characteristics. Some embodiments may include one or more such features, structures, and/or characteristics, in various combinations thereof. Moreover, references to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments&#x201d;, &#x201c;other embodiments&#x201d;, etc. in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor are separate or alternative embodiments necessarily mutually exclusive of other embodiments. When particular features, structures, and/or characteristics are described in connection with one embodiment, it should be understood that such features, structures, and/or characteristics may also be used in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described, unless clearly stated to the contrary. It should further be understood that such features, structures, and/or characteristics may be used or present singly or in various combinations with one another to create alternative embodiments which are considered part of the present disclosure, as it would be too cumbersome to describe all of the numerous possible combinations and subcombinations of features, structures, and/or characteristics. Moreover, various features, structures, and/or characteristics are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly, various features, structures, and/or characteristics or requirements are described which may be features, structures, and/or characteristics or requirements for some embodiments but may not be features, structures, and/or characteristics or requirements for other embodiments. Therefore, the present invention is not limited to only the embodiments specifically described herein.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, a pressure gauge and/or a pressure relief valve is configured for use with a single-use, disposable component through which or into which fluid flows, such as a tube set, or a bag (e.g., a fluid collection bag, a fluid containment bag, a fluid mixing bag, a bioreactor, etc.). It will be appreciated that references herein to fluid are intended to include references to gases and/or liquids. For the sake of convenience, and without intent to limit, reference may be made simply to a tube set, with the understanding that other components, such as bags or otherwise, may be encompassed by such reference (e.g., as an alternative, or in addition). Moreover, for the sake of convenience, and without intent to limit, a structure through which fluid flows or is contained may be generically referenced herein as a fluid-containing structure. For use with some systems requiring sterility, the tube set may be formed of a sterilizable material. For use with such sterile systems, the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve also is formed of a sterilizable material. As referenced herein, a sterilizable material generally is readily sterilized by such common processes as autoclaving, exposure to gamma radiation, steaming, or exposure to other sterilizing gases such as ethylene oxide. Moreover, for use with single-use, disposable tube sets, the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve may be formed of a material commonly used for single-use and to be discarded rather than reused and recycled. As those of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate, such materials generally are not metals, and may be plastics/polymers (such as polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polycarbonate (PC), polysulfone (PSU), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), etc.), or silicone, or a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) or other materials which are generally less expensive and/or more easily formable into the desired components. In some embodiments, the material of at least a part of a pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve formed in accordance with various principles of the present disclosure is compatible with the material of the fluid-containing structure to which the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve is to be coupled. Such compatible materials may be selected to be capable of being plastic or TPE welded. molded (e.g., over-molded or insert molded), or otherwise coupled together so that the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve may be retrofitted (e.g., modified from its as-manufactured form or configuration) onto and/or with existing fluid-containing structures, which generally do not include a pressure gauge or a pressure relief valve. For instance, a tube of a tube set may be cut and spliced together with a pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve inserted between the cut ends of the tube.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, a pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve is formed in accordance with various principles of the present disclosure with one or more fittings configured to be coupled with a fluid-containing structure. In some embodiments, the fitting may be a straight-through fitting configured for fluid to flow therethrough, such as in-line or otherwise generally along the fluid flow path of the fluid-containing structure. Such configuration may be suitable for insertion along tubing of a tube set. The pressure gauge and/or relief valve may extend transverse to the fitting. In some embodiments, the fitting may be a port-type fitting along a wall of a fluid-containing structure, such as extending through the wall (e.g., having a longitudinal axis generally transverse to a plane in which the wall extends). The fitting can be coupled to a fluid-containing structure through any of the following mechanisms, or other known or heretofore known mechanisms, without limitation: any of a variety of mechanical/structural connectors (e.g., hose barb; sanitary clamp; Luer connection; etc.); welding (e.g., welding of a TPE fitting to tubing such as TPE tubing; plastic welding to the wall of the fluid-containing structure such as impulse, ultrasonic, etc., welding); molding (e.g., silicone-over-molded/insert-molded into a fluid path; polymeric-over-molded/insert-molded onto a product device; etc.); etc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In accordance with various principles of the present disclosure, a pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve may be formed to minimize or reduce or even completely eliminate any dead leg or hold-up volume which typically is present in pressure gauges and/or pressure relief valves. In some embodiments, the indicator element of a pressure gauge formed in accordance with principles of the present disclosure, or the movable valve of a relief valve formed in accordance with principles of the present disclosure, is positioned in-line with or substantially in-line with the inner walls of the tube set with which the pressure gauge or relief valve is coupled. The inner walls of the tube set generally may be considered to define or form the fluid passage with which the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve is associated. As such, fluid flowing through the tube set is not significantly diverted into the pressure gauge and/or relief valve (such as in a passage of or a passage leading to the pressure gauge and/or relief valve), and does not pool or remain stationary therein. In some embodiments, the movable element of the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve has a rest position (when fluid is flowing at the desired flow rate and/or pressure through the fluid passage) at the bottom of the passage from the fluid passage into the functional passage of the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve (the passage in the pressure gauge at which the movable element would indicate the pressure of fluid flowing through the tube set, or the passage through which fluid is diverted to be released via the relief valve).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve may be formed in accordance with various principles of the present disclosure in a simple configuration with minimal (e.g., one or two) moving parts. For instance, a pressure gauge formed in accordance with various principles of the present disclosure may simply include a movable element (e.g., a follower) within a passage of a housing of the pressure gauge. The movable element may be a ball or disk which floats up and down the passage such as when pressure increases in the fluid-containing structure and fluid in such structure is diverted into the pressure gauge. The movable element may move with respect to graduated markings on the housing and thus may serve as an indicator of pressure within the housing of the pressure gauge and/or within the system with which the pressure gauge is coupled. The housing may be transparent or translucent, or may have a transparent or translucent window therein, to allow viewing of the movable element relative to the graduated markings to determine pressure within the housing and/or the system with which the pressure gauge is provided. A biasing element, such as a spring (more particularly, such as a tuned spring), may be provided to maintain the movable element in a neutral/zero pressure/baseline position under normal operating conditions in which the system functions without incident. If pressure increases (e.g., within the system to which the pressure gauge is coupled) above an acceptable level, the movable element may be moved by such pressure against the biasing element. The pressure gauge can be set for different ranges of pressure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Likewise, a relief valve formed in accordance with various principles of the present disclosure may simply include a movable element (e.g., a follower) within a passage of a housing of the relief valve. The movable element may be similar to the movable element described above with respect to a pressure gauge formed in accordance with various principles of the present disclosure. The housing passage may taper outwardly from an end of the passage closer to the fluid-containing structure to an end further away from the fluid-containing structure (such as a result of drafting of the housing during manufacture). As the movable element is moved further away from the fluid-containing structure (e.g., as a result of rising pressure), at a certain distance, fluid can flow past the movable element and out of the housing of the relief valve. In some embodiments, the movable element is a flexible element. A flexible movable element may seal against the inner walls of the relief valve housing when positioned adjacent the fluid-containing structure. As the flexible movable element moves up a tapered passage, the distance between the periphery of the flexible movable element and the inner surface of the passage increases until fluid can pass therebetween, such as to exit the relief valve. In some embodiments, the flexible movable element is reduced in size (e.g., folded or bent or otherwise configured to extend across a smaller space than the full size defined by the periphery of the movable element) such as when positioned adjacent the fluid-containing structure. The flexible movable element increases in size or extent (e.g., width or size defined by the periphery thereof relative to the inner dimensions of the passage) as it moves away from the fluid-containing structure. At a certain distance, the outer dimensions of the movable element are smaller than the inner dimensions of the passage, and fluid can pass therebetween. Fluid passing the movable element may exit the relief valve (e.g., leave the fluid-containing structure and/or devices coupled thereto), such as through an end of the housing spaced from the fluid-containing structure. Release of fluid (by exiting the relief valve) may prevent catastrophic failure to the fluid-containing structure and any devices coupled thereto, injury to the operator, loss of product, etc. A fitting may be coupled to the relief valve, and may be in fluid communication with an external fluid path through which fluid may be directed, such as to a bag, drain, or collection vessel/container. The relief valve may be chosen to trigger at the maximum working range of all acceptable pressures for the fluid-containing structure and/or systems or devices coupled thereto.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, pressure gauge features and components, and relief valve features and components may be combined into a single device. For instance, in some embodiments, the housing of the pressure gauge may also serve as the outlet for the relief valve. Even more particularly, in some embodiments, a movable indicator used to indicate pressure in a pressure gauge may also serve a dual purpose as a movable valve of a pressure relief valve. The housing may be tapered or have a drafted passage for a movable pressure gauge indicator/moveable relief valve element. In some embodiments, a common housing of a pressure gauge and relief valve may be provided with indicia for measuring pressure, and an end of the housing spaced from the tube set may be formed as a pressure relief outlet. The housing may be formed of a transparent or translucent material to allow a movable indicator or valve to be visible therethrough. The position of the movable indicator relative to markings on the housing may be used to indicate the measured pressure of fluid flowing through the tube set (and, optionally, pressure through at least that part of the system in which the tube set is provided). Different biasing elements may be used for each device to enable different pressure gauge and relief ranges and setpoints, respectively.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In accordance with various principles of the present disclosure, a sensor may be coupled to a pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve to transmit information such as pressure information to another component in fluid communication with the tube set with which the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve is coupled. In some embodiments, the sensor may be coupled to a component of the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve. In some embodiments, the sensor may be coupled to a spring of the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve (such as a spring associated with a movable indicator or valve element). In some embodiments, the sensor may otherwise track a movable indicator or valve element of the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve, such as with a visual sensor tracking movement of a movable indicator or valve element.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be appreciated that in the following description, elements, or components similar among the various illustrated embodiments with reference numbers under 1000 are generally designated with the same reference numbers increased by 100 and redundant description is omitted.

The housing passage is in fluid communication with the fluid-containing structure to which the housing is coupled or from which the housing otherwise extends. The movable element is a structure which is sized, shaped, configured, dimensioned, and positioned to move within the housing passage in response to pressure of fluid within the fluid-containing structure. In the case of a pressure gauge, as described with reference to an example of an embodiment in further detail below, the movable element may be structured as an indicator which moves relative to the housing to indicate the pressure of fluid within the fluid-containing structure. In the case of a relief valve, as described with reference to an example of an embodiment in further detail below, the movable element is a pressure valve which moves towards a pressure relief position in which fluid may be released if fluid pressure in the fluid-containing structure exceeds a pressure-relief value.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with various principles of the present disclosure, a pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve <b>100</b> may have movable element <b>130</b> therein configured to reduce or prevent the formation of a hold-up of fluid therein (which is common in prior art pressure gauges and/or pressure relief valves). More specifically, in the example of an embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve <b>100</b> is coupled to tubing <b>1002</b> of a tube set <b>1000</b> through which fluid flows. A housing <b>120</b> of the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve <b>100</b> defines a passage <b>122</b> with a longitudinal axis LA extending transversely to the flow path FP through the tubing <b>1002</b>. As may be appreciated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a movable element <b>130</b> within the passage <b>122</b> is sized, shaped, dimensioned, configured, and/or positioned under normal operating conditions (e.g., in a rest position) to inhibit or to block or to prevent passage of fluid from the tubing <b>1002</b> of the tube set <b>1000</b> into the passage <b>122</b> in the housing <b>120</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;normal operating conditions&#x201d; are conditions in which the tube set <b>1000</b> operates without causing the tubing <b>1002</b> to expand or deform from a neutral configuration (such as a configuration in which no fluid or other substance is within or passing through the tubing <b>1002</b>). In other words, normal operating conditions exist when the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve <b>100</b> does not register elevated pressure or require relief of excess pressure from within the tube set <b>1000</b>. In the example of an embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the movable element <b>130</b> has a first side <b>131</b> facing toward the flow path FP and a second side <b>133</b> facing away from the flow path FP. Under normal operating conditions, in the example of an embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first side <b>131</b> of the movable element <b>130</b> is substantially aligned with the inner surface <b>1003</b> of the tubing <b>1002</b>. Fluid flowing along flow path FP thus cannot collect or stagnate (or at least minimally collects) or otherwise create a hold-up volume in a dead leg region toward the passage <b>122</b> within the pressure gauge and/or pressure relief valve <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, a biasing element <b>140</b> (e.g., a spring element, such as a coil spring) may exert a biasing force against the second side <b>133</b> of the movable element <b>130</b> to maintain the movable element <b>130</b> in a position substantially aligned with the inner surface <b>1003</b> of the tubing <b>1002</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

In some embodiments, the housing <b>120</b> is formed of a transparent or translucent material with graduated markings <b>126</b> formed thereon, or includes a window of a transparent or translucent material along which the graduated markings <b>126</b> are located (e.g., on the window or alongside the window). The movable element <b>130</b> may be a colored element (or otherwise visually distinct element) visible through the housing <b>120</b> adjacent the graduated markings <b>126</b>. The position of the movable element <b>130</b> with respect to one of the graduated markings <b>126</b> indicates the fluid pressure within the tube set <b>1000</b>/pressure gauge <b>100</b> as indicated by the graduated markings <b>126</b>.
