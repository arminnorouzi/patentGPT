The shaft <b>500</b> is inserted from a to-be-sealed side (O), which corresponds to an area to be sealed, toward an opposite side (A) thereof. Before the shaft <b>500</b> is inserted through the insertion hole <b>610</b>, the gasket <b>700</b> is preliminarily mounted in the insertion hole <b>610</b> by using a jig not shown.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, the gasket <b>700</b> includes a reinforcing ring <b>710</b> and a seal main body <b>720</b> made of an elastic material and provided integrally with the reinforcing ring <b>710</b>.
