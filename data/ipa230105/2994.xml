INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to concrete forms for posts, piers, footings and other structural pillars.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Concrete posts, piers, footings and other structural pillars are a common component of infrastructure ranging from footings for decks and bridges to columns in multi-story buildings.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These posts, piers, footings and other structural pillars are constructed by pouring concrete into a form. Typically a tubular form is used. Tubular forms made of spirally wrapped paper are well known in the above-mentioned industries. The tubular paper forms are normally set, at least partially, below grade in a hole. Soil is backfilled into the hole to stabilize the tube and the tube is then filled with flowable concrete. Once the concrete has set, the form is removed if the confines of the hole allow or the form is left on the concrete to deteriorate over time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The paper tube forms are subject to damage if exposed to relatively wet conditions, such as being submersed into a hole with water seepage. Being subject to water damage, the time frame for completing the form pouring is limited to reduce the possibility of changing weather conditions or seepage of water over time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, what is needed is a form tube that is usable in less than ideal building conditions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thermoplastic concrete form tubes are widely available and well suited for use in less than ideal building conditions. However, thermoplastic form tubes are generally limited to forms having a diameter of less than about 16 inches as thermoplastic concrete forms of larger diameter are susceptible to radial compression and collapse when subjected to backfill pressure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, a need exists for a thermoplastic form tube having a diameter greater than about 16 inches which can structurally withstand backfill pressure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A first aspect of the invention is a single-piece thermoplastic inflexible concrete form tube at least 16 inches in diameter and at least 4 feet long with integrally formed fully encircling circumferentially continuous radially rigidifying ribs. The ribs are axially spaced along the full axial length of the tube between 10 and 36 inches apart center-to-center whereby any 3 foot length of the tube includes at least one radially rigidifying rib.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A second aspect of the invention is a method of forming a concrete column employing a concrete form tube in accordance with the first aspect of the invention. The method includes the steps of (a) excavating soil to form a hole, (b) inserting a first axial end of the concrete form tube into the hole, (c) backfilling the hole around the concrete form tube to create a stabilized concrete form tube, and (d) pouring concrete into the stabilized concrete form tube from a second longitudinal end of the concrete form tube.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is side view of one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is cross-sectional view of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> taken along line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a side view of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> placed into an evacuated hole prior to backfilling.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a side view of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> after backfilling.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Nomenclature</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0015"><b>10</b> Concrete Form Tube</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0016"><b>10</b><i>a </i>Tube Length</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0017"><b>11</b> First Axial End</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0018"><b>12</b> Second Axial End</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0019"><b>13</b> Wall of Tube</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0020"><b>13</b><i>t </i>Wall Thickness</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0021"><b>14</b> Interior Surface</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0022"><b>15</b> Exterior Surface</li>    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0023"><b>20</b> Circumferentially Continuous Radially Rigidifying Ribs</li>    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0024"><b>24</b> Circumferential Shoulder</li>    <li id="ul0001-0011" num="0025"><b>24</b><i>a </i>Axial Width of Circumferential Shoulder</li>    <li id="ul0001-0012" num="0026"><b>24</b><i>r </i>Radial Depth of Circumferential Shoulder</li>    <li id="ul0001-0013" num="0027"><b>25</b> Circumferential Groove</li>    <li id="ul0001-0014" num="0028"><b>25</b><i>a </i>Axial Width of Circumferential Groove</li>    <li id="ul0001-0015" num="0029"><b>25</b><i>r </i>Radial Depth of Circumferential Groove</li>    <li id="ul0001-0016" num="0030"><b>30</b><sub>n </sub>Axial Spacing Between Ribs</li>    <li id="ul0001-0017" num="0031"><b>100</b> Soil</li>    <li id="ul0001-0018" num="0032"><b>109</b> Hole in the Soil</li>    <li id="ul0001-0019" num="0033"><b>110</b> Frost Line</li>    <li id="ul0001-0020" num="0034">a Axial Direction</li>    <li id="ul0001-0021" num="0035">r Radial Direction</li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0036">Construction</p><p id="p-0018" num="0037">The concrete forming tube <b>10</b> is an inflexible large diameter compression resistant tube <b>10</b>. The tube <b>10</b> may be used to form pillars, posts, supports, piers, columns, shafts, pilings, or footings that serve as a foundation or prop for a structure or item such as outdoor sign posts, light poles, lamp posts, fence posts, pilings for decks and homes, play structures, gardens, and mailboxes. One of the more common uses of such large diameter concrete forming tubes <b>10</b> is pilings and footings which extend a substantial distance below grade. Therefore, the remainder of the discussion will be based upon a concrete forming tube <b>10</b> used to form below grade footings.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, one embodiment of the invention is a large diameter, inflexible, compression resistant concrete forming tube <b>10</b>. The concrete forming tube <b>10</b> is made of thermoplastic such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, etc., with the preferred material comprising recyclable polyethylene. The use of a thermoplastic allows the concrete forming tube <b>10</b> to be used in wet areas as water will not penetrate through the sidewall <b>13</b> of the concrete forming tube <b>10</b> during pouring, a phenomena that can occur when using concrete forming tubes of other materials and is known to affect the quality of the concrete poured into the forming tube. The use of a material such as polyethylene also allows the concrete forming tube <b>10</b> to be set into place a period of time prior to pouring without underground water or weather conditions significantly affecting the quality of the concrete forming tube <b>10</b> itself. The use of a material such as polyethylene may also allow the concrete forming tube <b>10</b> to reduce the effects of frost heaving as materials such as polyethylene may decompose at a much slower rate than other materials such as paper.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0039">The inflexible nature of the tube <b>10</b> is necessary to ensure that any concrete structure formed with the tube <b>10</b> is a vertically straight linear structure whereby the structure predominantly experiences a downward compressive force from a load placed upon the structure rather than a shear force. Concrete generally has excellent compressive strength but poor shear strength.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the concrete forming tube <b>10</b> has a sidewall <b>13</b> that extends a longitudinal length <b>10</b><i>a </i>from a first open axial end <b>11</b> to a second open axial end <b>12</b>. The sidewall <b>13</b> defines an interior surface <b>14</b> and an exterior surface <b>15</b>. The sidewall <b>13</b> has a thickness <b>13</b><i>t</i>. The concrete forming tube <b>10</b> is a large diameter tube (i) at least 4 feet long, preferably between 4 and 10 feet long, in the axial direction a, (ii) at least 16 inches in diameter, preferably between 16 and 36 inches in diameter, in the radial direction r, and (iii) preferably formed as a single-piece. Tubes <b>10</b> having a diameter of less than about 16 inches are not particularly susceptible to radial compression while tubes <b>10</b> having a diameter of greater than about 36 inches, even when formed in accordance with this invention, remain susceptible to radial compression.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0041">The concrete forming tube <b>10</b> has a plurality of integrally formed fully encircling circumferentially continuous radially rigidifying ribs <b>20</b> axially a spaced between about 10 and 36 inches apart center-to-center along the full axial a length of the tube whereby any 3 foot length of the tube <b>10</b> includes at least one radially rigidifying rib <b>20</b>. A spacing of less than about 10 inches begins to introduce unwelcome side-to-side bendability to the tube <b>10</b> akin to that observed with corrugated drainage pipe (i.e., the tube <b>10</b> starts to becomes flexible) absent a concomitant increase in compression resistance, while a spacing of greater than about 36 inchest begins to significantly reduce the compression resistance attributable to the ribs <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0042">The range of preferred axial spacing <b>30</b><i>n </i>of the ribs <b>20</b> on a tube <b>10</b> is dependent upon the diameter of the tube <b>10</b>, with the range of suitable spacing decreasing as the diameter increases. A preferred axial spacing <b>30</b><i>n </i>between radially rigidifying ribs <b>20</b> on a single tube <b>10</b> is between (1 ft)(2 ft/diameter of the tube <b>10</b>) and (1 ft)(4 ft/diameter of the tube <b>10</b>) with a minimum spacing of about 10 inches and a maximum spacing of about 36 inches. By way of example, following this preferred spacing algorithm a 16 inch tube should have ribs <b>20</b> spaced between 1.5 ft calculated as (1 ft)(24 inches/16 inches) and 3 ft calculated as (1 ft)(48 inches/16 inches) while a 36 inch tube should have ribs <b>20</b> spaced between 10 inches as (1 ft)(24 inches/36 inches)=8 inches and the minimum is 10 inches, and 1.3 ft calculated as (1 ft)(48 inches/36 inches).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0043">Each radially rigidifying rib <b>20</b> creates a circumferential groove <b>25</b> in the exterior surface <b>15</b> of the tube <b>10</b> and a corresponding internally projecting circumferential shoulder <b>24</b> on the interior surface <b>14</b> of the tube <b>10</b>. Each circumferential groove <b>25</b> preferably has an axial width <b>25</b><i>a </i>of between about 1 and 4 inches and projects a radial depth <b>25</b><i>r </i>of between 0.2 and 1 inch inward from the outer surface <b>15</b> of the tube <b>10</b>, with each shoulder <b>24</b> having a corresponding axial width <b>24</b><i>a </i>and radial depth <b>24</b><i>r </i>projecting inward from the inner surface <b>14</b> of the tube <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0044">The thickness <b>13</b><i>t </i>of the concrete forming tube <b>10</b> between the interior surface <b>14</b> and the exterior surface <b>15</b>, may be any suitable thickness sufficient to hold the hydrostatic pressure of the concrete poured into the forming tube <b>10</b> without appreciable outward bulging of the sidewall <b>13</b> between ribs <b>20</b> and withstanding backfill compression pressure without appreciable inward bulging of the sidewall <b>13</b> between ribs <b>20</b>. The preferred concrete forming tube <b>10</b> thickness is between about 0.05 and 0.2 inches with a unform thickness throughout except for the natural thinning that accompanies blow molding.

The most preferred method of connection is an integrally formed slide fit connector <b>20</b> at one end <b>11</b> of the forming tube <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0046">Use</p><p id="p-0028" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, the concrete forming tube <b>10</b> can be used to form a concrete column (not shown) by (i) excavating soil <b>100</b> to form a hole <b>109</b>, (ii) inserting the first axial end <b>11</b> of the concrete forming tube <b>10</b> into the hole <b>109</b>, (iii) backfilling the hole <b>109</b> around the concrete forming tube <b>10</b> to create a stabilized concrete forming tube <b>10</b>, and (iv) pouring concrete into the stabilized concrete forming tube <b>10</b> from the second longitudinal end <b>12</b> of the concrete forming tube <b>10</b>.
