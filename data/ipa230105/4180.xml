Voltage regulators may increase or decrease the voltage provided by the source and provide a substantially constant voltage to the electronic device despite variations in current dissipated by the electronic device or fluctuations of the voltage received from the source.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Voltage regulators are used in a variety of electronic devices and systems to provide a constant regulated voltage. Conventionally, voltage regulators may include a high-gain amplifier to reduce a direct current (DC) regulation error.

Representative examples utilizing many of these additional features and teachings, both separately and in combination, are described in further detail with reference to the attached figures. This detailed description is merely intended to teach a person of skill in the art further details for practicing aspects of the present teachings and is not intended to limit the scope of the claims. Therefore, combinations of features disclosed above in the detailed description may not be necessary to practice the teachings in the broadest sense, and are instead taught merely to describe particularly representative examples of the present teachings.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the description below, for purposes of explanation only, specific nomenclature is set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required to practice the teachings of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some portions of the detailed descriptions herein are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are used by those skilled in the data processing arts to effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities.

It is also expressly noted that all value ranges or indications of groups of entities disclose every possible intermediate value or intermediate entity for the purpose of an original disclosure, as well as for the purpose of restricting the claimed subject matter. It is also expressly noted that the dimensions and the shapes of the components shown in the figures are designed to help to understand how the present teachings are practiced, but not intended to limit the dimensions and the shapes shown in the examples.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A voltage regulator that is implemented with only one slow, high-gain amplifier in a feedback loop may provide a good DC regulation, but its transient response speed in a high frequency and the load capacitance may be poor. In contrast, a voltage regulator that is implemented with only one amplifier, for example, fast and low-gain amplifier in the feedback loop may provide a poor DC regulation although its response speed and its load capacitance may be sufficiently good.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present voltage regulator implements at least two amplifiers including one fast, low-gain amplifier and one slow, high-gain amplifier and sums the outputs of the two amplifiers. The slow amplifier dominates in a low frequency band, and the fast amplifier dominates in a high frequency. Therefore, the present voltage regulator provides a good DC regulation, transient stability, fast response to load changes, and can accommodate a large load capacitance.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The two or more amplifiers included in the present voltage regulator can change the characteristics of the voltage regulator by shaping a gain and a phase of the voltage regulator. The present voltage regulator may avoid a tradeoff between a high-gain and a good phase margin that is inherent in conventional voltage regulators by employing the at least two differential amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, the present voltage regulator may extend a frequency bandwidth compared to a conventional voltage regulator to accommodate a large output decoupling capacitance (DCAP) or a large change of the DCAP and suppress a ripple in the regulated output voltage. In addition, the present voltage regulator may improve a transient response and attain a replica-regulator-level of power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) without a replica load that matches an actual load. The extended frequency bandwidth of the present voltage regulator allows an open-loop gain to be greater than 1 toward a higher frequency band. If the amplifier gain is less than 1, the PSRR corresponds to a voltage divider of an impedance resistance R<sub>o_pass </sub>of a pass transistor and a load resistor R<sub>load</sub>. In this case, the PSRR is proportional to 1/(1+A<sub>openloop</sub>), where A<sub>openloop </sub>is the open-loop gain.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a voltage regulator according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. A voltage regulator <b>100</b> includes a first amplifier <b>110</b>, a second amplifier <b>120</b>, a summer <b>130</b>, and a pass transistor <b>140</b>. As will be described further below, the voltage regulator <b>100</b> provides a high gain for direct current regulation while maintaining a relatively large phase margin by generating an output voltage V<sub>reg </sub>based on a sum of outputs of the first and second amplifiers <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The voltage regulator <b>100</b> is connected between a first voltage V<sub>dd </sub>and a second voltage V<sub>ss </sub>via a load <b>150</b>. The first voltage V<sub>dd </sub>may be higher than the second voltage V<sub>ss</sub>. For example, the first voltage V<sub>dd </sub>is 5V, 3.3V, 1.8V, or 1.2V, and the second voltage V<sub>ss </sub>is zero voltage. The first voltage V<sub>dd </sub>may also be referred to as a supply voltage, and the second voltage V<sub>ss </sub>may be referred to as a ground voltage.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The voltage regulator <b>100</b> receives a reference voltage V<sub>ref </sub>as an input and generates an output voltage V<sub>reg </sub>as an output. Each of the first and second amplifiers <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> may be a differential amplifier that receives two inputs including a first input and a second input, and generates an output that is provided to the summer <b>130</b>. The first input may correspond to the reference voltage V<sub>ref</sub>, and the second input may correspond to the output voltage V<sub>reg </sub>of the voltage regulator <b>100</b>. In other words, the output voltage V<sub>reg </sub>of the regulator <b>100</b> is fed back to each of the first and second amplifiers <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> as their second inputs. The reference voltage V<sub>ref </sub>may be provided to each of the first amplifier <b>110</b> and the second amplifier <b>120</b> as a positive input, and the output voltage V<sub>reg </sub>is provided to each of the first amplifier <b>110</b> and the second amplifier <b>120</b> as a negative input. An error between the positive input and the negative input may be compensated to provide the output voltage V<sub>reg </sub>that is regulated according to the reference voltage V<sub>ref</sub>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The summer <b>130</b> receives the respective outputs from the first amplifier <b>110</b> and the second amplifier <b>120</b> and generates an output that corresponds to a sum of the first output from the first amplifier <b>110</b> and the second output from the second amplifier <b>120</b>. The output of the summer <b>130</b> controls the pass transistor <b>140</b> that is connected between the first voltage V<sub>dd </sub>and the load <b>150</b>. Based on the output from the summer <b>130</b>, the pass transistor <b>140</b> may generate the output voltage V<sub>reg </sub>of the voltage regulator <b>100</b>. The output voltage V<sub>reg </sub>of the voltage regulator <b>100</b> may be determined based on the sum output by the summer <b>130</b> and a plurality of parameters including, but not limited to, the first voltage V<sub>dd</sub>, the second voltage V<sub>ss</sub>, and a collector load (herein also referred to as an impedance) of the pass transistor <b>140</b>, etc. The voltage regulator <b>100</b> may output the output voltage V<sub>reg </sub>despite changes in the load <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to one embodiment, the pass transistor <b>140</b> may be a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). In this case, the pass transistor <b>140</b> has a drain electrode coupled to the first voltage V<sub>dd</sub>, a source electrode connected to the load <b>150</b> and outputting the out voltage V<sub>reg</sub>, and a gate electrode connected to the output of the summer <b>130</b>. Based on the output voltage of the summer <b>130</b>, the pass transistor <b>140</b> outputs the output voltage V<sub>reg</sub>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one embodiment, the pass transistor <b>140</b> may have a cascode structure (not shown) including at least two transistors connected in series, with the first one operating as a common emitter or a common source and the other one as a common base or a common gate. The pass transistor <b>140</b> having a cascode transistor can improve input-output isolation and reduce reverse transmission by eliminating direct coupling from the output to the input. As a result, the pass transistor <b>140</b> can eliminate the Miller effect and contribute to a higher bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first amplifier <b>110</b> has a first gain A<sub>fast </sub>and a first cut-off frequency f<sub>3bd_fast</sub>, and the second amplifier <b>120</b> has a second gain A<sub>slow </sub>and a second cut-off frequency f<sub>3db_slow</sub>. The first and second cut-off frequencies are herein also referred to as 3 decibel (dB) frequencies defining frequency bandwidths of the first amplifier <b>110</b> and the second amplifier <b>120</b>, respectively. At the cut-off frequency, the first and second amplifiers <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> have a power output that is dropped to half (3 dB) of its peak. The greater a cut-off frequency a device has, the greater the power supply rejection ratio and the phase margin of the device are.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to one embodiment, the second gain A<sub>slow </sub>of the second amplifier <b>120</b> is greater than the first gain A<sub>fast </sub>of the first amplifier <b>110</b>. For example, the second gain A<sub>slow </sub>of the second amplifier <b>120</b> is an order of magnitude greater than the first gain A<sub>fast </sub>of the first amplifier <b>110</b>. In this case, the DC accuracy of the output voltage V<sub>reg </sub>from the voltage regulator <b>100</b> is dominantly determined by the second gain A<sub>slow </sub>of the second amplifier <b>120</b>. The second gain A<sub>slow </sub>of the second amplifier <b>120</b> may be set to provide a good DC regulation for the voltage regulator <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to one embodiment, the first cut-off frequency f<sub>3db_fast </sub>of the first amplifier <b>110</b> is greater than the second cut-off frequency f<sub>3db_slow </sub>of the second amplifier <b>120</b>. In this regard, the first amplifier <b>110</b> may be referred to as a fast amplifier, and the second amplifier <b>120</b> may be referred to as a slow amplifier. For example, the first cut-off frequency f<sub>3db_fast </sub>of the first amplifier <b>110</b> is an order of magnitude greater than the second cut-off frequency f<sub>3bd_slow </sub>of the second amplifier <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Because the output voltage of the voltage regulator <b>100</b> is based on a sum of the outputs of the first amplifier <b>110</b> and the second amplifier <b>120</b>, a cut-off frequency f<sub>3db_reg </sub>of the voltage regulator <b>100</b> may be based on both the first cut-off frequency f<sub>3db_fast </sub>and the second cut-off frequency f<sub>3db_slow</sub>. The cut-off frequency f<sub>3db_reg </sub>of the voltage regulator <b>100</b> may be greater than the second cut-off frequency f<sub>3db_slow </sub>of the second amplifier <b>120</b> (e.g., a higher gain amplifier), as shown and described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The second amplifier <b>120</b> may provide a high gain (and consequentially DC regulation) while the first amplifier <b>110</b> extends a phase margin of the voltage regulator <b>100</b>. Therefore, the voltage regulator <b>100</b> may have both a high gain and a relatively large phase margin rather than trading a phase margin for a high gain.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, the outputs of the amplifiers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may not &#x201c;fight&#x201d; each other due to several reasons. For example, the second amplifier <b>120</b> may have a relatively high gain and set current in the first amplifier <b>110</b>, and the first amplifier <b>110</b> may have a relatively low gain and operate at the same current density as the pass transistor <b>140</b>. This may provide a harmonious operation between the first amplifier <b>110</b> and the second amplifier <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a circuit diagram of a voltage regulator according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. A voltage regulator <b>200</b> includes a first amplifier <b>210</b>, a second amplifier <b>220</b>, an impedance translating transistor <b>230</b>, and a pass transistor <b>240</b>. In one embodiment, the first amplifier <b>210</b> may include the impedance translating transistor <b>230</b>. In another embodiment, the impedance translating transistor <b>230</b> is separate from and connected to the first amplifier <b>210</b>. The voltage regulator <b>200</b> may be substantially similar to the voltage regulator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> except that the impedance translating transistor <b>230</b> may be used to sum the outputs of the first amplifier <b>210</b> and the second amplifier <b>220</b> instead of using a separate summer (e.g., the summer <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For example, the second amplifier <b>220</b> and the pass transistor <b>240</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may respectively correspond to the second amplifier <b>120</b> and the pass transistor <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
