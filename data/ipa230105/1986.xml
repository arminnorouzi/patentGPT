Front end portions of the load absorbing portions are respectively joined to rear end portions of side frames provided on both side portions in the vehicle width direction of a rear floor and extending in a front-rear direction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Under such a constitution, when a load (rear collision load) is applied from behind the vehicle to the rear portion of the vehicle, the bumper beam is firstly bent and deformed to receive the rear collision load. After that, the rear collision load that cannot be completely received by the bumper beam is transmitted to the load absorbing portions, and the load absorbing portions receive the rear collision load.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Here, in the above-described conventional technique, the rear collision load that can be absorbed by the bumper beam is limited to a very small load. Most of the rear collision load cannot be completely absorbed by bending and deforming of the bumper beam, and is received by the load absorbing portions. For this reason, the rear collision load is received by bending and deforming of the bumper beam, until the rear collision load is applied to the load absorbing portions. Hence, there is a problem that it takes time to reach a peak load of the rear collision load, and the peak load tends to increase.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, there is a problem that the rear collision load applied to the bumper beam is hardly transmitted to the load absorbing portions, and the rear collision load cannot be efficiently absorbed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, the load absorbing portions are respectively provided on both side portions in the vehicle width direction of the vehicle. For this reason, in a case where the position to which the rear collision load is applied is shifted from the center in the vehicle width direction of the rear portion of the vehicle, the rear collision load applied to each load absorbing portion may vary. As a result, there is a possibility that the side frames are damaged more than necessary, because the rear collision load cannot be completely absorbed by the load absorbing portions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present invention, a vehicle rear portion structure capable of suppressing the peak load of the rear collision load and efficiently absorbing the rear collision load is provided.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">(1) A vehicle rear portion structure (for example, a vehicle rear portion structure <b>1</b> in an embodiment) according to one aspect of the present invention includes: a center frame (for example, a center frame <b>15</b> in an embodiment) that is disposed closer to a center portion of a vehicle (for example, a vehicle <b>100</b> in an embodiment) in a vehicle width direction than both side portions of the vehicle in the vehicle width direction, that is disposed on a rear side in the vehicle, and that extends in a front-rear direction of the vehicle; and a bumper beam (for example, a bumper beam <b>21</b> in an embodiment) that is disposed on a rear side of the center frame to be next to the center frame, that is disposed at a position which overlaps the center frame when viewed from a front-rear direction, and that is configured to be crushable due to a rear collision load.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With the constitution as the above aspect (1), the bumper beam receives the rear collision load while being crushed. Furthermore, the rear collision load is transmitted to the center frame, while the bumper beam is being crushed. The center frame extends in the front-rear direction, and thus the mechanical strength of the center frame is easily ensured. As a result, the center frame is capable of receiving the rear collision load with certainty. Therefore, from the moment when the rear collision load is applied to the bumper beam, while the bumper beam is caused to be certainty crushed to certainty absorb the rear collision load, the center frame is capable of receiving the rear collision load. In addition, even in a case where an input position of the rear collision load is somewhat shifted from the center in the vehicle width direction, the rear collision load is firstly transmitted to the center frame. Accordingly, the peak load of the rear collision load can be suppressed, and the rear collision load can be efficiently absorbed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(2) The constitution in the above aspect (1) may further include a rear panel (for example, a rear panel <b>20</b> in an embodiment) provided between the center frame and the bumper beam, in which the bumper beam may be connected with the center frame via the rear panel.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the constitution as the above aspect (2), the rear collision load applied to the bumper beam can also be transmitted to the rear panel. In this manner, the rear collision load applied to the bumper beam can also be distributed to the rear panel in addition to the center frame. Therefore, the rear collision load is not concentrated on any specific component part of the vehicle other than the bumper beam. As a result, damage to the vehicle due to the rear collision load can be suppressed with certainty.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">(3) The constitution in the above aspect (2) may further include: a cross member (for example, a cross member <b>18</b> in an embodiment) that is disposed in front of the center frame, and that extends in the vehicle width direction; and side frames (for example, rear side frames <b>2</b> in an embodiment) respectively disposed on both side portions of the vehicle in the vehicle width direction, in which a front portion (for example, a front end portion <b>15</b><i>b </i>in an embodiment) of the center frame is connected with the cross member, and both end portions of the cross member in the vehicle width direction may be respectively connected with rear portions (for example, rear end portions <b>2</b><i>a </i>in an embodiment) of the side frames.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With the constitution as the above aspect (3), the rear collision load can be transmitted to the cross member through the center frame, and further, the rear collision load can be transmitted to the side frames disposed on both side portions in the vehicle width direction. Via the center frame, the rear collision load can be equally distributed to both side frames. Therefore, damage to the vehicle due to the rear collision load can be suppressed with more certainty.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">(4) In the constitution in the above aspect (3), the cross member may extend obliquely gradually forward from the center frame as approaching both outer sides in the vehicle width direction.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">With the constitution as the above aspect (4), the rear collision load applied to the center frame can be easily transmitted to both side frames, as compared with a case where the cross member extends linearly in the vehicle width direction.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(5) In the constitution in the above aspect (4), the center frame may extend linearly in the front-rear direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With the constitution as the above aspect (5), the rear collision load applied to the center frame can be transmitted to the cross member with certainty, as compared with a case where the center frame is formed in a bent manner. Therefore, the rear collision load can be distributed with certainty to the entire rear portion of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(6) In the constitution in the above aspect (2), the center frame, the bumper beam, and the rear panel may be fixed at an identical position.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With the constitution as the above aspect (6), the rear collision load applied to the bumper beam can be transmitted to the center frame more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">(7) The constitution in the above aspect (1) may further include a rear floor panel (for example, a rear floor panel <b>5</b> in an embodiment) disposed at a rear portion of the vehicle, in which the rear floor panel may be constituted by a double panel structure (for example, a double panel structure <b>10</b> in an embodiment) including an upper panel (for example, an upper panel <b>11</b> in an embodiment) and a lower panel (for example, a lower panel <b>12</b> in an embodiment) disposed below the upper panel, and the center frame may be provided on a lower surface (for example, a lower surface <b>11</b><i>d </i>in an embodiment) of the upper panel.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With the constitution as the above aspect (7), the load applied to the bumper beam can also be transmitted to the rear floor panel. The rear floor panel is constituted by the double panel structure, and thus the rear collision load can be further distributed on the rear panel. Therefore, damage to the vehicle due to the rear collision load can be suppressed with more certainty.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">(8) In the constitution in the above aspect (7), the bumper beam may be formed in a bent manner so as to bulge rearward between the upper panel and the lower panel, an upper fixing portion (for example, an upper fixing portion <b>21</b><i>d </i>in an embodiment) of the bumper beam may be shifted in an up-down direction with respect to a rear end (for example, a flange portion <b>19</b><i>a </i>in an embodiment) of the upper panel, and a lower fixing portion (for example, a lower fixing portion <b>21</b><i>e </i>in an embodiment) of the bumper beam may be shifted in the up-down direction with respect to a rear end (for example, a flange portion <b>19</b><i>b </i>in an embodiment) of the lower panel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With the constitution as the above aspect (8), the rear collision load can be preferentially transmitted to the center frame than the upper panel and the lower panel. That is, the positions of the respective fixing portions of the bumper beam are shifted from the positions of the rear end of the upper panel and the rear end of the lower panel, and thus the rear collision load applied to the bumper beam is not efficiently transmitted to each of the panels. On the other hand, the rear collision load is efficiently transmitted to the center frame. As a result, the function of the center frame can be exhibited sufficiently.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, in integrating the center frame, the bumper beam, the rear panel, and the floor panel, for example, when spot welding is adopted, it is possible to avoid spot welding with all of the center frame, the bumper beam, the rear panel, and each of the floor panels being overlapped. Therefore, it is possible to suppress a decrease in strength of the spot welding.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to an aspect of the present invention, the peak load of the rear collision load at the rear portion of the vehicle can be suppressed, and the rear collision load can be efficiently absorbed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a lower side of a vehicle rear portion structure in an embodiment of the present invention, when viewed obliquely from a rear left side.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view, taken along a front-rear direction and an up-down direction, illustrating the center and its vicinity in a vehicle width direction of the vehicle rear portion structure in an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an arrow view when viewed in an arrow III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partially exploded perspective view of a lower side of the vehicle rear portion structure, when viewed obliquely from a rear side in an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph illustrating a change in a rear collision load in the vehicle rear portion structure in an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a plan view, of the vehicle rear portion structure, illustrating a modification of a cross member, when viewed from a lower side in an embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described, based on the drawings.
