More specifically, various embodiments of the disclosure relate to methods and systems for controlling a ventilator.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In wake of an exponential rise in respiratory problems in individuals, due to multiple underlying issues (for example, coronavirus disease, pneumonia, asthma, snakebites, or the like), use of ventilators has become very crucial. Availability of a ventilator at the right time could prevent further deterioration of health of a patient. However, the healthcare sector often faces shortage of ventilators. A few reasons behind such shortage of the ventilators are its high cost of manufacturing and repair. The fact that ventilators are fragile and break down easily makes it even more difficult for the healthcare sector to maintain availability of a sufficient number of ventilators at all times.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A known reason behind such high cost of manufacturing and repair of ventilators is the use of expensive components in the ventilators. For example, a flow sensor used in a ventilator, to measure a tidal volume of air flowing via the ventilator, is a cost-intensive component. Further, the flow sensor tends to break down very easily and hence leads to a frequent requirement for maintenance of the ventilator, which adds to the cost of the ventilator. Such sudden break down of the ventilator may be fatal to an individual in its need, and hence may cause loss of lives and emotional trauma. Also, such components may be cost intensive to replace/repair and may also cause financial loss to an owner of the ventilator.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of the foregoing, there exists a need for a technical and reliable solution that overcomes the abovementioned problems and provides a robust and inexpensive ventilator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of described systems with some aspects of the present disclosure, as set forth in the remainder of the present application and with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Ventilators, methods and systems for controlling ventilators are provided substantially as shown in, and described in connection with, at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure may be appreciated from a review of the following detailed description of the present disclosure, along with the accompanying figures in which like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram that illustrates a ventilator, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram that illustrates a breathing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram that illustrates a pressure line adaptor used in the ventilator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram that illustrates a longitudinal-sectional view of the pressure line adaptor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is another schematic diagram that illustrates a pressure line adaptor, in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is a schematic diagram that illustrates a longitudinal-sectional view of the pressure line adaptor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a table that illustrates an exemplary look-up table, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram that illustrates a human machine interface of a ventilator, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram that illustrates a system architecture of a computer system for controlling a ventilator, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart that illustrates a method for controlling a ventilator, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>, collectively, illustrate a high-level flowchart of a method for controlling a ventilator, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Certain embodiments of the disclosure may be found in the disclosed ventilator, systems, and methods for controlling ventilators.

For the sake of brevity, the look-up table <b>400</b> is shown to include five sets of calibration values (i.e., S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, S<b>4</b>, and S<b>5</b>) for the plurality of parameters.

The first set of calibration values S<b>1</b>, further includes the desired volume of the gaseous inhalant (Vt) to be delivered to the patient within the time-interval to be &#x201c;250 milliliters (ml)&#x201d;. The first set of calibration values S<b>1</b>, further includes the RR to be &#x201c;10 breaths per minute (bpm)&#x201d; and the IE ratio to be &#x201c;1:2&#x201d;. Therefore, the patient breathes 10 times in each minute, and each breath cycle lasts for 6 seconds.

The time-interval is determined, by the control system <b>106</b>, for each set of calibration values based on values of corresponding RR and IE. The compression value applied to the bag valve <b>110</b> within the time-interval is used by the control system <b>106</b> to determine a compression rate.
