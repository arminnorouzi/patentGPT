The combination of the cantilever frame construction (with no side frames) and the edge/side driven belting allows for superior access and cleanability, which is of paramount importance to the food market, where sanitation requirements are stringent to improve food safety, prevent growth of bacteria and ensure food safety.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a spiral conveyor <b>100</b> with an open configuration to provide a sanitary design. Spiral conveyors include advantages including a small operating footprint, high throughput, and, many times, a single drive. The small operating footprint may provide space savings. The spiral conveyors convey the load in a continuous flow, creating high throughput. Driving the belt from the side allows the belt tension to be equally distributed through the length of the belt instead of at the end. This style of driving and distribution of the tension allows longer belting runs. Further, spiral conveyors provide ease of installation and can be installed as a single piece that is pre-assembled and tested. Spiral conveyors can also be used as a process step in an operation to allow for curing, cooling, or other time-based processes that are required in between either process or packaging steps in the production line.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The spiral conveyor <b>100</b> includes legs <b>110</b> supporting a cantilever frame <b>120</b> construction with an edge/side drive <b>130</b> of belting <b>140</b>. In operation, the spiral conveyor <b>100</b> is supported by legs <b>110</b> resting on an operating space, such as a floor, for example. The legs <b>110</b> support the frame <b>120</b> in a rigid manner. The legs may be made from stainless steel, for example. The frame may be made from stainless steel, for example. The frame provide the structure through which the side drive <b>130</b> operates. As illustrated, the side drive <b>130</b> may run vertically along the length of the conveyor <b>100</b>. The side drive may access the belting <b>140</b> at a circumferential point by providing contact at each circumferential point on the conveyor <b>100</b>. Alternative configurations, such as every other point and the like also may be used. The side drives may be placed as tension in belting <b>140</b> demands. This may include every layer, every other layer, and on long running conveyors anywhere, or multiple places, along the length of the conveyor. As would be understood in the art, the belt <b>140</b> provides the surface for the conveyor <b>100</b> to convey items or products.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the primary frame <b>210</b> and plastic wearstrip (carryway) <b>220</b> of the spiral conveyor <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. This sanitary/hygienic design has an extremely open style of frame construction that allows for superior access for washdown cycles. The primary frame <b>210</b> is illustrated. The primary frame <b>210</b> is distinct from other spiral conveyors presently in the market. These other spiral conveyors typically have a drum or cage on the inside of the spiral. Further, the other spiral conveyors fail to have an open cantilevered design. The keys to this open design are two things which include a frame <b>210</b> that carries belting <b>140</b> of a cantilever style with center vertical supports <b>230</b> and an edge driven belt <b>140</b> to eliminate the center drum/cage of other designs.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the vertical frame member <b>310</b> that holds the carryway <b>220</b> and supports the belting in the spiral conveyor <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The vertical frame member <b>310</b> is at least a portion of primary frame <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The frame <b>210</b> that carries the modular plastic belting is a cantilever style with a center vertical support <b>230</b> and horizontal belt supporting members that are cantilevered. This allows the cantilever frame <b>210</b> to be supported from one side. This frame <b>210</b> is constructed of stainless-steel plate, laser or waterjet cut to the application. The frame <b>210</b> is welded to other members to form the complete structure <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a representative overall structure <b>400</b> (shown as <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the spiral conveyor <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> absent any plastic or belting. These vertical frame members <b>310</b> are welded to each other by means of center ring supports <b>420</b> that create the overall primary structure <b>400</b>. The fact that the there are no sideframes on the outside of the structure allows good visibility and cleaning access. The fact that the inside is open without a center structure allows for great access and cleanability. The vertical frame members <b>410</b> are equivalent to the vertical frame members <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the edge drive <b>500</b> (illustrated as <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the spiral conveyor <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. An edge/side drive <b>130</b> is used to drive belt <b>140</b> allowing for the elimination of a driven, center drum/cage. By eliminating the center drum/cage the center remains open. With this open design, comes improved access and cleanability. A motor/gearbox combination <b>510</b> turns a vertical shaft <b>530</b> which has multiple plastic sprockets <b>520</b>, identified as <b>520</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>520</b><sub>2</sub>, <b>520</b><sub>3</sub>, . . . , on that common shaft <b>530</b>. The multiple plastic sprockets <b>520</b> allow the belt <b>140</b> to be driven at multiple locations, reducing tension build up as the belt rides up the conveyor.
