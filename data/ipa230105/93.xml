For this purpose, the fish to be processed are transported tail-first and ventral side, i.e. dorsal spokes, downwards in transport direction T along a transport path in a transport plane, thereby passing through the different processing stations. The transport plane is not to be understood as a plane in the strictly mathematical sense. Rather, the transport plane describes the plane region in which the fish are transported by means of the transport apparatus. The upper side/upper surface of the transport apparatus defines a plane E. This plane and planes parallel to it form the plane region. The belly cut is made by means of a circular blade pair with a cut to both sides of the backbone of the fish, starting in the region of the tail towards the belly cavity of the fish, the dorsal spokes being guided between the circular blades. With regard to the cutting depth, the cut is made vertical to the transport direction T and vertical to the transport plane E to just below the backbone. This releases the fish fillets from the dorsal spokes on both sides of the backbone. Due to the fish being continuously transported in transport direction T, the circular blades make a virtually idle cut with the circular blades in the region of the belly cavity. The flank cut is also made, for example, with a circular blade pair. In this case, the circular blades are guided along the flank bones from above such that the fish fillets are released from the flank bones, namely up to just below the backbone. Despite these preliminary cuts, the fish fillets are still connected to each other and to the bone structure, and in particular to the backbone, in the region of the back.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is possible to perform a dorsal cut and a separating cut separately from each other. However, a combined dorsal and separating cut is preferred, for example using a cutting apparatus of the generic type. For this purpose, two circular blades of a cutting blade assembly are set in two planes to each other. In the first plane, the two circular blades are pivoted from a starting position in which they are spaced apart and parallel to each other about pivot axes extending in transport direction T in such a manner that the two circular blades are in a V-shape. In other words, the two circular blades are tilted laterally/transverse to the transport direction T. In this intermediate position, the point P of the smallest distance between the circular blades is located at the lowest blade point.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, to create an &#x201c;aggressive&#x201d; circular blade position, in which the circular blades cut along as close as possible to the backbone, the two circular blades are pivoted in the second plane about a pivot axis which is oriented vertical to the transport plane E in such a manner that the point P of the smallest distance between the circular blades is remote from the lowest blade point of the circular blades. This is referred to as an &#x201c;aggressive&#x201d; blade position, as this enables the circular blades to be adjusted very close to the spine/backbone to achieve the highest yield possible. Ideally, the point P of the smallest distance opposes the transport direction T in such a manner that the fish to be processed dips with its tail end between the circular blades and cutting of the fish to be processed takes place with the smallest possible distance between the circular blades in order to already cut along as closely as possible to the backbone, starting from the tail. In known cutting apparatuses of the type referred to hereinbefore, the two circular blades standing in a V-shape to each other are fixed with regard to the V-position and with regard to the size of the smallest distance between the two circular blades. Basically, the angle a of the V-position and the distance P can be set before the cutting apparatus is put into operation. However, processing of the fish then takes place with the pre-set values. Since the fish to be processed vary in their size and the backbone of a fish also varies in its width and outline as it progresses from the tail towards the head, but setting the circular blades too close carries the inherent risk of cutting into the backbone with the circular blades, the circular blades must be set to the largest fish or the widest point of the backbone with regard to the angle a and in particular with regard to the distance P. This results, however, in a relevant loss of yield, since with the circular blades set for large or medium-sized fish or wide backbones, the circular blades do not come as close as required to the backbone in smaller fish and in a narrower region of the backbone. This leaves valuable meat in the region of the backbone and/or the dorsal bones which is not reached by the circular blades since the distance between the circular blades is too large. Possible abnormalities of the backbones, e.g. protrusions, excrescences, deformations or the like, cannot be compensated at all, with the result that the circular blades, which are fixed with regard to their distance, cut into the backbone. The problem of cutting in is exacerbated by a spring-loaded pre-tensioning of the fixed circular blades, since the circular blades are then virtually &#x201c;pulled&#x201d; into the backbone by the &#x201c;aggressive&#x201d; blade position.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus the object of the invention is to create a simple and reliable cutting apparatus which automatically ensures individual and variable cutting guidance. The object further consists of proposing a method with which final separation of the fish fillets from the backbone is implemented with maximum yield without risk of incisions into the backbone.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This object is achieved by a cutting apparatus of the type referred to hereinbefore in that, for the purpose of altering the distance between the circular blades, the knife heads are mounted in a movable manner on the frame structure and in that the cutting blade assembly is assigned at least one sensing element, which is fixed to one of the movable knife heads, each sensing element being arranged on the knife head downstream of the cutting edges of the circular blades, viewed in transport direction T, said cutting edges being directed counter to the transport direction T, and protrudes beyond the respective cutting edge, viewed in a direction transverse to the transport direction T, towards the central axis of the transport apparatus and thus of the fish to be processed. The knife heads are mounted so as to be movable individually or synchronously towards the central axis of the transport apparatus and therefore of the fish to be processed and away from it/them, i.e. transverse to the transport direction T. The cutting blade assembly or the knife heads of the cutting blade assembly are preferably mounted to be substantially free to oscillate. This means that the knife heads can freely, even if only against the resistance of a spring force or the like, move out of the way of the fish to be processed or parts thereof.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The at least one sensing element creates a mechanical coupling between sensing element and knife head for controlling the knife heads, by means of which the distance between the circular blades and the backbone can be individually controlled. As the circular blades first strike the fish, which are transported tail-first and back pointing upwards, with their cutting edges directed in the opposite direction to transport direction T, fish fillets are cut on the dorsal side and the backbone is at least partially exposed. The sensing element located downstream, in transport direction T, of the circular blades or at least of the cutting edges directed in the opposite direction to the transport direction T, enters this cut and runs along the backbone on the outside. The fact that the sensing element is guided along a hard bone material enables precise sensing and correspondingly also precise control in that, for example, size and/or outline-related changes of the backbone immediately cause the circular blades to move out of the way.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the sensing element is closer to the central axis of the transport apparatus and thus closer to the backbone of the fish than the circular blades, any deviation/change in outline of the backbone, i.e. due to different fish sizes, backbone increasing in size from the tail towards the head and/or abnormalities in the region of the backbone, is detected by the sensing element and transferred directly to the circular blades in that the sensing elements moving out of the way inevitably results in the knife heads and thus the circular blades moving out of the way. As a result, on the one hand, the circular blades are set individually for each fish as close as possible to the backbone in order to generate maximum yield and, on the other hand, the sensing element prevents the circular blades from penetrating into the backbone. In simple terms, each sensing element scans the respective width/outline of the backbone in transport direction T downstream of the circular blades but close to them such that deflections of each sensing element initiated by the backbone lead immediately and directly to deflection of the knife heads with the circular blades. Each sensing element thus prevents the distance between the circular blades from being too small which effectively prevents cutting into the backbone with the resulting consequences of wear, jamming or bone residues in the fish fillet.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A preferred embodiment is characterised in that the two knife heads are configured to be controllable separately from each other, each knife head being assigned its own sensing element, the two sensing elements being located at a distance from each other on opposite sides of the transport path. As mentioned, both knife heads can be controlled with a single sensing element, e.g. via corresponding control and/or synchronisation mimic circuits. However, individual control of each knife head by itself is preferred. Due to the fact that each side of the backbone can be scanned individually by a separate sensing element, it is possible in particular to control only one of the circular blades away from the narrowest path along the backbone, if, for example, there is a deformation on one side of the backbone, while the second circular blade on the opposite side can continue to be guided along the narrowest path as a result of which a further increase in yield is implemented.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Expediently, the distance between the sensing elements transverse to the transport direction T is smaller than the distance between the cutting edges of the circular blades transverse to the transport direction T. In other words, the two opposing sensing elements form a narrower passage channel for the fish to be processed than the two opposing circular blades. This reliably ensures that any change in outline of the backbone which results in a deflection of the sensing element is transferred to the circular blades in a timely manner. The sensing elements detect any obstacle on the backbone along the transport path before the circular blades have reached this obstacle and ensure, via the mechanical coupling with the knife heads, that the circular blades are still steered so far away in good time that a collision of the circular blades with the backbone or parts thereof is ruled out.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously, the two knife heads are each arranged on a free end of a supporting arm, the supporting arms having a common pivot axis S above the transport apparatus, which pivot axis extends in transport direction T and is located on or above the central axis of the transport apparatus and thus of the fish to be processed. On the one hand, the pivot axis S and its orientation ensure that the knife heads substantially swing freely about the pivot axis S. On the other hand, a symmetrical arrangement of the knife heads with respect to the fish to be processed is created, whereby easy and precise control of the knife heads, i.e. direct and precise evasion of the knife heads, initiated by each sensing element, can be implemented.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A preferred development is characterised in that the two knife heads are individually mounted with their supporting arms on the frame structure so as to be pivotable about the pivot axis S, the two supporting arms and thus the knife heads being prestressed with a spring element against an abutment towards the central axis of the transport apparatus and thus of the fish to be processed, in such a manner that the circular blades are spaced apart from each other by a predetermined minimum distance in a starting position. The spring force ensures a defined pressure of the circular blades towards the backbone of the fish. The spring force can be applied, for example, via a pneumatic cylinder. Preferred, however, is a simple spiral spring, for example, which is tensioned between the two supporting arms in such a manner that the spiral spring pulls the two supporting arms towards each other. Optionally, magnetic means can also be used for applying force. On the one hand, the abutment for each supporting arm prevents the two circular blades from colliding with each other and, on the other hand, it defines a predetermined, fixed minimum distance between the two circular blades.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantageously, the abutments for the supporting arms are configured to be adjustable so as to be able to adjust the minimum distance between the circular blades. For example, a simple screw or the like can serve as the abutment. By turning the screw against which the supporting arms or also the knife heads abut, the distance between the knife heads and the circular blades can be increased or decreased in a simple manner. Other actuating elements for pre-setting the distance between the circular blades can also be used.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, each sensing element is configured to be adjustable so as to be able to adjust the distance from the central axis of the transport apparatus and thus of the fish to be processed and their backbone. For this purpose, each sensing element is preferably releasably attached to the knife head. A particularly simple solution provides for sensing elements which are adjustable by loosening a screw, adjusting the distance and tightening the screw. Other actuating elements for pre-setting the distance between the sensing elements and the central axis of the transport apparatus and thus of the fish to be processed and their backbone can also be used.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Advantageously, the distance between the cutting edges of the circular blades, which are directed counter to the transport direction T, on the one hand, and each sensing element in transport direction T, on the other hand, is between 5 and 50 mm, and preferably between 10 and 30 mm. As already explained, viewed in transport direction T, each sensing element is arranged close behind the cutting edges of the circular blades, which are directed counter to the transport direction T, with which the fish to be processed first comes into contact. It is known from empirical investigations that the backbone basically has no abrupt changes in dimensions but rather changes substantially continuously and in particular becomes wider starting from the tail end towards the head end. As each sensing element is arranged immediately downstream of the cutting edges of the circular blades in transport direction T, the evasion/deflection movement of the sensing elements and thus of the knife heads with the circular blades is still sufficient to increase the distance between the circular blades sufficiently far.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An advantageous development is characterised in that each knife head is assigned a deflector element which has a first deflector section which is arranged on the inner side of the circular blades directed towards the central axis M of the transport apparatus and thus of the fish to be processed, and has a second deflector section which extends, in a manner bending away from the first deflector section, away from the central axis M of the transport apparatus and thus of the fish to be processed. The deflector element ensures that the fish fillet cut by the circular blades is not cut again. In other words, the deflector element protects the already cut regions of the fish fillet from renewed contact with the cutting edges of the circular blades.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each sensing element is preferably configured integrally with the deflector element. This ensures a particularly simple construction as multiple functions are achieved with one component. For example, the deflector element can include a finger-like sensing element in extension of the deflector section which extends into the transport path of the fish to be processed. However, other variants in the configuration of the sensing element, e.g. in the form of separate sensing means, can also be used.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A preferred embodiment is characterised in that the knife heads and/or the circular blades are configured, on the one hand, to be pivotable and/or adjustable about axes extending in transport direction T and, on the other hand, to be pivotable and/or adjustable about axes aligned vertical to the transport plane. This ensures, in a particularly simple and precise manner, optimum pre-setting of the circular blades for a yield-optimised cut.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The object is also achieved by a method with the steps referred to hereinbefore in that the circular blades are controlled with respect to their distance from each other by at least one sensing element which is guided in transport direction T downstream of the cutting edges of the circular blades, directed counter to the transport direction T, laterally along the backbone of the fish which is exposed by the cutting.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The advantages arising from this have already been explained in connection with the cutting apparatus, which is why reference will be made to the relevant passages to avoid repetitions. Finally, the sensing elements identify any deviation of the backbone and ensure that the circular blades move out of the way before they reach the deviations identified.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the circular blades, depending on the movement of the sensing elements, are moved individually, transverse to the transport direction T, away from the backbone and towards the backbone by a mechanical coupling between sensing element and the knife heads comprising the circular blades.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the invention, the width of the backbone is scanned by each sensing element in a section of the backbone which has already passed the circular blades.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Particularly preferably, the method is carried out using a cutting apparatus as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The advantages arising from the preceding method steps have already been described in connection with the cutting apparatus, which is why reference will be made to the relevant passages to avoid repetitions.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further expedient and/or advantageous features and developments of the cutting apparatus and the method emerge from the description.

The transport apparatus <b>13</b> is oriented in such a manner that a substantially horizontal transport plane E emerges, although transport planes inclined with respect to the horizontal are also possible. The cutting blade assembly <b>15</b> is preferably arranged above the transport apparatus <b>13</b>. The transport apparatus <b>13</b>, for example, has a transport chain or a transport belt. In the embodiment shown, the transport apparatus <b>13</b> is a spike strip <b>21</b> which is rotatively guided and or driven around deflection and/or drive bodies <b>22</b>. The spike strip <b>21</b>, an endless conveyor belt <b>23</b> with spike-like attachments <b>24</b> as receiving elements <b>14</b> for the fish to be transported, comprises a transport run <b>25</b> and a return run <b>26</b>.

As a result, the sensing elements <b>20</b>, <b>27</b> have a distance A<sub>3</sub>, wherein A<sub>3</sub>&#x3e;A<sub>1</sub>=A. Due to the mechanical coupling of sensing elements <b>20</b>, <b>27</b> and knife head <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, the distance B<sub>3 </sub>of the cutting edges S<sub>K </sub>of the circular blades <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> is greater than B<sub>1</sub>=B<sub>2</sub>. With a uniformly shaped backbone, the knife heads <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> move synchronously.
