In a fluid medium (for example, such as blood), high voltage pulses may result in electrolysis and associated bubble generation. In some cases, depending on pulse amplitude and waveform, the electric field very close to an electrode edge can be high enough to drive localized thermal effects or result in local flash arcing events, which can be undesirable for clinical applications such as cardiac ablation. Accordingly, it can be desirable to ensure that a device is appropriately positioned and deployed relative to target tissue prior to ablation energy delivery.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Described herein are systems, devices, and methods for ablating tissue through irreversible electroporation.

id="p-0025" num="0024">Systems, devices, and methods described herein can be configured to determine the sufficiency of electrode positioning of an ablation device relative to tissue and to control the operation of an ablation device based on such determination. For example, a system as described herein may include a signal generator configured to generate pre-ablation pulses and measurement circuitry configured to measure the current of the pre-ablation pulses. The measured currents may be analyzed to determine an electrode distribution relative to tissue. In some embodiments, it can be beneficial to ensure that the that the current delivered for a given electrode pairing with a high voltage applied across the electrode pair is within a desirable range, or that the current is not excessively large, or that the currents satisfy other constraints for an optimal therapeutic effect. This can help assess device deployment for optimal ablation delivery. Systems, devices, and methods described herein deliver and measure pre-ablation currents before an ablation waveform is delivered in order to ensure appropriate device deployment prior to ablation delivery.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A status signal may be output and used to control delivery of ablation energy to tissue. For example, ablation energy delivery can be inhibited when an electrode distribution does not meet predetermined criteria. A user alert can be output to prompt device redeployment/repositioning prior to ablation energy delivery. Pre-ablation pulses as described herein can be generated and associated current measurements can be performed with a variety of interventional or minimally-invasive devices such as catheters for cardiac ablation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Generally, the systems and devices described herein include one or more devices (e.g., catheters) configured to ablate tissue in a heart (e.g., a left atrial chamber of a heart). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> illustrates a system <b>1300</b> configured to deliver pre-ablation signals and ablation signals, according to embodiments.

The multi-spline catheter <b>400</b> can be deployed in a basket configuration, where a distal portion of the catheter <b>400</b> comprises a plurality of splines that may be deployed over a range of configurations.

In some embodiments, a guidewire lumen <b>421</b> may be configured to extend through the length of the second shaft <b>404</b> so that the catheter device <b>400</b> may be delivered over a guidewire to an anatomical region of interest.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, each of the distal splines <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> has one or more electrodes (not shown) disposed along its length; for example, the number of electrodes can range from 1 to 20 depending on implementation. Each spline is attached at its distal end to distal cap <b>418</b> and at its proximal end to the distal end <b>423</b> of the outer shaft. When the inner shaft <b>404</b> is fully extended, the splines are in an undeployed configuration with the splines running mostly parallel to the inner shaft with only a slight convexity in the middle. As the inner shaft <b>404</b> is pulled in by manipulating a control at the catheter handle, the ends of the spline are brought closer together and the splines bow or curve outward, thereby deploying the basket. In some embodiments, the distal cap at the end of the inner shaft can be pulled back almost to the location of the distal end <b>423</b> of the outer shaft, in which case the splines of the basket fold or curve into petals and the fully deployed basket assumes the shape of a flower, as described in International Application Serial No. PCT/US2018/29938 and incorporated above by reference. The partially or fully deployed splines can be used to engage a portion of a patient anatomy, such as the pulmonary vein ostium of the cardiac left atrium. Once suitably engaged, pulsed field ablation can be delivered. For optimal therapy delivery, the splines of a partially deployed basket configuration of the splines or a fully deployed flower configuration would be fairly uniformly distributed about the long axis of the inner shaft <b>404</b>.

This type of non-uniform spline arrangement can be a consequence of local anatomic constraints such as non-circular pulmonary vein anatomy <b>450</b> or steep take-off angles of pulmonary veins with respect to the left atrium. In this example, when ablation is attempted with a non-uniform spline distribution and the non-uniformity of spline distribution is sufficient to cause one or more pre-ablation current analysis checks to fail, the pulsed field ablation system can output (e.g., display of input/output device <b>1327</b>) a message to the user on a user interface prompting re-positioning of the device without delivering the ablation waveform.

The analog range of current values or current thresholds may be passed through an analog optocoupler, at <b>1218</b>, to ensure isolation of low-voltage circuits (such as the digital-to-analog converter) from any high voltage noise, and then passed to the comparator. The analog signal may be used to set a window range or threshold values in the comparator, at <b>1208</b>. In embodiments where a predetermined range or window of current values, or threshold values may not be not user-adjustable, predetermined or default values may be stored in the microcontroller and the window range in the window comparator may be set in the same manner as described herein.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The apparatus and methods disclosed here can verify device deployment or positioning prior to ablation energy delivery. While specific device embodiments are described herein for exemplary purposes, it should be apparent that other device embodiments can also be implemented as convenient as determined by one skilled in the art and without limitation.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an example method <b>1400</b> of tissue ablation. In some embodiments, a current of a pre-ablation signal as described herein may be measured and used to determine whether a device delivers ablation energy or is repositioned prior to ablation delivery. The method <b>1400</b> includes positioning a device (e.g., device <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>1310</b>, <b>1310</b>&#x2032;) at a target anatomy for ablation energy delivery (e.g., into an endocardial space such as a left or right atrium or left or right ventricle), at <b>1402</b>. A pre-ablation signal may be generated and applied to the device to confirm proper device positioning/deployment at <b>1404</b>. For example, a set of pre-ablation signals may be generated by a signal generator (e.g., signal generator <b>1320</b>). Each pre-ablation signal can be delivered to a subset of electrode channels or electrodes, e.g., according to a predetermined sequence. The pre-ablation currents (e.g., currents passing through a sensing resistor or measurement circuitry as described herein) may be measured for each pre-ablation signal that is delivered to a subset of electrode channels or electrodes, at <b>1406</b>. A determination of whether the device positioning/deployment passes a predetermined set of checks or criteria based on measured pre-ablation currents may be performed, at <b>1408</b>. For example, as described herein, the measured pre-ablation currents can be analyzed to check that each lies within a predetermined range of minimum and maximum values. In embodiments, the check can comprise determining that no pre-ablation current exceeds a predetermined maximum value. In some embodiments, the check can comprise determining that no pre-ablation current is below a predetermined minimum value. In embodiments, the check can comprise computing a metric such as the average value of the pre-ablation currents. In embodiments the check can comprise computing a metric such as the variance of the pre-ablation currents, computing a metric such as the ratio of maximum to minimum pre-ablation currents, or computing a metric based on some other generally non-linear function of the pre-ablation currents. In embodiments, the check can comprise any combination of these computations (e.g., computing a metric or a plurality of metrics based on one or more of these computations), and then determining whether the computed metric(s) lie inside a predetermined range or whether they fall below or exceed appropriate predetermined threshold values. For example, in one embodiment the check can be to determine whether the variance of the measured currents lies within a certain range. As another example, in one embodiment, the check can be to determine whether the ratio of the maximum current to minimum current lies below a threshold value. In some embodiments, this threshold value can be greater than about 1 and less than about 5, greater than about 1 and less than about 10, greater than about 1 and less than about 20, including all sub-values and ranges in-between. If the measured currents do not meet one or more predetermined criteria, the user may be prompted (e.g., alerted) to reposition the device, at <b>1402</b>. If the device is properly positioned, then ablation energy may be delivered to the device, e.g., in the form of an ablation pulse waveform, at <b>1410</b>. The device may be moved to a next target anatomy location and the procedure continued in this manner until ablation therapy is completed, at <b>1412</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The ablation pulse waveforms may include a plurality of levels of a hierarchy to optimize pulsed field ablation energy delivery, e.g., as described in International Application Serial No. PCT/US2019/031135, filed on May 7, 2019, titled &#x201c;SYSTEMS, APPARATUSES AND METHODS FOR DELIVERY OF ABLATIVE ENERGY TO TISSUE,&#x201d; the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
