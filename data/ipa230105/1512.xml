Laser welding is usually used if the intention is to carry out welding at a high welding speed, with a narrow and slender weld seam shape and with low thermal warpage. During laser welding, energy is fed in via a laser beam.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many cases, the workpieces to be welded to one another are coated, for example in order to protect the workpieces against corrosion. In the automotive field, bodywork parts of sheet steel as base material are often coated with zinc, for example.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the event of laser welding coated workpieces, however, defects often arise (for instance pores and spatter) at the weld seam if the material of the coating has such a low evaporation point that it evaporates at the temperature required for welding the base material of the workpieces. Primarily critical is coating material which becomes involved in the welding process at the joint of workpieces positioned overlapping on one another (lying one on top of the other). Suddenly evaporating coating material in the melt pool creates welding spatter and can result in holes or porosity in the weld seam (what is referred to as the &#x201c;melt pool effect&#x201d;). In addition, a coating material gas flow can flow at high pressure from the joint into a vapor capillary of the welding process and press against the back wall of the vapor capillary, and thus distend the vapor capillary of the welding process (what is known as the &#x201c;balloon effect&#x201d;); this can likewise generate spatter and tunnel-like pores.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A measure for reducing defects caused by coatings on workpieces is, during the laser welding, not to position the workpieces one on top of the other but rather to arrange them spaced apart one above the other. However, this requires complex preparation when the workpiece is being positioned, and can create surface defects in the form of indentations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To reduce defects in the weld seam when laser welding two plates positioned one on the other as far as possible without a gap, DE 103 09 157 A1 proposes using a laser beam first of all in a first method step to heat the coated plate facing the laser beam, with the result that the coating of the plates on their facing sides evaporates, with neither of the plates melting. In a second method step, the two plates can be welded in the region in which the coating has been removed. In this context, the same laser beam is used in the first and the second method step, with use being made of a respectively identical power and focusing but a different advancement speed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the case of this procedure, the quality of the weld seam can be improved, but this method is relatively slow. In addition, having the same laser beam travel over the weld seam multiple times at different advancement speeds is expensive and complicated to carry out.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Various methods for laser welding coated workpieces have also been disclosed in JP 2003 094 184 A, JP 2002 178 178 A, JP 2002 219 590 A, JP 2009 050 894 A, WO 2007/060479 A1, WO 03/031 111 A1, JP 2002 160 083 A and JP H04 231 190 A.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">DE 10 2010 003 750 A1 discloses altering the beam profile characteristic of a laser beam by means of a multiclad fiber.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for laser welding two coated workpieces that includes positioning an upper workpiece and a lower workpiece on top of each other and passing a first laser beam over the upper and lower workpieces from a side of the upper workpiece so as to at least partially evaporate the respective coating of each of the workpieces on their facing sides along a depletion trace.

This makes it possible to introduce the heat required to at least partially evaporate the coating at the joint of the overlapping workpieces positioned one on top of the other more quickly than when merely effecting heating without (even just partially) melting the upper workpiece in the course of the first method step. Correspondingly, in the first method step, higher advancement speeds are possible, and the method can be carried out more quickly overall.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">During the first method step, a web of non-melted material of the upper workpiece that consists of the base material of the workpiece remains, and therefore, in the first method step, the melt pool of the laser beam does not come into contact with the coating material at the joint of the two workpieces. This avoids a situation in which evaporating coating material from the joint is introduced in the depth of the melt pool or else into a vapor capillary during the first method step. Correspondingly, spatter formation caused by the coating material does not occur.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the first method step, the coating material from the joint is at least partially, and preferably virtually completely, evaporated over the width of a depletion trace by the heat of the laser beam. The evaporated coating material can in particular escape laterally outward along the joint of the workpieces. In the subsequent second method step, when the laser beam or a vapor capillary of the welding process also penetrates the lower workpiece through the depletion trace, only a little or even virtually almost no coating material from the joint enters the melt pool or the vapor capillary, as a result of which spatter or pores on account of evaporating coating material are effectively avoided. The quality of the final weld seam that can be achieved is correspondingly high.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">During the laser welding method according to the invention, during both the first method step and the second method step the two workpieces are positioned one on top of the other, and are in direct contact with one another in an overlapping region, in particular over their surface area. For this purpose, the two workpieces are typically clamped onto one another or pressed against one another during the first and the second method step, and typically the workpieces lie one on top of the other virtually without a gap. It should be noted that coating material that even in that case has evaporated (is gaseous) at the joint can flow along the joint, and in particular can flow out laterally. In particular, the two workpieces are not kept spaced apart one above the other during the first and the second method step.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">If desired, the laser beam of the first method step (&#x201c;first laser beam&#x201d;) and/or the laser beam of the second method step (&#x201c;second laser beam&#x201d;) may undergo beam shaping, for instance by a multiclad fiber and/or a diffractive optical element, in order to obtain a specific geometric configuration of the laser beam. In particular for the first laser beam, a configuration with an aspect ratio ASP (ratio of the greatest width transversely with respect to the advancement direction to the greatest extent in the advancement direction) of ASP&#x2265;2, or even ASP&#x2265;4, is preferred, it being possible in particular to set approximately a linear shape, rectangular shape or an elliptical shape. In particular for the second laser beam, the application of beam shaping by means of a core focus portion and (at least) one ring focus portion (with a lower power density in the ring focus portion than in the core focus portion) has proven successful.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Typically, both the first method step and the second method step are carried out as deep welding operations (with creation of a vapor capillary). In the first method step, it is in turn possible for heat to be introduced into the joint particularly quickly in this respect. In the second method step, it is possible also for heat to be introduced for melting purposes into the material of the second workpiece particularly quickly. For method steps in deep welding mode, the respective laser beam can advantageously be configured by means of a core focus portion and (at least) one ring focus portion, in order to increase the processing speed. The ring focus portion and core focus portion usually have a circular cross section; however, it is also possible to set up other annular geometries (for instance rectangular-annular geometries), in particular for the first laser beam, if a high aspect ratio is desired.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The laser welding method according to the invention can be performed by passing the two laser beams of the first and second method steps over the workpieces to be welded once.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The two coated workpieces are typically galvanized steel sheets. However, it is also possible to use other material combinations for the workpieces, in particular for which the evaporation temperature of the material of the coating is lower than the melting temperature of the base material of the workpieces. The workpieces typically have a thickness of 0.5-2.5 mm, usually 0.75-1.5 mm. Coatings of the workpieces typically have a thickness of 10 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferred variants of the method according to the invention</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a preferred variant of the method according to the invention, the first method step and the second method step take place at the same time at different locations on the workpieces positioned one on top of the other, the laser beam of the first method step leading the laser beam of the second method step. This makes it possible for the method to be carried out particularly quickly.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A further development of this variant in which the laser beam of the first method step and the laser beam of the second method step have the same advancement speed is advantageous. This can be carried out particularly easily; in that case, laser optical units for the first and the second laser beam can be moved together relative to the workpieces.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A variant, in which the material of the first workpiece that was melted in the first method step is solidified again at least on the workpiece surface if the second method step takes place later at the same location, is preferred. This makes it possible to improve control of the method sequence and to achieve a higher quality of the weld seam. The solidified surface of the melt pool after the first method step ensures continuous calming of fluctuations in the melt pool, before the second method step begins. Correspondingly, the setup of the second method step primarily defines the melt pool dynamics during the second method step.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A variant, in which the material of the first workpiece that was melted in the first method step is completely solidified again if the second method step takes place later at the same location, is likewise preferred. This likewise makes it possible to improve control over the method sequence and to achieve a higher quality of the weld seam. The completely solidified melt pool after the first method step ensures continuous calming of fluctuations in the melt pool, before the second method step begins. Correspondingly, essentially only the setup of the second method step defines the melt pool dynamics during the second method step. Furthermore, it is always the &#x201c;full&#x201d; enthalpy of melting that is expended to create the melt pool in the second method step or to progress it, thereby likewise improving control over the method sequence.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Particularly preferred is a variant in which, in the first method step, the material of the upper workpiece is melted to a great enough extent that, for a maximum melting depth AT of the melted material of the upper workpiece in comparison with the thickness DW of the upper workpiece, the following applies:</p><p id="p-0042" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>60%&#x2264;<i>AT/DW&#x2264;</i>95%,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0043" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>preferably 70%&#x2264;<i>AT/DW&#x2264;</i>90%.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0044" num="0041">These melting depths allow heat to readily access the joint, in order to bring about evaporation of the coating at the joint or on the facing sides of the workpieces in the depletion trace. In the case of conventional workpiece thicknesses, as a safeguard, the remaining height of the web is enough to avoid coating material accessing the melt pool or a vapor capillary in the first method step.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">Particularly preferred is a variant in which, for a maximum width B<b>1</b> of the laser beam in the first method step and a maximum width B<b>2</b> of the laser beam in the second method step, in each case measured transversely with respect to the advancement direction and on the surface of the upper workpiece, the following applies:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>B</i>1&#x2265;2*<i>B</i>2,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0047" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>preferably <i>B</i>1&#x2265;3*<i>B</i>2,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0048" num="0000">particularly preferably B<b>1</b>&#x2265;5*B<b>2</b>. A comparatively wide laser beam of the first method step makes it possible firstly to create a correspondingly wide depletion trace, in particular compared to the width of the later fusion zone of the workpieces. In addition, a large width of the first laser beam and a correspondingly wider distribution of the laser power radiated in reduces the risk of penetration occurring with the melt pool as far as the joint of the workpieces in the first method step, in particular in the event of inhomogeneities in the workpiece or at the joint. At the same time, the creation of a (sufficiently wide) depletion zone is highly reliable, with the result that the introduction of coating material from the joint in the second method step can similarly be reliably prevented.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0043">Also preferred is a variant which provides that, for an average laser power P<b>1</b> of the laser beam in the first method step and an average laser power P<b>2</b> of the laser beam in the second method step, the following applies:</p><p id="p-0050" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i>1&#x2265;1.5*<i>P</i>2,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0051" num="0000">preferably P<b>1</b>&#x2265;3*P<b>2</b>. The comparatively high laser power P<b>1</b> of the first laser beam makes it possible to introduce a lot of energy into the first workpiece or into the joint in a short time, with the result that the coating material in the joint can evaporate in a short time, and correspondingly high advancement speeds in the first method step are possible. It will be noted that the (average) power density of the first laser beam is typically considerably lower than the (average) power density of the second laser beam, typically by a factor of 2 or more, usually by a factor of 4 or more.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0044">In an advantageous variant, for a focal position F<b>1</b> of the laser beam of the first method step and a focal position F<b>2</b> of the laser beam of the second method step, the following applies:</p><p id="p-0053" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F</i>1&#x3c;<i>F</i>2,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0054" num="0000">preferably F<b>1</b>&#x3c;F<b>2</b>&#x2264;0. This has proven successful in practice in order, in the method, to bring about a favorable distribution of the laser power radiated in, and in particular in order to set the formation and depth of the vapor capillaries in the two method steps. A negative focal position indicates that the focus is below the workpiece surface of the upper workpiece (that is to say in the workpiece).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0045">Particularly preferred is a variant in which, for a width BE of the depletion trace on the facing sides of the workpieces after the first method step and a width BNK of the melted material in a joint plane of the facing sides of the two workpieces after the second method step, in each case measured transversely with respect to an advancement direction, the following applies:</p><p id="p-0056" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>BE&#x2265;</i>2*<i>BNK, </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0057" num="0000">preferably BE&#x2265;3*BNK. With these relationships, the introduction of coating material into the melt pool in the second method step can be minimized and this can also be ensured with high reliability in the event of inhomogeneities, and correspondingly it is possible to achieve a very good quality of the weld seam.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0046">Furthermore advantageous is a variant in which the laser beam of the first method step and/or the laser beam of the second method step is a reshaped laser beam and comprises a core focus portion and at least one ring focus portion, the core focus portion and the ring focus portion being coaxial with one another and the ring focus portion surrounding the core focus portion. This beam shaping has proven successful to avoid weld seam defects, both in the first method step but also and primarily in the second method step, in particular in deep welding mode. This beam shaping makes it possible to achieve calming of the melt pool dynamics, which, together with the avoidance according to the invention of the introduction of coating material from the joint into the melt pool ensures especially high quality of the weld seam and the same time allows a quick method sequence (in particular at high advancement speed in the two method steps). This variant is preferably applied for laser beams reshaped with a circular cross section, but can also be applied for non-circular, reshaped laser beams, for example rectangular, reshaped laser beams.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0047">In this respect, particularly preferred is a further development which provides that the reshaped laser beam is created by means of a multiclad fiber, a first part of the raw laser beam being fed into a core fiber of the multiclad fiber and at least one second part of the raw laser beam being fed into a ring fiber of the multiclad fiber at an input end, the ring fiber surrounding the core fiber, and the reshaped laser beam being obtained at an output end of the multiclad fiber. In this way, beam shaping can be comparatively easily carried out using a ring focus portion and a core focus portion, and in addition the division between these two portions (provided it is necessary) can be altered relatively easily or the respective welding task can be adapted by altering the division of the raw laser beam between the first part and the second part.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0048">Particularly preferred is a variant in which the laser beam of the first method step and the laser beam of the second method step are created using different laser sources, and are directed onto the workpieces positioned one on top of the other using different laser optical units,</p><p id="p-0061" num="0049">in particular with the two laser optical units being arranged at a fixed distance in relation to one another. In this variant, it is especially easily possible to independently select or set the laser power and the beam shaping of the first and the second laser beam, and in addition it is easily possible to apply the first and the second laser beam at the same time and independently. Arranging the laser optical units at a fixed distance easily makes it possible also to set up a fixed distance between the processing zones of the two laser beams on the workpieces positioned one on top of the other. In this instance, laser source means a structural unit composed of laser medium, pump and laser resonator.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0050">Furthermore advantageous is a variant in which the workpieces positioned one on top of the other are welded by full penetration welding in the second method step. This makes it possible firstly to achieve a particularly fixed connection between the workpieces, and secondly makes it possible to feed in a filler wire from below, if desired.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0051">A preferred variant of the method according to the invention provides that the workpieces are galvanized steel sheets with a thickness DW, with 0.5 mm&#x2264;DW&#x2264;1.8 mm, preferably 0.7 mm&#x2264;DW&#x2264;1.5 mm,</p><p id="p-0064" num="0000">that an average laser power P<b>1</b> of the laser beam in the first method step is selected with 6 kW&#x2264;P<b>1</b>&#x2264;20 kW, preferably 8 kW&#x2264;P<b>1</b>&#x2264;16 kW, and an average laser power P<b>2</b> of the laser beam in the second method step is selected as 3 kW&#x2264;P<b>2</b>&#x2264;6 kW,<br/>that a maximum width B<b>1</b> of the laser beam of the first method step and a maximum width B<b>2</b> of the laser beam of the second method step on the surface of the upper workpiece, in each case measured transversely with respect to the advancement direction, are selected with 2.5 mm&#x2264;B<b>1</b>&#x2264;5 mm and 0.25 mm&#x2264;B2&#x2264;0.75 mm,<br/>that an advancement speed V<b>1</b> of the laser beam of the first method step and an advancement speed V<b>2</b> of the laser beam of the second method step are selected with V<b>1</b>&#x2265;4 m/min and V<b>2</b>&#x2265;4 m/min, preferably V<b>1</b>&#x2265;6 m/min and V<b>2</b>&#x2265;6 m/min, particularly preferably with V<b>1</b>=V<b>2</b> and 6 m/min&#x2264;V<b>1</b>&#x2264;20 m/min and 6 m/min&#x2264;V<b>2</b>&#x2264;20 m/min,<br/>and that a spatial distance &#x394;X between the laser beams of the first and the second method step is selected with &#x394;X&#x2265;50 mm and/or an interval time TP between the action of the laser beams of the first and the second method step is selected with TP&#x2265;0.50 s. In practice, these parameters have led to welded connections with a high weld seam quality.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0052">The use of a method according to the invention that was described above for welding motor vehicle bodywork components also falls within the scope of the present invention. In other words, the two workpieces (in the course of or after being welded) are installed in the bodywork of a motor vehicle. In motor vehicles, coated metal sheets for which a good weld seam quality is desired, this weld seam quality being readily achievable by the present invention, are frequently used for corrosion protection purposes.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0053">Further advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description and the drawing.
