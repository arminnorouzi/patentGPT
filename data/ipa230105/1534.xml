Techniques are desired for automating this process as well as other paint applications (e.g., primer sanding, clear coat defect removal, clear coat polishing, etc.) amenable to the use of abrasives and/or robotic inspection and repair.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Prior efforts to automate the detection and repair of paint defects include the system described in US Patent Publication No. 2003/0139836, which discloses the use of electronic imaging to detect and repair paint defects on a vehicle body. The system references the vehicle imaging data against vehicle CAD data to develop three-dimensional paint defect coordinates for each paint defect. The paint defect data and paint defect coordinates are used to develop a repair strategy for automated repair using a plurality of automated robots that perform a variety of tasks including sanding and polishing the paint defect.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, like numerals may describe similar components in different views.

In particular, stereo deflectometry has recently been shown to be capable of providing paint and clear coat defects at appropriate resolution with spatial information to allow subsequent automated spot repair.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a robotic paint repair schematic in which embodiments of the present invention are useful. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the respective boxes represent various hardware components of the system including robot controller <b>102</b>, robot manipulator <b>104</b>, and robotic paint repair stack <b>106</b> including compliance force control unit <b>108</b>, tooling <b>110</b>, and abrasive articles/compounds <b>112</b>. The flow of data is depicted by the background arrow <b>114</b> which starts with pre-inspection data module <b>116</b> that provides inspection data including identified defects in the substrate and ends with post-inspection defect data module <b>118</b> for processing data generated from the substrate <b>120</b> during the defect repair process.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Substrate <b>120</b> may be the car body itself, and the finish can be any state of the car throughout the entire manufacturing process. Typically, the car or panels of interest have been painted, clear-coated, and have seen some form of curing (e.g., baking) and are checked for defects. In operation, the defect locations and characteristics are fed from the pre-inspection data module <b>116</b> to the robot controller <b>102</b> that controls robot manipulator <b>104</b> on which a program guides an end effector (stack) <b>106</b> to the identified defect to execute some pre-determined repair program (deterministic) policy. In some rare cases, the policy might be able to adapt depending on the provided defect characteristics.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For paint repair applications, the robotic paint repair stack <b>106</b> comprises abrasive tooling <b>110</b> and abrasive articles and compounds <b>112</b> along with any ancillary equipment such as (compliant) force control unit <b>108</b>. As used herein, the robotic paint repair stack <b>106</b> is more or less synonymous with the term end effector; however, in this document the term &#x201c;stack&#x201d; is the end effector in the context of robotic paint repair. Also, though described for providing robotic paint repair, which includes repair of primer, paint, and clear coats, it will be appreciated that the techniques described herein lend themselves to other industrial applications beyond paint repair.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view of the components of a robotic paint repair stack.

The pre-inspection data can include global, body-centric coordinates of each identified defect along with (optional) geometric data/profiles and/or classification of the defect itself. Global coordinates of the identified defects are communicated to the robot controller module at <b>304</b> along with any external axes such as conveyor belt position such that the robot manipulator can bring the end effector into close proximity to the identified defects in succession. If the optional local defect information and/or classification was provided, this can be used to select defects to process or skip.

Returned sanding actions (step one of two-part repair) from the learned policy are then executed at <b>310</b> by the ancillary controller through simultaneous communication with the robot controller module and end effector stack. Actions in this example include set points for tool RPM, pressure (control input into compliant force flange), robot trajectory, and total processing time. In on embodiment, the robot trajectory is communicated as time-varying positional offsets from the defects origin.

The backing substrate can be any of fabric, open-weave cloth, knitted fabric, porous cloth, loop materials, unsealed fabrics, open or closed cell foams, a nonwoven fabric, a spun fiber, a film, a perforated film or any other suitable backing material. A fabric backing may include cloth (e.g., cloth made from fibers or yarns comprising polyester, nylon, silk, cotton, and/or rayon, which may be woven, knit or stitch bonded) or scrim. The abrasive grains may include shaped abrasive grains, crushed abrasive grains, or platey shaped abrasive grains. The size of the abrasive grains may be selected based on the aggressiveness of the repair operation to be completed.

However, other configurations are expressly contemplated. For example, abrasive disc <b>430</b> may have one or more protrusions or tabs that extend beyond an edge of backup pad <b>420</b>. In another embodiment, abrasive discs <b>430</b> are not circular in shape and include at least one corner that extends beyond an edge of back-up pad <b>420</b>.

Abrasive discs can be used in conjunction with fluid, such as water or polish, when abrading a workpiece. After an abrasive disc is removed, at least some of the fluid may remain on backup pad <b>520</b>. A cleaning cycle may improve adhesion of a newly applied abrasive disc. Nozzle <b>550</b> provides fluid flow from a fluid source <b>555</b> onto backup pad <b>520</b>. Fluid flow, in one embodiment, is air flow from a source of pressurized air. The air flow is strong enough to remove residual water droplets. In one embodiment, the air flow is between 10 and 120 psi, or between 20 and 100 psi. In another embodiment, fluid flow includes water intended to dislodge particulates.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">While nozzle <b>550</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as being used on backup pad <b>520</b>, it is also contemplated that nozzle <b>550</b> could also be used to remove particulates or water droplets from an abrasive disc attached to backup pad <b>520</b>.

The abrasive disc is transferred from its backing by a separation force. The separation force may include peeling the backing at a rate or angle that forces the abrasive disc to separate. This can be accomplished using a breaker bar, for example. The breaker bar should have a small enough radius such that at least an initial peel of the disc away from the liner is achieved. The separation force can also be a suction force, provided by a suction module <b>712</b>, which pulls a vacuum against the backing. Alternatively, suction module <b>712</b> is intended to maintain a position of a disc with respect to a catch plate, and does not substantially contribute to removal of the disc from the liner.

Generally, abrasive material is coated onto a backing such that abrasive particles are embedded within a make coat and then coated with an additional optional size and/or supersize coating. The entire backing <b>800</b> is usually coated evenly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>800</b></figref>.

The cutting is often accomplished with a laser that outlines the desired abrasive disc shapes <b>810</b>. Abrasive disc shapes <b>810</b> are usually aligned in order to minimize waste, as the abrasive material outside of the abrasive shapes <b>810</b> is removed and discarded. Industry standard for manual abrasive applications is a dual-roll <b>830</b> of abrasive discs. Dual roll <b>830</b> has a reduced amount of waste, per disc produced, as compared a single-roll <b>840</b>.
