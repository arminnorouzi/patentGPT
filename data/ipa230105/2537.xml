It is an important direction for the development of the polyurethane industry and can be widely used in the fields such as coating materials, adhesives, fabric coatings and fabric finishing agents, leather finishes and paper surface treatments.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aqueous polyurethane dispersions are often used to coat textile carriers and synthetic leather since they have good low-temperature flexibility and elasticity. Of particular importance in this case is that the dispersion has a quite low tendency to hydrolyze and a relatively good mechanical strength. In the application field of synthetic leather, especially microfiber synthetic leather, it is required that the film formed by the dispersion has good tolerance in an acid-base environment. Although aqueous polyurethane dispersions have a wide range of adjustable properties, it is not always possible to obtain products with desirable performance characteristics. A disadvantage of the film formed by the existing aqueous polyurethane dispersion is that it cannot simultaneously satisfy good mechanical properties and acid and alkali resistance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">WO 07022885 discloses an elastomeric polyurethane dispersion composed of polyester polyols and having a high proportion of ethylene glycol and/or diethylene glycol. However, the product has a low hydrolysis resistance due to the instability of its ester bond, and thus the film formed by the dispersion is inferior in acid and alkali resistance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">DE 10122444 discloses an aqueous polyurethane dispersion based on polycarbonate and polytetramethylene glycol based polymer polyols, which exhibits high elasticity. However, the film formed by the dispersion has a low modulus and poor mechanical properties.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">WO 06075144 discloses a polyurethane solution composed of diisocyanate(s), polytetramethylene glycol polyether polyol(s) and polyimine(s), which forms a film exhibiting high elasticity. However, the product is a solvent based polyurethane and is not an environmentally friendly product.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO 2010142393 describes an aqueous polyurethane dispersion composed of diisocyanates and polytetramethylene glycol polyether polyols, which forms a film exhibiting good elasticity and resilience, but unsatisfactory acid and alkali resistance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">EP 2356163 discloses an aqueous polyurethane dispersion based on polyester polyol(s) and modified by carboxylic groups, which can be crosslinked with carbodiimide and exhibit good adhesion properties, but worse hydrolysis resistance and unsatisfactory acid and alkali resistance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">EP 3502156 A1 discloses an adhesive comprising an amorphous aqueous polyurethane dispersion and a carbodiimide crosslinkable therewith, wherein the aqueous polyurethane dispersion is obtained by reacting the components including an aliphatic polyisocyanate, a polyether polyol, an amino-functional chain extender and a hydrophilic agent, and the polyurethane of the aqueous polyurethane dispersion has carboxyl groups or carboxylate groups.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the industry, especially the textile industry, such as in the field of microfiber synthetic leather, requires an aqueous polyurethane dispersion which forms a film having good mechanical properties and acid and alkali resistance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term &#x201c;curing&#x201d;
