As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, three-dimensional design data <b>61</b> is displayed on the terminal display unit <b>51</b>. Further, on the terminal display unit <b>51</b>, various information such as a cross-sectional view <b>62</b>, and an advancing direction switching button <b>63</b> (<b>63</b><i>a</i>, <b>63</b><i>b</i>) indicating the selected advancing direction of observation are displayed. Reference sign <b>64</b> denotes a current position mark of the target.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077">Next, in Step S<b>02</b>, by pressing the advancing direction switching button <b>63</b> from the terminal display unit <b>51</b> and the terminal operation unit <b>52</b>, the worker switches a cross-sectional direction <b>63</b><i>a </i>and a route direction <b>63</b><i>b</i>, and inputs the advancing direction. Thereby, the terminal control unit <b>55</b> sets the selected advancing direction.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">When the cross-sectional direction is selected, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, measurement advances in order from a point nearest from a start point (for example, the point P<b>1</b><sub>CL </sub>on the section No. <b>1</b>) serving as a first measurement point set in the next Step S<b>03</b> in the cross-sectional direction, and when all points on the section are measured, moves to the nearest section (No. <b>2</b>), and this is repeated.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0079">On the other hand, when the route direction is selected, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, measurement advances over the sections from a start point (for example, the point P<b>1</b><sub>1 </sub>on the section No. <b>1</b>) set in the next Step S<b>03</b>, and moves to the nearest constituent point (point P<b>2</b><sub>1 </sub>in this case). Measurement then advances in order from the nearest point in the route direction, and when all constituent points on the same line are measured, moves to the nearest point in the cross-sectional direction on the same section, and further advances in a direction opposite to the route direction.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">The worker is able to judge and select a direction with which a work is efficiently performed from a landform and conditions of the site. It is assumed that the cross-sectional direction is set in this case.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">Next, in Step S<b>03</b>, by selecting an arbitrary point from the terminal display unit <b>51</b> and the terminal operation unit <b>52</b>, the worker designates the start point (for example, P<b>1</b><sub>CL</sub>, the same applies hereinafter) as the first measurement point. In accordance with this, the terminal control unit <b>55</b> sets the start point, and displays a next measurement point mark <b>65</b> on the terminal display unit <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082">Next, in Step S<b>04</b>, the mobile terminal <b>50</b> makes the surveying instrument <b>10</b> acquire position coordinates of the worker. It is possible to regard position coordinates of the target <b>40</b> as the position coordinates of the worker.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a detailed flowchart of Step S<b>04</b>. When acquisition of the position coordinates is started, in Step S<b>41</b>, the terminal control unit <b>55</b> sends a command to measure the target <b>40</b> to the surveying instrument <b>10</b>. When receiving the command in Step S<b>42</b>, the surveying instrument <b>10</b> measures (measures the distance and the angle of) the target <b>40</b> which is being tracked in response to the command in Step S<b>43</b>. Next, the surveying instrument <b>10</b> sends measurement data to the mobile terminal <b>50</b> in Step S<b>44</b>, and the mobile terminal <b>50</b> receives the measurement data and stores it in the terminal storage unit <b>53</b> in Step S<b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">Next, in Step S<b>46</b>, the terminal control unit <b>55</b> calculates and acquires the position coordinates of the target <b>40</b> from the measurement data. Alternatively, the terminal control unit <b>55</b> makes the control arithmetic unit <b>23</b> of the surveying instrument <b>10</b> calculate the position coordinates of the target <b>40</b> from the distance measurement and angle measurement data and send it to the mobile terminal <b>50</b> as the measurement data. The mobile terminal <b>50</b> receives the measurement data and acquires the position coordinates of the target <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0085">In the system <b>100</b>, when the mobile terminal <b>50</b> acquires the position coordinates of the target <b>40</b>, the terminal display unit <b>51</b> updates the current position mark <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0086">Next, in Step S<b>05</b>, the mobile terminal <b>50</b> guides the worker to the start point (next measurement point) set in Step S<b>03</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0087">Guidance of the worker is performed by displaying a compass display <b>66</b> for guidance illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> on the terminal display unit <b>51</b>. Specifically, when guidance is started, the mobile terminal <b>50</b> always repeats the action of Step S<b>04</b>, which makes the surveying instrument <b>10</b> measure the distance and the angle to the target and monitor the position coordinates of the target.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0088">Next, the terminal control unit <b>55</b> calculates a distance D between the start point (next measurement point) and a current position of the target <b>40</b> and a direction of the start point from the target <b>40</b> for each set of the acquired position coordinates. In a case where the distance D is not less than a predetermined upper limit value (for example, 3 m), the terminal control unit <b>55</b> displays a first compass display <b>66</b> on the terminal display unit <b>51</b>. The first compass display <b>66</b> indicates a direction toward the start point in a red circle depicting a compass, for example. Thereby, while holding the target <b>40</b>, the worker can come close to the set start point only by moving following the first compass display <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0089">Then, in a case where the distance D is not less than a predetermined lower limit value (for example, 0.5 m) and less than the predetermined upper limit value (for example, 3 m), a second compass display <b>66</b> is displayed on the terminal display unit <b>51</b>. The second compass display <b>66</b> indicates an arrow indicating a direction toward the start point and a distance value for each direction in a red circle depicting a compass, for example. Thereby, the worker can precisely come close to the start point without overshooting in a state of clearly bearing a sense of distance.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0090">Then, when the distance D is less than the predetermined lower limit value (for example, 0.5 m), the terminal control unit <b>55</b> displays a third compass display <b>66</b> on the terminal display unit <b>51</b>. The third compass display <b>66</b> is, for example, a green double circle indicating an OK-state where guidance is completed. The worker moves from a current position to the next measurement point (start point) while holding the target <b>40</b>, and installs the target <b>40</b> at the start point.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> illustrates the compass display <b>66</b> displayed together with the three-dimensional design data <b>61</b> on the terminal display unit <b>51</b>. In this way, the current position mark <b>64</b>, the next measurement point mark <b>65</b>, and the compass display <b>66</b> are displayed overlapping the three-dimensional design data <b>61</b> indicating the site. Thereby, the worker can intuitively understand the current position, a guidance destination, and a direction to move, and smoothly move to the next measurement point. The three-dimensional design data <b>61</b> and the compass display <b>66</b> are displayed according to an orientation of the mobile terminal <b>50</b> based on a detection result of an electronic compass (not illustrated) incorporated in the mobile terminal <b>50</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0092">When guidance is completed, in step S<b>06</b>, in the same manner as in Step S<b>04</b>, the terminal control unit <b>55</b> makes the surveying instrument <b>10</b> measure the distance and the angle to the target <b>40</b> installed at the measurement point P<b>1</b><sub>1 </sub>as the current position of the worker at the next measurement point P<b>1</b><sub>CL</sub>, and acquires the position coordinates of the target <b>40</b> (that is, the position coordinates of the worker at the measurement point Plc). The acquired position coordinates are stored in the terminal storage unit <b>53</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0093">Then, the terminal control unit <b>55</b> changes a point display of the measurement point of the three-dimensional design data, for example, from an open circle to a colored circle (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>B, <b>6</b>C</figref>). Thereby, the worker can grasp the status of progress of observation in one glance.
