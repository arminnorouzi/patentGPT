The rotating mechanism <b>60</b> may be installed in the middle of the inner cover <b>2</b>, and the longitudinally installed hub motors <b>4</b> are fixed to the left and right edges. In the embodiment, the first inner cover <b>21</b> and the second inner cover <b>22</b> are interconnected to form an entirety. However, the invention is not limited thereto. In other embodiments, the first inner cover <b>21</b> and the second inner cover <b>22</b> may be mutually separated and independent components. Similarly, the first inner cover <b>21</b> may be a left inner cover, and the second inner cover <b>22</b> may be a right inner cover. When the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> is rotated 180 degrees horizontally, the first inner cover <b>21</b> becomes the right inner cover, and the second inner cover <b>22</b> becomes the left right cover.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the embodiment, the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> further includes two pedals <b>5</b>, and the pedals <b>5</b> are fixed to the top cover <b>1</b> and the inner cover <b>2</b>. To enable the user to stand more stably in the moving process, mutually separated friction strips <b>51</b> are disposed on the upper surface of each pedal <b>5</b> of the self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> in the embodiment to increase the friction force.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">To fix the pedals <b>5</b> and reduce the volume of the self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b>, the first top cover <b>11</b> and the second top cover <b>12</b> have hollow spaces <b>16</b>, respectively, the first inner cover <b>21</b> and the second inner cover <b>22</b> have recesses <b>23</b> at positions corresponding to the hollow spaces <b>16</b>, respectively, and the hollow spaces <b>16</b> and the recesses <b>23</b> are mutually combined to form pedal cavities (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) for containing the pedals <b>5</b>. In actual application, the hollow spaces <b>16</b> are penetrated in the top cover <b>1</b>, the recesses <b>23</b> are not penetrated in the inner cover <b>2</b>, and the shapes of the hollow spaces <b>16</b> and the recesses <b>23</b> are matched with the shapes of the pedals <b>5</b>. The pedal cavities are containing spaces having bottom surfaces and side walls formed after the combination of the hollow spaces <b>16</b> with the recesses <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When in use, the pedals <b>5</b> directly carry the user. The inner cover <b>2</b> is used as the internal framework of the entire self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> to indirectly bear the weight of the user transferred by the pedals <b>5</b>, thereby preventing electronic elements between the inner cover <b>2</b> and the bottom cover <b>3</b> from being extruded by the weight of the user. Therefore, the entire electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> is firmer and stronger, and the electronic elements therein are protected, such that the self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> operates more stably and has longer service life. Preferably, the inner cover <b>2</b> is made of aluminum alloy. Thus, the strength is higher, and the structure is more stable. The top cover <b>1</b> and the bottom cover <b>3</b> are made of plastic, so that the weight of the entire vehicle body is reduced, the processes, such as spray coating, coloring and so on, are conveniently carried out on the appearance of the vehicle body, and antifouling and waterproof functions are achieved. Since the conventional electric self-balancing vehicle does not include the inner cover <b>2</b>, the internal electronic elements directly bear the weight of the user, and due to the shaking generated during the driving process of the conventional self-balancing vehicle, an automatic power off situation is easy to occur, and the user is easy to fall down during driving. The electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> in the present invention has solved this technical problem.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The rotating mechanism <b>60</b> is fixed between the first inner cover <b>21</b> and the second inner cover <b>22</b>. In the first embodiment, the rotating mechanism <b>60</b> includes two bearings <b>61</b>, a shaft sleeve <b>62</b>, and two snap springs <b>63</b>. The two bearings <b>61</b> are fixed to the inner ends of the first inner cover <b>21</b> and the second inner cover <b>22</b>, respectively. The shaft sleeve <b>62</b> is fixed inside the two bearings <b>61</b> and is fixed to the inner cover <b>2</b> via the two snap springs <b>63</b>. Thus, the left and right inner covers of the inner cover <b>2</b> can rotate under the cooperation of the rotating mechanism <b>60</b>. Due to the arrangement of the rotating mechanism <b>60</b>, the two parts of the vehicle body of the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> can rotate freely and relatively.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To install the rotating mechanism <b>60</b>, a cylindrical barrel <b>24</b> may be designed at the inward ends of the first inner cover <b>21</b> and the second inner cover <b>22</b>, and the bearings <b>61</b> and the shaft sleeve <b>62</b> are installed in the barrel <b>24</b> via the snap springs <b>63</b> from outside to inside. In order to limit an overlarge relative rotation angle between the first inner cover <b>21</b> and the second inner cover <b>22</b>, the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> further includes a limiting shaft <b>7</b>, and the length of the limiting shaft <b>7</b> in the second inner cover <b>22</b> is larger than the length of the limiting shaft <b>7</b> in the first inner cover <b>21</b>. In the embodiment, the limiting shaft <b>7</b> is located between the inward ends of the first inner cover <b>21</b> and the second inner cover <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The two wheels <b>50</b> are rotatably fixed at two sides of the inner cover <b>2</b>, respectively, and the two hub motors <b>4</b> are fixed in the two wheels <b>50</b>, respectively. The hub motor <b>4</b> is also called in-wheel motor, wherein power, transmission, and braking devices are incorporated into a hub, so that a large quantity of transmission components can be omitted, the structure of the self-balancing vehicle can be simpler, a better space utilization rate can be obtained, and the transmission efficiency can be improved at the same time. Since the hub motor <b>4</b> have the characteristic of independently driving a single wheel, differential steering similar to a crawler-type vehicle can be achieved by different rotating speeds and even by inversion of the left and right wheels <b>50</b>, so that the turning radius of the vehicle can be greatly reduced, and in-situ steering can be nearly achieved under a particular condition.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The plurality of sensors <b>80</b> are disposed between the bottom cover <b>3</b> and the inner cover <b>2</b>. In detail, a half of the sensors <b>80</b> are disposed between the first bottom cover <b>31</b> and the first inner cover <b>21</b>, and the other half of the sensors <b>80</b> are disposed between the second bottom cover <b>32</b> and the second inner cover <b>22</b>. The power supply <b>81</b> is fixed between the first bottom cover <b>31</b> and the first inner cover <b>21</b>. The controller <b>82</b> is fixed between the second bottom cover <b>32</b> and the second inner cover <b>22</b>. In the present invention, only one power supply <b>81</b> and one controller <b>82</b> arc required to simultaneously control the two hub motors <b>4</b>, so that the assembling is easier, the wiring is more convenient, and the repairing of the sold electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> returned to the factory is more convenient. Moreover, the power supply <b>81</b> and the controller <b>82</b> are disposed in two half parts of the vehicle body, respectively. Thus, more space is saved, and the structure of the entire vehicle body is more compact. An electric wire connecting the power supply <b>81</b> and the controller <b>82</b> and the electric wires connecting the controller <b>82</b> and the hub motors <b>4</b> can penetrate through the joint of the two half parts of the vehicle body, that is the electric wires penetrate from the left half part (or the right half part) of the vehicle body to the right half part (or the left half part).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the embodiment, the sensors <b>80</b> include a gyroscope <b>83</b>, an inductive switch <b>84</b>, and an acceleration sensor <b>85</b>. In actual application, to modularize the internal elements of the entire device, the acceleration sensor <b>85</b> and the gyroscope <b>83</b> are disposed on the same circuit board. Due to a visual angle, only the front surface of the circuit board can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and the acceleration sensor <b>85</b> and the gyroscope <b>83</b> (indicated by dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) are disposed on the back surface of the circuit board in actual application. The controller <b>82</b> is electrically connected with the plurality of sensors <b>80</b>, the power supply <b>81</b>, and the hub motors <b>4</b>, and the controller <b>82</b> controls the hub motors <b>4</b> to drive the corresponding wheels <b>50</b> to rotate according to sensing signals transmitted by the sensors <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The inductive switch <b>84</b> senses whether the user stands on the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> so as to be on or off, the controller <b>82</b> receives the sensing signal (i.e., the on or off signal) of the inductive switch <b>84</b> to control the hub motors <b>4</b> to work or to stop, and the controller <b>82</b> receives the sensing signals of the acceleration sensor <b>85</b> and the gyroscope <b>83</b> to control the hub motors <b>4</b> to change the state or to keep the state. In the first embodiment, the inductive switch <b>84</b> is an infrared photoelectric sensor. However, the invention is not limited thereto. In other embodiments, the inductive switch <b>84</b> may be a microwave inductive switch, an ultrasonic inductive switch, or any other inductive switches capable of achieving the same function. In the embodiment, the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> further includes a blocking element <b>86</b>. When the user stamps on the pedals <b>5</b>, the blocking element <b>86</b> will block an infrared induction area of the infrared photoelectric sensor, and thus the infrared photoelectric sensor is started. The controller <b>82</b> receives a starting signal sent by the inductive switch <b>84</b>, thereby driving the hub motors <b>4</b> to work.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The wheels of the self-balancing vehicle in the prior art start rotating automatically once the self-balancing vehicle is enabled, so that the user cannot easily stand on the self-balancing vehicle. When the user gets off from the self-balancing vehicle, the wheels do not stop rotating, and the entire wheels stop rotating only after the power switch is turned off. Thus, a very huge potential risk exists, and the using is very inconvenient. When the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> in the embodiment is enabled, the hub motors <b>4</b> do not work, while the wheels <b>50</b> are driven by sensing whether the user stands on the pedals <b>5</b>, thereby avoiding the blind rotating situation of the self-balancing vehicle in the prior art and greatly improving the using safety. On the other hand, the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> in the embodiment achieves automatic balance after sensing the stamping instead of balancing once the power supply is turned on, so that the safety of the vehicle body can be guaranteed, the rotation of the vehicle body is little to avoid the problem in the prior art that automatic balance is achieved once the power supply is turned on to cause a wrong balance point of the vehicle body and the vehicle body rotates to result in unbalance of the user.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The acceleration sensor <b>85</b> and the gyroscope <b>83</b> detect the motion state of the self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> together, for example, the acceleration, the angular speed and the like of the self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b>. The controller <b>82</b> drives the hub motors <b>4</b> according to the sensing signals transmitted by the acceleration sensor <b>85</b> and the gyroscope <b>83</b>, thereby determining to change the direction or the speed of the self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> or not. The detection technology of the acceleration sensor <b>85</b> and the gyroscope <b>83</b> is conventional and will not be described herein for a concise purpose.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the embodiment, the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> further includes a U-shaped fixing element <b>9</b>. The sensors <b>80</b> and the blocking element <b>86</b> are fixed to the U-shaped fixing element <b>9</b>, in order to achieve modularized installation of the electronic elements of the entire device to facilitate the assembly, wiring and the subsequent maintenance.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In practice, the user drives a part or two parts of the vehicle body to twist by forces of the feet, in order to drive the sensors <b>80</b> to send the sensing signals to the controller <b>82</b>. The controller <b>82</b> drives the hub motors <b>4</b> to operate according to an internal control program, to enable the user to turn, advance or retreat, so that &#x201c;foot control&#x201d; is achieved, the use is more convenient, and the control is more flexible.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">How the controller <b>82</b> in the present invention controls the self-balancing vehicle to achieve a self-balancing state and controls the wheels <b>50</b> to advance, retreat or turn belongs to the prior art, and will not be described herein for a concise purpose. Specific reference can refer to currently disclosed self-balancing vehicle control methods and control technologies adopted by self-balancing vehicle production enterprises. For example, the Chinese patent application No. 201320050547.3, entitled BALANCE CONTROL DEVICE FOR INTELLIGENT BALANCING VEHICLE AND INTELLIGENT BALANCING VEHICLE, wherein the control device may be the controller <b>82</b> in the embodiment. Or, for example, the Chinese patent application No. 201220367045.9, entitled CIRCUIT CONTROL DEVICE FOR CONTROLLING BALANCING VEHICLE MOTOR BY USING CPLD. Certainly, in actual application, other control devices and control methods can also be selected, for example, the control method described in the Chinese patent application No. 201310516158.X, entitled CONTROL METHOD FOR TWO-WHEELED SELF-BALANCING VEHICLE.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the embodiment, the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> further includes a charging interface <b>87</b>, and the charging interface <b>87</b> is disposed at the bottom cover <b>3</b>. Specifically, the charging interface <b>87</b> is disposed at the outer side of the bottom cover <b>3</b> for charging the power supply <b>81</b> conveniently.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the embodiment, the controller <b>82</b> has a storage unit <b>821</b> and a correction unit <b>822</b>, the storage unit <b>821</b> stores an initial balance state of the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b>, and the correction unit <b>822</b> corrects a current balance state of the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b>. Specifically, after the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> is delivered out of the factory, the data when the vehicle body is placed horizontally is recorded in the storage unit <b>821</b>. After the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> is used for a period of time, due to external environments, such as temperature and so on, and using situations such as shaking, the sensors <b>80</b> of the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> may deviate to a certain extent, so that the horizontal reference value of the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> will change correspondingly. At that time, if the horizontal data adopted when leaving the factory is still adopted, the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> is controlled inaccurately. After long term use, accidents may happen. A correction program is stored in the correction unit <b>822</b> in the embodiment. When the correction program is operated, the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> detects the real-time conditions of the sensors <b>80</b> and judges and compares the real-time conditions with the initial horizontal data, so as to determine whether to overwrite the original data for resetting. By setting the correction program, the control accuracy and the service life of the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>100</b> are greatly improved, and the problem in the prior art that the flexibility and the accuracy of the self-balancing vehicle decline after the self-balancing vehicle is used for a period of time is solved.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing an electric self-balancing vehicle according to a second embodiment of the invention.

The electric self-balancing vehicle <b>200</b> further includes an interface cover <b>310</b>, and the interface cover <b>220</b> covers the charging interface. The interface cover <b>220</b> can prevent muddy water splashed by operating the electric self-balancing vehicle <b>200</b> from polluting the charging interface and even entering the vehicle body.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In summary, according to the invention, the inner cover is uniquely disposed between the top cover and the bottom cover of the electric self-balancing vehicle, such that the entire structure of the electric self-balancing vehicle is firmer, and the electronic elements inside the vehicle body are protected at the same time. Further, the space for fixing the electronic elements is formed between the inner cover and the bottom cover, such that the electronic elements are installed more compactly. The power supply and the controller are disposed in two parts of the vehicle body, respectively. Therefore, one power supply and one controller can control the two hub motors simultaneously, the assembly is easier, the wiring is more convenient, and more space is saved. Meanwhile, the weights on both sides of the vehicle body are better balanced thus to improve the self-balance of the vehicle body. According to the present invention, the wheels are located at the left and right edges of the vehicle body. Thus, the wheels with larger sizes can be used. Compared with the existing self-balancing vehicle with wheels installed at the bottom of the bottom cover, the electric self-balancing vehicle has considerable movement distance and speed advantages. Further, the hub motors are adopted in the present invention, and the motors are directly installed in the wheels. Accordingly, the structure of the electric self-balancing vehicle is more compact. Compared with the self-balancing vehicle singly installed with a motor, more space is saved and the entire device is more compact.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, the disclosure is not for limiting the scope of the invention.
