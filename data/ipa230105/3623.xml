For this purpose, it is necessary to quantitatively analyze the precipitate and the like with high accuracy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, to quantitatively analyze the precipitate and the like in the metal material, first, the precipitate and the like are extracted. Thereafter, the extracted precipitate and the like are collected by filtration using a filter and subjected to quantitative analysis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Methods of extracting the precipitate and the like can be roughly classified into an acid dissolution method, a halogen method, and an electrolytic dissolution method.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Among those methods, an electrolytic dissolution method (see JP 2010-151695 A) of extracting the precipitate and the like in the metal material by electrolysis is often used because the precipitate and the like can be stably extracted.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, in recent years, as the metal material becomes more highly functional, controlling a metal structure or improving characteristics such as strength by using an extremely fine precipitate of 100 nm or less and the like has been performed on an industrial scale. In this instance, it is required to quantitatively analyze the extremely fine precipitate and the like, and to observe and grasp the form thereof using, for example, a transmission electron microscope.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the precipitate and the like in the metal material are extracted by electrolysis (electro extraction) and the extracted precipitate and the like are quantitatively analyzed, the resulting quantitative analysis value may greatly deviate from an expected value.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It could therefore be helpful to provide a method of extracting a precipitate and/or an inclusion (precipitate and the like), which method would enable accurate quantitative analysis of the extracted precipitate and the like.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It could also be helpful to provide a method of quantitative analysis of a precipitate and the like using the extracting method, an electrolyte solution used in the extracting method, and a method of preparing a replica sample using the electrolyte solution.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">We thus provide [1] to [15]:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">[1] A method of extracting a precipitate and/or an inclusion, comprising extracting the precipitate and/or the inclusion in a metal material by electrolysis using an electrolyte solution, wherein the electrolyte solution contains an adsorbent that is adsorbed to a surface of the precipitate and/or a surface of the inclusion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">[2] The method of extracting a precipitate and/or an inclusion according to claim <b>1</b>, wherein the adsorbent is adsorbed to a surface of a matrix metal of the metal material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">[3] The method of extracting a precipitate and/or an inclusion according to [1] or [2], wherein the electrolyte solution contains an agent that forms a complex with a matrix metal of the metal material.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">[4] The method of extracting a precipitate and/or an inclusion according to any one of [1] to [3], wherein the adsorbent is a compound having at least one group selected from the group consisting of a thiol group, a sulfide group, and a disulfide group.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">[5] The method of extracting a precipitate and/or an inclusion according to any one of [1] to [4], wherein a content of the adsorbent in the electrolyte solution is 0.1 g/L or more with respect to a base electrolyte solution containing an electrolyte and a solvent.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">[6] The method of extracting a precipitate and/or an inclusion according to any one of [1] to [5], wherein the metal material is a steel material.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">[7] A method of quantitative analysis of a precipitate and/or an inclusion, comprising quantitatively analyzing the precipitate and/or the inclusion extracted by the extracting method according to any one of [1] to [6].</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">[8] An electrolyte solution for extracting a precipitate and/or an inclusion in a metal material by electrolysis, the electrolyte solution comprising an adsorbent that is adsorbed to a surface of the precipitate and/or a surface of the inclusion.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">[9] The electrolyte solution according to [8], wherein the adsorbent is adsorbed to a surface of a matrix metal of the metal material.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">[10] The electrolyte solution according to [8] or [9], further comprising an agent that forms a complex with a matrix metal of the metal material.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">[11] The electrolyte solution according to any one of [8] to [10], wherein the adsorbent is a compound having at least one group selected from the group consisting of a thiol group, a sulfide group, and a disulfide group.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">[12] The electrolyte solution according to any one of [8] to [11], wherein a content of the adsorbent is 0.1 g/L or more with respect to a base electrolyte solution containing an electrolyte and a solvent.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">[13] The electrolyte solution according to any one of [8] to [12], wherein the metal material is a steel material.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">[14] A method of preparing a replica sample comprising: subjecting a surface of a metal material to an electro etching using the electrolyte solution according to any one of [8] to [13];
