During starch processing, starch is hydrolysed to dextrins and further to fermentable sugars like glucose or maltose. Enzymatic aids for those hydrolytic processes are &#x3b1;-amylases (&#x3b1;-1,4-glucan-4-glucanohydrolases, E.C. 3.2.1.1) to degrade high-molecular starch comprising amylose and amylopectin to liquified polysaccharide comprising lower molecular weight dextrins (liquefaction process) and glucoamylase (1,4-&#x3b1;-D-glucan glucohydrolase, E.C. 3.2.1.3) to cleave the &#x3b1;-1,4 glycosidic linkages of those dextrins releasing glucose (saccharification process).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such fermentable sugars are of high relevance for the food sector and can be further processed e.g. by yeast fermentation to bioethanol.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fermentation of starch can be achieved either by performing the saccharification and fermentation in subsequent or separate processes, or by combining the two steps into one single SSF-process standing for Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an economically ideal case, the utilized liquefied polysaccharide substrate should be converted almost completely to the fermentation product with as little loss as possible. However, such losses regularly occur by the unwanted accumulation of non-fermentable sugars and thus give rise to economical and technical problems. Those non-fermentable sugars are oligosaccharides that are not linked via &#x3b1;-1,4-glycosidic linkages and are typically not accessible in the fermentation process.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The origins of these unwanted glycosides are (i) from the polysaccharide source by leftover &#x3b1;-1,6-linkages of amylopectin (&#x3b1;-limit dextrins), (ii) from the amylase enzyme as unwanted side-products after pro-longed liquefaction, (iii) from side-activities of the glucoamylase used in saccharification or (iv) from the metabolisms of the respective fermenting organisms. As a result, non &#x3b1;-1,4-linked glycosides, comprising panose (&#x3b1;-D-Glc-[1&#x2192;6]-&#x3b1;-D-Glc-[1&#x2192;4]-D-Glc), isomaltotriose (&#x3b1;-D-Glc-[1&#x2192;6]-&#x3b1;-D-Glc-[1&#x2192;6]-D-Glc), isomaltose (&#x3b1;-D-Glc-[1&#x2192;6]-&#x3b1;-D-Glc) and/or trehalose (&#x3b1;-D-Glc-[1&#x2192;1]-&#x3b1;-D-Glc), accumulate during the fermentation process. These accumulated non-fermentable sugars can constitute up to 3% of the total glycosides during the fermentation process. Hence there is a pressing need for a process utilizing alpha-1,4-linked glycosides as well as alpha-1,6-linked glycosides during a fermentation or SSF.
