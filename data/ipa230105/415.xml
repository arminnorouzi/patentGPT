More particularly, the present disclosure relates to methods and apparatuses for facilitating the speed and efficiency for placing one or more electrodes against a patient's scalp, optionally in combination with tracking the movements of a patient. The present disclosure further relates to methods and apparatuses for comfortable and extended wear of one or more electrodes against a patient's scalp for a variety of patient settings.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Uniform contact between the metal electrode and the skin may be beneficial for electrodes used in electrocardiography and electroencephalography to prevent electrical noise due to the interface between the electrode and skin surface. To provide for uniform contact with the skin area, a conductive gel may be applied to the skin surface to facilitate electrical conduction with the electrode. However, when electrodes are placed at multiple locations over the patient's scalp, the application of the gel in combination with determining electrode placement may require specialized training and skill but may also be very time consuming.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some electrodes utilize conductive gel interfaces which are pre-formed for contacting the electrode; however, the gel interfaces may become ineffective when hair is present and may sometimes require the removal of the underlying hair.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Specialized electrode assemblies which dispense gel as they are worn and contacted against a patient's scalp have been developed. These electrode assemblies, however, may be uncomfortable for extended wear, such as when the patient is resting upon a pillow or other platform during sleep. Further, gel loss may occur over time with these electrode assemblies and connection quality may dip during extended wear.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there exists a need for methods and devices which facilitate the speed of placing electrodes. There also exists a need for facilitating contact between the electrode and the skin surface even in the presence of hair. It may be preferable to provide methods and devices which simplify or reduce the necessity of preparing the hair and scalp for each electrode contact. It may be desirable if such methods and devices could provide for incorporation of a conductive fluid or gel as part of the electrode assembly as well as for preserving such conductive fluids or gels for extended time periods. It may be desirable if such methods and devices facilitate comfortable extended wear for the patient.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure provides systems, apparatuses, and methods for use of electrode assemblies, which may be wearable by a user or patient. Electrode assemblies provided herein may improve comfort by increasing the overall surface area of the electrode assembly bottom surface, which may make contact with the patient's skin (e.g., scalp) and hair. Collapse, compression, or telescoping of the bottom surface may thereby decrease the direct force and/or pressure applied by the distal member(s) of the electrode assembly bottom surface to the skin. This may be advantageous in patients who have little to no hair in electrode contact areas, patients that are particularly skin-sensitive, and/or patients which must wear the electrode assemblies for an extended time period. The electrode assemblies may include structures to dispense and/or maintain conductive gel placed over the patient's skin, thereby maintaining electrical connection quality. The electrode assemblies described herein may also facilitate the clearing of skin and/or hair prior to establishing an electrical connection with the skin.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Aspects of the present disclosure provide electrode assemblies. An exemplary electrode assembly may comprise an electrode body defining an interior reservoir for storing a tissue conductive fluid or gel and having a bottom opening to dispense the tissue conductive fluid or gel. The electrode body may be at least partially adjustable, collapsible, or compressible in a direction toward the skin.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The electrode body may be at least partially collapsible or compressible in response to an increase in force applied on the electrode body in the direction toward the skin.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The electrode body may comprise a first body member and a second body member operatively coupled to one another. One or more of the first body member or the second body members may be conductive. The first body member and the second body members may be coaxial. The first and second body members may be configured to telescope relative to one another in response to the increase in force. For example, the second body member may be spring-loaded within the first body member. The first body member may be rigid and the second body member may be flexible and resiliently collapsible in response to the increase in force. The second body member may be elastomeric. The first body member may have a cylindrical shape and the second body member may have a conical shape. The bottom opening may be provided on the second body member. The electrode body may have a central axis and the bottom opening may be off-set from the central axis.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The electrode body may be at least partially depressible to dispense the tissue conductive fluid or gel through the bottom opening. The electrode body may comprise a depressible top surface or button.

assembly, which may be wearable by a user. Electrode assemblies of the present disclosure may improve comfort by increasing the overall surface area of the electrode assembly bottom surface which may make contact with the patient's scalp and hair. For instance, as force and/or pressure is applied from the electrode assembly to the skin, the electrode assembly may be configured to increase the surface area of contact. Collapse, compression, or telescoping of the bottom surface may thereby decrease the direct force applied by the distal member or members of the electrode assembly bottom surface. This may be advantageous in patients who have little to no hair in electrode contact areas, patients that are particularly skin-sensitive, and/or patients which must wear the electrode assemblies for an extended time period.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Embodiments of the present disclosure include apparatuses with structures to dispense a conductive fluid or gel to improve contact between an electrode assembly and a patient skin. Embodiments of the present may improve upon existing electrode assemblies by providing a valve which allows for repeated filling of the electrode with conductive gel to counteract gel evaporation or drying. These embodiments may be beneficial for extended wear and continuous signal collection and electrode use.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Embodiments of the present disclosure may facilitate the speed of placing electrodes by integration of the electrodes into a wearable electrode assembly. Additionally or alternatively, embodiments of the present disclosure may facilitate refilling of the conductive liquid or gel in order to improve electrical contact over longer measurement periods, such as when the gel may have dried. Optionally, in any embodiment, electrode assemblies disclosed herein may be combined with systems for tracking the movement of a patient, such as with accelerometers and/or optical tracking.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Embodiments of the present disclosure may comprise embodiments, variations, and examples of the electrode carrier assemblies of commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/387,381 filed Oct. 13, 2017, now issued on Nov. 21, 2017 as U.S. Pat. No. 9,820,670 (Attorney Docket No. 49938-703.201), U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/783,346 filed Oct. 13, 2017 (Attorney Docket No. 49938-703.301), and PCT Application No. PCT/US2017/024505 filed on Mar. 28, 2017 (Attorney Docket No. 49938-703.601), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The electrode carrier system <b>10</b> may generally comprise a backing <b>12</b> shown in the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> which illustrates the carrier system <b>10</b> secured around the head H of patient P. The backing <b>12</b> is shown configured as a headband in this variation although the carrier system <b>10</b> may be incorporated into any number of other platforms or positioning mechanisms for maintaining the electrodes against the patient body. The backing <b>12</b> is shown configured as a headband in this variation and the individual electrode assemblies <b>14</b> are spaced apart from one another so that when the headband is positioned upon the patient's head H, the electrode assemblies <b>14</b> are aligned optimally upon the head H for receiving EEG signals. The electrode carrier system <b>10</b> may have each of the electrodes assemblies <b>14</b> electrically coupled via corresponding conductive wires <b>16</b> extending from the backing <b>12</b> and coupled, e.g., to a controller and/or output device <b>18</b>. Although in other variations, the electrodes assemblies <b>14</b> may be coupled to the controller and/or output device <b>18</b> wirelessly.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The controller and/or output device <b>18</b> may generally comprise any number of devices for receiving the electrical signals such as electrophysiological monitoring devices and may also be used in combination with any number of brain imaging devices, e.g., fMRI, PET, NIRS, etc. In one particular variation, the electrode embodiments described herein may be used in combination with devices such as those which are configured to receive electrical signals from the electrodes and process them.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The electrodes assemblies <b>14</b>, as described herein, may be positioned upon the backing <b>12</b> to quickly enable conductive contact with the underlying skin while allowing for patient comfort such as when the patient P is reclined, as shown, with the back or side of their head H resting upon a surface without discomfort from the electrodes <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">One challenge in ensuring that the individual electrodes <b>14</b> make sufficient contact with the underlying skin is the presence of hair HR on the scalp S of the patient P. The electrode carrier assemblies of the present disclosure as described herein enable rapid reliable electrical contact on individual electrode assemblies through the hair HR and with scalp surface without having to remove the hair.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example where each of the electrodes <b>14</b> may also incorporate visual indicators such as one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs). When sufficient electrical contact is achieved, the LED on a particular electrode <b>14</b> may emit a light of a first color <b>20</b>, e.g., green, but if an electrode <b>14</b> has not achieved sufficient electrical contact, it may emit a light of a second color <b>22</b>, e.g., red. Alternatively, a single color LED may be used where sufficient contact may be indicated by steady illumination of the LED and insufficient contact may be indicated by a blinking LED. In other variations, an electrode may include, e.g., a piezoelectric transducer, eccentrically loaded weight coupled to a motor, etc., to provide for a vibration or other haptic response to indicate whether the electrode <b>14</b> has sufficient electrical contact with the underlying skin. In this manner, the electrodes <b>14</b> may efficiently provide direct indication of electrical contact rather than having to review a separate controller or indicator.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Turning now to the electrode configurations, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional detail side view of one variation of an electrode carrier system <b>35</b> where the electrodes <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>B may be enclosed within a reservoir which is pre-filled with a conductive gel or fluid. Each electrode <b>38</b>A, <b>38</b>B may be configured into a flattened or atraumatic configuration which is contained within a respective reservoir <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B and each reservoir <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B may be formed of any number of flexible materials, e.g., silicone, polyurethane, rubber, etc., which can readily collapse. The electrodes <b>38</b>A, <b>38</b>B may be coupled via conductive wires <b>16</b> passing through a lumen <b>34</b> defined through the backing <b>12</b> separated from the electrodes by a substrate <b>36</b>. Each reservoir <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B may also respectively define one or more openings <b>32</b>A, <b>32</b>B through which the conductive gel or fluid may be expelled.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Once the platform <b>12</b> has been situated over the patient's head H, the user may press upon each of the reservoirs <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B such that the conductive fluid or gel <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B flows through the openings <b>32</b>A, <b>32</b>B and onto the skin of the patient P. The conductive fluid or gel <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B expelled through the openings may maintain fluid communication between the skin surface and the respective electrodes <b>38</b>A, <b>38</b>B such that the detected electrical signals may be transmitted from the skin and to the electrodes <b>38</b>A, <b>38</b>B. Moreover, because of the flexibility of the reservoirs <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, once the conductive fluid or gel <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B has been expelled into contact with the skin surface, the backing <b>12</b> may lie flat against the skin surface so that the patient P may comfortably lay their head upon a surface while still maintaining electrical contact with the electrodes <b>38</b>A, <b>38</b>B.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows a side view of another electrode carrier system <b>35</b> where a pair electrode assemblies <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B may include one or more loops of conductive wire or ribbon <b>51</b>A, <b>51</b>B which are able to readily bend or flex against a skin surface.

This data can be transmitted to the controller and/or output device <b>1818</b> via conductive wires <b>1816</b> for processing to determine the patient's movements as well as motion artifact rejection. If the detected acceleration exceeds a predetermined threshold, this may be an indicator to the controller that these motion artifacts may be excluded from consideration to prevent the inclusion of artifact noise from other detected data.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The electrode carrier system <b>10</b> may be utilized with any combination of electrodes described herein, for example as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref>, and may also be used in any combination with either the optical motion detection or accelerometer monitoring. In other variations, both the optical motion detection and accelerometer monitoring may be utilized in combination together, if so desired.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The present disclosure provides methods for continuously monitoring a subject using the electrode carrier systems and electrode assemblies described herein.
