Mutations in the Ras gene can leave it permanently activated and lead to inappropriate intracellular signaling in the absence of extracellular signals. Because signaling leads to cell growth and division, dysregulated Ras signaling may ultimately lead to tumorigenesis and cancer. The Ras gene encodes the Ras superfamily proteins, which include the KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) protein encoded by the KRAS gene.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">KRAS gene mutations are common in pancreatic, lung, colorectal, gallbladder, thyroid, and bile duct cancers. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKIs are commonly used to treat these cancers. It has been reported that KRAS mutation is a predictor of the tumor's response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKI targeted therapy. The most common KRAS mutations occur at codons 12 and 13 of exon 2. Other rare mutations occur at codons 59 and 61 of exon 3. Studies found that KRAS mutations at codons 12, 13 or 61 cause the Ras protein to remain in its active form for a longer time, leading to overactivation of the EGFR pathway. Therefore, patients with a KRAS mutation at codons 12, 13, or 61 do not respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, it has been shown that a KRAS mutation at codon 12 or 13 is a strong predictor of patients who are in non-response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy such as for the treatment of certain cancerous diseases, including ERBITUX.RTM (cetuximab; ImClone Systems Inc., New York, USA) and VECTIBIX.RTM (panitumumab, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif., USA) for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and lung cancer.

Through these methods, samples of cancer cells, such as tissue samples, circulating tumor cells or biomolecules with characteristics of cancer (eg circulating nucleic acids) are obtained, and whether KRAS mutations are present in the cancer cells is then determined.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0065">Methods of characterizing KRAS mutations, e.g., detection, sequencing, analysis of the KRAS gene or its expression (e.g., DNA, mRNA), include KRAS nucleic acid amplification and/or visualization. To detect the KRAS gene or its expression, nucleic acid can be isolated from a subject by conventional methods in the art, and the isolated nucleic acid can then be amplified (e.g., by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (such as direct PCR, quantitative real-time PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR), ligase chain reaction, self-sustaining sequence replication, transcription amplification systems, Q-Beta replicase, etc.) and visualized (e.g., by labeling nucleic acids during amplification, exposure to intercalating compounds/dyes, probes).
