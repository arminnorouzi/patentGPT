The aim is thereby to ensure safe guiding for the handling operations of the operator at the containment, while nevertheless being able to rapidly detect incorrect activities of the operator and accident events, and to minimize losses resulting therefrom.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Overview of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The arrangement is designed for monitoring a state and movement sequence in an aseptic work chamber of a containment located in an installation room. At least one work glove projects into the work chamber, and the respective work glove can be extended in the work chamber as far as a maximum gripping range in the three xyz spatial axes. According to the invention, the arrangement comprises a tracking system, the recordings of which are used for continuous three-dimensional localization of the at least one work glove and are stored in a computer unit. At least one three-dimensional or two-dimensional prohibited region, which may be adjoined by a warning region, is defined in the work chamber. Individual surface sections or the entire bottom of the containment may be defined as a prohibited region. A prohibited region, optionally preceded by a warning region, may be set up around machines which are installed in the work chamber and which represent a hazard for the operator. The coordinates of the prohibited region and warning region are stored in the computer unit. The prohibited region must not be intervened in with the at least one work glove; and the warning region should not be intervened in.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Particular embodiments of the invention will be defined below: each work glove may respectively hold an object, or two work gloves together may hold an object, so that there is a maximally extended action range in the three xyz spatial axes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The recordings of the tracking system are used for continuous three-dimensional localization both of the at least one work glove and of the at least one object. The prohibited region must also not be intervened in with the object, while the warning region should not be intervened in with the object.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The spatial positions of work gloves and objects within the xyz coordinate system formed by the three spatial axes are recorded with a timestamp in the computer unit; and a real-time comparison with the prohibited regions and optional warning regions established in the computer unit is carried out in the computer unit.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Containers which are filled with substances, are to be filled therewith or are to be emptied, may be temporarily located in the work chamber. The spatial positions of the containers within the xyz coordinate system formed by the three spatial axes are recorded with a timestamp in the computer unit in order, in the event of an accident, to establish an unplanned position of a container, possible breakage of a container with its spreading region and the spreading region of uncontrolledly emerging substance.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advantageously, the operator is equipped with virtual reality glasses, which are intended:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">to display the prohibited regions and optional warning regions defined in the computer unit to them as graphics elements; or also in addition</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">to display to them a surface to be cleaned according to the cleaning and disinfection program saved in the computer unit.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">The tracking system comprises at least a first camera, which has a first acquisition angle, and a second camera, which has a second acquisition angle.
