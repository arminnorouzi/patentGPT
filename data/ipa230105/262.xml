Certain high chairs, however, are provided with an additional seat that can be removably secured to the high chair's child seat in order to convert the high chair for use by children of different ages. In some previously known devices, when the booster seat is detached from the high chair, it is typically coupled to a separate base member and can then be secured to a standard high chair for use as a booster.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, it can be seen that needs exist for an improved convertible high chair that is easier and more convenient for users to convert and that includes a removable booster seat capable of stably supporting itself on a support surface (e.g. a standard chair) without the need to be secured to a separate component (e.g. a separate base member).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is to the provision of a children's high chair meeting these and other needs that the present invention is primarily directed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In example embodiments, the present invention provides a convertible children's high chair providing improved functionality and convenience for parents and other adult caregivers. According to various embodiments, the convertible high chair generally includes a first child seat supported above a floor by a high chair frame, and a second child seat configured to be removably coupled to the first child seat. The second child seat is configured such that, when detached from the high chair's first child seat, it can be used independently as a booster seat. In certain embodiments, the second child seat includes a base surface configured to stably support the second child seat on a separate support surface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present invention relates to a convertible children's high chair including a frame configured to rest on a support surface, a first child seat defining a first seating surface and a second child seat defining a second seating surface. The first child seat is repositionably coupled to the frame and supported above the support surface. The second child seat is configured to be removably attached to the first child seat and includes a base configured to rest on a flat support surface to support the second child seat when the second child seat is decoupled from the first child seat.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, the present invention relates to a convertible high chair including a frame configured to rest on the floor, a first child seat defining a first seating portion and a second child seat defining a second seating portion. The first child seat is coupled to the frame and supported above the floor and the second child seat is configured to be removably coupled to the first child seat. The second child seat includes a base with a downward extending skirt.

present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of example embodiments taken in connection with the accompanying drawing figures, which form a part of this disclosure. It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the specific devices, methods, conditions or parameters described and/or shown herein, and that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments by way of example only and is not intended to be limiting of the claimed invention. Any and all patents and other publications identified in this specification are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Also, as used in the specification including the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include the plural, and reference to a particular numerical value includes at least that particular value, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Ranges may be expressed herein as from &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; one particular value and/or to &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; another particular value.

According to various embodiments, the convertible high chair generally comprises a first child seat supported above a floor by a high chair frame, and a second child seat configured for being removably coupled to the first child seat. The second child seat is configured such that, when detached from the high chair's first child seat, it can be used apart from the high chair as a booster seat (e.g., secured to the seating surface of a standard chair or another support surface) in a different mode of use independent of the frame. In certain embodiments, the convertible high chair is convertible for use by children of varying ages. For example, when the second child seat is coupled to the first child seat, the high chair functions in a first configuration as an infant high chair. In a second configuration, when the second child seat is detached, the high chair functions as a toddler booster seat. In a third configuration, the second child seat can also include a base surface configured to stably support the second child seat on a separate support surface (e.g., without the need to be attached to or mounted to a separate base or support member). In the third configuration, the second child seat functions on its own as an infant or toddler booster seat.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">With reference now to the drawing figures, wherein like reference numbers represent corresponding parts throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>49</b></figref> show a convertible high chair <b>100</b> according to an example embodiment of the present invention. The high chair <b>100</b> generally includes a frame <b>200</b>, a first child seat <b>300</b> and a second child seat <b>400</b> that includes a tray assembly <b>500</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> illustrate the convertible high chair <b>100</b> in a first configuration or mode of use as an infant high chair, in which the second child seat <b>400</b> is coupled to the first child seat <b>300</b> and thereby supported by the frame <b>200</b> in a high chair configuration.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the second configuration in which the convertible high chair <b>100</b> is adapted for a second mode of use as a stand-alone toddler booster seat. In this configuration, the second child seat <b>400</b> is decoupled from the first child seat <b>300</b> and is removed from the high chair <b>100</b> to expose the seat portion <b>310</b> of the first child seat. The first child seat <b>300</b> is supported a distance above the floor by the frame <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The frame <b>200</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, is generally configured for resting on a floor or other support surface. The frame <b>200</b> generally includes a front U-shaped frame member <b>210</b> and a back U-shaped frame member <b>220</b> connected at a hubs <b>230</b> positioned on either side of the frame. The frame members <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> each include a cross frame member <b>212</b>, <b>222</b> and generally upright frame members or legs <b>214</b>, <b>224</b> angled in the form of an A-frame support structure. The cross frame members <b>212</b>, <b>222</b> extend generally parallel with the support surface or floor. The upright frame members <b>214</b>, <b>224</b> extend at an upward angle from the cross frame members <b>212</b>, <b>222</b> to the hub <b>230</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the front upright frame members <b>214</b> are attached to the hubs <b>230</b> in a fixed position, whereas the back upright frame members <b>224</b> are pivotally attached to the hubs. This pivotal attachment allows a user to fold the frame <b>200</b> from an expanded in-use position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, to a more compact storage position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The hubs <b>230</b> can each include a locking mechanism that locks the frame in the in-use and/or storage position. In the example embodiment, the locking mechanism locks the back frame member <b>220</b> in both the in-use and folded position. The hubs <b>230</b> each include a button <b>232</b> that, when pressed, unlocks the locking mechanism and allows the back frame member <b>220</b> to pivot between the in-use and folded position. In example embodiments, two-handed operation by an adult is utilized to fold the mechanism, to prevent inadvertent release. In alternate embodiments, another release mechanism, such as a handle or switch, can be used. In alternate embodiments, the front frame member <b>210</b> or both frame members are able to pivot. In the depicted embodiment, the frame <b>200</b> also includes a plurality of wheels <b>240</b> (e.g., castors) that permit the frame <b>200</b> to be rolled by a user along the floor. In example embodiments, the wheels <b>240</b> have a diameter of at least about 1.5 inches to help the frame roll along a thick carpet. The wheels <b>240</b> optionally include caster mechanisms for rotation and turning. In alternate embodiments, larger or smaller wheel diameters can be used. In the depicted embodiment, wheel attachment protrusions <b>242</b> attach the wheels <b>240</b> to the frame members <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>. The protrusions <b>242</b> position the wheels <b>240</b> a distance outwardly away from the frame members <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> for improved stability. In alternate embodiments, the wheels <b>240</b> attach directly to the frame members <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>. The wheels <b>240</b> can include a lock and release or braking mechanism <b>244</b> for selectively locking the wheels to prevent rolling or releasing the wheels to allow rolling. In alternate embodiments, the frame <b>200</b> can include other sliding or rolling means.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In example embodiments, the frame <b>2200</b> of the high chair <b>2000</b> can also include additional rolling elements <b>2246</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b> and <b>52</b></figref>. In the depicted embodiment, the back cross frame member <b>2222</b> can include one or more rollers positioned in between the wheels <b>2240</b>. The rollers <b>2246</b> are configured to not engage the support surface when the frame <b>2200</b> is in the unfolded use position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b></figref>. In example embodiments, the rollers <b>2246</b> have a smaller diameter than the wheels <b>2240</b>. The rollers <b>2246</b> are configured to engage the support surface when the frame <b>2200</b> is pulled by a caregiver in the folded position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref>. The rollers <b>2246</b> help the caregiver move the high chair <b>2000</b> in this folded, angled position.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The first child seat <b>300</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, is attached to the front vertical frame members <b>214</b> of the frame <b>200</b> and supported a distance above the support surface. The first child seat <b>300</b> generally includes a seat portion <b>310</b>, a backrest <b>320</b> and optionally a footrest <b>330</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the seat portion <b>310</b> includes a seating surface <b>312</b> and shoulders or armrests <b>314</b>. The seating surface <b>312</b> provides a surface substantially parallel to the floor or support surface configured to support a child seated thereon. The shoulders <b>314</b> extend upwardly from lateral sides and back of the seating surface <b>312</b>. The shoulders <b>314</b> can act as armrest for a child seated therein. The backrest <b>320</b> extends upward from the seating surface <b>312</b> to provide back support to a child seated thereon. In the example embodiment, the back rest <b>320</b> is pivotally attached to the seating surface <b>312</b> and is able to be moved between an in-use position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, and a folded position, discussed further below. In alternate embodiments, the back rest <b>320</b> is detachable from the first child seat <b>300</b> or fixed in position.
