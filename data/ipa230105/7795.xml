display in an electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the advance of display technology, there is ongoing development on various types of display devices. In particular, display devices such as a computer, a tablet Personal Computer (PC), a mobile phone, or the like have a high distribution rate, and efforts have been recently made to develop a new form of the display device in order to meet the needs of users who want newer and more diverse functions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a result of such efforts, a rollable display device is an example of a next-generation display device. A portable electronic device employs a display having a larger area, compared to a housing, to provide a wide screen. However, since the electronic device increases in size in proportion to an increase in a size of the display, there is a limit in the size of the display. In order to overcome the limitation, in the next-generation display device, e.g., the rollable display, part of the display may be selectively drawn into the inside of the housing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A type of the display includes a bar type, a foldable type, and a rollable type. In case of the bar type, although the display is attached to part of a curved portion, since a window layer of the display is fixed in a bended shape, the display may be stably attached to the housing of the electronic device. In case of the foldable type, a folding portion of the display may not be attached to the housing of the electronic device, but at least part of a flat portion of the display may be attached to the housing of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In case of a rollable display, there is a state in which part of the display is drawn into the inside of a housing (hereinafter, referred to as a first state) and a state in which part of the display is drawn out from the inside of the housing (hereinafter, referred to as a second state). The rollable display includes a roller unit which enables the display to move. A movement section of the rollable display has a curved section, in which the display moves by being bended along the roller unit, and a flat section. when the electronic device is converted from the first state to the second state, an end of the rollable display located in the flat section when the rollable display is in the first state is located in the curved section, thereby repeatedly applying a stress to the end of the rollable display.
