It is problematic if the label is shorter than the distance between a print line in the printer and a dispensing edge at the label dispensing point. In continuous operation, the next but one label is then already printed while the other is still being dispensed. However, when the print job is finished, the label after the next one may not be printed and it remains empty. Depending on the label size, this may also be true for a plurality of labels.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Especially if the printer does not have a retract function, the unprinted labels must be advanced. In the process, these labels are dispensed and must be removed manually. This is a waste of the print medium.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For marking electrical conductors, for example, conventionally label printers are used which print a label which then has to be manually mounted on the conductor after printing. The document US 2003/146943 A1 describes a printer that alternately prints and cuts a label. Furthermore, label printers are known which, in addition to printing, detach self-adhesive labels from a carrier (also: &#x201c;liner&#x201d;) so that they can either be removed manually or automatically applied to the object to be marked by an application unit.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, special printers are known which may be used for conductor labeling. The document US 2004/0211522 A1 describes a machine that winds a pre-printed wrap-around label around a conductor taken from a spindle roll. The document US 2008/0073023 A1 discloses a monolithic machine for printing and applying wrap-around labels. However, these may only print certain labels and, if an automated application is integrated, no other printing applications are possible with such a device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, an add-on device is a significant use case for a label printer. However, the output of empty labels described at the beginning is also problematic if the printer is equipped with an add-on device and this device is to apply the dispensed label. In this case, the device interferes with or impedes the manual removal of unusable labels.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a printer for outputting a printed product, comprising: a print head configured to print on a print medium moving in a longitudinal direction, the print medium comprising a plurality of separate or separable labels detachably arranged on a carrier along the longitudinal direction; and a material interface configured to output the print medium printed by the printer as a printed product, the material interface comprising a dispensing edge and a support, which are configured to deflect the carrier over the dispensing edge and the support downstream of the print head in the longitudinal direction, wherein the dispensing edge is arranged relative to the support in a first position to induce a detaching deflection of the carrier for detaching the respective label, and wherein the dispensing edge and the support are arranged in a second position relative to each other to induce an entraining deflection for entraining the respective label on the carrier.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention will be described in even greater detail below based on the exemplary figures.

A printer and a printing system may be provided that supports the application of a marking to a prolate object, preferably a conductor, through exchangeable devices.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A first aspect relates to a printer for outputting a printed product. The printer comprises a print head configured to print on a print medium moving in a longitudinal direction. The print medium comprises a plurality of separate or separable labels detachably arranged on a carrier along the longitudinal direction. Alternatively or additionally, the printer comprises a material interface for outputting the print medium printed by the printer as a printed product. The material interface comprises a dispensing edge and a support over which the carrier can be deflected in the longitudinal direction behind the print head. The dispensing edge is arranged in a first position relative to the support to induce a deflection of the carrier to detach the respective label. The dispensing edge and the support are arranged in a second position relative to each other to induce a deflection entraining the respective label on the carrier.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the printer allow the dispensing function to be switched on and off according to the first and second positions, respectively. As a result, an operator does not have to manually remove blank or unusable labels; preferably, these are simply rewound or wound up along with the carrier. This is particularly important for printers that may not retract the printing material. Furthermore, this is important for the use of a device arranged at the material interface for further processing of the label, so that the device is not supplied with empty or unusable labels.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments may implement a selective outputting (also: dispensing) of the label (for example, by a sharp deflection at the dispensing edge), depending on the first or second position. The detaching deflection may be achieved when the inherent stiffness of the respective label is greater than an adhesive force of the label on the carrier (i.e., liner), such that the label detaches from the carrier.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The dispensing edge may be a sheet metal edge.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the case of the deflection that detaches (i.e., detaching deflection), the dispensing edge for the deflection may engage with the carrier. The detaching deflection may correspond to a sharp-edged deflection at the dispensing edge. In the entraining deflection, the dispensing edge may be out of contact with the carrier, for example not inducing a deflection or inducing a deflection corresponding to an entraining deflection.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A deflection angle of the dispensing edge and the support may be equal or substantially equal in the first position and the second position. In the first position, the deflection angle may be completely or substantially completely induced by the dispensing edge. In the second position, the deflection angle may be completely or substantially completely induced by the support. Alternatively or additionally, the deflection angle may be induced equally or substantially equally by the dispensing edge and the support, respectively.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The detachable labels may detach upon deflection (i.e., detaching deflection) if the deflection comprises a kink angle greater than a minimum detachment angle and/or if the deflection comprises a radius of curvature less than a maximum detachment radius. The detaching deflection may induce a kink angle in the carrier that is greater than the minimum angle and/or induce a radius of curvature that is less than the maximum radius.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The kink angle may be the angular deviation with respect to the longitudinal direction. The minimum angle may be equal to or greater than 45&#xb0;, 60&#xb0;, 90&#xb0; or 120&#xb0;. The maximum radius may be equal to or less than a thickness of the label and/or carrier.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The detaching deflection at the dispensing edge may individually detach the label passing the dispensing edge.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The dispensing edge and/or the support may be movable between the first position and the second position, preferably longitudinally movable (also: translational) and/or rotationally movable (also: rotational).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The dispensing edge and/or support may be manually movable between the first position and the second position.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the first position, the dispensing edge may abut the carrier for detaching deflection of the carrier. Alternatively or additionally, in the second position the dispensing edge may be spaced from the carrier.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A kink angle of the detaching deflection in the first position may be greater than a kink angle induced by the dispensing edge in the second position and/or than a kink angle induced by the support in the second position.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A radius of curvature of a surface of the support for deflection of the carrier may be larger or several times larger than a radius of curvature of a surface of the dispensing edge for deflection of the carrier.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the second position, the carrier may be deflected over a rounded surface of the support and the dispensing edge may be arranged on a side of the support facing away from the carrier. In the first position, the dispensing edge may extend transversely, preferably perpendicularly, to the longitudinal direction beyond the rounded surface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The support may comprise at least a portion of a circumferential surface of a circular cylinder. The dispensing edge may be rotatable about an axis (for example, the axis of symmetry) of the circular cylinder between the first position and the second position. Preferably, the dispensing edge may be arranged tangentially to the circular cylinder.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the first position, the carrier may be deflected over the dispensing edge in a deflection direction transverse to the longitudinal direction and the support may be aligned with or spaced from the dispensing edge in the longitudinal direction. In the second position, the dispensing edge may be longitudinally movable relative to the first position and/or relative to the support in the deflection direction. Preferably, in the first position and/or in the second position, the dispensing edge may be arranged behind the support with respect to the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the first position, the carrier may be deflected over the dispensing edge in a deflection direction transverse to the longitudinal direction and the support may be aligned with or spaced from the dispensing edge in the longitudinal direction. In the second position, the dispensing edge may be longitudinally moved relative to the first position and/or relative to the support to a side of the support remote from the carrier. Preferably, in the first position, the dispensing edge may be arranged longitudinally behind the support. Alternatively or additionally, in the second position, the dispensing edge may be aligned with the support in the deflection direction or arranged forward of the support with respect to the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The printer may further comprise a dispensing edge actuator configured to move the dispensing edge and/or the support between the first position and the second position.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The printer may further comprise a control unit or regulating unit configured to control or regulate the print head and/or the dispensing edge actuator such that the dispensing edge actuator moves the dispensing edge and/or the support to the first position when a label printed and/or defect-free (preferably moved in the longitudinal direction) by the print head reaches the material interface. Alternatively or additionally, the control unit or regulating unit of the printer may be configured to control or regulate the print head and/or the dispensing edge actuator such that the dispensing edge actuator moves the dispensing edge and/or the support into the second position when a label that is unprinted and/or defective (preferably moved in the longitudinal direction) by the print head reaches the material interface.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The printer may further comprise a sensor arranged between the print head and the material interface and in signal connection with the control unit or the regulating unit, which is configured to detect an identifier printed by the print head on the respective label. The control unit or the regulating unit may further be configured to detect whether the respective label is defect-free or defective on the basis of the detected identifier.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The label may be defective if it is printed incorrectly. The sensor may detect the identifier optically, preferably without contact. The sensor may comprise a camera or a line scanner.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Alternatively or additionally, the labels may each comprise a transponder. The printer may further comprise a reading unit of the transponder, which is in signal connection with the control unit or the regulating unit and is configured to read an identification of the respective label from the associated transponder. The control unit or regulating unit may further be configured to determine whether the respective label is error-free or defective on the basis of the read-out identifier.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The label may be faulty if the identifier cannot be read and/or does not match the printed identifier. The reader unit may be configured to read the transponder's identifier using alternating magnetic fields or (preferably high-frequency) radio waves, for example as radio frequency identification (RFID) or near field communication (NFC). The alternating fields or radio waves generated by the reader unit may supply the transponder with energy at least during the reading of the identifier.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The transponder may be materially connected to the printed product, for example embedded in a surface of the print medium.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The printer may further comprise a print roller. The print head and the print roller may be configured to print on the print medium loaded in the printer. For example, the print medium, and optionally a printing material, is guided between the print roller and the print head in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preferably, the printer is a printer for outputting a printed product to a device for circumferentially arranging a marking closed around a prolate object, preferably around a conductor, or for providing a marking arrangeable closed around a prolate object, preferably around a conductor.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The printer may further comprise a mechanical interface configured to releasably or irreversibly mount a device to the printer.
