More specifically, the invention relates to an adjustable damper for use with a vehicle suspension.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Vehicle suspension systems typically include a spring component or components and a dampening component or components. Typically, mechanical springs, like helical springs are used with some type of viscous fluid-based dampening mechanism and the two are mounted functionally in parallel. In some instances, a spring may comprise pressurized gas and features of the damper or spring are user-adjustable, such as by adjusting the air pressure in a gas spring. A damper may be constructed by placing a damping piston in a fluid-filled cylinder (e.g., liquid such as oil). As the damping piston is moved in the cylinder, fluid is compressed and passes from one side of the piston to the other side. Often, the piston includes vents there-through which may be covered by shim stacks to provide for different operational characteristics in compression or extension.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Conventional damping components provide a constant damping rate during compression or extension through the entire length of the stroke. Other conventional damping components provide mechanisms for varying the damping rate. As various types of recreational and sporting vehicles continue to become more technologically advanced, what is needed in the art are improved techniques for varying the damping rate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts an asymmetric bicycle fork having a damping leg and a spring leg.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts a cross-sectional side elevation view of a shock absorber of a bicycle fork cartridge, in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depict a cross-sectional side elevation view of various operational positions of an embodiment of the base valve assembly of detail <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depict a cross-sectional side elevation view of a valve assembly of detail <b>2</b> of the shock absorber of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> each depicts a cross-sectional side elevation view of the valve assembly of detail <b>2</b> of the shock absorber of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> depict a cross-sectional side elevation view of a shock absorber, in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref> depict a cross-sectional side elevation view of the base valve assembly of detail <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, including a &#x201c;latching solenoid&#x201d;, in accordance with an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The drawings referred to in this description should be understood as not being drawn to scale except if specifically noted.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present technology, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the technology will be described in conjunction with various embodiment(s), it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the present technology to these embodiments. On the contrary, the present technology is applicable to alternative embodiments, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, in the following description of embodiments, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present technology. However, the present technology may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Embodiments describe a system and method for a pilot spool valve assembly that enables the generation of relatively large damping forces by a relatively small solenoid (or other motive source), while using relatively low amounts of power. Furthermore, since the incompressible fluid inside of the valve body of the shock absorber assembly causes damping to occur as the valve opens and the valve body collapses, embodiments enable both a controllable preload on the valve stack and a controllable damping rate.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the solenoid includes a &#x201c;latching&#x201d; mechanism to open and close the pressure-balanced pilot spool. Due to the latching configuration of the solenoid, power is only required to open or close the valve. Power is not required to hold the valve open or closed in either setting. Consequently, embodiments enable reduced power consumption compared to the traditional shock absorber.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further embodiments provide an externally-adjustable means of tuning the open state of the damper. An adjuster turns in or out to vary the effective orifice size of the pilot spool when in the open position. This allows the rider to adjust the soft setting of the damper to his preference.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The following discussion describes the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>B</figref> and embodiments shown therein.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Integrated damper/spring vehicle shock absorbers often include a damper body surrounded by or used in conjunction with a mechanical spring or constructed in conjunction with an air spring or both. The damper often consists of a piston and shaft telescopically mounted in a fluid filled cylinder. The damping fluid (i.e., damping liquid) or damping liquid may be, for example, hydraulic oil. A mechanical spring may be a helically wound spring that surrounds or is mounted in parallel with the damper body. Vehicle suspension systems typically include one or more dampers as well as one or more springs mounted to one or more vehicle axles.

The damping leg includes an upper tube <b>105</b> mounted in telescopic engagement with a lower tube <b>110</b> and having fluid damping components therein. The spring leg includes an upper tube <b>106</b> mounted in telescopic engagement with a lower tube <b>111</b> and having spring components therein. The upper legs <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> may be held centralized within the lower legs <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> by an annular bushing <b>108</b>. The fork <b>100</b> may be included as a component of a bicycle such as a mountain bicycle or an off-road vehicle such as an off-road motorcycle. In some embodiments, the fork <b>100</b> may be an &#x201c;upside down&#x201d; or Motocross-style motorcycle fork.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the damping components inside the damping leg include an internal piston <b>166</b> disposed at an upper end of a damper shaft <b>136</b> and fixed relative thereto. The internal piston <b>166</b> is mounted in telescopic engagement with a cartridge tube <b>162</b> connected to a top cap <b>180</b> fixed at one end of the upper tube <b>105</b>. The interior volume of the damping leg may be filled with a damping liquid such as hydraulic oil. The piston <b>166</b> may include shim stacks (i.e., valve members) that allow a damping liquid to flow through vented paths in the piston <b>166</b> when the upper tube <b>105</b> is moved relative to the lower tube <b>110</b>. A compression chamber is formed on one side of the piston <b>166</b> and a rebound chamber is formed on the other side of the piston <b>166</b>. The pressure built up in either the compression chamber or the rebound chamber during a compression stroke or a rebound stroke provides a damping force that opposes the motion of the fork <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The spring components inside the spring leg include a helically wound spring <b>115</b> contained within the upper tube <b>106</b> and axially restrained between top cap <b>181</b> and a flange <b>165</b>. The flange <b>165</b> is disposed at an upper end of the riser tube <b>163</b> and fixed thereto. The lower end of the riser tube <b>163</b> is connected to the lower tube <b>111</b> in the spring leg and fixed relative thereto. A valve plate <b>155</b> is positioned within the upper leg tube <b>106</b> and axially fixed thereto such that the plate <b>155</b> moves with the upper tube <b>106</b>. The valve plate <b>155</b> is annular in configuration, surrounds an exterior surface of the riser tube <b>163</b>, and is axially moveable in relation thereto. The valve plate <b>155</b> is sealed against an interior surface of the upper tube <b>106</b> and an exterior surface of the riser tube <b>163</b>. A substantially incompressible lubricant (e.g., oil) may be contained within a portion of the lower tube <b>111</b> filling a portion of the volume within the lower tube <b>111</b> below the valve plate <b>155</b>. The remainder of the volume in the lower tube <b>111</b> may be filled with gas at atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">During compression of fork <b>100</b>, the gas in the interior volume of the lower tube <b>111</b> is compressed between the valve plate <b>155</b> and the upper surface of the lubricant as the upper tube <b>106</b> telescopically extends into the lower tube <b>111</b>. The helically wound spring <b>115</b> is compressed between the top cap <b>181</b> and the flange <b>165</b>, fixed relative to the lower tube <b>111</b>. The volume of the gas in the lower tube <b>111</b> decreases in a nonlinear fashion as the valve plate <b>155</b>, fixed relative to the upper tube <b>106</b>, moves into the lower tube <b>111</b>. As the volume of the gas gets small, a rapid build-up in pressure occurs that opposes further travel of the fork <b>100</b>. The high pressure gas greatly augments the spring force of spring <b>115</b> proximate to the &#x201c;bottom-out&#x201d; position where the fork <b>100</b> is fully compressed. The level of the incompressible lubricant may be set to a point in the lower tube <b>111</b> such that the distance between the valve plate <b>155</b> and the level of the oil is substantially equal to a maximum desired travel of the fork <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a cross-sectional side elevation view of a shock absorber of a bicycle fork cartridge is depicted, in accordance with an embodiment. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows the inner portions of the bicycle fork leg assembly, comprising a damper piston <b>5</b>. In practice, the top cap <b>20</b> is affixed to an upper tube (not shown) and the lower connector <b>10</b> is fixed to a lower leg tube (not shown) where the upper tube is typically telescopically mounted within the lower tube (although the reverse may also be the case). As the upper tube and the lower tube telescope in contraction or expansion in response to disparities in the terrain being traversed by a vehicle, including such for shock absorbsion, so also the damper piston <b>5</b> and piston rod <b>15</b> move telescopically into and out of damper cylinder <b>25</b>. During compression, the volume of the piston rod <b>15</b> displaces, from the cylinder <b>25</b>, a volume of damping liquid contained within the cylinder <b>25</b> corresponding to the volume of the piston rod <b>15</b> incurring into the damper cylinder <b>25</b>. During extension or &#x201c;rebound&#x201d;, the volume of liquid must be replaced as the piston rod <b>15</b> leaves the interior of the damper cylinder <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Damping liquid displaced as described above moves from the damper cylinder <b>25</b>, through a base valve assembly of detail <b>2</b> and ultimately into an elastic bladder <b>30</b> during compression, and from the elastic bladder <b>30</b>, back through the base valve assembly of detail <b>2</b> and into the damper cylinder <b>25</b> during rebound. In one embodiment, the base valve assembly of detail <b>2</b> allows for the compression damping to be adjusted by the user.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> show cross-sectional side elevation views of various operational positions of an embodiment of the base valve assembly of detail <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> show a continuously variable semi active arrangement, in accordance with embodiments, and as will be described in more detail below. In brief, a solenoid balanced by an armature biasing spring <b>235</b> axially locates a pressure-balanced pilot spool <b>210</b>. The pressure-balanced pilot spool <b>210</b> controls the pressure inside the valve body <b>230</b>. As this pressure is increased inside the valve body <b>230</b>, the axially force of the valve body <b>230</b> on the conventional valve shim increases. Due to the pilot spool assembly arrangement, a relatively small solenoid (using relatively low amounts of power) can generate relatively large damping forces. Furthermore, due to incompressible fluid inside the valve body <b>230</b>, damping occurs as the valve opens and the valve body <b>230</b> collapses. The result is not only a controllable preload on the valve stack, but also a controllable damping rate. Embodiments discussed herein may optionally be packaged in a base valve, the compression adjuster of a shock absorber, and/or on the main piston of a shock absorber.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a detailed view of the base valve assembly of detail <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, with the valve shown in the retracted soft position.

The pilot spool <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is in a firm position, in which the metering edge <b>205</b> of the pilot spool <b>210</b> is fully obstructing ports <b>50</b>A.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the axial displacement of the pilot spool <b>210</b> is facilitated by an electromagnetic interaction between the armature <b>215</b> and the coil <b>220</b>. Adjustment of the current in the coil <b>220</b> (via modulation of the current from a power source [not shown]) to predetermined values causes the armature <b>215</b>, and hence the pilot spool <b>210</b>, to move in corresponding predetermined axial positions relative to the coil <b>220</b>. As such, the pilot spool <b>210</b> can be adjusted as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the pilot spool <b>210</b> is closing ports <b>50</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, substantially all damping fluid compression flow must flow through port <b>70</b> and valve shims <b>225</b>. In addition, the damping fluid pressure acting through and in annulus <b>60</b> on an interior of the valve body <b>230</b> is increased and therefore the valve body <b>230</b> exerts more closing force of the valve shims <b>225</b>. The net result is an increased compression damping due to closure of ports <b>50</b>A and a further compression damping increase due to a corresponding pressure increase in the compression damping within annulus <b>60</b>. When the pilot spool <b>210</b> is located in a middle position as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the foregoing results apply in a diminished way because some of the compression flow (albeit less than full compression flow) may flow through partially open ports <b>50</b>A.

Of note, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows a &#x201c;hard/soft configuration&#x201d;.

However, for compression, the pressure is low, but there is no bleed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows a &#x201c;hard/hard configuration&#x201d; (a firm compression and a firm rebound), in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref> depicts a cross-sectional side elevation view of the base valve assembly of detail <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, including a &#x201c;latching solenoid&#x201d;, in accordance with an embodiment. Embodiments further provide, in brief and as will be described below, a low-power bi-state electronic damper.

In one embodiment, the latching solenoid assembly <b>905</b> (or latching spool valve assembly) includes: a pilot spool <b>210</b> which includes a magnetically active material; a spring <b>915</b> which is normally in compression and biases the pilot spool <b>210</b> toward a position obstructing ports <b>50</b>A; a permanent magnet <b>920</b>; and a coil <b>220</b> where power is supplied to the coil <b>220</b> by (in one embodiment) wires <b>925</b>.

As the cartridge is moved downward, the low speed adjuster metering edge <b>950</b> is moved into further obstruction of ports <b>50</b>B, thereby restricting flow of damping fluid through the damper from an interior of the pilot spool valve assembly to an exterior of the damping assembly (note the open ports <b>50</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in which the pilot spool valve <b>210</b> is shown in the open pilot position with the low speed adjuster <b>935</b> in the soft position).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, the pilot spool <b>210</b> is biased by spring <b>915</b> toward a position wherein the metering edge <b>930</b> of the pilot spool <b>210</b> further obstructs ports <b>50</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, wherein the pilot spool <b>210</b> is shown in the open pilot position with the low speed adjuster <b>935</b> in the middle position). A force opposing the bias of the spring <b>915</b> is exerted on the magnetic component of the pilot spool <b>210</b> by the permanent magnet <b>920</b>. When the pilot spool <b>210</b> is in its uppermost (corresponding to open ports <b>50</b>A) position, it is retained by the magnetic force between the permanent magnet <b>920</b> and the pilot spool valve <b>210</b> where that force is sufficient to overcome the bias of the spring <b>915</b> (thereby holding the spring <b>915</b> in a compressed state). As such, when the pilot spool valve <b>210</b> and ports <b>50</b>A are in the open position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>), no power input is required to maintain that state.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, when it is desired to close or partially close ports <b>50</b>A by means of the metering edge <b>930</b> of the pilot spool <b>210</b>, a current is applied to the coil <b>220</b> via the wires <b>925</b>. The current causes a magnetic flux around the coil <b>220</b>, which acts on the magnetic component of the pilot spool <b>210</b> causing the pilot spool <b>210</b> to move axially within the cartridge. When the pilot spool <b>210</b> has moved a relatively small distance axially away from the permanent magnet <b>920</b>, the spring <b>915</b> bias moves the pilot spool <b>210</b> toward closure of ports <b>50</b>A with little or no additional power input to the coil <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Of note, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the pilot spool <b>210</b> in the closed pilot position with the low speed adjuster <b>935</b> in the firm position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the pilot spool <b>210</b> in the open pilot position with the low speed adjuster <b>935</b> in the firm position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> additionally shows the low speed adjuster metering edge <b>1005</b> and the spool valve assembly housing <b>1010</b>, in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref> show an orifice block <b>955</b> having a tailored orifice <b>960</b> there through. The orifice <b>960</b> meters low speed damping fluid for low speed bump response of the suspension (when magnitude and rate is insufficient to open the shims). The size of the orifice <b>960</b> may be chosen to allow a desired amount or range of pressure to be applied to the valve body <b>230</b> through annulus <b>60</b> (ports). The use of the pilot spool <b>210</b> then further specifies that the pressure acts on the valve body <b>230</b> by modulating the flow restriction &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; (during a compression stroke of the suspension) of the orifice <b>960</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref> also show a pressure relief valve <b>965</b> or &#x201c;blow off&#x201d; valve, which is biased toward a closed position by Bellville spring(s) <b>970</b>. The pressure relief valve <b>965</b> opens in response to an interior damper pressure above a predetermined threshold and thereby prevents damage to the damper and vehicle in the event of rapid pressure build up (usually associated with extreme suspension compression rate).
