Different configurations of gates and springs are known that enable the gate and spring to be associated so that the spring moves the gate so that the carabiner is closed. The spring applies a force on the gate to bias the latter to its closed position thereby closing the carabiner.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known from the document U.S. Pat. No. 8,234,761 to form a gate that is openable and closable. The gate formed by a wire is elastically deformable and is prestressed to place itself against the body in the absence of any outside force. The gate is formed by a metal wire having two attachment points offset along the large axis of the carabiner to define an axis of rotation of the openable gate and a spring effect.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another carabiner configuration is also known with a movable gate that is hollow. The spring is a coil spring installed inside the gate. The spring deforms inside the gate. One end of the spring is pressing on the inside of the gate whereas the other end is pressing on a pusher that presses on the body of the carabiner close to the axis of rotation between the gate and body. Rotation of the gate results in rotation of the pusher and compression of the spring.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Different pusher configurations are known with in particular a pin that pushes into the coil spring. In one configuration, the pusher has one end having a cross-section close to the cross-section of the cavity of the gate so as to close the cavity. Rotation of the gate with respect to the body corresponds to translation of the pusher in the cavity which applies a more or less large stress on the coil spring. The spring is configured to repel the pusher corresponding to a gate in the closed position of the carabiner. In another configuration, the pusher that closes the cavity is replaced by a rod that partially obstructs the cavity and that passes through at least a part of the coil spring to ensure a good mechanical connection between the pusher and the coil spring.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Different configurations of carabiners are illustrated in the documents EP 1710456, FR 2731255, EP 1703148, JP 2016-6342, U.S. Pat. No. 4,835,823, FR 2651684 and CN 209212760.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is known from document U.S. Pat. No. 3,367,001 a hook that opens outward and has a hollow gate. The inside of the gate receives a coil spring that slides along the outside surface of the hook. The document U.S. Pat. No. 4,811,467 disclose a carabiner provided with a gate equipped with a pusher topped by an elastically deformable part forming a spring. The plunger and the spring are monolithic.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One object of the invention consists in remedying these shortcomings, and more particularly in providing a carabiner that ensures a better cooperation between the coil spring and the pusher while at the same time keeping an assembly formed by the spring and the pusher that is easy to install in the carabiner and that is economically viable.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These shortcomings tend to be overcome by means of a carabiner having:<ul

carabiner is remarkable in that the spring and pusher are fixedly mounted on one another to form a monolithic assembly.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">According to one feature of the invention, the spring and pusher are formed by one and the same metal wire.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">In preferential manner, the metal wire has a constant diameter from one end of the spring to the other and from one end of the pusher to the other.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">Advantageously, the pusher is in the form of a ring, the spring having two pressing points on the ring.</p><p id="p-0015"

carabiner provided with a body <b>1</b>, a gate <b>2</b> and a rotation shaft <b>3</b>. Body <b>1</b> is C-shaped. Gate <b>2</b> is fitted movable in rotation with respect to body <b>1</b>. Gate <b>2</b> is fitted rotatable around a rotation shaft <b>3</b>. Gate <b>2</b> is fitted movable between a closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and an open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In the closed position, gate <b>2</b> closes the carabiner which then defines a closed loop. In the open position, gate <b>2</b> closes the carabiner which then defines an open loop allowing a tool or a strap to be inserted.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0035">Body <b>1</b> presents a C-shape with opposite first and second ends <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>facing one another. First end <b>1</b><i>a </i>is joined to second end <b>1</b><i>b </i>by connecting portion <b>1</b><i>c </i>which is preferentially rectilinear or substantially rectilinear. Gate <b>2</b> is fixed to second end <b>1</b><i>b </i>by means of rotation shaft <b>3</b>. In the closed position, gate <b>2</b> connects first end <b>1</b><i>a </i>to second end <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0028" num="0036">Gate <b>2</b> defines a cavity <b>2</b><i>a </i>designed to house a spring <b>4</b>. The carabiner has a spring <b>4</b> and a pusher <b>5</b>. Spring <b>4</b> is a coil spring the spring axis B of which is parallel or substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis A of cavity <b>2</b><i>a</i>. Spring <b>4</b> has one end that is pressing against gate <b>2</b>. The coil spring extends along longitudinal axis A of cavity <b>2</b><i>a</i>. Longitudinal axis A of cavity <b>2</b><i>a </i>passes through or is in immediate proximity to the axis of gate <b>2</b> with respect to body <b>1</b>. Spring <b>4</b> is formed by a plurality of non-jointed coils so as to work in compression. Spring <b>4</b> is compressed between one end of cavity <b>2</b><i>a </i>and pusher <b>5</b>. The use of a coil spring is more advantageous than a flat spring known from the prior art.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0037">Pusher <b>5</b> is pressing directly against body <b>1</b>. Pusher <b>5</b> is housed in a dedicated space of body <b>1</b>, for example in the form of a dish or a hook arranged in body <b>1</b> to block one end of pusher <b>5</b>. Pusher <b>5</b> separates spring <b>4</b> and body <b>1</b>. This configuration is more advantageous than the one illustrated in document U.S. Pat. No. 3,367,001 because the pusher can intervene in the rotation of the gate when the latter is deformed from its end wedged in the cup or the hook to the other end attached to the spring.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0038">Rotation of gate <b>2</b> results in movement of pusher <b>5</b> which is inserted more or less deeply in cavity <b>2</b><i>a</i>. Insertion of pusher <b>5</b> into cavity <b>2</b><i>a </i>biases spring <b>4</b> which opposes this insertion. Rotation of gate <b>2</b> from the closed position to the open position results in depression of pusher <b>5</b> into cavity <b>2</b><i>a </i>and compression of spring <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0039">Pusher <b>5</b> and spring <b>4</b> are installed in fixed manner on one another so as to form a single part that is inserted into cavity <b>2</b><i>a </i>when spring <b>4</b> is installed in cavity <b>2</b><i>a</i>. Mechanical fixing of pusher <b>5</b> on spring <b>4</b> enables transmission of the forces between pusher <b>5</b> and spring <b>4</b> to be defined precisely. This makes it possible to better define the behaviour of spring <b>4</b> and the behaviour of pusher <b>5</b> when rotation of gate <b>2</b> takes place.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0040">In the prior art configurations where the pusher has one end having a substantially identical cross-section to the cross-section of the cavity, it is not possible to have a perfect complementarity between the two parts. Furthermore, to avoid introducing friction between gate <b>2</b> and pusher <b>5</b>, it is sought to provide a pusher <b>5</b> with a substantially smaller cross-section than that of the cavity. Unfortunately, this configuration results in cavity <b>2</b><i>a </i>being able to retain moisture or debris when the carabiners are used in difficult conditions, for example caving or mountaineering. This may result in premature ageing of spring <b>4</b> with a modification of its mechanical behaviour.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0041">In the prior art configurations where pusher <b>5</b> is in the form of a rod inserted between the coils of spring <b>4</b>, the width of the rod must be sufficiently large to come into contact with the coils substantially over a diameter without coming into contact with the side wall of the cavity to reduce friction. As the parts as small, installation of the spring and pusher is a painstaking operation. The behaviour of gate <b>2</b> can vary depending on how spring <b>4</b> and pusher <b>5</b> are installed. Spring <b>4</b> and pusher <b>5</b> move with respect to one another. As a result of the large number of movements of gate <b>2</b> between its open position and closed position, the mechanical connection between spring <b>4</b> and pusher <b>5</b> is modified which modifies the behaviour of gate <b>2</b> with time.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0042">It is therefore particularly advantageous to have a spring <b>4</b> and a pusher <b>5</b> that are irremediably fixed to one another so as to form an assembly whose mechanical behaviour is better mastered in particular as the carabiner is increasingly used. Mechanical fixing of spring <b>4</b> with pusher <b>5</b> enables the mechanical behaviour of the assembly formed by spring <b>4</b> and pusher <b>5</b> to be better mastered throughout rotation of gate <b>2</b> between the closed position and the open position. It is particularly advantageous to provide for the end of spring <b>4</b> in contact with pusher <b>5</b> not to be totally sealed so as to make it easier to extract ice, mud or sand which may penetrate into spring <b>4</b>. Depending on the configurations, pusher <b>5</b> does not obstruct or hardly obstructs the central hole of the spring in its proximal end of pusher <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0043">In a particular embodiment, fixing of spring <b>4</b> with pusher <b>5</b> defines a hinge with elastic deformation.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0044">In an advantageous configuration, pusher <b>5</b> and spring <b>4</b> are formed by one and the same part so as to form a monolithic, and therefore inseparable, assembly.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0045">In preferential manner, spring <b>4</b> and pusher <b>5</b> are made from metal material, preferably in the same grade of metal and even more preferentially in a single technological step so as to form an assembly whose mechanical performances are even better mastered.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0046">In a preferred embodiment, spring <b>4</b> is formed by a wire, preferably a metal wire, forming the coil spring, and the wire that extends from spring <b>4</b> is used to form pusher <b>5</b>. Advantageously, the straight section of the wire is circular. It is particularly advantageous to use a metal wire of circular cross-section which greatly reduces wear of pusher <b>5</b> and/or of body <b>2</b> in comparison with a pusher formed by a plate as illustrated in the document EP 1710456. Preferentially, the cross-section of the wire is identical between spring <b>4</b> and pusher <b>5</b>, i.e. it is constant from one end of spring <b>4</b> to the other and from one end of pusher <b>5</b> to the other. It is also possible to provide pusher <b>5</b> in a wire that is thicker than the wire forming spring <b>4</b> so as to form a pusher with a reduced deformation. Preferentially, the metal wire is deformed to define spring <b>4</b> and the rest of the metal wire extending spring <b>4</b> is then deformed to form pusher <b>5</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the metal wire is deformed to define pusher <b>5</b> and the rest of the metal wire extending pusher <b>5</b> is then deformed to form spring <b>4</b>. The metal wire extending between spring <b>4</b> and pusher <b>5</b> results in a better mastery of the mechanical connection between these two parts and of the orientation of the pusher at the join between pusher <b>5</b> and spring <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0047">Advantageously, pusher <b>5</b> is in the form of a ring. The ring can be of any shape. One end of the ring is pressing on body <b>1</b>. The other end of the ring is pressing on spring <b>4</b>. In a preferential configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGs. <b>3</b><i>a </i>to <b>4</b><i>e</i></figref>, a part of the ring extends away from spring <b>4</b>. The bottom coil of spring <b>4</b> is pressing on the ring of pusher <b>5</b> to limit deformation of spring <b>4</b> by flexion.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0048">It is particularly advantageous to provide a pusher <b>5</b> that presents apertures in a direction perpendicular to the direction B. Pusher <b>5</b> can be in the form of a ring or a hook of any shape so long as it performs transmission of the compression force on spring <b>4</b> when rotation of gate <b>2</b> takes place. By using an apertured pusher <b>5</b>, removal of ice and sand that may settle between body <b>1</b> and pusher <b>5</b> is easier to perform. Each time gate <b>2</b> is moved, pusher <b>5</b> moves with respect to body <b>1</b> which may give rise to rapid ageing of gate <b>2</b> and/or of pusher <b>5</b> and also a modification of the interface between gate <b>2</b> and pusher <b>5</b>. The use of an apertured pusher <b>5</b> makes for a more homogeneous operation of gate <b>2</b> with time.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0049">It is advantageous to form a pusher <b>5</b> in the form of a ring so as to limit its deformation along spring axis B thereby improving biasing of spring <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0050">In a particular configuration, pusher <b>5</b> is not in the form of a ring and is for example L-shaped or U-shaped. The force take-up of the bottom coil of spring <b>4</b> is not on two distinct points of pusher <b>5</b> but on one point only.
