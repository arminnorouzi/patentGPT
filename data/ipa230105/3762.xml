There are many types of chip package bodies. Generally, the chip package bodies can be divided into different types according to packaging materials of the chip package bodies, connection manners of the chip package bodies and printed circuit boards (PCBs), and the appearances of the chip package bodies. The chip package bodies need to be tested before leaving the factory, so as to improve the quality of the supply.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a process of testing a chip package body, a test pin thereof needs to be electrically connected to a test circuit. In order to facilitate the fixed connection between the test circuit and the chip package body, a carrier device meeting a test requirement of the chip package body needs to be provided, to provide a test electrical signal to the chip package body through the test circuit and the test pin of the chip package body fastened to the carrier device, to test performance and reliability of the chip package body.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, different types of chip package bodies have different dimensions, and chip package bodies of a same type may have different sizes of test pins.
