Among them, bulk polymerization enables the preparation of a high-purity polymer by using a minimum amount of additive and has an advantage of a simple device and a high polymerization rate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the case of bulk polymerization, temperature control is difficult due to a large amount of heat generated in the polymerization process. Also, in the case of bulk polymerization, there are no materials capable of absorbing and removing the heat of polymerization apart from a vinyl chloride-based monomer, and the viscosity of a polymer increases as polymerization proceeds, and thus the diffusion of the heat of reaction by conduction or convection is difficult. As a result, the vinyl chloride-based polymer prepared by bulk polymerization may he thermally damaged due to the heat of reaction generated in the bulk polymerization process or unexpectedly generated heat, so it is very important to ensure the thermal stability of the vinyl chloride-based polymer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, to ensure thermal stability, Chinese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 107056972 proposes using a specific type of initiator composition in a pre-polymerization step (preliminary polymerization step). In addition, Korean Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2016-0035439 proposes a preparation method in which an oxocarboxylic acid, inorganic phosphate, or ethylenediaminetetraacetate is added during bulk polymerization. Additionally, Korean Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2017-0004703 proposes a preparation method in which copolymerization with a comonomer having excellent heat resistance is performed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the thermal stability of the vinyl chloride-based polymer was not sufficiently improved only by the conventionally proposed methods.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">RELATED-ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">(Patent Document 1) CN107056972A</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">(Patent Document 2) KR2016-0035439A</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">(Patent Document 3) KR2017-0004703A</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is directed to providing a method of preparing a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite whose thermal stability, transparency, and color characteristics are all improved.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One aspect of the present invention provides a method of preparing a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite, which comprises: bulk-polymerizing vinyl chloride-based monomers to prepare a vinyl chloride-based polymer; and preparing a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite including the vinyl chloride-based polymer and polyvinylpyrrolidone.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another aspect of the present invention provides a method of preparing a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite, which includes bulk-polymerizing vinyl chloride-based monomers in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A vinyl chloride-based polymer composite prepared by a preparation method according to the present invention is remarkably excellent in thermal stability, transparency, and color characteristics by including polyvinylpyrrolidone.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, since the method of preparing a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite according to the present invention is performed in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone, thermal damage to a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite, which occurs due to the heat generated in bulk polymerization, can be prevented.

The vinyl chloride-based monomer may be vinyl chloride. The comonomer may be one or more selected from the group consisting of ethylene, propylene, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, acrylonitrile, methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether, acrylic acid, acrylic anhydride, methacrylic acid, methacrylic anhydride, itaconic acid, itaconic anhydride, maleic acid, and maleic anhydride.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the present invention, the &#x201c;number-average molecular weight of a vinyl chloride-based polymer&#x201d; may be 100 to 100,000, preferably 500 to 80,000, and more preferably 1,000 to 50,000.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the present invention, the &#x201c;degree of polymerization of a vinyl chloride-based polymer&#x201d; may be 200 to 3,500, preferably 500 to 3,000, and more preferably 600 to 2,500.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the present invention, the &#x201c;number-average molecular weight of a vinyl chloride-based polymer&#x201d; may be measured by gel permeation chromatography, and the &#x201c;degree of polymerization of a vinyl chloride-based polymer&#x201d; may be measured by specific viscosity measurement.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the present invention, the &#x201c;weight-average molecular weight of polyvinylpyrrolidone may be measured by gel permeation chromatography.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the term &#x201c;initiator&#x201d; may refer to a polymerization initiator. The initiator may be one or more selected from the group consisting of dicumyl peroxide, dipentyl peroxide, di(3,5,5-trimethylhexanoyl)peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, di-sec-butyl peroxydicarbonate, di(2-ethylhexyl) peroxydicarbonate, t-butyl peroxy neodecanoate, t-butyl peroxy neoheptanoate, t-amyl peroxy neodecanoate, cumyl peroxy neodecanoate, cumyl peroxy neoheptanoate, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl peroxy neodecanoate, azobis-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile, potassium persulfate, and ammonium persulfate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">1. Vinyl Chloride-Based Polymer Composite Preparation Method 1</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A method of preparing a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite according to an embodiment of the present invention comprise: bulk-polymerizing vinyl chloride-based monomers to prepare a vinyl chloride-based polymer; and preparing a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite including the vinyl chloride-based polymer and polyvinylpyrrolidone.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The polyvinylpyrrolidone is a stabilizer and may serve to protect the vinyl chloride-based polymer from an external factor, specifically, heat. As a result, the thermal stability of the vinyl chloride-based polymer composite may be substantially improved. Also, the polyvinylpyrrolidone is able to control the size and degree of dispersion of vinyl chloride-based polymer particles, and thus the transparency and color characteristics of the vinyl chloride-based polymer composite may be substantially improved.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Therefore, when a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite including the vinyl chloride-based polymer and polyvinylpyrrolidone is prepared after the completion of polymerization, the vinyl chloride-based polymer composite may be prevented from being thermally damaged in a post-treatment process. Also, high-pressure input equipment for inputting polyvinylpyrrolidone may be unnecessary.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The vinyl chloride-based polymer composite may include the polyvinylpyrrolidone in a state of being adsorbed onto the vinyl chloride-based polymer. In this case, the adsorption may refer to physical adsorption by Van der Waals fierce.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The polyvinylpyrrolidone may have a weight-average molecular weight of 6,000 to 2,000,000 g/mol, and preferably, 10,000 to 1,700,000 g/mol. When the above-described condition is satisfied, the thermal stability and transparency of the vinyl chloride-based polymer composite can be improved, and viscosity that enables uniform dispersion in the vinyl chloride-based polymer composite can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Meanwhile, the polyvinylpyrrolidone used in the present invention differs from polyvinylpyrrolidone used as a dispersant in typical suspension polymerization and microsuspension polymerization of a vinyl chloride-based polymer. Since polyvinylpyrrolidone used in typical suspension polymerization and microsuspension polymerization is added before the initiation of polymerization or at the beginning of polymerization to aid the formation of a droplet in a reaction mixture including vinyl chloride-based monomers, it serves to increase the dispersibility of vinyl chloride-based monomers and initial vinyl chloride-based polymer particles in a polymerization solvent. Accordingly, the size and porosity of the prepared polymer particles, particularly, initial polymer particles, are controlled to prevent the formation of coarse polymer particles, and thus the properties of the polymer, such as viscosity, processability, and the like, are prevented from being degraded.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, the polyvinylpyrrolidone used in the present invention differs from polyvinylpyrrolidone used in seeded emulsion polymerization and pure emulsion polymerization of a vinyl chloride-based polymer. Since polyvinylpyrrolidone used in seeded emulsion polymerization and pure emulsion polymerization is used as an emulsifier, it serves to increase the dispersibility of vinyl chloride-based monomer droplets.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above, the polyvinylpyrrolidone added in typical suspension polymerization, microsuspension polymerization, seeded emulsion polymerization, and pure emulsion polymerization is intended to increase the dispersibility of vinyl chloride-based monomers and initial vinyl chloride-based polymer particles in a polymerization solvent, and the polyvinylpyrrolidone added in bulk polymerization according to an embodiment of the present invention is intended to protect a vinyl chloride-based polymer from heat applied after the completion of polymerization, specifically, heat applied in the post-treatment process performed after the recovery of unreacted monomers, so the uses thereof are different.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The vinyl chloride-based polymer composite may include the polyvinylpyrrolidone in an amount of 0.003 to 0.5 parts by weight, and preferably, 0.005 to 0.5 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride-based monomers. When the above-described range is satisfied, a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite whose thermal stability, color characteristics, and transparency are excellent can be prepared.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The polyvinylpyrrolidone may be in the state of a solution where it is mixed with an aqueous solvent. When the polyvinylpyrrolidone in a solution state is included in the vinyl chloride-based polymer composite, more uniform dispersion may be made, and thus the thermal stability, transparency, and color characteristics of the vinyl chloride-based polymer can be improved. Also, for more uniform dispersion, a stirring process may be performed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The content of the polyvinylpyrrolidone in a solution may be 1 to 10 wt %, preferably 1 to 7 wt %, and more preferably 3 to 5 wt %.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Meanwhile, the preparation of a vinyl chloride-based polymer may be performed by bulk-polymerizing the vinyl chloride-based monomers and then recovering unreacted vinyl chloride-based monomers. Specifically, the preparation of a vinyl chloride-based polymer may be performed by hulk-polymerizing vinyl chloride-based monomers to prepare particle nuclei; and bulk-polymerizing vinyl chloride-based monomers in the presence of the particle nuclei and then recovering unreacted vinyl chloride-based monomers. As described above, when particle nuclei are first prepared, the preparation yield of a vinyl chloride-based polymer may be substantially improved. Also, when a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite is prepared after the recovery of unreacted vinyl chloride-based monomers, polyvinylpyrrolidone may be adsorbed onto a vinyl chloride-based polymer rather than a vinyl chloride-based monomer, and thus the effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone may be maximized, and the loss of polyvinylpyrrolidone may be minimized.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Meanwhile, the bulk polymerization may be performed in the presence of an initiator.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">2. Vinyl Chloride-Based Polymer Composite Preparation Method 2</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A method of preparing a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite according to another embodiment of the present invention includes bulk-polymerizing vinyl chloride-based monomers in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the bulk polymerization is performed in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone, damage to a vinyl chloride-based polymer, which occurs due to the heat generated during the bulk polymerization may be prevented. Also, the polyvinylpyrrolidone may suppress side reactions of an initiator. Therefore, the coloration of a vinyl chloride-based polymer, which is caused by the side reactions of an initiator, is minimized, and thus the transparency and color characteristics of the vinyl chloride-based polymer composite may be substantially improved. Further, since the polyvinylpyrrolidone is a water-soluble material, it is not compatible with the vinyl chloride-based monomer and an oil-soluble initiator and thus does not act as a factor that hinders bulk polymerization,</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described in &#x201c;1. Vinyl chloride-based polymer composite preparation method 1&#x201d;, the polyvinylpyrrolidone added in typical suspension polymerization, microsuspension polymerization, seeded emulsion polymerization, and pure emulsion polymerization is intended to increase the dispersibility of vinyl chloride-based monomers and initial vinyl chloride-based polymer particles in a polymerization solvent, and the polyvinylpyrrolidone added in bulk polymerization according to another embodiment of the present invention is intended to protect a vinyl chloride-based polymer from heat applied in an exothermic phenomenon whose control is difficult as polymerization proceeds without a polymerization solvent, so the uses thereof are different.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The polyvinylpyrrolidone may be present in an amount of 0.003 to 0.5 parts by weight, and preferably, 0.005 to 0.5 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the vinyl chloride-based monomers. When the above-described range is satisfied, the thermal stability, color characteristics, and transparency of the vinyl chloride-based polymer composite can be improved.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Meanwhile, the bulk polymerization may comprise: bulk-polymerizing, the vinyl chloride-based monomers in the presence of the polyvinylpyrrolidone to prepare particle nuclei; and bulk-polymerizing the vinyl chloride-based monomers in the presence of the particle nuclei to prepare a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite. When the above-described condition is satisfied, polyvinylpyrrolidone is uniformly dispersed in the vinyl chloride-based monomers, and thus the thermal stability of particle nuclei can be improved.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, the bulk polymerization may comprise: bulk-polymerizing the vinyl chloride-based monomers to prepare particle nuclei; and bulk-polymerizing the vinyl chloride-based monomers in the presence of the particle nuclei and polyvinylpyrrolidone to prepare a vinyl chloride-based polymer composite. When the above-described condition is satisfied, high-pressure input equipment for inputting polyvinylpyrrolidone can be unnecessary, and most of the input polyvinylpyrrolidone can be utilized to improve the thermal stability and transparency of the vinyl chloride-based polymer composite.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The bulk polymerization may be performed in the presence of an initiator.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">3.
