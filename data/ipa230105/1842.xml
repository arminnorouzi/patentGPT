These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and that logical structural, mechanical, electrical, and chemical changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. To avoid detail not necessary to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, the description may omit certain information known to those skilled in the art. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the claims. Unless otherwise indicated, as used throughout this document, &#x201c;or&#x201d; does not require mutual exclusivity.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">This disclosure generally involves chain use and storage issues on flatbed and other trailers and the dragging of chains from other vehicles. The systems presented herein protect chains from theft and loss while keeping them conveniently located on the trailer at all times. Some possible advantages are mentioned below.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The disclosed systems provide for storage, point-of-pull securement, and ease of deployment of chains used in securing equipment onto trailers. Rather than the typical front of trailer box storage of chains, the systems create secure storage of each chain at flush level with the trailer to allow for storage, point of pull, and no impediment in trailer use. The flush surface tie-down chain anchors and storage units maybe designed of heavy steel that may be driven over by equipment. The below deck storage portion of some embodiments secures chains in place while allowing ease of deployment through a hinged lid. The point of pull slotted top allows securing loads with only the amount of chain needed at any given time while the remaining chain remains securely stored below deck.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments of the disclosed systems create strong holding, securement and point of pull notching for chains on a flatbed trailer. By having chain boxes secured beneath the deck of the trailer in strategic placement, chains always remain onboard the trailer and are no longer lost or stolen. Further, the flush lid allows for movement of equipment on and off the trailer with no obstruction. The point of pull top allows the operator to withdraw only the amount of chain needed and the rest to remain securely stowed below the deck of the trailer. While &#x201c;chain&#x201d; is used throughout, one should understand that a cable, strap, ratchet, or other securing line may be used in an analogous fashion.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to the figures and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an illustrative embodiment of a tie-down chain anchor and storage system <b>100</b> for a flatbed trailer <b>104</b> is presented. The flatbed trailer <b>104</b> includes a flat top surface <b>108</b> on which equipment <b>112</b>, such as the vehicle <b>116</b>, may be positioned for transport. The equipment <b>112</b> often needs to be secured to the flatbed trailer <b>104</b> using chains. In this example, there are two tie-down chain anchor and storage systems <b>100</b> coupled to the front end <b>120</b> of the flatbed trailer <b>104</b> on the right and on the left. There may be four (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) or other numbers in some embodiments. Note that while flatbed trailers are referenced herein, it should be understood that other types of flat surfaces requiring chain securement may be the subject in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The left (perspective of driver's position) tie-down chain anchor and storage system <b>100</b> has a first chain <b>124</b> releasably secured thereto. The first chain <b>124</b> is also secured to the equipment <b>112</b> at the other end of the chain <b>124</b>. Likewise, the right tie-down chain anchor and storage system <b>100</b> has a second chain <b>128</b> that is releasably secured to the tie-down chain anchor and storage system <b>100</b> at one end and to the equipment <b>112</b> at the other end of the second chain <b>128</b>. Additional tie-down chain anchor and storage system <b>100</b> may be included on the flatbed trailer <b>104</b> such as at the rear <b>130</b> of the flatbed trailer <b>104</b> (again see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) or at midsection or other locations. Unused chain, e.g., of chain <b>124</b>, is stored in a container <b>132</b> in a below deck configuration. Below deck references being completely or substantially below the flat surface <b>108</b> of the trailer <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The tie-down chain anchor and storage system <b>100</b> has the container <b>132</b> having a flat top surface <b>136</b> and an interior compartment (<b>196</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and a top opening <b>140</b>, which is covered by a lid <b>144</b>. Typically, the flat top surface <b>136</b> is substantially (i.e., within a half inch) flush with the flat top surface <b>108</b> of the flatbed trailer <b>104</b>. This allows the equipment <b>112</b> or other items to move over both surfaces <b>108</b>, <b>136</b> without hinderance or issue.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the lid <b>144</b> or a portion of the flat top surface <b>136</b> is formed with one or more chain slots <b>146</b> (or point of pull slots), e.g., a first chain slot <b>148</b>, a second chain slot <b>152</b>, and a third chain slot <b>156</b>. The first chain slot <b>148</b> (and others if included) is formed on the top surface <b>136</b> at an inboard location on a periphery <b>158</b> of the top opening <b>140</b> and proximate to the lid <b>144</b>. In some embodiments, the first chain slot <b>148</b> is angled towards the rear <b>130</b> of the trailer. The first chain slot <b>148</b> of the left tie-down chain anchor and storage system <b>100</b> is sized and configured to secure a chain link of the first chain <b>124</b> when inserted and tension applied. Some embodiments may include the second chain slot <b>152</b>, which is substantially orthogonal to an edge of the top opening <b>140</b> of the container <b>132</b>. In some embodiments, the lid <b>144</b> may be coupled to the container <b>132</b> by one or more hinges <b>160</b> or releasable fasteners or other means.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The container <b>132</b> may take different shapes, but in the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is shown as having a rectangular plan view. Other shapes, e.g., circular, could be used in some embodiments. The container <b>132</b> may be coupled to the flatbed trailer <b>104</b> by welding or fasteners, e.g., screws, bolts, latches, etc. The container <b>132</b> holds chains waiting for use and any unused chain where they can be easily retrieved. As referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the chain may be locked in place.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the illustrative embodiment of the tie-down chain anchor and storage system <b>100</b> is shown in an exploded perspective view. In this illustrative embodiment, the tie-down chain anchor and storage system <b>100</b> is formed with an upper portion <b>164</b> and a lower portion <b>168</b>. The upper portion <b>164</b> and lower portion <b>168</b> may be mated and coupled by welding or fasteners, e.g., bolts, screws, latches, etc. In one illustrative embodiment, the upper portion <b>164</b> has a longitudinal length <b>170</b> of 20 inches and a lateral width <b>174</b> of 8 inches and a depth <b>178</b> of 3.5 inches. In the same illustrative embodiment, the lower portion <b>168</b> has a longitudinal length <b>184</b> of 19.75 and a lateral width <b>188</b> of 7.75, and a depth <b>192</b> of 5, 7, or 9 inches. The first chain slot <b>148</b> has a length <b>194</b> of 2 inches. Those skilled in the art will understand that the dimensions may be varied for different applications and trailer sizes and other examples will be given further below. The mated upper or top portion <b>164</b> and bottom or lower portion <b>168</b> together form the container <b>132</b> with an interior compartment <b>196</b>.
