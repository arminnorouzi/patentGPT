For example, LiDAR and/or camera sensors on a rooftop of a vehicle need to be connected to tolerate a single-point failure, and also should be connected in a manner to reduce an amount of wiring needed. Using a daisy chain network may effectively and efficiently maintain communications between sensors. Even if a single-point failure were to occur in a daisy chain network, sensors would still be able to communicate with one another. A daisy chain network improves robustness of a sensor communication network compared to conventional star topology networks.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example vehicle such as an autonomous vehicle <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. A vehicle <b>100</b> generally refers to a category of vehicles that are capable of sensing and driving in a surrounding by itself. The vehicle <b>100</b> can include myriad sensors (camera, LiDAR, radar systems, GPS, sonar, ultrasonic, IMU (inertial measurement unit), accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and FIR (far infrared) sensors) to detect and identify objects in the surrounding. For example, the LiDAR sensors can generate a three-dimensional map of the environment. The LiDAR sensors can also detect objects in the environment. In another example, the radar systems can determine distances and speeds of objects around the vehicle <b>100</b>, and may be configured for adaptive cruise control and/or accident avoidance and blind spot detection. In another example, the cameras can capture and process image data to detect and identify objects, such as road signs, as well as deciphering content of the objects, such as speed limit posted on the road signs. Such objects may include, but not limited to, pedestrians, road signs, traffic lights, and/or other vehicles, for example. The vehicle <b>100</b> can also include myriad actuators to propel and navigate the vehicle <b>100</b> in the surrounding. Such actuators may include, for example, any suitable electro-mechanical devices or systems to control a throttle response, a braking action, a steering action, etc. In some embodiments, the vehicle <b>100</b> can recognize, interpret, and analyze road signs (e.g., speed limit, school zone, construction zone, etc.) and traffic lights (e.g., red light, yellow light, green light, flashing red light, etc.). For example, the vehicle <b>100</b> can adjust vehicle speed based on speed limit signs posted on roadways. In some embodiments, the vehicle <b>100</b> can determine and adjust speed at which the vehicle <b>100</b> is traveling in relation to other objects in the surroundings. For example, the vehicle <b>100</b> can maintain a constant, safe distance from a vehicle ahead (e.g., adaptive cruise control). In this example, the vehicle <b>100</b> maintains this safe distance by constantly adjusting its vehicle speed to that of the vehicle ahead.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, the vehicle <b>100</b> may navigate through roads, streets, and/or terrain with limited or no human input. The word &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d; or &#x201c;vehicles&#x201d; as used in this paper includes vehicles that travel on ground (e.g., cars, trucks, bus, etc.), but may also include vehicles that travel in air (e.g., drones, airplanes, helicopters, etc.), vehicles that travel on water (e.g., boats, submarines, etc.). Further, &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d; or &#x201c;vehicles&#x201d; discussed in this paper may or may not accommodate one or more passengers therein. Moreover, phrases &#x201c;autonomous vehicles,&#x201d; &#x201c;driverless vehicles,&#x201d; or any other vehicles that do not require active human involvement can be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In general, the vehicle <b>100</b> can effectuate any control to itself that a human driver can on a conventional vehicle. For example, the vehicle <b>100</b> can accelerate, brake, turn left or right, or drive in a reverse direction just as a human driver can on the conventional vehicle. The vehicle <b>100</b> can also sense environmental conditions, gauge spatial relationships (e.g., distances between objects and itself), detect and analyze road signs just as the human driver. Moreover, the vehicle <b>100</b> can perform more complex operations, such as parallel parking, parking in a crowded parking lot, collision avoidance, etc., without any human input.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In various embodiments, the vehicle <b>100</b> may include a rooftop <b>101</b>, camera sensors <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b>, and LiDAR sensor <b>108</b>, disposed on the rooftop <b>101</b>.

The controller <b>650</b> may acquire and process data from the sensors <b>610</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>630</b>, and <b>640</b>. For example, the controller <b>650</b> may adjust for a time delay of transmission of the sensors <b>610</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>630</b>, and <b>640</b>. The controller <b>650</b> may control operations of a vehicle such as vehicle <b>100</b>, using data from the sensors <b>610</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>630</b>, and <b>640</b>. For example, the controller <b>650</b> may perform operations on a vehicle such as changing a speed, turning, or changing lanes. Because data transmission is bidirectional, the controller <b>650</b> does not need to reverse a direction of data transmission in an event of a fault because a data packet would be received by a reverse communication path. Thus, a controller (such as controller <b>650</b>) may determine whether or not to reverse a direction of data transmission in response to a fault based on whether the data transmission is unidirectional or bidirectional, and take such action. For example, if the data transmission is unidirectional, the controller <b>650</b> determines to reverse the direction of data transmission. If the data transmission is bidirectional, the controller <b>650</b> determines not to reverse the direction of data transmission. In an event of a fault, data packets may be sent from one or more sensors neighboring a location of the fault. The one or more sensors neighboring a location of the fault may be set as trigger points (for example, points at which data transmission start) for data transmission. The controller <b>650</b> may arbitrate depending on a failure mode of the network <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Data packets from the sensors <b>610</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>630</b>, and <b>640</b> may be transmitted from each of the sensors <b>610</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>630</b>, and <b>640</b>, through the daisy chain network <b>600</b>, to the controller <b>650</b>. Initially, only a single sensor (e.g., sensor <b>610</b>) may be set as a trigger point to commence data transmission. At a location of each sensor <b>610</b>, <b>620</b>, <b>630</b>, and <b>640</b>, an additional data packet may be appended. Each data packet may include a timestamp. Data transmission may be bidirectional. Data packet A may be transmitted from the sensor <b>610</b> through the wire <b>615</b> to the sensor <b>620</b>. At the same time, data packet A may also be transmitted from the sensor <b>610</b> through the wire <b>646</b> to the sensor <b>640</b>. The controller <b>650</b> may receive each packet of data twice, but at different times. The controller <b>650</b> may discard a packet of data that has previously been received.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A scheme of bidirectional data transmission provided by the daisy chain network <b>600</b> in one embodiment is shown in Table 1. At time t1, a data packet A may be transmitted from the sensor <b>610</b> to the sensor <b>620</b>, and also from the sensor <b>610</b> to the sensor <b>640</b> in an opposite direction. &#x201c;A1&#x201d; denotes that a data packet A is transmitted at time t1. At time t2, a data packet A1B2 (A appended with B) may be transmitted from the sensor <b>620</b> to the sensor <b>630</b>, and at the same time from the sensor <b>620</b> to the sensor <b>610</b>. At time t2, a data packet A1D2 may be transmitted from the sensor <b>640</b> to the sensor <b>630</b>, and at the same time from the sensor <b>640</b> to the sensor <b>610</b>. At time t3, data packets A1D2A3 and A1B2A3 may be transmitted from the sensor <b>610</b> to the sensor <b>620</b>, and from the sensor <b>610</b> to the sensor <b>640</b>. At time t3, data packets A1D2C3 and A1B2C3 may be transmitted from the sensor <b>630</b> to the sensor <b>640</b>, and from the sensor <b>630</b> to the sensor <b>620</b>. The controller <b>650</b> may coordinate or schedule a time and location for offloading of data packets to the controller. For example, the controller <b>650</b> may schedule the offloading of data packets after every three data transmission cycles (for example, after time t3) from the sensor <b>640</b>, and/or after every four data transmission cycles from the sensor <b>610</b>. For example, after time t3, data packets A1D2A3, A1B2A3, A1D2C3, and A1B2C3 would be offloaded to the controller <b>650</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Transmission</entry><entry>Transmission</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Start </entry><entry>End</entry><entry>Data Packets</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Time</entry><entry>Point</entry><entry>Point</entry><entry>Transmitted</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>t1</entry><entry>610</entry><entry>620</entry><entry>A1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>t1</entry><entry>610</entry><entry>640</entry><entry>A1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>t2</entry><entry>620</entry><entry>630</entry><entry>A1B2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>t2</entry><entry>620</entry><entry>610</entry><entry>A1B2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>t2</entry><entry>640</entry><entry>630</entry><entry>A1D2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>t2</entry><entry>640</entry><entry>610</entry><entry>A1D2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>t3</entry><entry>610</entry><entry>620</entry><entry>A1D2A3; A1B2A3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>t3</entry><entry>610</entry><entry>640</entry><entry>A1D2A3; A1B2A3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>t3</entry><entry>630</entry><entry>640</entry><entry>A1D2C3; A1B2C3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>t3</entry><entry>630</entry><entry>620</entry><entry>A1D2C3; A1B2C3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">The controller <b>650</b> may adjust data packets received based on timestamps of each of the data packet that indicate a transmission delay time of each of the data packets, to take into account different time delays of each of the data packets.

Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory <b>606</b>. Common forms of non-transitory media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, solid state drive, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic data storage medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical data storage medium, any physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, NVRAM, any other memory chip or cartridge, and networked versions of the same.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">Non-transitory media is distinct from but may be used in conjunction with transmission media.

All such modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of this disclosure. The foregoing description details certain embodiments of the invention. It will be appreciated, however, that no matter how detailed the foregoing appears in text, the invention can be practiced in many ways. As is also stated above, it should be noted that the use of particular terminology when describing certain features or aspects of the invention should not be taken to imply that the terminology is being re-defined herein to be restricted to including any specific characteristics of the features or aspects of the invention with which that terminology is associated. The scope of the invention should therefore be construed in accordance with the appended claims and any equivalents thereof.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">Engines, Components, and Logic</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components, engines, or mechanisms. Engines may constitute either software engines (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium) or hardware engines. A &#x201c;hardware engine&#x201d; is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner. In various example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone computer system, a client computer system, or a server computer system) or one or more hardware engines of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware engine that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">In some embodiments, a hardware engine may be implemented mechanically, electronically, or any suitable combination thereof. For example, a hardware engine may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. For example, a hardware engine may be a special-purpose processor, such as a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). A hardware engine may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example, a hardware engine may include software executed by a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor. Once configured by such software, hardware engines become specific machines (or specific components of a machine) uniquely tailored to perform the configured functions and are no longer general-purpose processors. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware engine mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0098">Accordingly, the phrase &#x201c;hardware engine&#x201d; should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein, &#x201c;hardware-implemented engine&#x201d; refers to a hardware engine. Considering embodiments in which hardware engines are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware engines need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where a hardware engine comprises a general-purpose processor configured by software to become a special-purpose processor, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special-purpose processors (e.g., comprising different hardware engines) at different times. Software accordingly configures a particular processor or processors, for example, to constitute a particular hardware engine at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware engine at a different instance of time.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0099">Hardware engines can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware engines. Accordingly, the described hardware engines may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware engines exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) between or among two or more of the hardware engines. In embodiments in which multiple hardware engines are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware engines may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware engines have access. For example, one hardware engine may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware engine may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware engines may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented engines that operate to perform one or more operations or functions described herein. As used herein, &#x201c;processor-implemented engine&#x201d; refers to a hardware engine implemented using one or more processors.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented, with a particular processor or processors being an example of hardware. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented engines. Moreover, the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a &#x201c;cloud computing&#x201d; environment or as a &#x201c;software as a service&#x201d; (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), with these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., an Application Program Interface (API)).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0102">The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processors or processor-implemented engines may be located in a single geographic location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or a server farm). In other example embodiments, the processors or processor-implemented engines may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">Language</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">Throughout this specification, plural instances may implement components, operations, or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently, and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">Although an overview of the subject matter has been described with reference to specific example embodiments, various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader scope of embodiments of the present disclosure.
