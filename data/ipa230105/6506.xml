For example, a rotating shaft of a rotary electric machine is supported by a main bearing and an auxiliary bearing. The auxiliary bearing is filled with conductive grease. As a result, an electric charge when a shaft voltage of the rotating shaft is about to increase flows to an outer frame by the conductive grease of the auxiliary bearing, and does not flow to the main bearing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, when foreign matter adheres to the bearing as described above, there is a possibility that the electric charge hardly flows to a housing such as the outer frame. For example, in an in-vehicle motor, a lubricating oil, a refrigerant for cooling a motor portion, and the like circulate. There is a possibility that these are mixed with a lubricant to increase electric resistance of the lubricant when adhering to the above-described bearing having the lubricant. Therefore, there is a possibility that it is difficult to maintain favorable electrical conduction between the shaft and the housing.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An exemplary drive device of the present invention includes a shaft, a rotor, a stator, a first bearing, a housing, and a second bearing. The shaft extends in an axial direction along a rotation axis. The rotor is fixed to the shaft and is rotatable about the rotation axis. The stator radially faces the rotor with a gap interposed therebetween. The first bearing rotatably supports the shaft and is lubricated by a fluid. The housing includes a first bearing holder that holds the first bearing, and accommodates the rotor and the stator. The second bearing is arranged between the shaft and the housing, rotatably supports the shaft, and is lubricated by a lubricant having a higher electrical conductivity than the fluid. The second bearing is arranged in a space isolated from the first bearing holder.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An exemplary vehicle of the present invention includes the drive device described above.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above and other elements, features, steps, characteristics and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a configuration example of a drive device;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of a shaft neutralizing structure of the drive device according to an preferred embodiment;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of a vehicle having the drive device mounted thereon;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of a shaft neutralizing structure of a drive device according to a first modification;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating another example of the shaft neutralizing structure of the drive device according to the first modification; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of a shaft neutralizing structure of a drive device according to a second modification.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Hereinafter, an exemplary preferred embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the present specification, a direction parallel to a rotation axis J<b>1</b> of a motor portion <b>2</b> is referred to as an &#x201c;axial direction&#x201d; of a drive device <b>100</b>. In the axial direction, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a motor portion <b>2</b> side is defined as one axial side D<b>1</b>, and a gear portion <b>3</b> side is defined as the other axial side D<b>2</b>. In addition, a radial direction orthogonal to a predetermined axis, such as the rotation axis J<b>1</b>, is simply referred to as a &#x201c;radial direction&#x201d;, and a circumferential direction around the predetermined axis, such as the rotation axis J<b>1</b>, is simply referred to as a &#x201c;circumferential direction&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the present specification, in the positional relationship between any one of orientations, lines, and surfaces and another one, the term &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; means not only a state where both never cross each other no matter how long they extend, but also a state where both are substantially parallel. In addition, the term &#x201c;perpendicular&#x201d; includes not only a state where both intersect each other at 90 degrees, but also a state where both are substantially perpendicular. That is, the terms &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; and &#x201c;perpendicular&#x201d; each include a state where the positional relationship between both permits an angular deviation to a degree that does not depart from the gist of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the present specification, the term &#x201c;extending&#x201d; in a predetermined direction includes a configuration in which an extending direction is substantially the predetermined direction in addition to a configuration in which the extending direction is strictly the predetermined direction. That is, the term &#x201c;extending&#x201d; in the predetermined direction includes a configuration in which there is a directional deviation from the predetermined direction to an extent that does not depart from the gist of the present invention.

The drive device <b>100</b> is used as the power source of the above-described vehicle <b>300</b>. The vehicle <b>300</b> has the drive device <b>100</b>. Since the drive device <b>100</b> is installed, the drive device <b>100</b> of the vehicle <b>300</b> including a neutralizing mechanism between a shaft <b>1</b> and a housing <b>4</b> can be downsized. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the drive device <b>100</b> drives front wheels of the vehicle <b>300</b>. Note that, the drive device <b>100</b> may drive at least any of the wheels. In addition, the vehicle <b>300</b> further includes a battery <b>200</b>. The battery <b>200</b> stores electric power to be supplied to the drive device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the drive device <b>100</b> includes the shaft <b>1</b>, the motor portion <b>2</b>, the gear portion <b>3</b>, the housing <b>4</b>, a liquid circulation portion <b>5</b>, a conductive bearing <b>6</b>, a rotation detector <b>7</b>, a first seal member <b>81</b>, and a second seal member <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The shaft <b>1</b> axially extends along the rotation axis J<b>1</b>. As described above, the drive device <b>100</b> includes the shaft <b>1</b>. The shaft <b>1</b> is rotatable about the rotation axis J<b>1</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the shaft <b>1</b> is rotatably supported by the housing <b>4</b> via a first motor bearing <b>4211</b>, a second motor bearing <b>4221</b>, a third motor bearing <b>4311</b>, and a fourth motor bearing <b>4611</b> to be described later. That is, the drive device <b>100</b> includes these bearings <b>4211</b>, <b>4221</b>, <b>4311</b>, and <b>4611</b>. These bearings <b>4211</b>, <b>4221</b>, <b>4311</b>, and <b>4611</b> rotatably support the shaft <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The shaft <b>1</b> has a tubular shape extending in the axial direction. A fluid F flows inside the shaft <b>1</b>. The drive device <b>100</b> further includes this fluid F. Note that the fluid F is a lubricant that lubricates the gear portion <b>3</b> and the bearings of the drive device <b>100</b>, and is, for example, an automatic transmission fluid (ATF) in the present preferred embodiment. In addition, the fluid F is used as a refrigerant for cooling the motor portion <b>2</b> and the like. As the shaft <b>1</b> rotates, the fluid F flowing inside the shaft <b>1</b> can be supplied to the motor portion <b>2</b>, the first motor bearing <b>4211</b>, the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>, and the like through a first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> to be described later. Therefore, a stator <b>22</b> (particularly, a coil end <b>2221</b> to be described later), the above-described bearings <b>4211</b> and <b>4311</b>, and the like can be cooled by the fluid F.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Note that the shaft <b>1</b> may be dividable, for example, at an intermediate portion in the axial direction. When the shaft <b>1</b> is dividable, the divided shafts <b>1</b> are connected by spline fitting, for example. Alternatively, the divided shafts <b>1</b> may be connected by screw coupling using a male screw and a female screw, or may be joined by a fixing method such as press-fitting and welding. When the fixing method such as press-fitting or welding is adopted, serrations combining recesses and protrusions extending in the axial direction may be adopted. With such a configuration, it is possible to reliably transmit the rotation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The shaft <b>1</b> includes a shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> having a tubular shape surrounding the rotation axis J<b>1</b>. The shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> has a tubular shape and extends in the axial direction along the rotation axis J<b>1</b>. The shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> is rotatably supported by the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>. In addition, the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> is also rotatably supported by the first motor bearing <b>4211</b>, the second motor bearing <b>4221</b>, the fourth motor bearing <b>4611</b>, and the conductive bearing <b>6</b>. The shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> has conductivity, and is made of metal in the present preferred embodiment. In addition, the shaft <b>1</b> includes a hollow portion <b>12</b> and an inlet <b>111</b>. The hollow portion <b>12</b> is a space surrounded by an inner peripheral surface of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>, and is arranged inside the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. The inlet <b>111</b> is the other axial end portion of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> having the tubular shape, and is connected to a flow passage <b>465</b> of a gear lid <b>46</b> to be described later. The fluid F flows from the flow passage <b>465</b> into the hollow portion <b>12</b> through the inlet <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Next, the shaft <b>1</b> further includes a shaft wall <b>13</b>. The shaft wall <b>13</b> is arranged inside the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> and expands in the radial direction. The shaft wall <b>13</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. In addition, the other axial end portion of the shaft wall <b>13</b> is arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> of the rotation detector <b>7</b> in the present preferred embodiment. A radially outer end portion of the shaft wall <b>13</b> is connected to an inner surface of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. Preferably, the shaft wall <b>13</b> is integrated with the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. For example, the shaft wall <b>13</b> and the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> are mutually different parts of the same member in the present preferred embodiment. Since the shaft wall <b>13</b> is integrated with the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>, the shaft <b>1</b> can be easily manufactured. In addition, the number of components of the shaft <b>1</b> can be reduced, and thus, the drive device <b>100</b> is easily assembled. However, the present invention is not limited to this example, and the shaft wall <b>13</b> may be a separate member from the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The shaft wall <b>13</b> forms a shaft recess <b>14</b> together with the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> at one axial end portion of the shaft <b>1</b>. That is, the shaft <b>1</b> includes the shaft recess <b>14</b>. The shaft recess <b>14</b> is recessed from the one axial end portion of the shaft <b>1</b> to the other axial side D<b>2</b>. In the present preferred embodiment, the shaft recess <b>14</b> accommodates at least the other axial side D<b>2</b> of a first columnar portion <b>442</b>. Further, the shaft recess <b>14</b> accommodates the conductive bearing <b>6</b> and the first seal member <b>81</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> is arranged in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. That is, the shaft <b>1</b> further includes the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> penetrating the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> in the radial direction. The number of first shaft through-holes <b>101</b> may be one or plural. When the shaft <b>1</b> rotates, the fluid F in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> flows out from the hollow portion <b>12</b> to the outside of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> through the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> by centrifugal force. In the present preferred embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the other axial end portion of a rotor <b>21</b> and on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to one axial end portion of the rotor <b>21</b>, and is connected to a rotor through-hole <b>2111</b> to be described later. However, the present invention is not limited to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> may be arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the other axial end portion of the rotor <b>21</b> and on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the first motor bearing <b>4211</b>, and may be arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the one axial end portion of the rotor <b>21</b> and on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>. That is, at least a part of the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> may be arranged in at least one of these positions.

The shaft <b>1</b> further includes the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b>. The second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> penetrates the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> in the radial direction. Alternatively, the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> may penetrate the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> in a direction intersecting the radial direction and the axial direction. Note that the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is an example of a &#x201c;shaft through-hole&#x201d; of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The number of second shaft through-holes <b>102</b> may be one or plural. In the latter case, the second shaft through-holes <b>102</b> can be arranged at equal intervals or different intervals in the circumferential direction.

A radially outer end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is connected to a third motor bearing holder <b>431</b>. A radially inner end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the shaft wall <b>13</b> and is connected to the hollow portion <b>12</b>. Here, the fluid F can flow inside the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. The fluid F is also supplied to the third motor bearing <b>4311</b> through the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b>. For example, when the shaft <b>1</b> rotates, the fluid F flowing inside the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> flows into the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> by the centrifugal force. Therefore, for example, even if there is no electric oil pump (EOP), the fluid F can flow out from the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> to the outside of the shaft <b>1</b>. At least a part of the fluid F having flowed out can be supplied to the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Note that the other axial end portion of the shaft wall <b>13</b> is arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to one axial end portion of an opening <b>4312</b> of the third motor bearing holder <b>431</b> to be described later in the present preferred embodiment. Alternatively, the other axial end portion of the shaft wall <b>13</b> may be at the same axial position as the one axial end portion of the opening <b>4312</b>. Then, an interval between the radially inner end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> and the shaft wall <b>13</b> in the axial direction can be further narrowed. Therefore, for example, the fluid F flowing inside the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> toward the one axial side D<b>1</b> easily flows to the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b>, and the fluid F staying between the radially inner end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> and the shaft wall <b>13</b> further decreases. Thus, the fluid F in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> can be more smoothly supplied to the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>. However, the above-described example does not exclude a configuration in which the other axial end portion of the shaft wall <b>13</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the one axial end portion of the opening <b>4312</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The radially outer end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>.

As described above, the radially outer end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is connected to the inside of the third motor bearing holder <b>431</b>. For this reason, the fluid F hardly enters a space <b>403</b> to be described later in which the one axial end portion of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> is arranged as compared with a configuration in which the radially outer end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the one axial end portion of the opening <b>4312</b> (that is, configuration in which the radially outer end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is connected to the outside of the third motor bearing holder <b>431</b>).

The flow passage <b>465</b> is a passage for the fluid F and connects the tray portion <b>464</b> and the inlet <b>111</b> of the shaft <b>1</b>. The fluid F stored in the tray portion <b>464</b> is supplied to the flow passage <b>465</b> and flows into the hollow portion <b>12</b> from the inlet <b>111</b> at the other axial end portion of the shaft <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, the liquid circulation portion <b>5</b> will be described.

The pump <b>52</b> sucks the fluid F stored in a lower region of the gear portion accommodation space <b>402</b>. The pump <b>52</b> is an electric pump, but is not limited thereto.

That is, the fluid F sucked by the pump <b>52</b> passes through the cooler unit <b>53</b> via the pipe <b>51</b> and then is sent to the fluid reservoir <b>54</b>. For example, a refrigerant such as water supplied from the outside is supplied to the cooler unit <b>53</b>. The cooler unit <b>53</b> exchanges heat between the refrigerant and the fluid F to lower the temperature of the fluid F.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The fluid reservoir <b>54</b> is a tray arranged vertically above the stator <b>22</b> inside the motor accommodation space <b>401</b>.

The conductive bearing <b>6</b> is arranged between the shaft <b>1</b> and the housing <b>4</b> and rotatably supports the shaft <b>1</b>. As described above, the drive device <b>100</b> includes the conductive bearing <b>6</b>. The conductive bearing <b>6</b> is an example of a &#x201c;second bearing&#x201d; of the present invention in the present preferred embodiment, and is a ball bearing in the present preferred embodiment.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The conductive bearing <b>6</b> is lubricated by a lubricant <b>61</b> having a higher electrical conductivity than the fluid F. In the present preferred embodiment, conductive grease is used as the lubricant <b>61</b>. In the conductive grease, a conductive material such as copper powder or carbon powder is added to a lubricating oil such as grease. The conductive bearing <b>6</b> can electrically connect the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> and the first columnar portion <b>442</b> by the lubricant <b>61</b>. For example, an inner ring and an outer ring of the ball bearing are electrically connected by the lubricant <b>61</b>, and thus, the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the first columnar portion <b>442</b> of the housing <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The conductive bearing <b>6</b> is arranged in a space isolated from the third motor bearing holder <b>431</b>. In the present preferred embodiment, this space is the shaft recess <b>14</b>. For example, the third motor bearing <b>4311</b> is lubricated by the fluid F having an electrical insulation property such as an automatic transmission fluid (ATF), so that it is possible to electrically insulate the shaft <b>1</b> from the housing <b>4</b> in the third motor bearing <b>4311</b> while securing the lubricity of the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>. For example, when the third motor bearing <b>4311</b> is a ball bearing, an outer ring fixed to one of the shaft <b>1</b> and the housing <b>4</b> can be insulated from an inner ring fixed to the other of the shaft <b>1</b> and the housing <b>4</b>. In addition, the conductive bearing <b>6</b> is arranged between the shaft <b>1</b> and the housing <b>4</b>, and is lubricated by the lubricant <b>61</b> having electrical conductivity. Since the conductive bearing <b>6</b> is arranged in the space (the shaft recess <b>14</b> in the present preferred embodiment) isolated from the third motor bearing holder <b>431</b>, the fluid F for lubricating and cooling the stator <b>22</b>, the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>, and the like is hardly applied to the conductive bearing <b>6</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the fluid F from mixing with the lubricant <b>61</b>, and thus, it is possible to prevent deterioration in the electrical conductivity of the lubricant <b>61</b>. Therefore, the conductive bearing <b>6</b> can favorably maintain the electrical connection between the shaft <b>1</b> and the first columnar portion <b>442</b> of the housing <b>4</b>. Therefore, a current generated by potential fluctuations occurring in the shaft <b>1</b> can be sufficiently discharged to the housing <b>4</b> via the conductive bearing <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The conductive bearing <b>6</b> is arranged to be coaxial with the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>. For example, the both have an annular shape centered on the same axis (that is, the rotation axis J<b>1</b>). Then, the conductive bearing <b>6</b> can rotatably support the shaft <b>1</b> more stably together with the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the present preferred embodiment, the conductive bearing <b>6</b> is fitted to the shaft recess <b>14</b>. For example, a radially outer end portion of the conductive bearing <b>6</b> (for example, the outer ring of the ball bearing) is fitted to and contacts an inner peripheral surface of the shaft recess <b>14</b>. A radially inner end portion of the conductive bearing <b>6</b> (for example, the inner ring of the ball bearing) contacts a radially outer surface of the first columnar portion <b>442</b>. Then, since the conductive bearing <b>6</b> is fitted and held in the shaft recess <b>14</b>, it is unnecessary to secure a space for arranging the conductive bearing <b>6</b> and a bearing holder for holding the conductive bearing <b>6</b> outside the shaft <b>1</b>. Therefore, the drive device <b>100</b> can be downsized. However, the present invention is not limited to this example, and the conductive bearing <b>6</b> may be fixed to the shaft recess <b>14</b> by means (welding, brazing, or the like) other than the above-described fitting structure.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The conductive bearing <b>6</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the shaft wall <b>13</b> inside the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. The second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the shaft wall <b>13</b>. Then, a space through which the fluid F in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> flows can be isolated from the space in which the conductive bearing <b>6</b> is arranged by the shaft wall <b>13</b>. For example, the hollow portion <b>12</b> in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> can be partitioned into a space on the other axial side D<b>2</b> of the shaft wall <b>13</b> in the hollow portion <b>12</b>, and the shaft recess <b>14</b>. The fluid F flows in the former, and the conductive bearing <b>6</b> is arranged in the latter. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the fluid F from being directly applied to the conductive bearing <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The rotation detector <b>7</b> is attached to the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the housing lid <b>43</b>. The rotation detector <b>7</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the third motor bearing holder <b>431</b>, and detects a rotation angle of the shaft <b>1</b>. In the present preferred embodiment, the rotation detector <b>7</b> is a resolver including a resolver rotor and a resolver stator. The rotation detector <b>7</b> includes the resolver rotor (not illustrated) fixed to the shaft <b>1</b> and the resolver stator (not illustrated) fixed to the housing lid <b>43</b> of the housing <b>4</b>. The resolver rotor and the resolver stator have an annular shape. An inner peripheral surface of the resolver stator radially faces an outer peripheral surface of the resolver rotor. The resolver stator periodically detects a rotation angle position of the resolver rotor when the rotor <b>21</b> rotates. As a result, the rotation detector <b>7</b> acquires information on the rotation angle position of the rotor <b>21</b>. Note that the present invention is not limited to the example of the present preferred embodiment, and the rotation detector <b>7</b> is not necessarily the resolver, and may be, for example, a rotary encoder or the like.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The first seal member <b>81</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the conductive bearing <b>6</b> in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>.

Here, for example, mist of the fluid F for lubricating and cooling the respective portions of the drive device <b>100</b> may enter the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> at the one axial end portion of the shaft <b>1</b>. Even if the fluid F enters, the fluid F can be suppressed or prevented from entering from the one axial side D<b>1</b> to the other axial side D<b>2</b> of the first seal member <b>81</b>.
