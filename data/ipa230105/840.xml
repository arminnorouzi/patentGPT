Rifaximin exerts its broad antibacterial activity, for example, in the gastrointestinal tract against localized gastrointestinal bacteria that cause infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, Crohn's disease, and/or pancreatic insufficiency. It has been reported that rifaximin is characterized by a negligible systemic absorption, due to its chemical and physical characteristics (Descombe J. J. et al. Pharmacokinetic study of rifaximin after oral administration in healthy volunteers. <i>Int J Clin Pharmacol Res, </i>14 (2), 51-56, (1994)).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Disclosed herein are methods of preventing, ameliorating and/or treating bowel diseases (BDs).

Thus, polymorphs are distinct solids sharing the same molecular formula, yet each polymorph may have distinct physical properties. Therefore, a single compound may give rise to a variety of polymorphic forms where each form has different and distinct physical properties, such as solubility profiles, melting point temperatures, hygroscopicity, particle shape, density, flowability, compatibility and/or x-ray diffraction peaks. The solubility of each polymorph may vary, thus, identifying the existence of pharmaceutical polymorphs is essential for providing pharmaceuticals with predictable solubility profiles. It is desirable to investigate all solid state forms of a drug, including all polymorphic forms, and to determine the stability, dissolution and flow properties of each polymorphic form. Polymorphic forms of a compound can be distinguished in a laboratory by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy and by other methods such as, infrared spectrometry. For a general review of polymorphs and the pharmaceutical applications of polymorphs see G. M. Wall, Pharm Manuf. 3, 33 (1986); J. K. Haleblian and W. McCrone, J Pharm. Sci., 58, 911 (1969); and J.

One embodiment of the invention is a method of treating bowel disease (BD) with a durability of antibiotic response, by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a rifamycin class antibiotic to a subject in need thereof, selecting subjects who respond to treatment after being treated for between about 1 and about 24 weeks, and removing a responding subject from treatment wherein after removal of treatment there is a durability of response. The selecting may be by a healthcare professional, by self selection or by selection of one in a position to decide or discern symptoms or to diagnose a response to the antibiotic. Removal of treatment comprises, for example, ceasing to administer, ceasing to recommend administration of the antibiotic, and/or advising responding subjects to stop taking the antibiotic.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0153">In one embodiment, the recommendation (e.g., selection) is made on a label of a pharmaceutical product, which indicates that the product should be administered for 14 days (e.g., two weeks). For example, a subject in need of treatment is administered rifaximin 550 mg TID for two weeks and instructed by a label. In one embodiment, the recommendation (e.g., selection) is made on a label of a pharmaceutical product, which indicates that the product should be administered for two weeks. For example, a subject in need of treatment is administered rifaximin 550 mg TID for two weeks as instructed by a label. In one embodiment, selecting is following dosing instructions on a package insert of a pharmaceutical product.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0154">Also described herein are methods for maintenance of remission of bowel disease in a subject comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of rifaximin for at least 25 weeks to a subject in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0155">Yet another aspect of this invention relates to a method of treating a subject (e.g., mammal, human, horse, dog, cat) with rifaximin who is in need thereof. Identifying a subject in need of such treatment can be in the judgment of a subject or a health care professional and can be subjective (e.g., opinion) or objective (e.g., measurable by a test or diagnostic method). Rifaximin may be used in various treatment regimes. These regimes may vary depending upon the subject and the type of treatment.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0156">Rifaximin may be administered, for example, twice a day, three times a day, or four times or more often as necessary per day. Rifaximin may be administered in doses, for example of from about between 25 mg BID to about 3000 mg TID. Another example is administering rifaximin from between about 4.0 g/day to about 7.25 g/day. The rifaximin may be administered, for example, in tablet form, powered form, liquid for or in capsules.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0157">Subjects in need thereof include subjects having or that are susceptible to BD, are in remission from BD, males and/or older subjects with long duration of disease, as disclosed further below.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0158">As used herein, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount effective, when administered to a human or non-human subject, to provide a therapeutic benefit such as an amelioration of symptoms, e.g., an amount effective to decrease the symptoms of IBS, or maintenance of remission of a IBS.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0159">In certain embodiments, the rifaximin is administered to a subject from between about 1 week to about 6 weeks in duration, from between about 8 weeks to about 12 weeks in duration, or from between 1 day to about 7 days. The rifaximin may be administered from between about 1 day and about 1 year, or from 1 week to about 24 weeks. The rifaximin may be administered, for example, for the remainder of a subject's life. The rifaximin may be administered intermittently or continuously during the course of treatment. Length of treatment may vary depending on the type and length of disease and the proper length of treatment may be easily determined by one of skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0160">For any of the embodiments, rifaximin may be administered, for example, once daily, twice daily, three times daily, or four times daily (or more often as necessary for a particular subject) to a subject. In some methods of the present invention comprise administering the rifaximin once daily to the subject because it may, for example, minimize the side effects and increase patient compliance. Also preferred, are twice and three times daily administration of rifaximin.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0161">Dosages, according to certain preferred embodiments, range from between about 50 to about 6000 mg of rifaximin administered daily. For example, a dose of 550 mg may be administered to a subject twice daily. Other appropriate dosages for methods according to this invention may be determined by health care professionals or by the subject. The amount of rifaximin administered daily may be increased or decreased based on the weight, age, health, sex or medical condition of the subject. One of skill in the art would be able to determine the proper dose for a subject based on this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0162">According to certain embodiments, rifaximin may be administered in combination with other compounds, including for example, chemotherapeutic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-pyretic agents radiosensitizing agents, radioprotective agents, urologic agents, anti-emetic agents, and/or anti-diarrheal agents. For example, cisplatin, carboplatin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, flurouracil, capecitabine, gemcitabine, irinotecan, topotecan, etoposide, mitomycin, gefitinib, vincristine, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, celecoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, dexamethasone, prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, acetaminophen, misonidazole, amifostine, tamsulosin, phenazopyridine, ondansetron, granisetron, alosetron, palonosetron, promethazine, prochlorperazine, trimethobenzamide, aprepitant, diphenoxylate with atropine, and/or loperamide.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Risk Selection Methods</heading><p id="p-0173" num="0163">The methods described herein may also further comprise genetically profiling for genetic risk of BD and selecting to treat an at risk subject. For example, an at-risk subject may be determined to be at risk of a bowel disease by genetic screening, family history, lifestyle, travel plans and the like. Genetic screening may, for example, be for genes and expression profiles or epigenetic modifiers shown to affect or predict bowel disease or susceptibility for bowel diseases. Mutations which may be screened for include mutations or polymorphisms in, for example, Nod2, CFTR, or CARD15. Nod2, a gene involved in the immune systems initial response to bacterial infection, significantly increases the risk of Crohn's disease. The CFTR protein resides in the surface of cells lining the digestive system, lungs and sweat glands. In normal cells, it acts as an ion channel that transports chloride into and out of cells. It also controls the regulation of other transport pathways regulating the passage of fluid and bicarbonate across cell membranes. DNA sequence variations (or mutations) alone do not explain CFTR-related gastrointestinal disease patterns; rather, epigenetic modifiers, or changes that leave the gene's sequence of DNA intact, influence CFTR expression.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0164">For example, a subject may be typed for rs6822844 and/or rs2305767 to indicate risk of celiac disease.

That is, formulations may contain only one polymorph or may contain a mixture of more than one polymorph. Polymorph, in this context, refers to any physical form, hydrate, acid, salt or the like of rifaximin. Mixtures may be selected, for example on the basis of desired amounts of systemic adsorption, dissolution profile, desired location in the digestive tract to be treated, and the like. The pharmaceutical composition further comprises excipients, for example, one or more of a diluting agent, binding agent, lubricating agent, disintegrating agent, coloring agent, flavoring agent or sweetening agent. Compositions may be formulated for selected coated and uncoated tablets, hard and soft gelatin capsules, sugar-coated pills, lozenges, wafer sheets, pellets and powders in sealed packet. For example, compositions may be formulated for topical use, for example, ointments, pomades, creams, gels and lotions. In an embodiment, the rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) is administered to the subject using a pharmaceutically-acceptable formulation, e.g., a pharmaceutically-acceptable formulation that provides sustained delivery of the rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) to a subject for at least 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, one week, two weeks, three weeks, or four weeks after the pharmaceutically-acceptable formulation is administered to the subject.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0170">In certain embodiments, these pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for topical or oral administration to a subject. In other embodiments, as described in detail below, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following: (1) oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets, boluses, powders, granules, pastes; (2) parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension; (3) topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment or spray applied to the skin; (4) intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or foam; or (5) aerosol, for example, as an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation or solid particles containing the compound.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0171">The phrase &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; refers to those rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) described herein, compositions containing such compounds, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0172">The phrase &#x201c;pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier&#x201d; includes pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject chemical from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be &#x201c;acceptable&#x201d; in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate buffer solutions; and (21) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0173">Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions. Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0174">Compositions containing a rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, aerosol and/or parenteral administration. The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 1% to about 99% of active ingredient, preferably from about 5% to about 70%, most preferably from about 10% to about 30%.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0175">Liquid dosage forms for oral or rectal administration of the rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) include pharmaceutically-acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0176">In addition to inert diluents, the oral compositions can include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0177">Suspensions, in addition to the active rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0178">Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active agent. Compositions which are suitable for vaginal administration can include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0179">Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) can include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0000">The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin), excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0180">Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin), excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane. The rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) can be alternatively administered by aerosol. This is accomplished, for example, by preparing an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation or solid particles containing the compound. A non-aqueous (e.g., fluorocarbon propellant) suspension could be used. Sonic nebulizers are preferred because they minimize exposing the agent to shear, which can result in degradation of the compound.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0181">Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions can include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0182">These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0183">In some cases, to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to alter the absorption of the drug. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline, salt oramorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug may then depend on its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend on crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. When the rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5 to 90%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0184">Regardless of the route of administration selected, the rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin), which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0185">Actual dosage levels and time course of administration of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. An exemplary dose range is from 25 to 3000 mg per day.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0186">In combination therapy treatment, both the compounds of this invention and the other drug agent(s) are administered to mammals (e.g., humans, male or female) by conventional methods. The agents may be administered in a single dosage form or in separate dosage forms. Effective amounts of the other therapeutic agents are well known to those skilled in the art. However, it is well within the skilled artisan's purview to determine the other therapeutic agent's optimal effective-amount range. In one embodiment of the invention in which another therapeutic agent is administered to an animal, the effective amount of the compound of this invention is less than its effective amount in case the other therapeutic agent is not administered. In another embodiment, the effective amount of the conventional agent is less than its effective amount in case the compound of this invention is not administered. In this way, undesired side effects associated with high doses of either agent may be minimized. Other potential advantages (including without limitation improved dosing regimens and/or reduced drug cost) will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0187">In various embodiments, the therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) are administered less than 5 minutes apart, less than 30 minutes apart, 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour apart, at about 1 to about 2 hours apart, at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart, at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart, at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart, at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart, at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart, at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart, at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart, at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart, at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart, at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart, at about 12 hours to 18 hours apart, 18 hours to 24 hours apart, 24 hours to 36 hours apart, 36 hours to 48 hours apart, 48 hours to 52 hours apart, 52 hours to 60 hours apart, 60 hours to 72 hours apart, 72 hours to 84 hours apart, 84 hours to 96 hours apart, or 96 hours to 120 hours part. In preferred embodiments, two or more therapies are administered within the same patient's visit.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0188">In certain embodiments, one or more of the rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) and one or more other therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents) are cyclically administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first therapy (e.g., a first prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second therapy (e.g., a second prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time, optionally, followed by the administration of a third therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time and so forth, and repeating this sequential administration, i.e., the cycle in order to reduce the development of resistance to one of the therapies, to avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and/or to improve the efficacy of the therapies.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0189">In certain embodiments, the administration of the same compounds may be repeated and the administrations may be separated by at least about 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 2 months, 75 days, 3 months, or at least 6 months. In other embodiments, the administration of the same therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agent) other than a rifamycin class antibiotic (e.g., rifaximin) may be repeated and the administration may be separated by at least at least 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, 2 months, 75 days, 3 months, or at least 6 months. In one embodiment, a label on a rifamycin class antibiotic may instruct, for example, do not repeat more often than every 6 weeks. In another embodiment, a label on a rifamycin class antibiotic may instruct, for example, do not repeat more often than every 3 weeks. In another embodiment, a label on a rifamycin class antibiotic may instruct, for example, do not repeat more often than every 3-12 weeks. Included within ranges given herein for dosage or administration are any value within the range.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0190">In certain embodiments, retreatment is efficacious in combination with the methods disclosed herein. See for example, Rifaximin versus Other Antibiotics in the Primary Treatment and Retreatment of Bacterial Overgrowth in IBS, Janet Yang, Hyo-Rang Lee, Kimberly Low, Soumya Chatterjee, and Mark Pimentel, Dig Dis Sci (2008) 53:169-174. For example, methods as described herein may further comprise determining symptom relief in a subject and administering a second course of rifaximin treatment if symptoms remain unresolved. Methods may also further comprise, for example, determining the gender of a subject and administering the therapeutically effective amount to a male subject.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0191">Certain indications may require longer treatment times. For example, travelers' diarrhea treatment may only last from between about 12 hours to about 72 hours, while a treatment for Crohn's disease may be from between about 1 day to about 3 months and a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy may be from between 1 day and 12 months. For example, HE may require chronic therapy for the remainder of a subject's life. Crohn's disease subjects may also require chronic therapy.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Kits</heading><p id="p-0203" num="0192">Kits are also provided herein, for example, kits for treating a bowel disorder in a subject treating bowel disease (BD) with a durability of antibiotic response; methods of treating bowel disease (BD) in females methods of treating bowel disease (BD) in males; methods of treating bloating due to BD in males; methods of treating bloating due to BD; methods of treating non-white subjects having BD; and/or methods of treating BD in older subjects; methods of treating BD in older subjects with long duration of disease; and/or methods of predicting response to rifaximin treatment for BD. The kits may contain, for example, a polymorph or amorphous form of rifaximin and instructions for use.

Subjects received daily one of BID doses of placebo, rifaximin 275 mg, 550 mg, or 1100 mg for 14 days. A fifth group of subjects received rifaximin 550 mg BID for a period of 28 days. There were two measures of efficacy assessed. Subjects were questioned on the relief of overall IBS symptoms and bloating. Adequate relief of IBS related symptoms (SGA) and IBS-related bloating (IBS-B) were assessed, and a dose of 550 mg BID for 2 weeks demonstrated statistically significant relief. The analyses defined success as a &#x201c;yes&#x201d; response to questions regarding adequate relief.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0201">Predictors of response analyses showed that the response was similar across some subgroups however, there were differences. Analyses on predictors of response demonstrated that age (older subjects and those with a longer IBS duration); sex (males) and baseline severity (mild to moderate symptoms) were predictors of response. All subpopulations in the study responded to therapy. Baseline severity was determined using 7-point Lickert scales during screening for Abdominal Pain/Discomfort and Bloating, and the number, type (normal, hard, loose) and urgency of bowel movements.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0202">Duration of effect was assessed in a follow-up period. Subjects that responded in the 4 week treatment period were followed for an additional 3 months.

The analyses defined success as a &#x201c;yes&#x201d; response to questions regarding adequate relief.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0233">A measure of efficacy is based on subjects' answers to the Weekly Subject Global</p><p id="p-0248" num="0234">Assessment (SGA) questions over the 4 week study duration in relation to their IBS symptoms. The SGA question is asked weekly as follows: &#x201c;In the past 7 days, have you had adequate relief of your 20 IBS symptoms'?&#x201d; (Yes/No.) Subjects in the treatment group taking oral rifaximin respond &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; more often than Subjects who are not taking oral rifaximin. Another measure of efficacy is based on subjects' answers to the Weekly Subject Global Assessment (SGA) question over the 4 week study duration in relation to their IBS symptom of bloating. The SGA question is asked weekly as follows: &#x201c;In the past 7 days, have you had adequate relief of your IBS symptom of bloating'?&#x201d; (Yes/No). Subjects in the treatment group taking oral rifaximin respond &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; more often than subjects who are not taking oral rifaximin.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0235">All subpopulations in the study responded to therapy. Baseline severity was determined during screening for Abdominal Pain/Discomfort and Bloating, and the number, type (normal, hard, loose) and urgency of bowel movements. Duration of effect was assessed in a ten week follow-up period.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Study Demographics</heading><p id="p-0250" num="0236">Subjects enrolled in the study are detailed in Table 13. Demographics of the population are set forth in Tables 14, 15, and 16.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Rifaximin Exposure</heading><p id="p-0251" num="0237">Rifaximin exposure in subjects having IBS is similar to the levels of exposure in healthy subjects and more than 520-fold lower than rifampin exposure, and more than 66-fold lower than neomycin exposure. As previously disclosed by Applicants, the rifaximin exposure in healthy subjects is significantly lower than the level of exposure in subjects having hepatic encephalopathy.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Percentage of Subjects with Adequate Relief of IBS and Bloating Symptoms</heading><p id="p-0252" num="0238">The primary and secondary endpoints evaluated in this study were the effect of treatment on the percentage of subjects who reported adequate relief of IBS and the adequate relief of IBS symptom of bloating. These results are shown in Tables 17, 18, 19 and 20. The data demonstrates that more subjects taking rifaximin had adequate relief of IBS symptoms and of bloating.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0239">To further evaluate the study results, efficacy of rifaximin treatment on subpopulations of study participants was evaluated.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0240">Primary and secondary endpoints were evaluated for male and female populations independently. This analysis indicated that higher percentage of female subjects taking rifaximin had adequate relief of IBS symptoms and the IBS symptom of bloating. See Table 21.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0241">Primary and secondary endpoints were evaluated for subpopulations of study participants based on age. Analysis of subjects less than 65 and those 65 years old and older demonstrated that a higher percentage of subjects 65 years old or older that were administered rifaximin had adequate relief of IBS symptom of bloating. See Table 22.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0242">The efficacy of rifaximin treatment of white and non-white study participants demonstrated that a higher percentage of non-white participants administered rifaximin had adequate relief of IBS symptoms. See Table 23.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0243">The efficacy of rifaximin treatment was also evaluated for subjects having diarrhea-predominant IBS and alternating-predominant IBS. The data indicate that a higher percentage of subjects having alternating-predominant IBS had adequate relief of IBS symptoms and adequate relief of IBS symptom of bloating than subjects with diarrhea-predominant. See Table 24.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0244">The study also evaluated the effect of rifaximin administration on the average number of stools per day from the baseline value for each subject. The data indicate that rifaximin effectively decreased the weekly average of stool frequency by at least one for subjects in the study. In particular, the last four weeks of the study show significant decrease in the stool frequency for subject administered rifaximin when compared to those administered a placebo.

This finding adds several key observations to what is known about the durable effect of rifaximin on IBS. Namely, that daily questioning, which reduces recall bias presumed to be part of the primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrates significant and robust finding. Secondly, these finding correlate significantly with the results of the primary and key secondary, yielding interclass correlations which are very strong indicating construct validity (e.g., daily measures show strong relationship and validated measure of disease activity for IBS, weekly SGA). Thirdly, the daily measures were all highly correlated with each other (correlation coefficient of at least 80%). Taken in totality, the results of the primary, key secondary, daily measures of symptoms, bloating and abdominal pain strongly support the reliability, validity, responsiveness, and utility of these outcomes used as endpoints in the studies suggests that each of these questionnaires validates the results from the other.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0247">In addition, using the primary endpoint to assess effect over the entire 3 months of the trial, adequate relief of global IBS symptoms was superior in rifaximin treated as compared to placebo treated patients in each of the trials respectively.
