Conventionally, shaft seals are provided with at least a seal lip pressing against the propeller shaft for ensuring a sufficient seal. Typically, such seal lips are shaped so that environmental hydrostatic pressure exerts a radial force on the seal lip such that it is firmly pressed against the propeller shaft. To prevent such radial forces from becoming too great, and consequently resulting in excess wear, multiple seal lips have been provided, such that corresponding seal chambers are formed between axially adjacent seal lips. Such seal chambers allow a gradual change in pressure from the hydrostatic pressure prevailing outside the structure from which the propeller shaft protrudes from to the pressure prevailing within said structure. Consequently, each seal lip needs to seal against only a portion of the total pressure difference, resulting smaller radial forces and increased longevity of the seal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, if multiple such seal chambers are provided, conventional arrangements may have included a lubricant introduced into inner seal chambers. In such a case, an air pressure is typically introduced into an intermediate or outer seal chamber so as to prevent lubricant contamination.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, it has been considered that the water surrounding the structure from which the propeller protrudes from provides a sufficient cooling for any frictional heat caused by the seal lip(s) pressing against the rotating propeller shaft. It has now been surprisingly discovered that the seal lips may nevertheless reach temperature levels exceeding those allowed based on their material properties, thereby leading to premature wear.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a propulsion unit equipped with a shaft seal arrangement which provides for more efficient cooling of seal lips thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object of the disclosure is achieved by a propulsion unit which is characterized by what is stated in the independent claims. The preferred embodiments of the disclosure are disclosed in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosure is based on the idea of providing a lubricant flow through seal chambers formed between axially adjacent seal lips. More particularly, this lubricant flow is conducted via a heat exchanger, which is at least partially exposed to the environment surrounding a shell structure of the propulsion unit. Consequently, the lubricant is used to carry excess heat from the seal chambers and transfer it to the surrounding environment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An advantage of the method and arrangement of the disclosure is that a simple solution for efficient cooling is achieved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, a propulsion unit, such as an azimuthing propulsion unit, for a marine vessel, is provided. The propulsion unit comprises a shell structure mountable below a hull of an associated marine vessel, such that the shell structure is at least partially immersed in water, when in use. Most suitably, the propulsion unit is fully immersed in water, when in use.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The propulsion unit further comprises a shaft extending between an inside and an outside of the shell structure through an opening provided thereat and a propeller coupled to the shaft outside the shell structure so as to be rotatable by the shaft.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The propulsion unit further comprises a shaft seal arrangement for sealing an inside of the shell structure from a surrounding outside environment at the interface of the shell structure and the propeller shaft. The shaft seal arrangement, in turn, comprises a plurality of seal lips axially spaced apart from each other and engaging the outer circumference of the shaft, such that at least a first seal chamber is delimited between adjacent seal lips and the outer circumference of the shaft. In the context of this disclosure, the shaft may encompass an assembly including elements other than a shaft proper and rotating along therewith. e.g. shaft sleeve.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The propulsion unit further comprises a first lubrication arrangement, in turn, comprising a first lubricant circulator. The first lubrication arrangement further comprises a first lubricant feed line for conducting a first lubricant to the first seal chamber via the first lubricant circulator, and a first lubricant return line for conducting said first lubricant from the first seal chamber back to the first lubricant circulator. It should be noted that the first feed line and the first return line may conduct said first lubricant via additional entities not mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, but not necessarily, the first lubrication arrangement further comprises a first lubricant reservoir for holding said first lubricant. For example, the first lubricant reservoir may be implemented as the first lubricant feed line, first lubricant return line and/or any additional flow lines associated to the first lubrication arrangement. Most suitably the first lubricant reservoir is implemented as a dedicated first lubricant tank. In such a case, the first lubricant circulator is suitably arranged to feed the first lubricant form the first lubricant tank to the first seal chamber via the first lubricant feed line. Correspondingly, the first lubricant feed line is then suitably arranged to conduct the first lubricant from the first seal chamber back to the first lubricant tank. However, it should be noted that other arrangements are also possible. For example, the first lubricant circulator may alternatively be arranged in connection with the first lubricant return line. Preferably, but not necessarily, the first lubricant circulator is provided as a pump.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, the first lubrication arrangement further comprises a first lubricant heat exchanger arranged at least partly in contact with an outside environment of the shell structure <b>2</b> for conducting the first lubricant through the first heat exchange <b>7</b><i>e </i>and for transferring heat from the first lubricant to the outside environment of the shell structure. That is, when in use, the first heat exchanger is at least partly in direct contact with water in which the propulsion unit is at least partly immersed, such that excess heat carried away from the shaft seal arrangement by the lubricant can be transferred in said surrounding water. For example, the first heat exchanger may be arranged at least party outside the shell structure. For example, the first heat exchanger may be implemented as a separate dedicated component, or by arranging a part of the piping associated to the first lubrication arrangement at least partially exposed to the environment surrounding a shell structure of the propulsion unit.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It should be noted, that in the context of this disclosure, terms such as first, second third or fourth are not used imply the number or order of referred entities, but rather to distinguish them from each other, unless otherwise explicitly stated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, but not necessarily, the propulsion unit may further comprise a propulsion motor <b>3</b> arranged within the shell structure. The propulsion motor is rotatably coupled with the shaft such that the propeller is rotatable by the propulsion motor. Most suitably, the propulsion motor is an electric motor provided with electrical power generated by a prime move abord an associated marine vessel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment according to the first aspect of the present disclosure, the shaft seal arrangement may comprise a plurality of seal lips, such that additionally at least a second seal chamber is delimited between adjacent seal lips and the outer circumference of the shaft. Most suitably, the second seal chamber is then arranged axially adjacent to the first seal chamber.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The shaft seal arrangement may further comprise a second lubrication arrangement, in turn, comprising a second lubricant circulator. The second lubricant arrangement further comprises a second lubricant feed line for conducting a second lubricant to the second seal chamber via the second lubricant circulator, and a second lubricant return line for conducting said second lubricant from the second seal chamber back to the second lubricant circulator. It should be noted that the first feed line and the first return line may conduct said first lubricant via additional entities not mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, but not necessarily, the second lubrication arrangement further comprises a second lubricant reservoir for holding said second lubricant. For example, the second lubricant reservoir may be implemented as the second lubricant feed line, second lubricant return line and/or any additional flow lines associated to the second lubrication arrangement.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Most suitably the second lubricant reservoir is implemented as a dedicated second lubricant tank. In such a case, the second lubricant circulator is suitably arranged to feed the second lubricant form the second lubricant tank to the second seal chamber via the second lubricant feed line. Correspondingly, the second lubricant feed line is then suitably arranged to conduct the second lubricant from the second seal chamber back to the second lubricant tank. However, it should be noted that other arrangements are also possible. For example, the second lubricant circulator may alternatively be arranged in connection with the second lubricant return line.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, but not necessarily, the first lubricant circulator is provided as a pump.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, the second lubricant arrangement comprises a second lubricant heat exchanger arranged at least partly in contact with the outside environment of the shell structure for conducting second lubricant through the second heat exchanger and for transferring heat from the second lubricant to the outside environment of the shell structure. That is, when in use, the second heat exchanger is at least partly in direct contact with water in which the propulsion unit is at least partly immersed, such that excess heat carried away from the shaft seal arrangement by the lubricant can be transferred in said surrounding water. For example, the second heat exchanger may be arranged at least party outside the shell structure. For example, the second heat exchanger may be implemented as a separate dedicated component, or by arranging a part of the piping associated to the second lubrication arrangement at least partially exposed to the environment surrounding a shell structure of the propulsion unit.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment according to the first aspect of the present disclosure, the shaft seal arrangement comprises a plurality of seal lips, such that additionally at least a third seal chamber is delimited between adjacent seal lips and the outer circumference of the shaft. In such a case, the third seal chamber is suitably arranged axially adjacent to the second seal chamber.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The propulsion unit may then further comprise a pressurized medium supply line in fluid communication with the third seal chamber, such that a fluid pressure prevailing within the third seal chamber may be regulated by setting a desired pressure of the air supply line. Particularly, this enables regulating the fluid pressure prevailing in the third seal chamber so as to counteract a hydrostatic pressure prevailing outside of the shell structure of the propulsion unit. Most suitably, pressurized air is used as the medium for regulating the prevailing pressure in the third seal chamber. Advantageously, such a pressurized medium supply line is also in flow connection with the second lubricant reservoir, so as to regulate the pressure therein, most suitably accordingly with the pressure prevailing within the third seal chamber. The first lubricant reservoir may also be in flow connection with the pressurized medium supply line, suitably via a regulator for governing the pressure prevailing in the first lubricant reservoir, advantageously being lower than that prevailing in the first lubricant reservoir. The pressure prevailing in one or more of the pressurized medium supply line, second lubricant reservoir and third seal chamber may also be governed with one or more shared or common regulators.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, flow regulators or pressure regulators may be used as such regulators.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Such a regulator may be fed, for example, by a pressurized medium supply, such as a compressed air supply. Furthermore, such a regulator may be in fluid communication with either or both of the first lubricant reservoir or the second lubricant reservoir so as to be fed with the pressurized medium. That is, reservoir pressures prevailing within the first lubricant reservoir and the second lubricant reservoir, respectively, may be set by the pressurized medium supply, and subsequently feed the regulator used to regulate the pressure prevailing in the third seal chamber.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, such a third seal chamber may be coupled to a drainage reservoir via a drainage line, so as to drain from the third seal chamber any fluids (such as water or lubricant) leaked over from any axially adjacent seal chamber.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment according to the first aspect of the present disclosure, the shaft seal arrangement comprises a plurality of seal lips, such that additionally at least a fourth seal chamber is delimited between adjacent seal lips and the outer circumference of the shaft. Most suitably, the fourth seal chamber is arranged axially adjacent to the third seal chamber.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, the fourth seal chamber preferably an axially outermost seal chamber, such that an axially outermost seal lip associated with the fourth seal chamber is in direct contact with surrounding water, when in use.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be noted that the present disclosure encompasses arrangements having further seal chambers in addition to those mentioned in connection with embodiments discussed above.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment according to the first aspect of the present disclosure, the first heat exchanger is preferably provided upstream of the first seal chamber. This prevents any pressure losses over the first heat exchanger from increasing the pressure prevailing in the first seal chamber. Alternatively, or in addition, the first heat exchanger may be provided downstream of the first seal chamber.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment according to the first aspect of the present disclosure, where a second lubrication arrangement is provided, the second heat exchanger is preferably provided upstream of the second seal chamber. This prevents any pressure losses over the second heat exchanger from increasing the pressure prevailing in the second seal chamber. Alternatively, or in addition, the second heat exchanger may be provided downstream of the second seal chamber.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment according to the first aspect of the present disclosure, the first lubrication arrangement may further be equipped with a first bypass valve for selectively conducting the first lubricant flow past the first heat exchanger. This allows the first lubricant to be conducted past the first heat exchanger, e.g. in case of damage to the heat exchange.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment according to the first aspect of the present disclosure, where a second lubrication arrangement is provided, the second lubrication arrangement may further be equipped with a second bypass valve for selectively conducting the second lubricant flow past the second heat exchanger.

Such an arrangement provides protection for the first heat exchanger as the propeller guards the heat exchanger from potential collisions with external objects, such as ice. Preferably, but not necessarily, the first heat exchanger may at least partially annularly surround the propeller shaft. Preferably, but not necessarily, said portion of the first heat exchange may at least partially be covered by a separate cowling, such as a rope guard, which further provides additional protection for the heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment according to the first aspect of the present disclosure, where a second lubrication arrangement is provided, a portion of the second heat exchanger outside the shell structure is arranged on an outside end surface of the shell structure facing the propeller.

The first sensor may then be coupled to a control unit configured to adjust output flow of the first lubricant circulator based on the first sensor signal.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, but not necessarily the control unit is configured to adjust output flow of the first lubricant circulator by controlling an associated circulator motor configured to drive said first lubricant circulator. Alternatively, or in addition, a variable displacement circulator may be used and arranged to be controlled by the control unit.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, the first sensor may be provided as a first temperature sensor configured to produce a first sensor signal indicative of a first lubricant temperature. Most suitably, the first temperature sensor is configured to produce a first sensor signal indicative of a first lubricant temperature. Advantageously, the first temperature sensor is arranged downstream of the first seal chamber, but may alternatively be arranged upstream of the first seal chamber. Furthermore, the control unit may advantageously be configured to increase output flow of the first lubricant circulator, if the first sensor signal indicates an excessive first lubricant temperature. Alternatively, or in addition, the control unit is advantageously configured to decrease output flow of the first lubricant circulator if the first sensor signal indicates insufficient first lubricant temperature.
