For patients with diabetes mellitus, for example, conventional infusion systems incorporate various pumps that are used to deliver insulin to a patient. These pumps have the capability of delivering assorted fluid delivery profiles which include specified basal rates and bolus requirements. For example, these pumps include a reservoir to contain the liquid medication along with electromechanical pumping technology to deliver the liquid medication via tubing to a needle that is inserted subcutaneously into the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although such conventional pumps/infusion systems are adequate for their intended purpose, such pumps have difficult controlling drug delivery precisely thereby causing harm to the patient. That is, these pumps have large stroke volumes resulting in inaccurate basal rate infusion and incorrect insulin dosing. Further, with these infusion systems, diabetes patients must install and carry at least two bulky and obtrusive devices on their bodies. This causes significant inconvenience for the patient during his/her daily activities.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide an improved infusion system over these conventional infusion systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A device is disclosed for delivering medication to a patient.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, a device is disclosed for delivering a medication to a patient in a drug infusion system.

In this example, infusion system <b>100</b> is configured to infuse insulin to a patient for diabetes management (e.g., type 1). However, system <b>100</b> can be configured to infuse other medications such as small molecule pharmaceutical solutions, large molecule or protein drug solutions, saline solutions, blood or other fluids known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Infusion system <b>100</b> includes device <b>102</b> (or pod) for delivering insulin to a diabetes of other fluid medication to a patient. In this configuration, device <b>102</b> incorporates one or more micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) devices into its architecture for motive force and sensing functionality (as described in more detail below). Among other benefits, the MEMS technology (layers) in device <b>102</b> architecture enables direct connection between fluid path components for infusion without any tubing, connectors and/or separate mechanical valves. As a result, device <b>102</b> not only produces greater precision in pumping volume, it requires less power for operation, has better reliability, and less drug waste held up in fluid pathways (smaller dead volume). (In addition, MEMS manufacturing results in a very accurate device dimension with low tolerance (e.g, 1 um)). Consequently, device <b>12</b> may be fabricated to a significantly smaller scale. In short, by incorporating MEMS technology, device <b>102</b> is configured as a fully autonomous and integrated wearable unit or apparatus for diabetes management in which continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin delivery and closed loop control are provided together to ensure insulin is delivered at very precise rates. Device <b>102</b> details appear below. (Note that MEMS devices are also known as microsystem technology and micromachined devices).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Device <b>102</b> includes reservoir <b>104</b>, pumping unit or element <b>106</b> (also may be referred to as a micropump), microcontroller unit (MCU) <b>108</b>, insulin delivery needle <b>110</b>, glucose monitoring components <b>112</b> including the CGM (device), a sensor and needle (percutaneously inserted in the patient), and battery and power controller <b>114</b>. CGM, as known to those skilled in the art, tracks patient glucose levels and permits those levels to be used in algorithms that control flow rate. MCU <b>108</b> controls the operation of pumping unit <b>106</b> as described below.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Reservoir <b>104</b> is configured to receive and store insulin for its delivery over a course of about three days, or as needed. However, reservoir size may be configured for storing any quantity of fluid as required.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Pumping unit <b>106</b> fluidly communicates with reservoir <b>104</b> to enable infusion as needed. In one example configuration, pumping unit <b>106</b> may connect directly to reservoir <b>104</b> by bonding and/or adhesive with corresponding holes in alignment. In another example configuration, a short interposer may be used as a connector. In practice, the interposer functions as a funnel. The interposer consists of two plates of glass and/or silicon bonded together to form a plurality of holes and channels which may be employed to transition one size opening to another between pumping unit <b>106</b> to reservoir <b>104</b>. These are examples. Those skilled in the art know that other connector options may be used to achieve desired results. Pumping unit <b>106</b> also fluidly communicates with insulin needle <b>110</b> for insulin delivery. Insulin needle <b>110</b> and/or a cannula itself surrounding needle <b>110</b> may be inserted directly into pumping unit <b>106</b>. Alternatively, a similar interposer may also be used to connect needle <b>110</b> or cannula to pumping unit <b>106</b>. In this configuration, a plate covering the larger end of the interposer includes several holes to ensure proper fluid transfer in any orientation.

In one example configuration, the MEMS devices are each a piezoelectric transducer (or other MEMS devices including capacitive transducers or piezoresistive transducers) that acts as the active element for pumping fluid, but other MEMS structures or technology may be used to achieve desired results as known to those skilled in the art. Operation and functional details of the MEMS devices (e.g., piezoelectric transducer) appear in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">MCU <b>108</b> electronically communicates with the actuator and sensors in pumping unit <b>106</b> as well as the CGM sensor, as the monitoring components <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Among several functions, MCU <b>108</b> operates to control the operation of pumping unit <b>106</b> to deliver insulin through insulin needle <b>110</b> from reservoir <b>104</b> at specific doses, i.e., flow rates over specified time intervals, based on CGM data converted to desired flow rate via control algorithms. As part of this, MCU <b>108</b> also functions to perform dual closed control loop (also referred to as loop control) in which a flow rate is (1) prescribed by the control algorithm via data from the CGM and (2) subsequently monitored to precisely maintain such flow rate. (The sensors on pumping unit <b>106</b> measure pressure, flow rate and presence of air or other gas bubbles to ensure that flow rate is accurately maintained.) Control algorithms for such control reside in memory of MCU <b>108</b>. Dual closed loop control is described in more detail below. Importantly, once device <b>102</b> is started, it operates as a fully autonomous and integrated unit for diabetes management without connection or tether to a mobile device or computer. MCU <b>108</b> will incorporate sufficient memory known to those skilled in the art to store all data collected and generated (e.g., glucose levels, flow rates, dose delivered, pressures, faults etc.) for up to 3 days or more as desired. Once in proximity to (or commanded by) a mobile device or computer, the data stored may be uploaded to such mobile device or computer (e.g., via Bluetooth, WIFI, wired connection). This is described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Battery and power controller <b>114</b> controls the power to MCU <b>108</b> and pumping unit <b>106</b> to enable those components to function properly as known to those skilled in the art.

The control algorithms residing on MCU <b>108</b> controls and commands the pumping unit <b>106</b> (MEMS devices as valves and pumping elements as described below) to deliver insulin through insulin needle <b>110</b> from reservoir <b>104</b> at that flow rate, based on the CGM converted data.

As the first step, MCU <b>108</b> will set an initial flow rate as determined above, i.e., a voltage and frequency, as well as a driving waveform, for a patient and the pumping unit <b>104</b> will pump at that flow rate. Next, a flow sensor measures the actual flow rate (Q) off pumping unit <b>106</b> (MEMS device as described herein). At the same time, CGM (monitoring component <b>112</b>) measures the glucose level in the patient and converts that glucose level to a flow rate (S). Then, MCU <b>108</b> will then compare the flow rate (S) with the actual flow rate (Q) sensed.

Operation is described as follows. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, outlet valve <b>302</b> is in an energized configuration where pumping membrane <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> is depressed (i.e., forced downwardly). Then, pumping actuator <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> causes the pumping membrane <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> and chamber <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> to move the insulin by lowering the chamber pressure as membrane <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> is withdrawn from the chamber <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> (by the pumping actuator under negative voltage).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, inlet valve <b>300</b> is closed by the inlet valve actuator <b>302</b>-<b>1</b>, by changing the position of the inlet valve membrane onto an opposing surface or edge. Then, pumping membrane <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> is moved back into pumping chamber <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> by pumping actuator <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> driven in that direction, thereby increasing pressure in pumping chamber <b>302</b>-<b>3</b>. With pumping membrane <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> sweeping the volume of pumping chamber <b>302</b>-<b>3</b>, thereby increasing pressure therein, outlet valve <b>304</b> is opened with outlet valve actuator <b>302</b>-<b>1</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. This permits fluid to flow out and into a channel carrying the fluid toward the patient.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At the exit region of the MEMS devices, pressure sensor and flow sensor sense pressure and flow as identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In one example, the MEMS devices (piezoelectric elements) will sense pressure and flow by sensing both pressure and pressure drop due to flow across the membranes that transmit pressure as a force to the piezoelectric elements as known to those skilled in the art. However, other methods may be used to sense pressure and/or flow as known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition to pressure and flow sensing, air bubble sensing is performed in the flow path to determine if bubbles are present in the fluid path. In an example configuration, the air sensor uses an ultrasonic device to measure time-of-flight for sound waves changing velocity of transmission between air and insulin (fluid) solution. That is, once air volume is determined, it is subtracted from the volume of insulin dosage to alert and/or adjust for lack of dosing.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">These sensors will transmit information to MCU <b>108</b> and processed via software to provide real-time adjustments to fluid flow and pressure as needed per patient as well as alert/alarm signals for conditions present. The adjustments in flow rate may be accomplished in two ways. First, flow rate may be adjusted by increasing pulse frequency of the actuators in the inlet, pumping and outlet chambers. Second, flow rate may be adjusted by increasing the voltage of each pulse to the pumping actuator. This increase in voltage ultimately causes an increase in amplitude of deflection of the pumping membrane. These real-time adjustments in flow will yield significantly improved flow precision, pulsatility and accuracy. However, there are other ways to adjust flow and/or pressure. Examples of this appear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>. In brief, the pumping chambers (of MEMS devices) may be configured in parallel to increase flow rate and/or pumping chambers may be configured in series to increase output pressures as required per patient. Details are described below.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As for alerts and alarms, MCU <b>108</b> may also provide signals for alarm/alert conditions such as low flow and excess pressure (both indicating occlusion for example) causing a potential under-dosing of the patient. In addition, the alarm/alert will alert of conditions such as presence of air indicating absence of drug dosing or possibly an empty reservoir/end of dose, as well as conditions of flow in excess of that set by the insulin dosing control algorithm.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, inlet and outlet valve actuators <b>300</b>, <b>304</b> are shown and described as an active design in which the inlet and outlet valve actuators are configured with moving parts, i.e., a piezoelectric transducer actuator retracts a membrane to enable fluid flow. In the passive design, the inlet valve actuator and outlet valve actuator function passively. That is, the inlet valve actuator and outlet valve actuator are configured without moving parts such as in a diffuser valve. In essence, the inlet and outlet valve actuators are considered not be present.
