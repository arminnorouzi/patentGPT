For example, users use laptops, PCs, tablet devices, cellular phones, or other computing devices in various different environments such as offices, conference rooms, homes, at restaurants and coffee shops, outdoor venues, etc. It is common to adapt display luminance with embedded ambient light sensor in mobile systems, such as smartphones and portable (laptop) PCs, to provide the comfortable screen performance. On the other hand, stand-alone or stationary personal computer (PC) monitor devices do not have any light sensors embedded on the devices. The optical properties of the monitor devices are usually tuned by its user preference.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, because the monitor devices are tuned mostly by the user preference, they are not capable to reproduce the perceptually accurate color, specifically when the ambient illuminance is different from the content producer ambience. In exceptional situations, where both of the content producer and content consumer use the professionally calibrated monitor devices in the dark ambient illuminance, the influence of the ambient illuminance may be removed. However, such solution is quite expensive and is not commonly used.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Implementations disclosed herein provides a virtual ambient illuminance sensor system that includes a virtual ambient illuminance sensing device attached on a monitor device. A virtual ambient illuminance sensing device driver incorporates pre-measured ambient illuminance sensing information. The virtual ambient illuminance sensor system may use the pre-measured information to adjust display color and luminance so as to reproduce perceptually accurate color on the monitor screen.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The technology disclosed herein solves a technical problem of managing brightness of a standalone device that does not have an illuminance sensor. Specifically, the implementations disclosed herein allows the standalone device, such as a standalone PC or a monitor, to receive a snapshot of ambient illuminance levels from a mobile device including an illuminance sensor. Subsequently, the snapshot of the ambient illuminance levels is used to determine VCO levels provided to the pixels of an output screen of such standalone device. Furthermore, such snapshot of ambient illuminance levels is saved for future use. As a result, the pixels of such standalone device are illuminated such that it provides pleasant user experience. Also, these implementations are advantageous to the standalone device as it eliminates the need for the standalone device to be modified to have illuminance sensor. Another advantage of the implementations disclosed herein is that the snapshot of ambient illuminance is received from a mobile device that is in the vicinity of the standalone device, thus resulting in better user experience.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example block diagram of a virtual ambient illuminance sensor system <b>100</b> disclosed herein. Specifically, the virtual ambient illuminance sensor system <b>100</b> discloses an implementation where a stationary personal computer (PC) is communicatively attached with a mobile device <b>102</b>. The mobile device <b>102</b> may be a laptop, a tablet, or another mobile device with capability for ambient illuminance sensing capability. In the illustrated implementation, the mobile device <b>102</b> has an illuminance sensor <b>130</b> that senses ambient illuminance, such as illuminance from a light source <b>104</b>. The ambient illuminance sensor <b>112</b> may be implemented as any light sensor that measures the level of illuminance in the vicinity of the computing device <b>102</b> in lux or other appropriate units. The ambient illuminance sensor <b>130</b> may be implemented with ambient color sensing capability as well as illuminance. For example, the ambient illuminance sensor <b>130</b> may be implemented using a photo-voltaic light sensor, a phototube, a photo-emissive device, a photo-conductive device, a photo-junction device, a light-detective resistor, a photodiode, a photo-transistor, etc. In one implementation, the ambient illuminance sensor <b>130</b> may generate a series of illuminance values measured at a predetermined time period, such as every millisecond (ms), every second, etc. These series of illuminance values may be used by an operating system of the computing device <b>102</b> to adjust illuminance levels of an output screen.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the illustrated implementation, the output from the ambient illuminance sensor <b>130</b> may be input to an ambient light sensor driver <b>110</b> of the mobile device <b>110</b>. A measurement application <b>112</b> implemented on the mobile device <b>102</b> may sample the illuminance data input to the ambient light sensor driver <b>110</b>. Specifically, the measurement application <b>112</b> may have be communicatively connected to a virtual sensor setter application <b>120</b> configured on the stationary PC <b>108</b>. For example, the measurement application <b>112</b> may have be communicatively connected to a virtual sensor setter application <b>120</b> via a communication connection <b>132</b>. Alternatively, the communication connection <b>132</b> may be a wireless connection, an HDMI connection, etc.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The virtual sensor setter application <b>120</b> may be configured to determine if the mobile device <b>102</b> is in the vicinity of the stationary PC. In one implementation, such determination may be made by communicating with the mobile device over the communication connection <b>132</b>. Ascertaining that the mobile device <b>102</b> is in the vicinity of the stationary PC <b>108</b> allows to make sure that the illuminance level of the light incident upon the stationary PC <b>108</b> is substantially similar to the illuminance level of the light incident upon the mobile device <b>102</b>. This provides advantageous user experience to the user <b>106</b> using the standalone PC <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one implementation, the measurement application <b>112</b> is configured to take a snapshot of the illuminance levels at the mobile device <b>102</b> and communicate the illuminance level snapshot to the virtual sensor setter application <b>120</b> of the standalone PC <b>108</b>. The virtual sensor setter application <b>120</b> may save the snapshot in local memory of the standalone PC <b>108</b> for later use. For example, if the standalone PC <b>108</b> is configured in an office of the user <b>106</b>, anytime a mobile device in the vicinity of the standalone PC <b>108</b>, such as the mobile device <b>102</b>, is communicatively connected to the standalone PC <b>108</b>, a snapshot of the illuminance report is saved on the local memory of the standalone PC <b>108</b>. Thus, if the next day, even if the user <b>106</b> does not connect the mobile device <b>102</b> to the standalone PC <b>108</b>, the standalone PC <b>108</b> is able to use the illuminance snapshot, which most likely is a good representation of the illuminance at the standalone PC <b>108</b> resulting from the light source <b>104</b> located in the office of the user <b>106</b>. Therefore, the virtual ambient illuminance sensor system <b>100</b> provides a technical advantage by allowing the stationary PC <b>108</b> to adjust the VCO levels for the pixels of its display screen without having to have sensors thereupon and even if the mobile device <b>102</b> is disconnected from the stationary PC <b>108</b>, the VCO levels are set to be in accordance with the ambient illuminance from the light source <b>104</b> around the stationary PC <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As a result of using the snapshot of the illuminance levels as measured by a mobile device having an illuminance sensor, the illuminance of the pixels on an output screen of the standalone PC <b>108</b> is managed so as to give pleasant experience to a user <b>106</b>. Furthermore, even when the user <b>106</b> folds the mobile device <b>102</b> and/or disconnects it from the standalone PC <b>108</b>, the snapshot of illuminance saved by the virtual sensor setter application <b>120</b> may be used by a virtual ambient light sensor driver <b>122</b> to maintain the VCO levels of the pixels of the standalone PC <b>108</b> and therefore the illuminance of the output screen of the standalone PC <b>108</b> in view of the illuminance generated by the light source <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an alternative block diagram of a virtual ambient illuminance sensor system <b>200</b> disclosed herein. Specifically, the virtual ambient illuminance sensor system <b>200</b> may include a mobile device <b>202</b> that is connected to a standalone monitor <b>208</b> via a communication connection <b>230</b>. For example, the communication connection <b>230</b> may be an HDMI cable. The mobile device <b>202</b> includes an ambient illuminance sensor <b>230</b> that generates a series of illuminance signals that are communicated to an ambient light sensor driver <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The ambient light sensor driver <b>220</b> may be used to drive an output device, such as a screen of the mobile device <b>202</b>. However, in the illustrated implementation, the ambient light sensor driver <b>220</b> also generates an output of a snapshot of the ambient illuminance that is communicated to a virtual sensor setter application <b>222</b>. In one implementation, the virtual sensor setter application <b>222</b> is run at a predetermined ambient illumination condition. An example of the predetermined illumination condition may be the stored sensor information from when the stand-alone monitor was used by the mobile device last time to replicate the ambient illuminance sensor <b>230</b> to a virtual ambient light sensor driver <b>224</b>. The output of the sensor setter application <b>222</b> to the driver <b>224</b> may be the snapshot of the ambient illuminance sensing data. Once it is determined that the data from the ambient illuminance sensor <b>230</b> is replicated to the virtual ambient light sensor driver <b>224</b>, the ambient illuminance sensor <b>202</b> of the mobile device <b>202</b> may be disabled or the mobile device <b>202</b> may be closed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an example use case of the virtual ambient light sensor driver <b>224</b> disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the mobile device <b>202</b> may be active but the ambient illuminance sensor <b>230</b> may be disabled. For example, the lid of the mobile device <b>202</b> may be closed with the mobile device <b>202</b> connected to external monitor <b>208</b> as well as external keyboard/mouse, as if it is used as desktop PC. In this condition, ambient illuminance would not generate the sensor report and therefore, the display of the monitor <b>208</b> cannot be adapted to the ambient illuminance. With the implementation disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the virtual ambient light sensor driver <b>224</b> stores the last known good ambient illuminance data, such as from when the lid of the mobile device <b>202</b> was open with the illuminance sensor <b>230</b> active. As a result, the display subsystem of the monitor <b>208</b> is able to use the sensor information to adapt the display to the ambient illuminance.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, the above implementation provides an additional advantage of using the mobile device <b>202</b> with the lid closed and still the monitor <b>208</b> being able to adjust its display to the ambient illuminance. Keeping the lid of the mobile device <b>202</b> closed allows the mobile device to be used for longer period of time and therefore, preserving its battery life. Thus, providing the monitor <b>208</b> with the virtual ambient light sensor driver <b>224</b> allows not only extended use of the mobile device <b>202</b> but results in less damage to the display of the mobile device <b>202</b> due to extended use of screen saves on the display.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Subsequently, the operations for managing the illuminance of the monitor device <b>208</b> may be managed by the virtual ambient light sensor driver <b>224</b>. Specifically, the virtual ambient light sensor driver <b>224</b> may adjust the VCO levels of the pixels of the monitor device <b>208</b> using the replicated data from the ambient illuminance sensor <b>230</b>. As a result, the monitor device <b>208</b> is able to manage the illuminance levels of its output screen in consideration of the ambient illuminance provided by the light source <b>204</b> even when it does not have an illuminance sensor or even when it is not connected to any mobile device, such as the mobile device <b>202</b>. Thus, unless the ambient illuminance condition is changed and the user <b>206</b> thinks to replicate the sensing information from mobile device <b>202</b> once again, it is unnecessary to perform replication process, and the monitor device <b>208</b> can reproduce the correct illuminance and color on its display screen for a long usage period.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates another alternative block diagram of a virtual ambient illuminance sensor system <b>300</b> disclosed herein. Specifically, the virtual ambient illuminance sensor system <b>300</b> includes a mobile device <b>302</b> that may be communicatively connected to a monitor device <b>304</b> at least for some time period. The mobile device <b>302</b> may be a device such as a tablet device, a laptop, etc., that has an ambient illuminance sensor <b>330</b> thereupon. The ambient illuminance sensor <b>330</b> may be implemented with ambient color sensing capability as well as illuminance. For example, the ambient illuminance sensor <b>330</b> may be implemented using a photo-voltaic light sensor, a phototube, a photo-emissive device, a photo-conductive device, a photo-junction device, a light-detective resistor, a photodiode, a photo-transistor, etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A virtual ambient light sensor driver <b>310</b> implemented on the mobile device <b>302</b> may receive a series of illuminance and color data from the ambient illuminance sensor <b>330</b> and generate illuminance and color data that may be used by display screens to adjust the VCO levels and the color input signals for its pixels. The output from the virtual ambient light sensor driver <b>310</b> is used by a display control and illuminance adapter service <b>312</b> to control the VCO levels and the color input signals for a display screen pixels. These values are submitted to a display subsystem <b>314</b> of the mobile device <b>302</b>, which adapts the attached monitor color and luminance of a display screen.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated implementation, a luminance controller <b>320</b> and a display color pipeline <b>322</b> may be configured to receive the luminance and color levels from the display subsystem <b>314</b> and communicate them to the monitor device <b>304</b>.
