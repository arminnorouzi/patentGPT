For example, when the operation handles <b>1</b> come close to the end of the movable region during the operation, it is possible to move the operation handles <b>1</b> back to near the central position by operating the clutch pedal <b>23</b> and temporarily disconnecting the control-related connections. Then, once the operation of the clutch pedal <b>23</b> is quitted, the manipulators <b>201</b> and the operation handles <b>1</b> are connected again, and operation of the operation handles <b>1</b> can be restarted from near the central position. In this case, the clutch pedal <b>23</b> is operated to temporarily disconnect the whole control-related connections between both the operation handles <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the manipulators <b>201</b>. On the other hand, the clutch switch <b>11</b> provided in each of the operation handles <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>is operated to temporarily disconnect the control-related connections between either of the operation handles <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>and corresponding one of the manipulators <b>201</b>, individually.

Specifically, the camera pedal <b>24</b> enables control of the endoscope <b>201</b><i>d </i>by the operation handles <b>1</b>. That is, the position and orientation of the endoscope <b>201</b><i>d </i>are controllable by the operation handles <b>1</b> while the camera pedal <b>24</b> is being pressed. The endoscope <b>201</b><i>d </i>is controlled by using both of the right and left operation handles <b>1</b>, for example. Specifically, when the operator O rotates the right and left operation handles <b>1</b> about the middle point between the right and left operation handles <b>1</b>, the endoscope <b>201</b><i>d </i>is rotated. When the operator O presses the right and left operation handles <b>1</b> together, the endoscope <b>201</b><i>d </i>goes further into the body cavity. When the operator O pulls the right and left operation handles <b>1</b> together, the endoscope <b>201</b><i>d </i>retracts. When the operator O moves the right and left operation handles <b>1</b> together up, down, right, and left, the endoscope <b>201</b><i>d </i>moves up, down, right, and left, respectively.

The switch pedal <b>25</b> is operated by being pressed leftward (in the X<b>1</b> direction). For example, the manipulator <b>201</b> operated by the right hand-operation handle <b>1</b><i>a </i>is switched by operating the switch pedal <b>25</b>. In this case, the manipulator <b>201</b> operated by the right hand-operation handle <b>1</b><i>a </i>is switched without changing the manipulator <b>201</b> operated by the left hand-operation handle <b>1</b><i>b</i>.
