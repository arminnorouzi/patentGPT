id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention provides an improved pole assembly. According to a first preferred embodiment, the present invention includes a first pole section which is formed by an inner shell wall surrounding a hollow inner cavity. According to a further preferred embodiment, the inner shell wall is formed as a first column of a given shape, which is formed of galvanized steel or fiberglass reinforced polymer, and which is surrounded by a center fill layer. The center fill layer is preferably formed of SSC concrete which surrounds the inner shell wall. According to a further preferred embodiment, the present invention preferably further includes an outer shell wall which is formed as a second column of a given shape, which surrounds the center fill layer.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="75.78mm" wi="85.09mm" file="US20230001665A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

No. 17/481,438, filed Sep. 22, 2021, which in turn claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/082,504 filed Sep. 24, 2020.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to an improved pole assembly. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for providing an improved pole assembly which includes inner and outer shell components made of selective materials.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Utility poles are generally single, vertical posts (also referred to as distribution or transmission poles) which are commonly installed at set intervals to support overhead power lines and other public utilities such as electrical cable, fiber optic cable, and related equipment such as transformers and streetlights.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most commonly, utility poles are made of pressure treated wood, steel, concrete or composite materials. Composite poles are generally manufactured by centrifugally casting methods, winding and/or pultrusion techniques. Composite poles have an extremely high strength to weight ratio and are highly durable thus lasting longer. Composite poles are also less harmful to the environment. Because of their increased strength, the lengths of composite poles have been pushed to their limits and now commonly extend to sixty feet or higher. At these extended heights, the amount of bending moments and shear force greatly increase. Moreover, because of the reduced stiffness of composite poles, the lateral deflections increase dramatically with increases in length. Increasing the cross-section of composite poles for strength and stiffness requirements can add significantly to the cost of a given structure. For these reasons, current composite pole designs have plateaued in terms of their ability to support weight and to withstand lateral forces. The current pole technologies are either high in cost or require materials which are restrictively heavy in weight, such as concrete, and do not provide the benefits of composite material.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To address the shortcomings presented in the prior art, the present invention provides an improved utility pole assembly which is light in weight, has increased stiffness, and which is capable of carrying greater applied loads.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with preferred embodiments, the present invention includes a first pole section which is preferably formed by an inner and outer shell walls surrounding a hollow inner cavity. According to preferred embodiments, the inner shell wall is preferably formed as a first rectangular, square or circular member.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a further preferred embodiment, the inner shell wall is preferably formed of fiberglass reinforced polymer (FRP) or steel and is preferably surrounded by a center fill layer and an outer shell. The center fill layer (e.g., between the inner and outer shells) is preferably made of high strength concrete (e.g., SSC concrete) or a grout material that is cementitious, resin based or polyurethane.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a further preferred embodiment, the present invention also includes an outer shell wall which is preferably formed as a second rectangular, square or circular member which surrounds the inner shell and the center fill layer. Preferably, the center fill layer may include reinforcing steel wires which are arranged longitudinally within the center fill layer. According to further preferred embodiments, other forms of interior reinforcements may also be used such as: welded wire reinforcement (WWR), reinforcing steel rebar cage, steel fiber reinforced concrete, FRP bars or FRP laminates. In another embodiment, the interior fill layer may not include additional reinforcement, but depends on the fill material and the two surrounding shells to carry load.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other goals and advantages of the invention will be further appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and accompanying drawings. While the following description may contain specific details describing particular embodiments of the invention, this should not be construed as limitations to the scope of the invention but rather as an exemplification of preferable embodiments.

The spacer elements preferably are evenly spaced around the steel pole outer surface so as to provide uniform spacing around the steel pole to create a uniform annular space for later pumped concrete as discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">At a next step <b>302</b>, the steel tube with the attached spacers is preferably inserted within an extended outer FRP shell. At a next step <b>303</b>, one or more rubber gasket spacers are preferably applied to each end spacing element. Additionally, one or more rubber gasket spacers may further be applied to the end surfaces of each of the top and bottom sides of the inserted steel tube. At a next step <b>305</b>, silicon is preferably applied to contact surfaces of a top filling cap and a bottom filling cap. One or more of the filling caps may preferably include input nozzles for receiving pumped concrete. According to a preferred embodiment, the contact surfaces may preferably include each point of contact between the steel pole and the surfaces of the top and bottom filling caps as they are secured to respective ends of the assembled hybrid pole.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">At a next step <b>306</b>, the top and bottom filling caps are preferably attached to the outer FRP shell thus sealing the internal cavity of the outer FRP shell. At a next step <b>307</b>, the pumping of a pre-mixed concrete mixture (or other filler material) is preferable initiated through one or both of the top/bottom filling caps. At a next step <b>308</b>, the system preferably initiates movement/vibration which is applied to the sealed outer FRP shell. According to a preferred embodiment, the movement/vibration may preferably be provided by a vibrating stand/cradle supporting the sealed FRP shell. Alternatively, vibrating elements may be secured to the outside surface of the outer FRP shell. In this way, the concrete may preferably be pumped within the outer FRP shell in an amount sufficient to fill the uniform spacing around the steel pole to create a uniform concrete layer once cured.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">The present invention has been disclosed above with reference to several exemplary embodiments which are not intended to be limiting.

These weldments <b>327</b>-<b>331</b> may be attached and positioned to provide alignment between the FRP tube <b>334</b> and the inner steel tube <b>332</b> during construction. Additionally, they may be attached as shear connectors tying the inner steel tube <b>332</b> to the concrete layers <b>333</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">The scope of the present invention should be determined purely by the terms of the appended claims and their legal equivalents.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
