level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for treating a plastics pyrolysis oil so as to obtain a hydrocarbon effluent, the composition of which is compatible with a feedstock feeding a steam cracking unit. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for treating a feedstock obtained from the pyrolysis of plastic waste, so as to at least partly remove impurities, notably olefins (monoolefins and diolefins), metals, in particular silicon, and halogens, in particular chlorine, which said feedstock may contain in relatively large amounts, and so as to hydrogenate the feedstock so as to be able to upgrade it in a steam cracking unit with increased yields of light olefins.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">PIastics obtained from collection and sorting channels may undergo a step of pyrolysis so as to obtain, inter alia, pyrolysis oils. These plastics pyrolysis oils are generally burnt to generate electricity and/or used as fuel in industrial boilers or urban heating.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another route for upgrading plastics pyrolysis oils could be the use of these plastics pyrolysis oils as feedstock for a steam cracking unit so as to (re)create olefins, said olefins being constituent monomers of certain polymers. However, plastic waste is generally mixtures of several polymers, for example mixtures of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene. Furthermore, depending on the applications, the plastics may contain, in addition to polymers, other compounds, such as plasticizers, pigments, dyes or polymerization catalyst residues. PIastic waste may also contain, in a minor amount, biomass originating, for example, from household waste. As a result, the oils obtained from the pyrolysis of plastic waste comprise a lot of impurities, in particular diolefins, metals, notably silicon, or halogenated compounds, notably chlorine-based compounds, heteroelements such as sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen, and insoluble matter, in contents that are often high and incompatible with steam cracking units or units located downstream of the steam cracking units, notably polymerization processes and selective hydrogenation processes. These impurities may give rise to operability problems and notably problems of corrosion, coking or catalytic deactivation, or alternatively incompatibility problems in the applications of the target polymers. The presence of diolefins may also lead to problems of instability of the pyrolysis oil, characterized by the formation of gums. This phenomenon is generally limited by appropriate storage of the feedstock. The gums and the insoluble matter that may be present in pyrolysis oil can give rise to problems of clogging in the processes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, during the steam cracking step, the yields of light olefins sought for petrochemistry, notably ethylene and propylene, depend greatly on the quality of the feedstocks sent for steam cracking. The BMCI (Bureau of Mines Correlation Index) is often used to characterize hydrocarbon cuts. Globally, the yields of light olefins increase when the paraffin content increases and/or when the BMCI decreases. Conversely, the yields of undesired heavy compounds and/or of coke increase when the BMCI increases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2018/055555 proposes an overall process for recycling plastic waste, which is very general, ranging from the very step of pyrolysis of the plastic waste up to the steam cracking step. The process of application WO 2018/055555 comprises, inter alia, a step of hydrotreating the liquid phase obtained directly from the pyrolysis, preferably under quite stringent conditions notably in terms of temperature, for example at a temperature of between 260 and 300&#xb0; C., a step of separation of the hydrotreatment effluent and then a step of hydrodealkylation of the heavy effluent separated out, preferably at a high temperature, for example between 260 and 400&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention aims to overcome these drawbacks and to participate in the recycling of plastics, by proposing a process for treating an oil resulting from the pyrolysis of plastics to purify it and hydrotreat it in order to obtain a hydrocarbon effluent with a reduced content of impurities, the composition of which is compatible with a feedstock feeding a steam cracking unit, leads to improved yields of light olefins during the steam cracking step, while in particular reducing the risks of clogging during steps for treating plastics pyrolysis oils, such as those described in the prior art, and the formation of coke in large amounts and/or the risks of corrosion encountered during a step for steam cracking plastics pyrolysis oils.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention relates to a process for treating a feedstock comprising a plastics pyrolysis oil, comprising at least the following steps:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0008">a) a selective hydrogenation step performed in a reaction section fed with said feedstock and a gaseous stream comprising hydrogen, in the presence of at least one selective hydrogenation catalyst, at a temperature of between 100 and 250&#xb0; C., a partial pressure of hydrogen of between 1.0 and 10.0 MPa abs. and an hourly space velocity of between 1.0 and 10.0 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, to obtain a hydrogenated effluent;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0009">b) a hydrotreatment step performed in a hydrotreatment reaction section, comprising a fixed-bed reactor containing n catalytic beds, n being an integer greater than or equal to 1, placed in series and each comprising at least one hydrotreatment catalyst, said hydrotreatment reaction section being fed, at the first catalytic bed, with said hydrogenated effluent obtained from step a) and a gaseous stream comprising hydrogen and used at a temperature of between 250 and 430&#xb0; C., a partial pressure of hydrogen of between 1.0 and 10.0 MPa abs. and an hourly space velocity of between 0.1 and 10.0 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, to obtain a hydrotreatment effluent;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0010">c) a separation step, fed with the hydrotreatment effluent obtained from step b) and an aqueous solution, said step being performed at a temperature of between 50 and 370&#xb0; C., to obtain at least one gaseous effluent, an aqueous effluent and a hydrocarbon effluent.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">The advantage of the process of the invention is to provide a precise sequence of operations which makes it possible to rid an oil resulting from the pyrolysis of plastic waste of at least a part of its impurities, to hydrogenate it to make it in particular compatible with treatment in a steam cracking unit in order to be able to recreate light olefins with increased yields which may be used as monomers in the production of polymers. The invention also makes it possible to prevent risks of clogging and/or corrosion of the treatment unit in which the process of the invention is performed, the risks being exacerbated by the presence, often in large amounts, of diolefins, metals and halogenated compounds in the plastics pyrolysis oil.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">The process of the invention thus makes it possible to obtain an effluent obtained from a plastics pyrolysis oil which is at least partly freed of the impurities of the starting plastics pyrolysis oil, thus limiting the problems of operability, such as the corrosion, coking or catalytic deactivation problems, to which these impurities may give rise, in steam cracking units and/or in units located downstream of the steam cracking units, notably the polymerization and selective hydrogenation units. The removal of at least a part of the impurities from the oils obtained from the pyrolysis of plastic waste will also make it possible to increase the range of applications of the target polymers, the application incompatibilities being reduced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">The invention has the further advantage of participating in the recycling of plastics and in conserving the fossil resources, by enabling the upgrading of oils resulting from their pyrolysis in a steam cracking unit.
