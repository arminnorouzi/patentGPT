As will be described in more detail below, the device <b>20</b> is suitable for pulverizing, grinding or otherwise breaking up friable material. In some embodiments, the friable material is a cosmetic formulation having a solid, pressed, lyophilized or sintered form.

In use, suitable movement of the plunger <b>50</b> forces the solid product <b>24</b> into the pulverizing component <b>70</b>. With relative movement between the solid product <b>24</b> and the pulverizing component <b>70</b>, the pulverizing device <b>20</b> is capable of pulverizing, grinding or otherwise breaking up the solid product <b>24</b> housed in the housing <b>22</b> into, for example, powder form. The pulverizing device <b>20</b> then dispenses the powder into the user's hand, a container or other surface, etc., for subsequent use (e.g., consumption, mixing, etc.).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The components of the pulverizing device <b>20</b> will now be described in more detail referencing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> are longitudinal cross-sectional views of the device <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> taken along the lines <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the housing <b>22</b> defines a first opening <b>26</b> at one end <b>28</b> and a second opening <b>30</b> at an opposite, second end <b>32</b>. In the embodiment shown, the opening <b>26</b> is formed by an inner wall <b>34</b> comprised of a somewhat frustoconical upper section <b>36</b> and a cylindrical lower section <b>38</b>. In some embodiments, the cylindrical lower section <b>38</b> of housing <b>22</b> is coincident with the longitudinal axis of the housing <b>22</b>. From the cylindrical lower section <b>38</b>, the first opening <b>26</b> communicates with a cavity <b>40</b> sized and configured for housing the solid product <b>24</b>. At the second end <b>32</b> of the housing <b>22</b>, the second opening <b>30</b> forms an outlet for dispensing the solid product <b>24</b> after at least some of the solid product has been broken into, for example, powder form.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the plunger <b>50</b> extends exteriorly of the housing <b>22</b> through the first opening <b>26</b>. At the end of the plunger <b>50</b> extending exteriorly of the housing <b>22</b> there is provided a handle <b>52</b>. At the opposite end of the plunger <b>50</b>, which extends interiorly of the housing <b>22</b> and into the cavity <b>40</b>, there is provided a solid product contact surface <b>54</b>. In the embodiment shown, the plunder <b>50</b> includes a cylindrical (e.g., tube, etc.) section <b>56</b> that extends from an area adjacent the handle <b>52</b> to the contact surface <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The cylindrical section <b>56</b> of the plunger <b>50</b> is sized and configured to be slidably received through the cylindrical lower section <b>38</b>. The cylindrical lower section <b>38</b> defines a bearing surface <b>58</b> against which the plunger <b>50</b> (e.g., the cylindrical lower section) is slideably supported is a guiding manner. In other words, when the handle <b>52</b> is pushed/pulled inwardly/outwardly, movement of the plunger <b>50</b> is guided by the bearing surface <b>58</b>. While complimentary cylindrical shapes are shown, other cross-sectional shapes may be practiced with embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the plunger <b>50</b> may include an external flange, one or more tabs, or other movement interfering means, generally designated <b>62</b>, provided at a position along the lower cylindrical section <b>38</b>. The movement interfering means <b>62</b> defines a stop against the interior end of the inner wall <b>34</b> so as to limit the outwardly (e.g., pulling) movement of the plunger <b>50</b>, and in some embodiments, prohibits removal of the plunger <b>50</b> through the first opening <b>26</b>. Similarly, the handle <b>52</b> in some embodiments is sized and configured so that the plunger <b>50</b> is prohibited from passing through the first opening <b>26</b> when moved in the direction of the cavity <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the pulverizing component <b>70</b> is positioned within the cavity <b>40</b> of the housing <b>22</b>. The pulverizing component <b>70</b> is configured to pulverize the solid product <b>24</b> as the plunger <b>50</b> is pushed or otherwise advanced inwardly against the solid product. In the embodiment shown, movement of the plunger <b>50</b> in a linear manner causes the pulverizing component <b>70</b> to pulverize the solid product <b>24</b> as the plunger <b>50</b> is pushed or otherwise advanced inwardly against the solid product. In the embodiment shown, the pulverizing component <b>70</b> includes an extension spring (shown as a coil spring) having a plurality of coils or loops. The extension spring is configured and arranged for contacting the solid product when the plunger <b>50</b> is pushed inwardly into the cavity <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, the pulverizing component <b>60</b> may also be configured for receiving the solid product <b>24</b> at least partially therein.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiment shown, the pulverizing component <b>70</b> includes a coil spring <b>72</b> mounted within the cavity <b>40</b>. For example, in the embodiment shown, one end (the plunger facing end) of the coil spring <b>72</b> is retained by an internally formed flange <b>74</b> that extends around the inner perimeter of the housing <b>22</b>, or sections thereof. In some embodiments, at least the first coil or loop of the coil spring <b>72</b> is retained by the plunger facing surface of the flange <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the coil spring <b>72</b> is a conical or domed extension spring, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. For example, the coil spring <b>72</b> may include one end <b>76</b> with a larger diameter and a second end <b>78</b> with a smaller diameter, wherein the coil spring <b>72</b> tapers (e.g., the coils get successively smaller in diameter) from the first, larger diameter end <b>76</b> to the second, smaller diameter end <b>78</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the coil spring <b>72</b> has an inverted orientation when assembled such that the first, larger diameter end <b>76</b> is retained by the flange <b>74</b> of the housing <b>22</b> and the second, smaller diameter end <b>78</b> is facing the second opening <b>30</b> of the housing <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, the coil spring may have a cylindrical or other suitable shape.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the extension spring can be a spiral spring <b>80</b> (i.e., a spring that is formed as a spiral in a two-dimensional (XY) plane) of the type typically used in torsion, sometimes referred to as a flat coil spring. In this embodiment, the spiral spring <b>80</b> is configured so that it can be extended in the Z direction when a force is applied in the Z direction thereto, and will revert to its planar spiral form (or close to) at rest. In embodiments employing the spiral spring <b>80</b>, at least the outermost section <b>82</b> of the spiral spring <b>80</b> would be retained by the plunger facing surface of the flange <b>74</b>, and the solid product <b>24</b> would be supported on the top of the spiral spring. In use, when movement of the plunger <b>50</b> pushes against the solid product <b>24</b> supported by the coils of spiral spring, the inner coils or loops of the spiral spring extend in the Z direction. As the spiral spring extends, the spiral spring forms a somewhat conical shape, and the top edges of the coils or loops apply a shearing force against the outer surface of the solid product <b>24</b>, thereby pulverizing areas of the solid product <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the extension spring can be made of stainless steel or spring steel (e.g., low-alloy manganese, a medium-carbon steel, a high-carbon steel with a very high yield strength, etc.). In some embodiments, the profile of the extension spring is round in cross-section. In other embodiments, the profile of the extension spring is rectangular in cross-section. Of course, other cross-sectional shapes, such as elliptical, etc., may be practiced with embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">One example of a method for using the pulverizing device <b>20</b> for pulverizing, grinding or otherwise breaking up a solid product into, for example, powder form, will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. Firstly, a pulverizing device <b>20</b> is obtained, containing a solid product housed within the cavity <b>40</b>, and in some embodiments, inside the loops of a coil spring <b>72</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Next, the handle <b>52</b> of the plunger <b>50</b> is pushed inwardly (e.g., linear displacement) so that the product contacting surface <b>54</b> contacts the solid product <b>24</b>. With continued pushing movement of the plunger <b>50</b> from the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> to the position shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the solid product <b>24</b> is forced against the coils or loops of the coil spring <b>72</b>. As the coil spring <b>72</b> extends, the coil spring <b>72</b> conforms somewhat to the shape of the solid product <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As such, movement of the solid product <b>24</b> with respect to the coil spring <b>72</b> from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> causes the edges of the coil spring's coils or loops to apply a shearing force against the outer surface of the solid product <b>24</b>, thereby pulverizing the brittle surface of the solid product <b>24</b> and creating a pulverized formulation (e.g., in powder form). With the aid of gravity, the powder falls through the second opening <b>30</b>, and is dispensed into the user's hand, a container or other surface, etc., for subsequent use (e.g., consumption, mixing, etc.) In some embodiments, the pulverizing device <b>20</b> may include a somewhat doomed shaped structure <b>84</b> associated with the second opening <b>30</b>. In some embodiments, the structure <b>84</b> may act like a dispenser to aid in dispensing the powder from the second opening <b>30</b>. In that regard, as the powder falls onto the domed surface <b>86</b> of the structure <b>84</b>, the powder tends to slide to the perimeter thereof and falls through a gap <b>88</b> formed between the inner perimeter surface of the housing <b>22</b> and the perimeter edge of the structure <b>84</b>. In some embodiments, the structure <b>84</b> may also act as a stop for limiting the extension travel of the extension spring <b>72</b>. To aid in collecting the dispensed powder, a cup or like container (not shown) can be removably attached (e.g., snug fit, press fit, threaded, etc.), to the second end <b>32</b> of the housing <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the pulverizing device <b>20</b> is manufactured and assembled for single use. In these embodiments, the type of solid product, such as a cosmetic foundation, a cake mascara, etc., is placed in the cavity at the time of assembly. In other embodiments, the pulverizing device <b>20</b> is configured to be reusable once the solid product <b>24</b> is partially or fully exhausted. For example, to remove and/or replace a partially exhausted solid product <b>24</b>, the housing may be formed with two housing halves or two parts that can be removeably attached to one another via threaded connection, a snap fit connection, etc. To exchange solid products <b>24</b>, one part of the housing <b>22</b> is detached to expose the cavity <b>40</b>. The solid product in the cavity <b>40</b> is then exchange with a different solid product and the housing part is reattached. Substantially similar steps would be undertaken to refill the pulverizing device <b>20</b> after exhaustion of the solid product.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The detailed description set forth above in connection with the appended drawings, where like numerals reference like elements, are intended as a description of various embodiments of the present disclosure and are not intended to represent the only embodiments.
