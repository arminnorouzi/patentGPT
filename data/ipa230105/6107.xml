To reduce reflection losses, the lead frame can be coated with silver. There is the risk, however, that this silver will discolour on account of corrosion during operation of the component, thus resulting in increased reflection losses.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One object is to provide an optoelectronic semiconductor component that has good properties in a simplified manner and reliably.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This object is achieved, inter alia, by a housing according to claim <b>1</b>. Further embodiments and expedient features are the subject of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A housing for an optoelectronic semiconductor component is described, in particular as a surface-mountable component (surface-mounted device, or SMD). The housing has, for example, a mounting side, on which all electrical contacts necessary for electrically contacting the optoelectronic semiconductor component are accessible externally. In the vertical direction, that is to say perpendicularly to the mounting side, the housing extends for example between the mounting side and a front side facing away from the mounting side. For example, the housing extends along a longitudinal axis of the housing between two first side faces. The housing extends for example between two second side faces of the housing perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis. The longitudinal axis and the transverse axis, in plan view of the housing, run in particular centrally in each case, so that an intersection point between the longitudinal axis and the transverse axis forms for example a centre point of the housing in plan view of the housing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the housing has a lead frame and a housing body, which is integrally moulded onto the lead frame. The housing body comprises a plastics material for example. The housing body is produced for example by a moulding method.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A moulding method is understood generally to be a method by means of which a moulding compound can be formed in accordance with a predefined shape and, as necessary, hardened. In particular, the term &#x201c;casting method&#x201d; includes moulding, film assisted moulding, injection moulding, transfer moulding, and compression moulding.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The lead frame extends in a vertical direction, for example between a rear side of the lead frame and a front side of the lead frame. For example, the lead frame is a partially etched lead frame, also referred to as a semi-etched lead frame). This means that the lead frame has regions of different thickness, wherein the thickness of the lead frame relates to the vertical extent. For this purpose, a starting sheet of the lead frame, for example a coated or uncoated copper sheet, can be partially etched from the front side and/or from the rear side.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to at least one embodiment of the lead frame, the lead frame comprises a first lead frame part and a second lead frame part. The first lead frame part and the second lead frame part are arranged without overlapping each other, in particular in plan view of the housing, and are not directly connected to each other in an electrically conductive manner at any point. In particular, the first lead frame part and the second lead frame part are connected to each other in a mechanically stable manner only via the housing body.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first lead frame part and the second lead frame part can each be formed in one piece in the sense of a coherent body.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the housing body comprises a cavity on the front side of the housing for accommodating a semiconductor chip. A vertical extent of the cavity, i.e. a distance between a bottom face of the cavity and the front side of the housing, is in particular so large that the semiconductor chip to be accommodated is arranged completely within the cavity.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the lead frame is exposed in the cavity only at a first connection point of the first lead frame part and at a second connection point of the second lead frame part of the lead frame. In other words, in a plan view of the housing, only the first connection point and the second connection point of the lead frame are visible. In particular, the first connection point and the second connection point are completely covered by the semiconductor chip when a semiconductor chip to be accommodated in the cavity is mounted as intended.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first connection point and the second connection point are set up in particular for the electrical contacting of a semiconductor chip with two electrical contacts on the side of the semiconductor chip facing the mounting side, for example for the mounting of semiconductor chips in flip-chip geometry.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, the first connection point and the second connection point are each at most half the size of the semiconductor chip to be accommodated.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In at least one embodiment of the housing for an optoelectronic semiconductor component, the housing has a mounting side, a lead frame, and a housing body which is integrally moulded onto the lead frame, wherein the lead frame has a first lead frame part and a second lead frame part, and the housing body having a cavity, for accommodating an optoelectronic semiconductor chip, on a front side facing away from the mounting side. The lead frame is exposed in the cavity only at a first connection point of the first lead frame part and at a second connection point of the second lead frame part of the lead frame.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">When mounting an optoelectronic semiconductor chip in such a housing, there are no exposed regions of the lead frame inside the cavity after the mounting the optoelectronic semiconductor chip, for example by means of a connecting means, such as a solder. In particular, the parts of the lead frame not covered by the housing body can be completely covered by the connecting means.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The danger that parts of the lead frame exposed in the cavity will corrode is thus avoided. By contrast, in conventional optoelectronic semiconductor components, parts of the lead frame to the side of the semiconductor chip are not covered by the housing body. If these parts are only covered by polymer materials, such as a potting compound of the semiconductor chip, penetration paths can lead to corrosion. By contrast, in the case of the described housing, the potting compound itself does not have to be able to block penetration paths and thus suppress the penetration of corrosion-causing gases, such as hydrogen sulfide. Materials such as silicones, which have a comparatively high permeability to hydrogen sulfide, can therefore also be used for the potting compound.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, a bottom face of the cavity in the region of the first connection point and the second connection point has an indentation in which the first connection point and the second connection point are exposed. The indentation can be a common indentation for both connection points. In this case, the indentation extends continuously over the first connection point and the second connection point. Deviating from this, the first connection point and the second connection point can each be assigned a separate indentation. The indentation is designed, for example, to accommodate a connecting means, such as a solder.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A vertical extent of the indentation, i.e. a vertical distance of the housing body in the region of the indentation from the bottom face of the housing body, is preferably small compared to the vertical extent of the cavity. For example, the vertical extent of the indentation is at least twice or at least five times as large as the vertical extent of the cavity.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the first lead frame part has a first inner region. The first inner region overlaps with the first connection point, in particular in plan view of the housing. The first inner region is exposed on the mounting side of the housing. In particular, the first inner region forms the rear side of the lead frame at points.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the first lead frame part has a first edge region, wherein the first edge region is exposed on the mounting side of the housing and/or the first edge region being exposed at a side face of the housing. The side face of the housing is in particular a first side face which delimits the housing along the longitudinal axis in the lateral direction.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first inner region and the first edge region are in particular parts of a coherent first lead frame part.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the first inner region and the first edge region are connected to each other via a first front-side region of the first lead frame part. The first front side region is distanced from the mounting side. Thus, the front-side region forms the front side of the lead frame at points, but does not extend to the rear side of the lead frame in the vertical direction. In particular, the front-side region is covered by the housing body in a rear view of the housing and is thus not visible. Preferably, the first inner region and the first edge region are only connected to each other via the first front-side region.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the first edge region has a recess that is accessible on the mounting side and on the side face of the housing. For example, the recess extends only partially through the lead frame in the vertical direction. However, the recess can also extend completely through the lead frame in the vertical direction. The recess can fulfil the function of a solder control structure, so that it can be seen from the side of the housing whether soldering of the housing, for example to a connection carrier such as a printed circuit board, has been reliably carried out.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the first front-side region runs along two edges of the first inner region in plan view of the housing. The two edges run in particular obliquely or perpendicularly to each other. This increases the mechanical stability of the housing.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, the reliability in the production of the housing is increased, since the first inner region for the formation of the housing body can be reliably pressed into the film used for this purpose by means of a film assisted moulding method. Unintentional covering of the rear side of the lead frame with material for the housing body can thus be efficiently avoided.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the first lead frame part is interrupted between the first inner region and the first edge region in plan view of the housing along the longitudinal axis of the housing. Thereby, a direct force transfer along the longitudinal axis between the first edge region and the first inner region can be avoided or at least reduced. Such a force transfer can occur, for example, when the housing is heated during soldering to a connection carrier and different thermal expansion coefficients of the materials used lead to thermomechanical stresses. With such a housing, the risk of damage to a semiconductor component during mounting of the housing can thus be reduced.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the first inner region and the first edge region are connected to each other only on one side of the longitudinal axis of the housing via the first front-side region, as seen in plan view of the housing along said longitudinal axis. In particular, the first lead frame part does not form a closed structure such as an O-shaped structure when viewed in plan view of the housing. For example, the part of the first front-side region that connects the first inner region to the first edge region is C-shaped in plan view.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the first front-side region of the first lead frame part comprises a first extension extending between the second connection point and a second side face of the housing running parallel to the longitudinal axis. For example, the first extension protrudes beyond the transverse axis of the housing. In other words, the first extension is located, at least at points, on that side of the transverse axis of the housing on which the second connection point of the second lead frame part is arranged, in plan view of the housing. Thus, in a side view of the housing, the first extension of the first lead frame part overlaps with the second lead frame part. It has been shown that such an extension can improve the mechanical stability of the housing, in particular with respect to bending.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the first extension runs along at least <b>50</b>% of the extent of the second connection point, as seen along the longitudinal axis of the housing. The first extension can also extend over the entire length of the second connection point, as seen along the longitudinal axis. The mechanical stability of the housing is thus further improved.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, an area dimension of the first connection point and an area dimension of the second connection point is in each case at most <b>30</b>% of an area dimension of the bottom face of the cavity. The first connection point and the second connection point are thus small compared to the total area of the bottom face of the cavity.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When an optoelectronic semiconductor chip is mounted in the cavity as intended, it is thus easily ensured that the first connection point and the second connection point are completely covered by the optoelectronic semiconductor chip.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first lead frame part and the second lead frame part can be similar in respect of their basic shape. In particular, the second lead frame part can have a second inner region and/or a second edge region and/or a second front-side region and/or a second extent, and these elements can have some or also all of the features listed in conjunction with the first lead frame part.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to at least one embodiment of the housing, the second lead frame part and the first lead frame part are point-symmetrical to one another in respect of their basic shape, in particular point-symmetrical to the centre point of the housing. For example, the second lead frame part and the first lead frame part differ only by a marking for simplified identification of the polarity of the contacts of the housing. In particular, the first lead frame part and the second lead frame part are not axis-symmetrical in respect of their basic shape, neither to the longitudinal axis nor to the transverse axis.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Furthermore, an optoelectronic semiconductor component with a housing is specified. The housing described above is particularly suitable as a housing. Features mentioned in conjunction with the housing can therefore also be used for the optoelectronic semiconductor component, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The optoelectronic semiconductor component comprises, in particular, an optoelectronic semiconductor chip which is arranged, for example, in the cavity of the housing and is electrically conductively connected to the first connection point and the second connection point. The semiconductor chip is formed, for example, to generate and/or receive radiation, for example in the visible, ultraviolet or infrared spectral range. In particular, the optoelectronic semiconductor chip is formed with two contacts on the side facing the mounting side, for example as a flip chip.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic semiconductor component, the optoelectronic semiconductor chip completely covers the first connection point and the second connection point. Thus, in plan view of the optoelectronic semiconductor component, the lead frame of the optoelectronic semiconductor component is not visible within the cavity. All parts of the lead frame that are exposed in the cavity of the housing are therefore covered by the semiconductor chip when the semiconductor chip is in the mounted state.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic semiconductor component, the first connection point and the second connection point are each at most half the size of the optoelectronic semiconductor chip in plan view of the semiconductor component. In particular, the optoelectronic semiconductor chip overlaps both the first connection point and the second connection point.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic semiconductor component, the optoelectronic semiconductor chip is embedded in a potting compound. The potting compound is in particular permeable to the radiation to be received and/or generated in the optoelectronic semiconductor chip. Preferably, the potting compound does not at any point directly border the lead frame. For the potting compound, the choice of material can therefore be selected independently of its adhesion properties to metal surfaces.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further embodiments and practicalities will result from the following description of the exemplary embodiments in conjunction with the figures.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the figures:</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D, <b>1</b>E, <b>1</b>F and <b>1</b>G</figref> show an exemplary embodiment of a housing on the basis of a schematic plan view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), a schematic sectional view along the longitudinal axis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), a rear view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), a schematic plan view showing the course of the lead frame (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>), a perspective sectional view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>), as well as a schematic representation of the lead frame in a perspective front-side view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>) and a schematic rear-side view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>); and</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of an optoelectronic semiconductor component in schematic plan view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) and in an associated perspective sectional view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Identical, similar or similarly acting elements are provided with the same reference signs in the figures.

The first lead frame part <b>21</b> and the second lead frame part <b>22</b>, in particular their respective front-side regions, each have a C-shaped basic form, as illustrated by the line <b>85</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first front-side region <b>215</b> is distanced from the rear side <b>200</b> of the lead frame <b>2</b>, so that the first front-side region <b>215</b> has a comparatively small thickness, as does the second front-side region <b>225</b>. Seen from the rear side of the housing <b>1</b>, the first front-side region <b>215</b> and the second front-side region <b>225</b> are covered by material of the housing body <b>5</b>. A mechanical force transmission due to thermomechanical stresses between the first edge region <b>212</b> and the first inner region <b>211</b> is reduced compared to the situation in which a connecting region between the first inner region and the first edge region is not thinned, in particular in conjunction with the interruption of the first lead frame part <b>21</b> and the second lead frame part <b>22</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>81</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">This reduces the risk that thermomechanical stresses will cause an optoelectronic semiconductor chip fastened to the first connection point <b>31</b> and the second connection point <b>32</b> or an electrical connection between the optoelectronic semiconductor chip and the connection points <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> to be damaged due to thermomechanical stresses.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first lead frame part <b>21</b>, in particular the first front-side region <b>215</b> further comprises a first extension <b>217</b>.

Thus, in a side view of the housing <b>1</b>, the first lead frame part <b>21</b> and the second lead frame part <b>22</b> overlap due to the extensions <b>217</b>, <b>227</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Via the first extension <b>217</b> and the second extension <b>227</b>, the mechanical stability of the housing <b>1</b> is improved, in particular with respect to a bending or a breaking stress.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, the first inner region <b>215</b> has a cuboid basic shape and is covered at points by the first front-side region <b>215</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>, the first front-side region <b>215</b> extends along two edges <b>2110</b> of the first inner region, wherein these edges run perpendicular to each other.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Accordingly, the second front-side region <b>225</b> runs along two edges <b>2210</b> of the second inner region <b>221</b>.

The optoelectronic semiconductor component <b>9</b> further comprises an optoelectronic semiconductor chip <b>95</b>. The first connection point <b>31</b> and the second connection point <b>32</b> are each electrically conductively connected to a contact <b>951</b> of the optoelectronic semiconductor chip <b>95</b>, for example via a connecting means <b>97</b> such as a solder. The optoelectronic semiconductor chip <b>95</b> is formed in flip-chip geometry and has the contacts <b>951</b> in each case on the side facing the mounting side <b>10</b> of the housing <b>1</b>. For example, the semiconductor chip <b>95</b> is a light-emitting diode having a sapphire substrate as a growth substrate and an active region based on nitride compound semiconductor material for generating radiation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In plan view of the optoelectronic semiconductor component <b>9</b>, the optoelectronic semiconductor chip <b>95</b> completely covers the first connection point <b>31</b> and the second connection point <b>32</b>. In particular, the first connection point <b>31</b> and the second connection point <b>32</b> can be covered by metal material of the connection means <b>97</b>. The indentation <b>19</b> of the housing <b>1</b> delimits the lateral extent of the connecting means <b>97</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Waste heat generated during operation of the optoelectronic semiconductor component <b>9</b> can be dissipated directly in the vertical direction via the first front-side region <b>215</b> and the first inner region <b>211</b>, or via the second front-side region <b>225</b> and the second inner region <b>221</b> of the lead frame <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The optoelectronic semiconductor chip <b>95</b> is embedded in a potting compound <b>99</b>. The potting compound <b>99</b> is expediently permeable to the radiation to be generated and/or received by the optoelectronic semiconductor chip and can, for example, be mixed with a luminescent material. In particular, the potting compound <b>99</b> does not adjoin the lead frame <b>2</b> of the optoelectronic semiconductor component <b>9</b> at any point, and therefore the material for the potting compound <b>99</b> can be selected independently of how well the material adheres to metal surfaces.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Furthermore, no bonding wires are required for the electrical contacting of the optoelectronic semiconductor chip <b>95</b>. Thus, there is no risk of the potting compound <b>99</b> impairing the electrical contacting of the optoelectronic semiconductor chip <b>95</b>, for example when soldering the optoelectronic semiconductor component <b>9</b> to a connection carrier such as a printed circuit board. Furthermore, there is no risk of corrosion of the lead frame <b>2</b> within the cavity <b>17</b>, irrespective of whether the potting compound <b>99</b> is permeable to corrosive gases, such as hydrogen sulfide, and/or whether the potting compound <b>99</b> or the housing body <b>5</b> allows penetration paths to the lead frame <b>2</b> in the cavity <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The described embodiment of the housing <b>1</b> is particularly suitable for the realisation of small housing designs. For example, an extent of the housing along the longitudinal axis <b>81</b> is at most 3 mm or at most 2 mm. For example, the housing <b>1</b> is a housing for a light-emitting diode of the design <b>1608</b>, i.e. a light-emitting diode with a footprint of 1.6&#xd7;0.8 mm<sup>2</sup>, in particular in QFN (Quad Flat No Lead) technology. The electrical connections of the housing <b>1</b> therefore do not protrude laterally beyond the housing body <b>5</b> in plan view.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The figures are true to scale for an exemplary embodiment of design <b>1608</b>.
