id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A Stirling cycle machine with a liquid fuel/gaseous fuel burner. The burner may include a preheater to capture the thermal energy of the exhaust. The burner directs the preheated air to each burner head, where it enters a prechamber. Each burner head includes a fuel nozzle that directs liquid or gaseous fuel into the prechamber. The prechamber is fluidically connected to a combustion chamber via a prechamber nozzle that has a smaller opening than the prechamber. The burner head ignites the fuel air mixture in the prechamber with an ignitor located above or within the prechamber. The flame is initially lit as a diffusion flame in the prechamber. The flame is pushed out of the prechamber into the combustion chamber by an increased air flow rate. The liquid fuel from the nozzle now evaporates in the prechamber and forms a prevaporized flame in the combustion chamber.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

In most applications, the pistons are housed in a cylinder. A common problem encountered with such machines is that of friction generated by a sliding piston resulting from misalignment of the piston in the cylinder and lateral forces exerted on the piston by linkage of the piston to a rotating crankshaft. These increased side loads increase engine noise, increase piston wear, and decrease the efficiency and life of the engine. Additionally, because of the side loads, the drive requires more power to overcome these frictional forces, thus reducing the efficiency of the machine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Improvements have been made on drive mechanisms in an attempt to reduce these side loads, however, many of the improvements have resulted in heavier and bulkier machines.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for practical machines with minimal side loads on pistons.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a rocking beam drive mechanism for a machine is disclosed.

engines and refrigerators, have a long technological heritage, described in detail in Walker, Stirling Engines, Oxford University Press (1980), incorporated herein by reference. The principle underlying the Stirling cycle engine is the mechanical realization of the Stirling thermodynamic cycle: isovolumetric heating of a gas within a cylinder, isothermal expansion of the gas (during which work is performed by driving a piston), isovolumetric cooling, and isothermal compression. Additional background regarding aspects of Stirling cycle machines and improvements thereto is discussed in Hargreaves, The Phillips Stirling Engine (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1991), which is herein incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The principle of operation of a Stirling cycle machine is readily described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>E</figref>, wherein identical numerals are used to identify the same or similar parts.

A working fluid contained within cylinders <b>16</b> is constrained by seals from escaping around piston <b>12</b> and displacer <b>14</b>. The working fluid is chosen for its thermodynamic properties, as discussed in the description below, and is typically helium at a pressure of several atmospheres, however, any gas, including any inert gas, may be used, including, but not limited to, hydrogen, argon, neon, nitrogen, air and any mixtures thereof. The position of the displacer <b>14</b> governs whether the working fluid is in contact with the hot interface <b>18</b> or the cold interface <b>20</b>, corresponding, respectively, to the interfaces at which heat is supplied to and extracted from the working fluid. The supply and extraction of heat is discussed in further detail below. The volume of working fluid governed by the position of the piston <b>12</b> is referred to as the compression space <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">During the first phase of the Stirling cycle, the starting condition of which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the piston <b>12</b> compresses the fluid in the compression space <b>22</b>. The compression occurs at a substantially constant temperature because heat is extracted from the fluid to the ambient environment. The condition of the Stirling cycle machine <b>10</b> after compression is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. During the second phase of the cycle, the displacer <b>14</b> moves in the direction of the cold interface <b>20</b>, with the working fluid displaced from the region of the cold interface <b>20</b> to the region of the hot interface <b>18</b>. This phase may be referred to as the transfer phase. At the end of the transfer phase, the fluid is at a higher pressure since the working fluid has been heated at constant volume. The increased pressure is depicted symbolically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> by the reading of the pressure gauge <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">During the third phase (the expansion stroke) of the Stirling cycle machine, the volume of the compression space <b>22</b> increases as heat is drawn in from outside the Stirling cycle machine <b>10</b>, thereby converting heat to work. In practice, heat is provided to the fluid by means of a heater head (not shown) which is discussed in greater detail in the description below. At the end of the expansion phase, the compression space <b>22</b> is full of cold fluid, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>. During the fourth phase of the Stirling cycle machine <b>10</b>, fluid is transferred from the region of the hot interface <b>18</b> to the region of the cold interface <b>20</b> by motion of the displacer <b>14</b> in the opposing sense. At the end of this second transfer phase, the fluid fills the compression space <b>22</b> and cold interface <b>20</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and is ready for a repetition of the compression phase. The Stirling cycle is depicted in a P-V (pressure-volume) diagram as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Additionally, on passing from the region of the hot interface <b>18</b> to the region of the cold interface <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the fluid may pass through a regenerator (shown as <b>408</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). A regenerator is a matrix of material having a large ratio of surface area to volume which serves to absorb heat from the fluid when it enters from the region of the hot interface <b>18</b> and to heat the fluid when it passes from the region of the cold interface <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Stirling cycle machines have not generally been used in practical applications due to several daunting challenges to their development. These involve practical considerations such as efficiency and lifetime. Accordingly, there is a need for more Stirling cycle machines with minimal side loads on pistons, increased efficiency and lifetime.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">The principle of operation of a Stirling cycle machine or Stirling engine is further discussed in detail in U.S. Pat.

Since the distal ends of the link rods <b>226</b> and <b>230</b> are connected to the rocking beam <b>216</b> at pivots <b>232</b> and <b>236</b>, the distal ends of the link rods <b>226</b> and <b>230</b> also follow this arc path, resulting in an angular deviation <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> from the longitudinal axis of motion of their respective pistons <b>202</b> and <b>204</b>. The coupling means <b>234</b> and <b>238</b> are configured such that any angular deviation <b>244</b> and <b>242</b> from the link rods <b>226</b> and <b>230</b> experienced by the piston rods <b>224</b> and <b>228</b> is minimized. Essentially, the angular deviation <b>244</b> and <b>242</b> is absorbed by the coupling means <b>234</b> and <b>238</b> so that the piston rods <b>224</b> and <b>228</b> maintain substantially linear longitudinal motion to reduce side loads on the pistons <b>204</b> and <b>202</b>. A stationary linear bearing <b>220</b> may also be placed inside the cylinder <b>208</b> or <b>206</b>, or along coupling assemblies <b>212</b> or <b>210</b>, to further absorb any angular deviation <b>244</b> or <b>242</b> thus keeping the piston push rod <b>224</b> or <b>228</b> and the piston <b>204</b> or <b>202</b> in linear motion along the longitudinal axis of the piston <b>204</b> or <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Therefore, in view of reciprocating motion of pistons <b>202</b> and <b>204</b>, it is necessary to keep the motion of pistons <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> as close to linear as possible because the deviation <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> from longitudinal axis of reciprocating motion of pistons <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> causes noise, reduction of efficiency, increase of friction to the wall of cylinder, increase of side-load, and low durability of the parts. The alignment of the cylinders <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> and the arrangement of crankshaft <b>214</b>, piston rods <b>224</b> and <b>228</b>, link rods <b>226</b> and <b>230</b>, and connecting rod <b>222</b>, hence, may influence on, amongst other things, the efficiency and/or the volume of the device. For the purpose of increasing the linearity of the piston motion as mentioned, the pistons (shown as <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>) are preferably as close to the side of the respective cylinders <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> as possible.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In another embodiment reducing angular deviation of link rods, link rods <b>226</b> and <b>230</b> substantially linearly reciprocate along longitudinal axis of motion of respective pistons <b>204</b> and <b>202</b> to decrease the angular deviation and thus to decrease the side load applied to each piston <b>204</b> and <b>202</b>. The angular deviation defines the deviation of the link rod <b>226</b> or <b>230</b> from the longitudinal axis of the piston <b>204</b> or <b>202</b>. Numerals <b>244</b> and <b>242</b> designate the angular deviation of the link rods <b>226</b> and <b>230</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Therefore, the position of coupling assembly <b>212</b> influences the angular displacement of the link rod <b>226</b>, based on the length of the distance between the end pivot <b>232</b> and the rocker pivot <b>218</b> of the rocking beam <b>216</b>. Thus, the position of the coupling assemblies may be such that the angular displacement of the link rod <b>226</b> is reduced. For the link rod <b>230</b>, the length of the coupling assembly <b>210</b> also may be determined and placed to reduce the angular displacement of the link rod <b>230</b>, based on the length of the distance between the end pivot <b>236</b> and the rocker pivot <b>218</b> of the rocking beam <b>216</b>. Therefore, the length of the link rods <b>226</b> and <b>230</b>, the length of coupling assemblies <b>212</b> and <b>210</b>, and the length of the rocking beam <b>216</b> are significant parameters that greatly influence and/or determine the angular deviation of the link rods <b>226</b> and <b>230</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The exemplary embodiment has a straight rocking beam <b>216</b> having the end points <b>232</b> and <b>236</b>, the rocker pivot <b>218</b>, and the connecting pivot <b>240</b> along the same axis.

Since motor/generator <b>1000</b> is mounted to crankcase <b>1008</b>, pressurization of crankcase with a charge fluid may result in crankcase deformation, which in turn may lead to misalignments between motor/generator <b>1000</b> and crankshaft <b>1006</b> and cause crankshaft <b>1006</b> to deflect. Because rocking beam drives <b>1010</b> and <b>1012</b> are coupled to crankshaft <b>1006</b>, deflection of crankshaft <b>1006</b> may lead to failure of rocking beam drives <b>1010</b> and <b>1012</b>. Thus, in one embodiment of the machine, a motor/generator coupling assembly is used to couple the motor/generator <b>1000</b> to crankshaft <b>1006</b>. The motor/generator coupling assembly accommodates differences in alignment between motor/generator <b>1000</b> and crankshaft <b>1006</b> which may contribute to failure of rocking beam drives <b>1010</b> and <b>1012</b> during operation.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>G</figref>, in one embodiment, the motor/generator coupling assembly is a spline assembly that includes spline shaft <b>1004</b>, sleeve rotor <b>1002</b> of motor/generator <b>1000</b>, and crankshaft <b>1006</b>.

Thus, work is transferred from piston <b>802</b> to piston <b>806</b> to piston <b>804</b> to piston <b>808</b> so that with a full revolution of crankshaft <b>814</b>, all pistons have exerted work by moving from the top to the bottom of their respective cylinders.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, together with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C</figref>, illustrate the 90 degree phase difference between the pistons in the exemplary embodiment. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A</figref>, although the cylinders are shown in a linear path, this is for illustration purposes only. In the exemplary embodiment of a four cylinder Stirling cycle machine, the flow path of the working gas contained within the cylinder working space follows a figure eight pattern. Thus, the working spaces of cylinders <b>1200</b>, <b>1202</b>, <b>1204</b>, and <b>1206</b> are connected in a figure eight pattern, for example, from cylinder <b>1200</b> to cylinder <b>1202</b> to cylinder <b>1204</b> to cylinder <b>1208</b>, the fluid flow pattern follows a figure eight. Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, an unwrapped view of cylinders <b>1200</b>, <b>1202</b>, <b>1204</b>, and <b>1206</b>, taken along the line B-B (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref>) is illustrated. The 90 degree phase difference between pistons as described above allows for the working gas in the warm section <b>1212</b> of cylinder <b>1204</b> to be delivered to the cold section <b>1222</b> of cylinder <b>1206</b>. As piston <b>802</b> and <b>808</b> are 90 degrees out of phase, the working gas in the warm section <b>1214</b> of cylinder <b>1206</b> is delivered to the cold section <b>1216</b> of cylinder <b>1200</b>. As piston <b>802</b> and piston <b>806</b> are also 90 degrees out of phase, the working gas in the warm section <b>1208</b> of cylinder <b>1200</b> is delivered to the cold section <b>1218</b> of cylinder <b>1202</b>. And as piston <b>804</b> and piston <b>806</b> are also 90 degrees out of phase, so the working gas in the warm section <b>1210</b> of cylinder <b>1202</b> is delivered to the cold section <b>1220</b> of cylinder <b>1204</b>. Once the working gas of a warm section of a first cylinder enters the cold section of a second cylinder, the working gas begins to compress, and the piston within the second cylinder, in its down stroke, thereafter forces the compressed working gas back through a regenerator <b>1224</b> and heater head <b>1226</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>), and back into the warm section of the first cylinder. Once inside the warm section of the first cylinder, the gas expands and drives the piston within that cylinder downward, thus causing the working gas within the cold section of that first cylinder to be driven through the preceding regenerator and heater head, and into the cylinder. This cyclic transmigration characteristic of working gas between cylinders <b>1200</b>, <b>1202</b>, <b>1204</b>, and <b>1206</b> is possible because pistons <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, <b>806</b>, and <b>808</b> are connected, via drives <b>810</b> and <b>812</b>, to a common crankshaft <b>814</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), in such a way that the cyclical movement of each piston is approximately 90 degrees in advance of the movement of the proceeding piston, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Rolling Diaphragm, Metal Bellows, Airlock, and Pressure Regulator</heading><p id="p-0199" num="0198">In some embodiments of the Stirling cycle machine, lubricating fluid is used.

This pressure differential inflates seal <b>1300</b> and allows seal <b>1300</b> to act as a dynamic seal as the pressure differential ensures that rolling diaphragm maintains its form throughout operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>C-<b>13</b>H</figref> illustrate how the pressure differential effects the rolling diaphragm. The pressure differential causes the rolling diaphragm <b>1300</b> to conform to the shape of the bottom seal piston <b>1310</b> as it moves with the piston rod <b>1302</b>, and prevents separation of the seal <b>1300</b> from a surface of the piston <b>1310</b> during operation. Such separation may cause seal failure. The pressure differential causes the rolling diaphragm <b>1300</b> to maintain constant contact with the bottom seal piston <b>1310</b> as it moves with the piston rod <b>1302</b>. This occurs because one side of the seal <b>1300</b> will always have pressure exerted on it thereby inflating the seal <b>1300</b> to conform to the surface of the bottom seal piston <b>1310</b>. In some embodiments, the top seal piston <b>1328</b> &#x2018;rolls over&#x2019; the corners of the rolling diaphragm <b>1300</b> that are in contact with the bottom seal piston <b>1310</b>, so as to further maintain the seal <b>1300</b> in contact with the bottom seal piston <b>1310</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the pressure differential is in the range of 10 to 15 PSI. The smaller pressure in the pressure differential is preferably in crankcase <b>1304</b>, so that the rolling diaphragm <b>1300</b> may be inflated into the crankcase <b>1304</b>. However, in other embodiments, the pressure differential may have a greater or smaller range of value.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The pressure differential may be created by various methods including, but not limited to, the use of the following: a pressurized lubrication system, a pneumatic pump, sensors, an electric pump, by oscillating the rocking beam to create a pressure rise in the crankcase <b>1304</b>, by creating an electrostatic charge on the rolling diaphragm <b>1300</b>, or other similar methods. In some embodiments, the pressure differential is created by pressurizing the crankcase <b>1304</b> to a pressure that is below the mean pressure of the working space <b>1306</b>. In some embodiments the crankcase <b>1304</b> is pressurized to a pressure in the range of 10 to 15 PSI below the mean pressure of the working space <b>1306</b>, however, in various other embodiments, the pressure differential may be smaller or greater. Further detail regarding the rolling diaphragm is included below.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>C, <b>13</b>G, and <b>13</b>H</figref>, however, another embodiment of the Stirling machine is shown, wherein airlock space <b>1312</b> is located between working space <b>1306</b> and crankcase <b>1304</b>. Airlock space <b>1312</b> maintains a constant volume and pressure necessary to create the pressure differential necessary for the function of rolling diaphragm <b>1300</b> as described above. In one embodiment, airlock <b>1312</b> is not absolutely sealed off from working space <b>1306</b>, so the pressure of airlock <b>1312</b> is equal to the mean pressure of working space <b>1306</b>. Thus, in some embodiments, the lack of an effective seal between the working space and the crankcase contributes to the need for an airlock space. Thus, the airlock space, in some embodiments, may be eliminated by a more efficient and effective seal.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">During operation, the working space <b>1306</b> mean pressure may vary so as to cause airlock <b>1312</b> mean pressure to vary as well. One reason the pressure may tend to vary is that during operation the working space may get hotter, which in turn may increase the pressure in the working space, and consequently in the airlock as well since the airlock and working space are in fluid communication. In such a case, the pressure differential between airlock <b>1312</b> and crankcase <b>1304</b> will also vary, thereby causing unnecessary stresses in rolling diaphragms <b>1300</b> that may lead to seal failure. Therefore, some embodiments of the machine, the mean pressure within airlock <b>1312</b> is regulated so as to maintain a constant desired pressure differential between airlock <b>1312</b> and crankcase <b>1304</b>, and ensuring that rolling diaphragms <b>1300</b> stay inflated and maintains their form. In some embodiments, a pressure transducer is used to monitor and manage the pressure differential between the airlock and the crankcase, and regulate the pressure accordingly so as to maintain a constant pressure differential between the airlock and the crankcase. Various embodiments of the pressure regulator that may be used are described in further detail below, and in U.S. Pat. No. 7,310,945, issued Dec. 25, 2007, to Gurski et al., which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">A constant pressure differential between the airlock <b>1312</b> and crankcase <b>1304</b> may be achieved by adding or removing working fluid from airlock <b>1312</b> via a pump or a release valve. Alternatively, a constant pressure differential between airlock <b>1312</b> and crankcase <b>1304</b> may be achieved by adding or removing working fluid from crankcase <b>1304</b> via a pump or a release valve. The pump and release valve may be controlled by the pressure regulator. Working fluid may be added to airlock <b>1312</b> (or crankcase <b>1304</b>) from a separate source, such as a working fluid container, or may be transferred over from crankcase <b>1304</b>. Should working fluid be transferred from crankcase <b>1304</b> to airlock <b>1312</b>, it may be desirable to filter the working fluid before passing it into airlock <b>1312</b> so as to prevent any lubricant from passing from crankcase <b>1304</b> into airlock <b>1312</b>, and ultimately into working space <b>1306</b>, as this may result in engine failure.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In some embodiments of the machine, crankcase <b>1304</b> may be charged with a fluid having different thermal properties than the working fluid. For example, where the working gas is helium or hydrogen, the crankcase may be charged with argon. Thus, the crankcase is pressurized. In some embodiments, helium is used, but in other embodiments, any inert gas, as described herein, may be used. Thus, the crankcase is a wet pressurized crankcase in the exemplary embodiment. In other embodiments where a lubricating fluid is not used, the crankcase is not wet.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In the exemplary embodiments, rolling diaphragms <b>1300</b> do not allow gas or liquid to pass through them, which allows working space <b>1306</b> to remain dry and crankcase <b>1304</b> to be wet sumped with a lubricating fluid. Allowing a wet sump crankcase <b>1304</b> increases the efficiency and life of the engine as there is less friction in rocking beam drives <b>1316</b>. In some embodiments, the use of roller bearings or ball bearings in drives <b>1316</b> may also be eliminated with the use of lubricating fluid and rolling diaphragms <b>1300</b>.

In these embodiments, the rolling diaphragm and/or bellows is required to operate with as much as 3000 psi across it (and in some embodiments, up to 1500 psi or higher). In this case, the rolling diaphragm and/or bellows seal forms the working gas (helium, hydrogen, or otherwise) containment barrier for the machine (engine in the exemplary embodiment). Also, in these embodiments, the need for a heavy, pressure-rated, structural vessel to contain the bottom end of the engine is eliminated, since it is now required to simply contain lubricating fluid (oil is used as a lubricating fluid in the exemplary embodiment) and air at ambient pressure, like a conventional internal combustion (&#x201c;IC&#x201d;) engine.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">The capability to use a rolling diaphragm and/or bellows seal with such an extreme pressure across it depends on the interaction of several parameters.

The rolling diaphragm and/or bellows fatigue life is generally limited by the combined stress from both the tensile (and hoop) load, due to pressure differential, as well as the fatigue due to the bending as the fabric rolls through the convolution.

For a fiber-reinforced material, the stress in the fibers themselves (during the prescribed deflection in the exemplary embodiments) is reduced as the fiber diameter decreases. The lower resultant stress for the same level of bending allows for an increased fatigue life limit. As the fiber diameter is further reduced, flexibility to decrease the radius of convolution Rc is achieved, while keeping the bending stress in the fiber under its endurance limit. At the same time, as Rc decreases, the tensile load on the fabric is reduced since there is less unsupported area in the annulus between the piston and cylinder.

Based on the equation: Sb=E*tb/(2*R), it is clear that minimizing tb in direct proportion to Rc should not increase the bending stress. The minimum thickness for the exemplary embodiments of the rolling diaphragm and/or bellows material or membrane is directly related to the minimum fiber diameter that is used in the reinforcement of the elastomer. The smaller the fibers used, the smaller resultant Rc for a given stress level.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0237">Another limiting component of load on the rolling diaphragm and/or bellows is the hoop stress in the convolution (which is theoretically the same in magnitude as the axial load while supported by the piston or cylinder). The governing equation for that load is as follows:</p><p id="p-0261" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Sh=Pd*Rc/tb </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0262" num="0238">Thus, if Rc is decreased in direct proportion to tb, then there is no increase of stress on the membrane in this region. However, if this ratio is reduced in a manner that decreases Rc to a greater ratio than tb then parameters must be balanced. Thus, decreasing tb with respect to Rc requires the rolling diaphragm and/or bellows to carry a heavier stress due to pressure, but makes for a reduced stress level due to bending. The pressure-based load is essentially constant, so this may be favorable&#x2014;since the bending load is cyclic, therefore it is the bending load component that ultimately limits fatigue life.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0239">For bending stress reduction, tb ideally should be at a minimum, and Rc ideally should be at a maximum. E ideally is also at a minimum. For hoop stress reduction, Rc ideally is small, and tb ideally is large.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0240">Thus, the critical parameters for the rolling diaphragm and/or bellows membrane material are:</p><p id="p-0265" num="0241">E, Elastic Modulus of the membrane material;</p><p id="p-0266" num="0242">tb, membrane thickness (and/or fiber diameter);</p><p id="p-0267" num="0243">Sut, Ultimate tensile strength of the rolling diaphragm and/or bellows; and</p><p id="p-0268" num="0244">Slcf, The limiting fatigue strength of the rolling diaphragm and/or bellows.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0245">Thus, from E, tb and Sut, the minimum acceptable Rc may be calculated. Next, using Rc, Slcf, and tb, the maximum Pd may be calculates. Rc may be adjusted to shift the bias of load (stress) components between the steady state pressure stress and the cyclic bending stress. Thus, the ideal rolling diaphragm and/or bellows material is extremely thin, extremely strong in tension, and very limber in flexion.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0246">Thus, in some embodiments, the rolling diaphragm and/or bellows material (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;membrane&#x201d;), is made from carbon fiber nanotubes.

In a some embodiments, the exhaust flow concentrator <b>3302</b> does not carry any load and may therefore, operate at 1000.degree. C. or higher. In contrast, the heater tubes <b>3304</b> generally operate at 700.degree. C.

This is due in part to the swirl induced in the flow of the exhaust gases and the sudden expansion as the exhaust gases exit the burner. The high exhaust gas flow rates at the top of the heater tubes creates hot spots at the top of the heater tubes and reduces the exhaust gas flow and heat transfer to the lower sections of the heater tubes. Local overheating (hot spots) may result in failure of the heater tubes and thereby the failure of the engine. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> is a perspective view of an exhaust flow axial equalizer in accordance with an embodiment.

The maximum working gas temperature, however, is typically limited by the properties of the heater head. For an external combustion engine with a tube heater head, the maximum temperature is limited by the metallurgical properties of the heater tubes. If the heater tubes become too hot, they may soften and fail resulting in engine shut down. Alternatively, at too high of a temperature the tubes will be severely oxidized and fail. It is, therefore, important to engine performance to control the temperature of the heater tubes. A temperature sensing device, such as a thermocouple, may be used to measure the temperature of the heater tubes. The temperature sensor mounting scheme may thermally bond the sensor to the heater tube and isolate the sensor from the much hotter combustion gases. The mounting scheme should be sufficiently robust to withstand the hot oxidizing environment of the combustion-gas and impinging flame that occur near the heater tubes for the life of the heater head. One set of mounting solutions include brazing or welding thermocouples directly to the heater tubes. The thermocouples would be mounted on the part of the heater tubes exposed to the hottest combustion gas. Other possible mounting schemes permit the replacement of the temperature sensor. In one embodiment, the temperature sensor is in a thermowell thermally bonded to the heater tube. In another embodiment, the mounting scheme is a mount, such as a sleeve, that mechanically holds the temperature sensor against the heater tube.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0290"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref> is a side view in cross section of a cylinder <b>4204</b> and a burner <b>4210</b>.

By placing the straight portion <b>5002</b> of the helical heater tube outboard of the gap <b>5009</b>, the pressure drop for exhaust gas passing through the helical heater tubes is increased, thereby forcing more of the exhaust gas through the helical coils where the heat transfer and heat exchange area are high.

The difficulty encountered in integral casting of radial pin fins is discussed further below. A pin fin that could be cast as part of cylindrical wall would allow the inexpensive fabrication of a highly effective heater head and/or cooler for a Stirling engine.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0307">Castings are made by creating negative forms of the desired part. All forms of production casting (sand, investment and injection) involves forming extended surfaces and details by injecting material into a mold and then removing the mold from the material leaving the desired negative or positive form behind. Removing the mold from the material requires that all the extended surfaces are at least parallel. In fact, good design practice requires slight draft on these extended surfaces so that they release cleanly. Forming radial pins on the outside or inside of a cylinder would require the molds to contain tens or hundreds of parts that pull apart in different directions. Such a mold would be cost prohibitive.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0308">In accordance various embodiments, pins or fins may be cast onto the inside and outside surface of Stirling heat exchangers using production sand, investment or metal injection casting methods.

It should be noted that the technology herein described may advantageously be applied more generally in any other heat exchanger application. All the pins <b>5202</b> in each group <b>5208</b> are parallel to each other. Only the pins <b>5202</b> in the center of the group are truly radial. The pins on the outside of the group, such as those designated by numeral <b>5204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>52</b>C and <b>53</b>D</figref>, are angled inward from a local radius such as to be substantially parallel to a radial line <b>5212</b> toward the center of the group. In addition, the pins on the outside of the group are preferably longer, typically by a small amount, than pins closer to the center of the group.

Several mold pieces are then assembled to form the negative form for a sand casting. In investment mold casting, the wax positive can be formed in an injection mold with only a handful of separate parts that pull apart in different directions. The resulting mold is formed at an acceptable cost, thereby making production of a pin fin heater head economically practical.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0310">Casting of a heater head having protuberances, such as pins, extending to the interior and exterior of a part with cylindrical walls may be achieved, in accordance with various embodiments, by investment, or lost-wax, casting, as well as by sand casting, die casting, or other casting processes. The interior or exterior protuberances, or both, may be integrally cast as part of the head.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0311">While typically more cheaply accomplished than machining or assembly of the pin arrays, casting pin arrays may still have attendant difficulties and substantial costs. Additionally, the casting process may result in a heater head that is less than fully densely populated with pins, thus increasing the fraction of gases failing to collide with the heater head surface and reducing the efficiency of heat transfer.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0312">One embodiment of the method for populating the surfaces of heater head <b>5100</b> with heat transfer pins entails fabrication of heater <b>5100</b> and arrays of heat transfer pins in separate fabrication processes. An array <b>5250</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b>B</figref> as <b>5350</b>) of heat transfer pins <b>5252</b> may be cast or injection molded with panel <b>5254</b> resulting in an integral backing panel structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b>D</figref>. Pin arrays <b>5250</b>, after casting or molding, are mounted to the inner and outer surfaces of the heater head by a high temperature braze. Thus, a more densely populated head with a resultant low rate of gas leakage past the pins may advantageously be achieved. In other embodiments, panels <b>5254</b> may be secured by various mechanical means to the heater head.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0313">Transient liquid-phase (TLP) bonding, as described, for example, in the Aerospace Structural Metals Handbook, Code 4218, p. 6 (1999) is particularly advantageous for brazing the panels to the head, since nickel based superalloys, typically employed for fabrication of the head, is difficult to weld by conventional processes, and operates in a high stress and high temperature environment. Advantages of TLP bonding in this application are that the parts braced by TLP are effectively welded using the parent material and have nearly the same tensile strength properties as integrally cast parts. TLP bonds do not remelt at elevated temperatures, whereas typical brazes will remelt at the brazing temperature. This is of particular significance in the case of continuous operation at elevated temperatures where temperature excursions may occur, as in the present application.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0314">The panels <b>5254</b> of pins may be attached to the interior or exterior of either the heater head or the cooler by other means.

In another embodiment, the panels are attached to the heater head or cooler by brazing.

Lastly, the dividers may advantageously provide a convenient structure to which to attach panels of pins to the heater head, in one embodiment, and a parting line for casting operations, in accordance with a further embodiment.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0316">Dividers <b>5306</b> may serve to improve the thermal effectiveness of the pin fin arrays in the following manner. Referring, once again, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b>A</figref>, the rate of heat transfer for a fluid flowing through staggered pin fins is significantly higher than for fluid flowing through aligned pin fins. Fluid approaching a staggered pin array <b>5208</b> would travel at a 45-degree angle to an axial path along the length of the cylinder, with the skew direction designated by numeral <b>5214</b>. In order to provide for improved thermal transfer, dividers <b>5206</b>, <b>5306</b> are provided, in accordance some embodiments, to force the fluid flow through the staggered array of pin fins along a path designated by numeral <b>5212</b>. In addition to forcing the flow to travel axially, the dividers provide convenient interfaces and joining planes for the casting molds described above.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0317">In certain embodiments, individual arrays <b>5250</b>, each with its associated panel segment <b>5254</b>, comprise arcuate fractions of the circumferential distance around the heater head. This is apparent in the top view of the heater head assembly shown in perspective in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b>A</figref>. Cylinder head <b>5320</b> is shown, as is exterior surface <b>5302</b> of the heater head. Backer segments supporting arrays of heat transfer pins are not shown but are inserted, during assembly, in spaces <b>5304</b> surrounding exterior surface <b>5302</b> of the heater head. Between successive heat transfer pin array segments are trapezoidal dividers <b>5306</b> which are baffled to block the flow of exhaust gases in a downward direction through any path other than past the heat transfer pins.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0318">In one embodiment, flow dividers <b>5306</b> include structures for mechanically retaining the panel segments <b>5254</b> during assembly, before brazing, or simply to mechanically retain the panels <b>5254</b> against heater head <b>5302</b>.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0319">In order to maximize engine power, the hottest part of the heater head is preferably at the highest temperature allowed, considering the metallurgical creep and tensile strength, stress, and appropriate factors of safety. Maintaining the hottest part of the heater head at the highest temperature requires measuring the temperature of the hottest part of the heater head. The dividers provide a convenient location and routing for temperature sensors on the heater had to any axial location along the pin fin arrays. Hot gas flow path <b>5313</b> (shown also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b>A</figref>), is defined, on the outside, by gas flow channel cover <b>5340</b>. Since exhaust gases do not flow through dividers <b>5306</b>, a temperature sensor, such as thermocouple <b>5138</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b>A and <b>53</b>C</figref>) is advantageously disposed in divider <b>5306</b> in order to monitor the temperature of heater head <b>5100</b> with which the temperature sensor is in thermal contact. The position of pin arrays <b>5250</b> and temperature sensor <b>5138</b> mounted within divider <b>5306</b> is shown more clearly in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b>B</figref> in which the pin backer has been removed.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0320">Temperature sensing device <b>5138</b> is preferably disposed within divider <b>5306</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b>B</figref>. More particularly, temperature sensing tip <b>5339</b> of temperature sensor <b>5138</b> is preferably located in the slot corresponding to divider <b>5306</b> as nearly as possible to cylinder head <b>5320</b> in that this area is typically the hottest part of the heater head. Alternatively, temperature sensor <b>5138</b> may be mounted directly to cylinder head <b>5320</b>, however location of the sensor in the slot, as described, is used in some embodiments. Engine performance, in terms of both power and efficiency, is highest at the highest possible temperature, yet the maximum temperature is typically limited by metallurgical properties. Therefore, sensor <b>5138</b> should be placed to measure the temperature of the hottest, and therefore the limiting, part of the heater head. Additionally, temperature sensor <b>5138</b> should be insulated from combustion gases and walls of divider <b>5306</b> by ceramic insulation <b>5342</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b>C</figref>. The ceramic can also form an adhesive bond with the walls of the divider to retain the temperature sensor in place. Electrical leads <b>5344</b> of temperature sensor <b>5138</b> should also be electrically insulated.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0321">Although the burner is designed to have circumferential symmetry, hot spots may develop on heater head <b>5320</b>. Adding to the problem, the alloys typically employed for fabrication of the heater head, on account of their high melting point, have relatively poor thermal conductivity. Once hot spots form, they are apt to endure because the gas flow outside the head is axial rather than circumferential, since dividers <b>5306</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b>A</figref>) impede any circumferential flow. Additionally, heating may increase local gas viscosity thereby redirecting more flow to other channels. In order to even out the temperature distribution on the heater head, a layer of highly thermally conductive metal, such as copper, of thickness greater than 0.001 in. and preferably about 0.005 in. is applied to interior surface <b>5348</b> of heater head <b>5320</b>, by deposition or plating, or other application method. Alternatively, a similar coating may be applied to the exterior surface, in accordance with another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0322">In order to keep the size of the Stirling cycle engine small, it is important to maximize the heat flux from the combustion gas through the heater head. Whereas prior art employed loops of pipe in which heat transfer to the working fluid is achieved, loops engender both low reliability (since the loops are mechanically vulnerable) and higher cost, due to the more complicated loop geometry and extra materials. The limiting constraint on the heat flux are the thermo-mechanical properties of the heater head material that must be able to withstand the high temperatures of the combustion chamber while maintaining the structural integrity of the pressurized head. The maximum design temperature is determined by the hottest point on the heater head which is typically at the top of the wall. Ideally, the entire heater wall hot section would be at this maximum temperature, as may be controlled, for example, by controlling the fuel flow.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0323">As combustion gases travel past the heater head in gas flow channels <b>5113</b>, <b>5313</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b>A</figref>), the gas temperature decreases as heat is transferred from the gas to the heater head. As a result, the maximum allowed heater head temperature at the top of the gas flow channel must be set by the material used for the heater head. The material is preferably chosen from the family of high nickel alloys, commonly known as super alloys, such as Inconel 600 (having a maximum temperature T.sub.max=800.degree. C. before softening), Inconel 625 (T.sub.max=900.degree. C.), Inconel 754 (T.sub.max=1080.degree. C.), or Hastelloy GMR 235 (T.sub.max=935.degree. C.). The gas in gas channel <b>5113</b>, <b>5313</b> may cool by as much as 350.degree. C. on transit through the channel, resulting in underheating of the bottom of the hot zone.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0324">In accordance with some embodiments, the temperature profile of the heater wall is controlled by means of heat transfer geometry, as now described. One method for controlling the geometry is by means of providing a variable cross-section gas flow channel <b>5113</b>, <b>5313</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b>A and <b>54</b>A</figref>). The radial dimension (perpendicular to the wall of the heater head), and thus the cross-section of the channel, is large at the top of the heater wall, thereby allowing much of the gas to bypass the pin array at the top of the wall. The bypass allows hotter gas to reach the pin array at the bottom of the wall thereby allowing the bottom pin array to operate closer to its maximum temperature. The temperature gradient from the top of the heater to the bottom of the hot section (before regenerator volume <b>5132</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b>A</figref>) has been reduced from as much as 350.degree. C. to 100.degree. C. using a variable cross-section gas flow channel.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0325">A second method for controlling the geometry is by varying the population density and the geometry of the pin array as a function of position along the gas flow channel. The geometry of the pins may be adjusted by varying the height/diameter (H/D) ratio of the pins. If a casting process is used to form the pin array, the range of H/D rations may be limited by the process. If pin rings are used, the range of H/D ratios may be extended.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0326">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>53</b>E, <b>53</b>F, <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B</figref>, arrow <b>5402</b> designates the path of heated exhaust gases past heater head <b>5100</b>.

(For clarity, heat transfer pins <b>5130</b> and <b>5124</b> are shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>A</figref>.

Successive heat transfer pins <b>5406</b>, <b>5408</b>, and <b>5410</b>, for example, present a progressively larger cross section to the flow of exhaust gas along path <b>5402</b>. Thus, while the exhaust gas has transferred some fraction of its heat prior to arrival at the lower pins, heat is extracted there with a greater conduction rate, thereby reducing the temperature gradient between the top <b>5412</b> and bottom <b>5414</b> of the path of working fluid between expansion volume <b>5198</b> and regenerator volume <b>5132</b>. Typical temperatures of the surface of expansion cylinder <b>5115</b> are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>A</figref>: 850.degree. C. at the top of the cylinder, 750.degree.

C. at the end of the cylinder closest to the regenerator volume.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0327">Another method for achieving more even distribution of heat from the exhaust gases to the heater head is to create a tapered divider on the outside diameter of the heater head by means of concentric tapered pin backer <b>5146</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>A</figref>. The cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>A</figref> shows how tapered pin backer <b>5146</b> allows some of the hottest exhaust gas to bypass the pins near the top of the heater head. Pin backer <b>5146</b> creates a narrowing annular gap on the outside of the pins that progressively forces more and more of the exhaust gases into the pin heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0328">Another method for increasing the surface area of the interface between a solid such as heater head <b>5100</b> and a fluid such as combustion gases as discussed above is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>55</b>A-<b>55</b>D</figref>.

The thickness of ring <b>5162</b>, which may be referred to as a &#x2018;heat transfer pin ring&#x2019; is comparable to the thickness of the heat transfer pins discussed above, and is governed by the strength of the heat-conductive material at the high temperature of the combustion gases traversing holes <b>5160</b>.

It is typically desirable to operate Stirling cycle engines at as high a working gas pressure as possible, thus, enabling the head to withstand higher pressures is highly advantageous. In designing the heater head, it must be borne in mind that increasing the pressure at a given operating temperature typically requires increasing the heater head wall thickness in direct proportion. On the other had, thickening the heater head wall results in a longer thermal conduction path between the exterior heat source and the working gas.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0335">Moreover, thermal conduction increases with heat exchanger surface area, thus thermal efficiency is increased by increasing the diameter of the heater head. Stress in the wall, however, is substantially proportional to the diameter of the head, thus increasing the head diameter, at a given temperature and interior gas pressure, requires increasing the wall thickness in direct proportion.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0336">The strength considerations are tantamount at typical Stirling engine head temperatures, in fact, they drive the maximum operating temperature, since, as discussed, efficiency increases with temperature. Both creep and ultimate tensile strengths of materials tend to fall off precipitously when specified elevated temperatures are reached. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b>A</figref>, the yield strength at 0.2% offset and ultimate tensile strength are shown for the GMR 235 nickel alloy in typical representation of the qualitative behavior of nickel alloys. Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b>B</figref>, it can be seen that the 0.01% per hour creep rate strength of GMR 235 falls from 40 ksi to half as the temperature rises from 1500.degree.

Ribs <b>5800</b> are characterized by an interior bore <b>5802</b>. The creep strength and rupture strength of heater head <b>5801</b> is thus determined predominantly by an effective thickness <b>5804</b> of the heater head and the interior bore diameter <b>5802</b>. Heat conduction through the heater head is not limited by thickness <b>5804</b> since intervening segments <b>5806</b> of the head are narrower and provide enhanced heat conduction. Ribs <b>5800</b> not only relieve hoop stresses on outer wall <b>5808</b> of head <b>5801</b> but additionally provide supplemental surface area interior to the heater head and thus advantageously enhance heat transfer to the working fluid.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0338">Further advantages of providing ribs <b>5800</b> interior to the heater head include reducing the temperature gradient across the head wall <b>5808</b> for a given rate of heat transfer, as well as allowing operation at higher hot end working temperatures.

Regenerator</p><p id="p-0369" num="0345">A regenerator is used in a Stirling cycle machine, as discussed above and as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,591,609, and 6,862,883, to add and remove heat from the working fluid during different phases of the Stirling cycle. The regenerator used in a Stirling cycle machine must be capable of high heat transfer rates which typically suggests a high heat transfer area and low flow resistance to the working fluid. Low flow resistance also contributes to the overall efficiency of the engine by reducing the energy required to pump the working fluid. Additionally, a regenerator must be fabricated in such a manner as to resist spalling or fragmentation because fragments may be entrained in the working fluid and transported to the compression or expansion cylinders and result in damage to the piston seals.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0346">One regenerator design uses several hundred stacked metal screens. While exhibiting a high heat transfer surface, low flow resistance and low spalling, metal screens may suffer the disadvantage that their cutting and handling may generate small metal fragments that must be removed before assembling the regenerator. Additionally, stainless steel woven wire mesh contributes appreciably to the cost of the Stirling cycle engine.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0347">A three dimensional random fiber network, such as stainless steel wool or ceramic fiber, for example, may be used as the regenerator, as now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b>A</figref>. Stainless steel wool regenerator <b>6300</b> advantageously provides a large surface area to volume ratio, thereby providing favorable heat transfer rates at low fluid flow friction in a compact form. Additionally, cumbersome manufacturing steps of cutting, cleaning and assembling large numbers of screens are advantageously eliminated. The low mechanical strength of steel wool and the tendency of steel wool to spall may both be overcome as now described. In some embodiments, the individual steel wires <b>6302</b> and <b>6304</b> are &#x201c;cross-linked&#x201d; into a unitary 3D wire matrix.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0348">The starting material for the regenerator may be fibrilose and of random fiber form such as either steel or nickel wool. The composition of the fiber may be a glass or a ceramic or a metal such as steel, copper, or other high temperature materials. The diameter of the fiber is preferably in the range from 10 micrometers to 1 millimeter depending on the size of the regenerator and the properties of the metal. The starting material is placed into a form corresponding to the final shape of the regenerator which is depicted in cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b>B</figref>. Inner canister cylindrical wall <b>6320</b>, outer canister cylindrical wall <b>6322</b>, and regenerator network <b>6300</b> are shown.

The selection of the starting material will depend on such factors as the particular deposition technique chosen and the chemical compatibility of the first and second materials, as known to one of ordinary skill in the electrochemical art. During deposition, the second material will build up on the starting material and form bridges <b>6308</b> between the individual fibers of the starting material in places where the individual fibers are in close proximity to each other. The deposition is continued until the bridges have grown to a sufficient size to hold the two individual fibers rigidly in place.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0351">The deposition duration depends on the particular deposition process and is easily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.

The glass fiber and form is dipped in a solution of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and ethanol so that the fiber is completely wetted by the solution. The fiber and form are removed from the solution and allowed to drain in a humid atmosphere. The solution will form meniscoidal shapes bridging fibers in close proximity to each other. The humidity of the atmosphere will start the hydrolysis-condensation reaction that converts the TEOS to silica forming a cross link between the two fibers. The fiber and form may be heat treated at a temperature less than 1000&#xb0; C., most preferably less than 600&#xb0; C., to remove the reactant products and form a silica bridge between the fibers.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0355">In another embodiment a ceramic slurry is deposited onto a reticulated foam having the shape of the regenerator. The slurry is dried on the reticulated foam and heat treated to burn off the foam and sinter the ceramic. The ceramic may be composed of an oxide ceramic such as cordierite, alumina, or zirconia. The composition of the ceramic slurry and the heat treatment profile is easily specified by one of ordinary skill in the ceramic processing art.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0356">In yet other embodiments, knit or woven wire is employed in fabrication of a regenerator as now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>A</figref>.

Engine <b>6500</b> is hermetically sealed. A crankcase <b>6502</b> serves as the cold-end pressure vessel and contains a charge gas in an interior volume <b>6504</b>. Crankcase <b>6502</b> can be made arbitrarily strong without sacrificing thermal performance by using sufficiently thick steel or other structural material. A heater head <b>6506</b> serves as the hot-end pressure vessel and is preferably fabricated from a high temperature super-alloy such as Inconel 625, GMR-235, etc. Heater head <b>6506</b> is used to transfer thermal energy by conduction from an external thermal source (not shown) to the working fluid. Thermal energy may be provided from various heat sources such as solar radiation or combustion gases. For example, a burner, as previously discussed, may be used to produce hot combustion gases (shown as <b>6507</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>B</figref>) that are used to heat the working fluid. An expansion area of cylinder (or warm section) <b>6522</b> is disposed inside the heater head <b>6506</b> and defines part of a working gas volume as discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A piston <b>6528</b> is used to displace the working fluid contained in the expansion area of cylinder <b>6522</b>.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0360">In accordance with an embodiment, crankcase <b>6502</b> is welded directly to heater head <b>6506</b> at joints <b>6508</b> to create a pressure vessel that can be designed to hold any pressure without being limited, as are other designs, by the requirements of heat transfer in the cooler. In an alternative embodiment, the crankcase <b>6502</b> and heater head <b>6506</b> are either brazed or bolted together. The heater head <b>6506</b> has a flange or step <b>6510</b> that axially constrains the heater head and transfers the axial pressure force from the heater head <b>6506</b> to the crankcase <b>6502</b>, thereby relieving the pressure force from the welded or brazed joints <b>6508</b>. Joints <b>6508</b> serve to seal the crankcase <b>6502</b> (or cold-end pressure vessel) and bear the bending and planar stresses. In an alternative embodiment, the joints <b>6508</b> are mechanical joints with an elastomer seal.

By placing the cooler <b>6520</b> within crankcase <b>6502</b>, the pressure across the cooler is limited to the pressure difference between the working gas in the working gas volume, and the charge gas in the interior volume <b>6504</b> of the crankcase.

The small diameter of the coolant passages, such as provided by coolant tubing <b>6514</b>, is key to achieving high heat transfer and supporting large pressure differences. The required wall thickness to withstand or support a given pressure is proportional to the tube or vessel diameter. The low stress on the tube walls allows various materials to be used for coolant tubing <b>6514</b> including, but not limited to, thin-walled stainless steel tubing or thicker-walled copper tubing.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0366">An additional advantage of locating the cooler <b>6520</b> entirely within the crankcase <b>6502</b> (or cold-end pressure vessel) volume is that any leaks of the working gas through the cooler <b>6520</b> will only result in a reduction of engine performance. In contrast, if the cooler were to interface with the external ambient environment, a leak of the working gas through the cooler would render the engine useless due to loss of the working gas unless the mean pressure of working gas is maintained by an external source. The reduced requirement for a leak-tight cooler allows for the use of less expensive fabrication techniques including, but not limited to, powder metal and die casting.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0367">Cooler <b>6520</b> is used to transfer thermal energy by conduction from the working gas and thereby cool the working gas.

Coolant tubing <b>6548</b> is placed within the cooler working space <b>6550</b>, so that the working gas can flow over an outside surface of coolant tubing <b>6548</b>. The working gas is confined to flow past the coolant tubing <b>6548</b> by the cooler body <b>6552</b> and a cooler liner <b>6526</b>.

The cooler casting process is simplified by having a seal around coolant lines <b>6548</b>. In addition, placing the coolant line <b>6548</b> in the working space improves the heat transfer between the working fluid and the coolant fluid. The coolant tubing <b>6548</b> may be smooth or may have extended heat transfer surfaces or fins on the outside of the tubing to increase heat transfer between the working gas and the coolant tubing <b>6548</b>. In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>E</figref>, spacing elements <b>6554</b> may be added to the cooler working space <b>6550</b> to force the working gas to flow closer to the coolant tubes <b>6548</b>. The spacing elements are separate from the cooler liner <b>6526</b> and the cooler body <b>6552</b> to allow insertion of the coolant tube and spacing elements into the working space.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0374">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>F</figref>, coolant tubing <b>6548</b> is overcast to form an annular heat sink <b>6556</b> where the working gas can flow on both sides of the cooler body <b>6552</b>.

The body of the cooler <b>6552</b> constrains the working gas to flow past the extended heat exchange surfaces on heat sink <b>6556</b>. The heat sink <b>6556</b> is typically a simpler part to fabricate than the cooler <b>6520</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>65</b>A and <b>65</b>B</figref>. The annular heat sink <b>6556</b> provides roughly double the heat transfer area of cooler <b>6520</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>65</b>A and <b>65</b>B</figref>.

This method is described, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>66</b>A and <b>66</b>B</figref>, and may be applied to a pressurized close-cycle machine as well as in other applications where it is advantageous to locate a cooler inside the crankcase.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0376">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b>A</figref>, a heat exchanger, for example, a cooler <b>6520</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>65</b>A and <b>65</b>B</figref>) may be fabricated by forming a high-temperature metal tubing <b>6602</b> into a desired shape. In one embodiment, the metal tubing <b>6602</b> is formed into a coil using copper. A lower temperature (relative to the melting temperature of the tubing) casting process is then used to overcast the tubing <b>6602</b> with a high thermal conductivity material to form a gas interface <b>6604</b> (and <b>6532</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>B</figref>), seals <b>6606</b> (and <b>6524</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>B</figref>) to the rest of the engine and a structure to mechanically connect the drive housing <b>6572</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to the heater head <b>6506</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>B</figref>. In one embodiment, the high thermal conductivity material used to overcast the tubing is aluminum. Overcasting the tubing <b>6602</b> with a high thermal conductivity metal assures a good thermal connection between the tubing and the heat transfer surfaces in contact with the working gas. A seal is created around the tubing <b>6602</b> where the tubing exits the open mold at <b>6610</b>. This method of fabricating a heat exchanger advantageously provides cooling passages in cast metal parts inexpensively.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0377"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b>B</figref> is a perspective view of a cooling assembly cast over the cooling coil of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b>A</figref>. The casting process can include any of the following: die casting, investment casting, or sand casting. The tubing material is chosen from materials that will not melt or collapse during the casting process. Tubing materials include, but are not limited to, copper, stainless steel, nickel, and super-alloys such as Inconel. The casting material is chosen among those that melt at a relatively low temperature compared to the tubing. Typical casting materials include aluminum and its various alloys, and zinc and its various alloys.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0378">The heat exchanger may also include extended heat transfer surfaces to increase the interfacial area <b>6604</b> (and <b>6532</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>B</figref>) between the hot working gas and the heat exchanger so as to improve heat transfer between the working gas and the coolant. Extended heat transfer surfaces may be created on the working gas side of the heat exchanger <b>6520</b> by machining extended surfaces on the inside surface (or gas interface) <b>6604</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>B</figref>, a cooler liner <b>6526</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>B</figref>) may be pressed into the heat exchanger to form a gas barrier on the inner diameter of the heat exchanger.

In accordance some embodiments, longitudinal grooves <b>6704</b> are broached into the surface, as shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>67</b>A and <b>67</b>C</figref>. Alternatively, lateral grooves <b>6708</b> (also shown in enlarged section view <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b>B-<b>1</b></figref>) may be machined in addition to the longitudinal grooves <b>6704</b> (also shown in enlarged section view <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b>A-<b>1</b></figref>) thereby creating aligned pins <b>6710</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b>B</figref>.

Various embodiments of intake manifold <b>6899</b> are further disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,381,958. In accordance with some embodiments, fuel is pre-mixed with air that may be heated above the fuel's auto-ignition temperature and a flame is prevented from forming until the fuel and air are well-mixed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref> shows one embodiment including an intake manifold <b>6899</b> and a combustion chamber <b>6810</b>. The intake manifold <b>6899</b> has an axisymmetrical conduit <b>6801</b> with an inlet <b>6803</b> for receiving air <b>6800</b>. Air <b>6800</b> is pre-heated to a temperature, typically above 900 K, which may be above the auto-ignition temperature of the fuel. Conduit <b>6801</b> conveys air <b>6800</b> flowing inward radially with respect to combustion axis <b>6820</b> to a swirler <b>6802</b> disposed within the conduit <b>6801</b>.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0383"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>A</figref> shows a cross sectional view of the conduit <b>6801</b> including swirler <b>6802</b> in accordance with some embodiments. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>A</figref>, swirler <b>6802</b> has several spiral-shaped vanes <b>6902</b> for directing the flow of air <b>6800</b> radially inward and imparting a rotational component on the air. The diameter of the swirler section of the conduit decreases from the inlet <b>6904</b> to the outlet <b>6906</b> of swirler <b>6802</b> as defined by the length of the swirler section conduit <b>6801</b>. The decrease in diameter of swirler vanes <b>6902</b> increases the flow rate of air <b>6800</b> in substantially inverse proportion to the diameter. The flow rate is increased so that it is above the flame speed of the fuel. At outlet <b>6906</b> of swirler <b>6802</b>, fuel <b>6806</b>, which in a one embodiment is propane, is injected into the inwardly flowing air.</p><p id="p-0408" num="0384">In some embodiments, fuel <b>6806</b> is injected by fuel injector <b>6804</b> through a series of nozzles <b>6900</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>B</figref>. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>B</figref> shows a cross sectional view of conduit <b>6801</b> and includes the fuel jet nozzles <b>6900</b>. Each of the nozzles <b>6900</b> is positioned at the exit of the swirler vanes <b>6902</b> and is centralized between two adjacent vanes. Nozzles <b>6900</b> are positioned in this way for increasing the efficiency of mixing the air and fuel. Nozzles <b>6900</b> simultaneously inject the fuel <b>6806</b> across the air flow <b>6800</b>. Since the air flow is faster than the flame speed, a flame will not form at that point even though the temperature of the air and fuel mixture is above the fuel's auto-ignition temperature. In some embodiments, where propane is used, the preheat temperature, as governed by the temperature of the heater head, is approximately 900 K.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0385">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref>, the air and fuel, now mixed, referred to hereafter as &#x201c;air-fuel mixture&#x201d; <b>6809</b>, is transitioned in direction through a throat <b>6808</b> which has a contoured fairing <b>6822</b> and is attached to the outlet <b>6807</b> of the conduit <b>6801</b>. Fuel <b>6806</b> is supplied via fuel regulator <b>6824</b>.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0386">Throat <b>6808</b> has an inner radius <b>6814</b> and an outer dimension <b>6816</b>. The transition of the air-fuel mixture is from a direction which is substantially transverse and radially inward with respect to combustion axis <b>6820</b> to a direction which is substantially parallel to the combustion axis. The contour of the fairing <b>6822</b> of throat <b>6808</b> has the shape of an inverted bell such that the cross sectional area of throat <b>6808</b> with respect to the combustion axis remains constant from the inlet <b>6811</b> of the throat to outlet <b>6812</b> of the throat. The contour is smooth without steps and maintains the flow speed from the outlet of the swirler to the outlet of the throat <b>6808</b> to avoid separation and the resulting recirculation along any of the surfaces. The constant cross sectional area allows the air and fuel to continue to mix without decreasing the flow speed and causing a pressure drop. A smooth and constant cross section produces an efficient swirler, where swirler efficiency refers to the fraction of static pressure drop across the swirler that is converted to swirling flow dynamic pressure. Swirl efficiencies of better than 80% may typically be achieved in practice. Thus, the parasitic power drain of the combustion air fan may be minimized.</p><p id="p-0411" num="0387">Outlet <b>6812</b> of the throat flares outward allowing the air-fuel mixture <b>6809</b> to disperse into the chamber <b>6810</b> slowing the air-fuel mixture <b>6809</b> thereby localizing and containing the flame and causing a toroidal flame to form.

First, using an ejector can eliminate the need for additional equipment, controls, and space, such as, a gaseous fuel pump, fuel control circuitry, and the associated components. Furthermore, using an ejector such as a venturi simplifies the fuel control system by eliminating the need for a separate fuel control scheme. Based on the corresponding rise of the vacuum with the airflow, and subsequently, an increased fuel flow, the burner power can be regulated by regulating the airflow. Accordingly, removing separate fuel control simplifies the development and implementation of automatic burner control in a gaseous fuel burner with an ejector.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0397">Secondly, the corresponding rise of the vacuum with airflow also results in an approximately steady fuel-air ratio despite changes in temperature and airflow rates. The resulting steady fuel-air ratio simplifies the fuel control and operation of the burner, by eliminating the need for complex exhaust sensor/feedback fuel control mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0398">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b></figref>, a gaseous fuel burner <b>7201</b> comprises an ejector <b>7240</b>, a heat exchanger <b>7220</b>, a combustion chamber <b>7250</b>, and a blower <b>7200</b> (shown as <b>7300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b>A</figref>). The term ejector as used here includes eductors, siphons, or any device that can use the kinetic energy of one fluid to cause the flow of another fluid. Ejectors are a reliable way of producing vacuum-based fuel flow systems with low initial cost, lack of moving parts, and simplicity of operation.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0399">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b></figref>, in a some embodiments, the ejector <b>7240</b> is a venturi.

The fuel delivery means may include other components such as a fuel restriction <b>7278</b>, fuel inlet ports <b>7279</b> and fuel valves (not shown). Fuel supplied by a pressure regulator <b>7272</b> flows through a manifold <b>7273</b> and fuel inlet ports <b>7279</b> into the relatively lower pressure in the throat <b>7244</b>. In one embodiment the fuel inlet ports <b>7279</b> provide the largest portion of the pressure drop in the fuel delivery means. Preferably, making the fuel inlet ports the largest restriction in the fuel delivery means assures that the restriction occurs at the venturi temperature and maximizes fuel-air mixing by producing the largest possible fuel plumes. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b></figref>, the fuel and air flow into the divergent cone or diffuser <b>7248</b> of the venturi, where static pressure is recovered. In the diffuser <b>7248</b>, the entrained fuel mixes with the air to form an ignitable fuel air mixture in the combustion chamber <b>7250</b>. The ignitable fuel-air mixture then enters the combustion chamber <b>7250</b>, where the igniter <b>7260</b> may ignite the mixture, and the tangential flow induced by a swirler <b>7230</b> creates a swirl-stabilized flame. Using an ejector <b>7240</b> to draw the gaseous fuel into the combustion chamber eliminates the need for a high-pressure gaseous fuel pump to deliver the fuel.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0410">In one embodiment, the venturi <b>7240</b> is constructed from high temperature materials to withstand high temperatures and maintain its structural integrity. For the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b></figref>, the dimensions of the venturi can be approximately 0.9 inches diameter inlet and outlets with an approximately 0.24 inches diameter throat. The half angles of the convergent cone and divergent cones can be 21.degree. and 7.degree. respectively and the throat can be 0.25 inches long. In this embodiment, the venturi can be constructed from Inconel 600. Alternatively, other high temperature metals could be used including, but not limited to Stainless Steels 310, 316L, 409 and 439, Hastalloy C76, Hastalloy X, Inconel 625 and other super alloys.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0411">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b></figref>, a swirler <b>7230</b> is located upstream of the venturi <b>7240</b> and advantageously creates a tangential flow of air through the venturi. As is well known in the art, the tangential flow from the swirler can create an annular vortex in the combustion chamber, which stabilizes the flame. Additionally, the swirler <b>7230</b> increases the suction pressure at the venturi throat <b>7244</b> by increasing the local air velocity over the fuel inlet ports <b>7279</b>. Adding the swirler allows the venturi throat <b>7244</b> to be made larger for a given suction pressure. Furthermore, the swirling action induced by the swirler <b>7230</b> can suppress fluctuations in the combustion chamber pressure from propagating upstream to the venturi <b>7240</b>. Such pressure fluctuations can temporarily slow or stop the flow of fuel gas into the venturi <b>7240</b>. The swirler <b>7230</b> thereby facilitates a steady fuel-air ratio in the combustion chamber for steady airflows. The swirler <b>7230</b> may be a radial swirler.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0412">In other embodiments, the gaseous burner can be connected to multiple fuel sources. In this configuration, the burner may be fired, lit or ignited with a type of fuel and then run with a different type of fuel. The use of multiple fuel sources may require a fuel delivery means tuned for each fuel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>75</b>A, <b>75</b>B, and <b>75</b>C</figref> show embodiments for two fuels with significantly different energy densities such propane and natural gas. In this embodiment, the fuel delivery means for the denser propane must be approximately three times more restrictive than the fuel delivery means for the less dense natural gas or methane. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>A</figref>, the venturi has different manifolds and fuel ports for each fuel. High-density fuels such as propane would require the more restrictive fuel inlet ports <b>7279</b>, while a low-density fuel such as natural gas would require less restrictive fuel inlet ports <b>7279</b>A. This configuration retains the highest resistance to fuel flow at the venturi temperature. However, the embodiment of the venturi in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>A</figref> may be more difficult to manufacture and have a higher-pressure loss drop due to the long narrow passage.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0413">Another embodiment for a gaseous burner with multiple fuel sources is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>B</figref>. In this embodiment, a fuel selector valve <b>7276</b> directs the fuel through an additional fuel restriction such as <b>7278</b>A or <b>7278</b>B for a dense gas or a less dense gas respectively. The multi-port valve <b>7276</b> allows any number of predefined gases to be burned by the same burner. Predefined gases such as natural gas, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) or biogas can be burned in the same burner by simply setting a selector valve to the corresponding fuel setting. Alternatively, other embodiments can have multiple settings for different qualities of biogas as the carbon dioxide fraction in biogas can vary from 50% to 20%. The fuel restrictors may be placed outside the burner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>B</figref> or alternatively they can be located in the entrances to the manifold <b>7273</b>. If restrictions <b>7278</b> are placed outside of the burner, then significant part of the fuel-delivery-means pressure drop is not at the venturi temperature and thus the fuel-air ratio may vary with the venturi temperature. The burner will run initially leaner and get progressively richer as the hotter faster air flowing through the venturi exerts a stronger vacuum on the fuel. In addition, moving a significant part of the pressure drop from the fuel ports <b>7279</b>, the fuel will not penetrate as far into the air stream. Nevertheless, locating multiple restrictors <b>7278</b> for different gases may make the fabrication of the part easier.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0414">An alternative embodiment, that provides significant flexibility in the fuel-air ratio control and fuel gas usages, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>C</figref>. In this embodiment, the two fuel sources, <b>7272</b>A and <b>7272</b>B are regulated to their individual pressure and flows though separate fuel delivery means adjusted for each fuel. Each fuel delivery means includes two or more restrictions in parallel <b>7206</b>A and <b>7208</b>A, and <b>7206</b>B and <b>7208</b>B with one or more valves <b>7202</b>A, and <b>7202</b>B, respectively, to vary the pressure drop of the fuel delivery means. The valves may be manually or automatically actuated. Fuel selector <b>7276</b> connects fuel delivery means to the venturi, while closing the other fuel off.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0415">The multiple restrictions <b>7206</b>A and <b>7208</b>A, and <b>7206</b>B and <b>7208</b>B and the valves <b>7202</b>A and <b>7202</b>B allow the pressure drop of the fuel delivery means to be adjusted during burner warm-up. Thus the fuel-air ratio can be roughly maintained as the suction pressure increases with increasing venturi temperature. The multiple restrictions can also adjust for changing fuel gas density. A changing fuel gas density may occur when the gaseous fuel burner is connected to biogas digester, wherein the biogas digester is the source of fuel. In a biogas digester embodiment, the carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2) content and therefore the energy density can vary weekly. In this embodiment, if the CO.sub.2 content increases, the pressure-drop through the fuel delivery means must be reduced to allow higher flows of the less energy dense fuel gas. In addition, the multiple restrictions can improve the ignition of the fuel gas by providing a richer fuel-air mixture for lighting. The richer mixture is provided by opening additional valves <b>7202</b>A or <b>7202</b>B, which also reduces the pressure-drop of the fuel delivery means. Once the burner is lit, the valve <b>7202</b>A or <b>7202</b>B may be closed to produce a leaner flame. As described supra, once the burner is lit, the burner may be run on a different fuel. A fuel selector may be used to switch the fuel types. Alternatively, an embodiment with a multiple fuel selector facilitates varying the fuel-air ratio during the operation of the burner.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0416">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>75</b>B and <b>75</b>C</figref>, the fuel selector <b>7276</b> may enable the burner to be lit on one fuel and run on a different type of fuel. This can be important if one fuel is too weak to ignite, but will burn in a warmed up burner. In one example, the burner may be lit on a higher density fuel such as propane. Once the burner is warmed up, the fuel selector <b>7276</b> is moved to draw in a low-density biogas.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0417"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b></figref> depicts an embodiment where an automated controller <b>7288</b> adjusts a variable restriction <b>7292</b> such as a variable flow valve in the fuel delivery means to hold the exhaust oxygen constant as measured by a wide-range lambda sensor or UEGO <b>7286</b>. In this embodiment, the automated scheme allows any fuel from biogas to propane to be connected to the burner and the control system can compensate for the changing fuel density. In this embodiment, the automated controller can restrict the fuel path for dense fuels such as propane and open up the fuel path for low-density fuels such as methane and biogas. Ignition would be accomplished by starting the variable restrictor <b>7292</b> in the fully open position, which will produce the richest mixture then closing it until the fuel-air mixture is ignited. After ignition, the controller can control the fuel flow to achieve the desired exhaust oxygen level. It is also envisioned that such an embodiment would allow the fuel air ratio to be adjusted during warm-up to optimize efficiency and burner stability.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0418">In another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>77</b></figref>, the gaseous fuel burner is a high efficiency burner for an external combustion engine such as a Stirling cycle engine. The burner includes manual controls to control the burner. The manual controls include a ball valve <b>7270</b> to manually select a fuel type, a trim valve <b>7274</b> to adjust the fuel-air ratio and a rheostat <b>7702</b> to control the blower speed, and subsequently the airflow. The preheated air <b>7222</b> in the venturi <b>7240</b> draws in the fuel from a fuel source <b>7272</b>. The fuel then mixes with the preheated air to create a fuel-air mixture. The fuel-air mixture flows into the combustion chamber <b>7250</b> where it burns. In this embodiment a microprocessor/controller <b>7288</b> holds the heater head temperature constant as measured by the temperature sensor <b>7289</b> by varying the engine speed. Furthermore, the blower-speed determines the burner power output and thus the engine power output. In an alternative embodiment, the fuel trim valve <b>7274</b> is not included.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0419">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>78</b></figref> the gaseous fuel burner <b>7201</b> is a high efficiency burner for an external combustion engine such as a Stirling cycle engine.

Additionally, the burner includes a blower controller (shown as <b>7702</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>77</b></figref>). The blower controller <b>7702</b> can be adjusted by the microprocessor/controller <b>7288</b> to match the Stirling engine power output with the load. In this embodiment, the burner temperature is held constant by varying the engine speed and the engine power output is automatically adjusted by setting the blower speed. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the burner can burn most gaseous fuels, including fuels without constant properties such as biogas.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0420">In another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>79</b></figref>, fuel is delivered directly into the venturi at a point proximal to the venturi throat <b>7244</b>.

The swirler <b>7230</b> is preferably an axial swirler positioned in the venturi <b>7240</b> and upstream of the venturi throat <b>7244</b>.

Desired performance may be achieved without the throttle plates or valves or other restrictive devices that are normally used to meter the fuel flow to the combustion chamber.</p><p id="p-0453" num="0428"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b></figref> shows a metering pump system providing gaseous fuel to a pressurized combustion chamber <b>8058</b> of an engine <b>8022</b> according to one embodiment. A gas train, labeled generally as <b>8005</b>, includes a fuel pump <b>8014</b>, interconnecting lines <b>8038</b>, <b>8042</b> and may include a pressure regulator <b>8018</b>. The fuel pump <b>8014</b> raises the fuel pressure in line <b>8038</b> to a higher pressure in line <b>8042</b>. The gas train delivers fuel from the gas supply to the burner <b>8010</b>, where it is mixed with air and burned in a combustion chamber <b>8058</b>. The fuel pump is controlled by a controller <b>8034</b> that modulates the fuel flow rate by varying one or more parameters of an electrical signal sent to the fuel pump <b>8014</b>. The controller may also regulate a blower <b>8060</b> that provides air to the combustion chamber <b>8058</b> and may receive signals from sensors that report engine-operating parameters.</p><p id="p-0454" num="0429">In some embodiments the delivered fuel pressure in line <b>8038</b> is 6 to 13 inches water column for liquefied petroleum gas.

Alternatively, pressure regulator <b>8018</b> can supply the fuel at lower pressures, even negative pressures. Typical fuel pressures in line <b>8042</b> may range from 0.5 to 5 PSIG.</p><p id="p-0455" num="0430">In some embodiments, fuel pump <b>8014</b> is a linear piston pump. A linear piston pump is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref>. The pump includes a cylinder <b>8100</b>, a piston <b>8102</b>, a winding <b>8104</b>, a spring <b>8106</b> and check valves <b>8108</b>, <b>8112</b>. When an electrical signal is applied to winding <b>8104</b>, the winding pulls the ferrous metal piston <b>8102</b> to the left, compressing the spring <b>8106</b>. Check valve <b>8108</b> in the piston allows fuel to flow into compression volume <b>8110</b>. When the electrical signal is turned off and the electromagnetic force on the piston begins to decrease, the piston <b>8102</b> is forced to the right by the spring <b>8106</b>. Gas is forced out check valve <b>8112</b> into the receiver volume <b>8114</b> at a higher pressure.</p><p id="p-0456" num="0431">The flow rate of the pump can be modulated by varying the stroke of the piston <b>8102</b>. In one embodiment the signal from the controller to the pump is a half-wave alternating current (&#x201c;AC&#x201d;) signal, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>82</b></figref>. Circuitry to produce this signal is well known in the art. The piston stroke and, thus, the flow rate increases as the amplitude of the AC signal increases. In some embodiments, low amplitude signals are biased slightly higher to improve repeatability and linearity of flow versus the driving signal. The force applied to the piston <b>8102</b> by the windings <b>8104</b> is inversely proportional to the distance from the windings to the piston. At low signal levels, the piston does not get very close to the windings and small changes in the friction and inertia of the piston will produce significant changes in the resulting piston stroke and flow. A bias voltage is applied to bring the resting-position of the piston closer to the windings, so that small changes in the controller signal that drives the piston dominate the frictional forces and the inertia of the piston. For example, the bias voltage added to the signal is highest at the lowest driving signal (10% signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>82</b></figref>) and may drop to zero before the drive signal reaches 50%. The bias is reduced at higher flow levels to take advantage of the full pump stroke.</p><p id="p-0457" num="0432">In another embodiment, the controller signal that drives the pump is a pulse-width-modulated (&#x201c;PWM&#x201d;) direct current (&#x201c;DC&#x201d;) voltage signal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref> shows an exemplary DC waveform that may be used to drive the pump. Circuitry to generate the PWM DC signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref> is well known in the art. Three different drive signals are plotted versus time. These signal modulations correspond to 10%, 50% and 90% duty cycles, which are shown for purposes of illustration and not for limitation. Applying the rectangular wave voltages of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref> to the windings <b>8104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref> will cause the piston <b>8102</b> to move to the left and compress the spring <b>8106</b>. The stroke and, therefore, the flow will be roughly proportional to the voltage times the duration of the signal. The lower signals, 10% and 50%, include bias voltages between signal pulses. As in the case of the AC drive signal, the bias voltage moves the piston closer to the windings to provide greater piston response to small changes in the signal and overcome the frictional and inertia forces of the piston. This bias voltage may be varied with the duration of the drive signal. The bias voltage is highest at the minimum drive signal duration and may drop to zero before the drive voltage pulse duty cycle reaches 50%.</p><p id="p-0458" num="0433">Other embodiments may use different controller signal waveforms to drive the piston. In another embodiment, the piston pump of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref> can be driven without the bias voltages shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>82</b> and <b>83</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0459" num="0434">In another embodiment both the frequency and the duration of the PWM DC controller signal modulating the pump can be varied to linearize the flow through the pump with changes in the driving signal.</p><p id="p-0460" num="0435">In further embodiments, pump <b>8014</b> is a diaphragm pump as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>84</b></figref>. In the diaphragm pump, one or more solenoidal coils <b>8200</b> drive the shaft of the pump <b>8202</b> back and forth. The shaft <b>8202</b> deflects two diaphragms <b>8204</b> that alternatively pull gas into the chambers <b>8212</b> and then expel it. The two wire coil is driven with an AC signal connected to wires (<b>8234</b>, <b>8236</b>) that drives the piston <b>8202</b> back and forth by reversing the flow of current through the coil <b>8200</b>. The solenoid has a permanent magnet so that a reversing magnetic field can drive the solenoid in opposite directions. The pumping force on the two chambers <b>8212</b> is phased 180 degrees apart so that as one chamber is filled, the companion chamber is emptied. Check valves <b>8208</b> upstream of the pumping chambers <b>8212</b> allow gas flow in, while the downstream valves <b>8210</b> allow flow out of the chambers and into the receiver volume <b>8216</b>. The solenoidal coil <b>8200</b> can be driven with a full wave AC signal.

One embodiment of the filter <b>8701</b> is an RC filter comprising a capacitance (volume) <b>8702</b> and an orifice <b>8704</b>. The volume and orifice are sized to allow the required fuel flow and reduce fluctuations in flow to a desired level. Mathematical techniques that are well known in the art may be used to determine these filter parameters.</p><p id="p-0465" num="0440">An acoustic filter using a volume and an orifice restrictor has the electrical circuit analog shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>87</b>B</figref>. The analog of gas flow is electrical current, the analog of gas pressure is electrical voltage, the analog of volume is electrical capacitance, the analog of flow resistance is electrical resistance and the analog of gas inertia is electrical inductance. The orifice restrictor does not translate directly into this model because the orifice flow resistance is proportional to the gas flow squared (non-linear) instead of being proportional to the gas flow as the model suggests. The model can be used through the process of linearization of flow resistance for small signals. The pump gas flow ripple is attenuated by the factor of 1/(1+2.pi.fRC). Where &#x201c;f&#x201d; is the frequency component of the gas flow entering the filter from the pump. Due to the orifice restrictor non-linear characteristics, the acoustic filter has a lower attenuation at low flow causing a high burner flow ripple as a percentage of average flow. The higher ripple can cause flame instability and higher emissions of pollutants. This non-linearity also causes a high resistance to average gas flow at the higher flow rates reducing the pump maximum flow capability.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0441">The addition of a long thin tube <b>8703</b> to the acoustic filter provides ripple attenuation through the gas mass acceleration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>87</b>C</figref>. The diagram for the electrical analog is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>87</b>D</figref>. The pump gas flow ripple is attenuated by the factor of 1/[1+(LC)(2.pi.f).sup.2]. Since L and C are not a function of flow, the filter attenuation is not affected by the flow rate and does not have the disadvantages of the filter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>87</b>A</figref>. Attenuation of the ripple also increases the pump's flow rate.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0442">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b></figref>, in another embodiment, controller <b>8034</b> modulates the output of the fuel pump <b>8014</b> to control the temperature of the heater tubes <b>8026</b> of the engine. The temperature of the heater tube <b>8026</b> may be measured with a temperature sensor <b>8054</b>, such as a thermocouple, that is attached to a heater tube <b>8026</b>. When the engine increases speed, the engine draws more thermal energy from the heater tubes <b>8026</b>. The tubes cool and the thermocouple <b>8054</b> reports this temperature drop to the controller <b>8034</b>, which in turn increases the fuel flow until the measured temperature is restored to a specified level. Any of the devices and methods for metering the fuel through the fuel pump, as described above, may be employed in this embodiment of the machine. Various fuel pump types including rotary vane pumps, piezoelectric pumps, crank driven piston pumps, etc., may be employed. In other embodiments, various operating parameters of a system, of which the pressurized chamber is a part, may be controlled by controlling the fuel pump to meter the fuel flow to the chamber. For example, the speed of an internal combustion engine or the power output of an engine may be determined by the controller. Alternatively, a fuel/air mixture ratio to a burner may be maintained by the controller.</p><p id="p-0468" num="0443">It is to be understood that the various fuel pump embodiments described herein may be adapted to function in a multiple burner configuration.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Single Burner Multiple Piston Engine</heading><p id="p-0469" num="0444">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>88</b>, <b>89</b>A-<b>89</b>C</figref>, various embodiments is shown wherein an engine <b>8800</b>, such as a Stirling cycle engine, having a rocking beam drive <b>8802</b> (also shown as <b>810</b> and <b>812</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) and a plurality of pistons (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> as <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, <b>806</b>, and <b>808</b>), includes a single burner (shown as <b>8900</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>89</b>A and <b>89</b>B</figref>) to heat heater heads <b>8804</b> of the pistons.

The burner head <b>8903</b> may house a UV window <b>8910</b> for flame detection, a fuel injector <b>8912</b>, which may be an air-assist fuel injector such as a Delevan siphon nozzle, and a hot surface igniter <b>8914</b>. Also connected to the burner head <b>8903</b> are a first inlet <b>8916</b> and a second inlet <b>8918</b>.

The prechamber <b>8901</b> is where the fuel is ignited to form a diffusion flame. In one embodiment where liquid fuel is used, the liquid fuel passes through the first inlet <b>8916</b>. Atomizer passes through the second inlet <b>8918</b> to atomize the liquid fuel and mix with the liquid fuel in the prechamber <b>8901</b>. As the atomizer and liquid fuel enter the prechamber <b>8901</b> via fuel injector <b>8912</b>, it is ignited by the hot surface igniter <b>8914</b>. Air may also pass through an intake <b>8920</b> and be preheated by a preheater <b>8922</b> before it travels into the prechamber <b>8901</b>, where it will mix with the atomizer and the liquid fuel. Once the mixture is preheated and formed into a diffusion flame, it travels through the prechamber nozzle <b>8908</b> into the combustion chamber <b>8906</b> to form a PPV (premixed prevaporized) flame. When the diffusion flame leaves the prechamber <b>8901</b>, evaporation may occur in the prechamber <b>8901</b> which may allow the diffusion flame to be relit more easily, should it get flamed out or burned out.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0447">Once the flame is in the combustion chamber <b>8901</b>, the heat from the flame is used to heat the heater heads <b>8804</b>.

The heater head lining <b>8926</b> ensures uniform flow of the heated gas. Uniform flow prevents uneven temperature distribution around the heater heads <b>8804</b> and ensures thermal efficiency, as discussed in detail in the preceding sections.
