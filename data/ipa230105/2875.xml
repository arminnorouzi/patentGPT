For example, it can be desirable to heat a metal strip prior to performing certain processes, or it can be desirable to maintain heat in a metal strip for a duration of time without allowing the metal strip to cool past a minimum temperature. Temperature control can generally involve adding or removing heat energy to or from a metal strip.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various techniques for adding heat energy to a metal strip exist. Direct-contact techniques can induce undesirable effects on the metal strip, such as surface-marring, build-up of waste (e.g., carbon from indirect and/or direct-impingement flame) on the surface, or other such undesirable results. Other techniques attempt to heat up the metal strip without contact, but are unable to efficiently or rapidly transfer heat energy to the metal strip. Some other problems associated with current techniques include requiring high installation and/or maintenance costs, occupying significant production space, limiting the mobility of the metal strip being processed, and inducing undesirable effects on the metal strip.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The terms &#x201c;invention,&#x201d; &#x201c;the invention,&#x201d; &#x201c;this invention&#x201d; and &#x201c;the present invention&#x201d; used in this patent are intended to refer broadly to all of the subject matter of this patent and the patent claims below.

The claimed subject matter may be embodied in other ways, may include different elements or steps, and may be used in conjunction with other existing or future technologies.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">This description should not be interpreted as implying any particular order or arrangement among or between various steps or elements except when the order of individual steps or arrangement of elements is explicitly described.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; and &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; are used to describe relative orientations with respect to a metal strip as if the metal strip were moving in a horizontal direction with its top and bottom surfaces generally parallel to the ground. The term &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; as used herein can refer to a direction perpendicular to a surface (e.g., top or bottom surface) of the metal strip, regardless of the orientation of the metal strip. The term &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; as used herein can refer to a direction parallel to a surface (e.g., top or bottom surface) of the metal strip, such as a direction parallel to the direction of travel of a moving metal strip, regardless of the orientation of the metal strip. The terms &#x201c;above&#x201d; and &#x201c;below&#x201d; can refer to locations beyond top or bottom surfaces of a metal strip, regardless of the orientation of the metal strip.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Disclosed are systems and methods for pre-ageing treatment of a metal strip using magnetic heating. Aspects and features of the present disclosure can be used with various suitable metal strips, and may be especially useful with metal strips of aluminum or aluminum alloys. Specifically, desirable results can be achieved when the metal strips are alloys such as 2xxx series, 6xxx series, 7xxx series, or 8xxx series aluminum alloys. For an understanding of the number designation system most commonly used in naming and identifying aluminum and its alloys, see &#x201c;International Alloy Designations and Chemical Composition Limits for Wrought Aluminum and Wrought Aluminum Alloys&#x201d; or &#x201c;Registration Record of Aluminum Association Alloy Designations and Chemical Compositions Limits for Aluminum Alloys in the Form of Castings and Ingot,&#x201d; both published by The Aluminum Association.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Pre-ageing treatment of a metal strip is generally used with various metal processing lines, such as continuous annealing solution heat treatment (CASH) line or other equipment. For example, on a CASH line, after a quenching step, the metal strip may undergo a pre-ageing treatment by reheating the metal strip with a reheater before coiling. By reheating the metal strip before coiling, better mechanical properties (e.g., maximum strength and hardness) can be obtained in the metal strip when the metal strip hardens, and thus may be more suitable for consumer use. In the CASH line, the reheaters are normally located in the non-continuous section of the CASH line. Because reheaters are in the non-continuous section, the metal strip must stop and start every time a coil of the metal strip is removed at a rewind coiler. Sometimes during the period when the metal strip is stopped, a traditional gas-powered reheater may overheat and damage a section of the metal strip that is stopped within the reheater. This overheated section of the metal strip must be cut out and discarded as scrap, and the overheated section can also cause damage to downstream rolls and/or the coil of the metal strip. Additionally, sometimes during reheating, the metal strip loses tension and contacts one or more nozzles of the traditional reheater. Such contact may cause the metal strip to wrinkle or distort, and may further cause wrinkles in the metal strip coiled at the rewind coiler that must be discarded as scrap.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Aspects and features of the present disclosure include pre-ageing systems and methods having a reheater that includes one or more magnetic rotors arranged above and/or below a moving metal strip to induce moving or time varying magnetic fields through the strip. The changing magnetic fields can create currents (e.g., eddy currents) within the metal strip, thus heating the metal strip.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some cases, the magnetic rotors disclosed herein may be used with non-ferrous materials, including aluminum, aluminum alloys, magnesium, magnesium-based materials, titanium, titanium-based materials, copper, copper-based materials, steel, steel-based materials, bronze, bronze-based materials, brass, brass-based materials, composites, sheets used in composites, or any other suitable metal, non-metal or combination of materials. The article may include monolithic materials, as well as non-monolithic materials such as roll-bonded materials, clad materials, composite materials (such as but not limited to carbon fiber-containing materials), or various other materials. In one non-limiting example, the magnetic rotors can be used to heat metal articles such as aluminum metal strips, slabs or other articles made from aluminum alloys, including aluminum alloys containing iron.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each magnetic rotor includes one or more permanent magnets or electromagnets. In some examples, a pair of matched magnetic rotors can be positioned on opposite sides of a passline of the metal strip. In other examples, one or more magnetic rotors are positioned above or below the passline. The magnetic rotors are rotatable in a forward direction or a reverse direction, and may be rotated through various suitable methods including, but not limited to, electric motors, pneumatic motors, another magnetic rotor, or various other suitable mechanisms. The direction and rotational speed of the magnetic rotors may be adjusted and controlled as needed. In some examples, the magnetic rotors are positioned a predetermined distance from the passline. In certain cases, the distance between the magnetic rotors and the passline may be adjusted and controlled as needed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Precise heating control for pre-ageing treatment can be achieved when using the reheater. Such precise control can be achieved through manipulation of various factors, including strength of magnets in the rotor, number of magnets in the rotor, orientation of magnets in the rotor, size of magnets in the rotor, speed of the rotor, the direction of rotation in the forward direction or reverse direction, size of the rotor, vertical gap between vertically offset rotors in a single rotor set, laterally offset placement of rotors in a single rotor set, longitudinal gap between adjacent rotor sets, thickness of the strip being heated, distance between the rotor and the strip, forward speed of the strip being heated, and number of rotors sets used. Other factors can be controlled as well.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some cases, the reheater is a fast response reheater because the rotation of the magnets may be stopped when the metal strip is stopped while a coil of the metal strip is removed at a rewind coiler to prevent overheating of the metal strip. In some cases, control of one or more of the aforementioned factors, among others, can be based on a computer model, operator feedback, or automatic feedback (e.g., based on signals from real-time sensors).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An example of a pre-ageing system <b>100</b> for pre-ageing treatment of a metal strip <b>102</b> during metal processing is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In various examples, the pre-ageing system <b>100</b> may be used with a processing line <b>104</b>. In various examples, the processing line <b>104</b> includes a rewind coiler <b>108</b> for winding the metal strip <b>102</b> into a coil <b>110</b>B after metal processing. Optionally, the processing line <b>104</b> also includes an unwind coiler <b>111</b>, which receives a coil <b>110</b>A of the metal strip <b>102</b> that had previously been processed (e.g., through hot rolling, cold rolling, or various other metal processing techniques). In some examples, the processing line <b>104</b> optionally includes processing equipment <b>106</b>, such as parts of a CASH line (e.g., furnaces, cooling units, or other equipment) or other suitable pieces of equipment. During metal processing, the metal strip <b>102</b> may be unwound from the unwind coiler <b>111</b>, processed by the processing line <b>104</b>, and then rewound onto the rewind coiler <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the pre-ageing system <b>100</b> includes a reheater <b>112</b> that is configured to heat the metal strip <b>102</b> before it is coiled on the rewind coiler <b>108</b>. In some examples, the reheater <b>112</b> is configured to heat the metal strip <b>102</b> without contacting the metal strip <b>102</b>. The reheater <b>112</b> may be orientated in various directions relative to the ground, such as vertically, diagonally, or horizontally, and is not limited to the orientation shown in FIGs. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>. For example, the reheater may be oriented vertically (and the metal strip <b>102</b> passes vertically through the reheater <b>112</b>), diagonally (and the metal strip <b>102</b> passes through the reheater <b>112</b> at an angle relative to the ground), horizontally, or various other orientations or combinations of orientations.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In various examples, the reheater <b>112</b> includes at least one magnetic rotor <b>114</b>, and in certain examples, the reheater <b>112</b> may include more than one magnetic rotor <b>114</b>. For example, the reheater may include one magnetic rotor <b>114</b>, two magnetic rotors <b>114</b>, three magnetic rotors <b>114</b>, four magnetic rotors <b>114</b>, five magnetic rotors <b>114</b>, six magnetic rotors <b>114</b>, or more than six magnetic rotors <b>114</b>. As such, the number of magnetic rotors <b>114</b> should not be considered limiting on the current disclosure. In the non-limiting example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the reheater <b>112</b> includes four magnetic rotors <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each magnetic rotor <b>114</b> includes one or more permanent magnets or electromagnets. The magnetic rotors <b>114</b> are rotatable (see arrows <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) in a forward direction (a clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) or a reverse direction (a counter-clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In various examples, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b> may be rotated through various suitable methods including, but not limited to, electric motors, pneumatic motors, another magnetic rotor, or various other suitable mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The magnetic rotors <b>114</b> are spaced apart from the passline of the metal strip <b>102</b> such that during metal processing, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b> are in a non-contacting configuration with the metal strip <b>102</b>. In various examples, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b> are vertically adjustable such that a distance between a particular magnetic rotor <b>114</b> and the metal strip <b>102</b> (or passline of the metal strip <b>102</b>) may be adjusted and controlled.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some examples, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b> are provided as a set having a top magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A positioned above the passline and a bottom magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A positioned below the passline. In other examples, the reheater <b>112</b> includes only bottom magnetic rotors <b>114</b>B, only top magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A, or various combinations of top magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A and bottom magnetic rotors <b>114</b>B. In some examples, at least one top magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A is horizontally aligned with a corresponding bottom magnetic rotor <b>114</b>B, although it need not be. In certain examples, the top magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A is vertically offset from a corresponding bottom magnetic rotor <b>114</b>B such that a gap <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is defined between the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, during processing, the metal strip <b>102</b> is passed through the gap <b>116</b>. In other cases, the top magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A may be horizontally offset relative to a bottom magnetic rotor <b>114</b>B.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In various examples, the top magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A and the bottom magnetic rotor <b>114</b>B are vertically adjustable such that a size of the gap <b>116</b>, which is a distance from the top magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A to the bottom magnetic rotor <b>114</b>B, may be adjusted and controlled (see arrows <b>118</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In various examples, the gap <b>116</b> may be controlled through various actuators including, but not limited to, hydraulic pistons, screw drives, or other suitable examples. In certain examples, the gap <b>116</b> may be varied between a minimum gap size and a maximum gap size. In some cases, the strength of the magnetic field, and thus the amount of heat imparted into the metal strip <b>102</b>, may be controlled by changing the distance between the magnetic rotors <b>114</b> and the metal strip <b>102</b>. In various examples, the top magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A may be vertically adjustable independent from or in conjunction with the bottom magnetic rotor <b>114</b>B. As mentioned above, the strength of the magnetic field, and thus the amount of heat imparted into the metal strip <b>102</b>, can be adjusted in other or additional ways.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In certain examples, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B may be adjusted laterally (see arrows <b>122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Lateral movement can control the percentage of the surface of the metal strip <b>102</b> covered by a particular rotor <b>114</b>A-B, and therefore the amount and location of the heat imparted into the metal strip <b>102</b>. In certain examples, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B may be laterally adjusted to control the temperature profile in the metal strip <b>102</b>. For example, in some cases, edges of the metal strip <b>102</b> may be heated more rapidly than non-edge portions of the metal strip <b>102</b>, and the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B may be laterally adjusted such that the temperature variation in the metal strip <b>102</b> is reduced. In various examples, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B may be longitudinally adjustable to control the gap between adjacent sets of magnetic rotors <b>114</b> (see arrows <b>124</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, the top magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A and the bottom magnetic rotor <b>114</b>B rotate in the same direction, although they need not. For example, in some cases, the top magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A and the bottom magnetic rotor <b>114</b>B may rotate in opposite directions. In various examples, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B of one set of magnetic rotors may rotate in the same or in a different direction as the corresponding magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B of another set of magnetic rotors. The magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B may rotate at various rotational speeds, such as from about 100 rpm to about 5000 rpm. In one non-limiting example, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B rotate at about 1800 revolutions per minute, although various other rotational speeds may be utilized.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B rotate, the magnets induce a magnetic field into the metal strip <b>102</b> such that the metal strip <b>102</b> is heated. In various examples, through the rotation of the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>, the reheater <b>112</b> is configured to heat the metal strip <b>102</b> as the metal strip <b>102</b> is passed through the reheater <b>112</b> at a pre-ageing temperature of from about 60&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C., such as from about 80&#xb0; C. to about 120&#xb0; C. For example, the reheater <b>112</b> may heat the metal strip <b>102</b> at a temperature of about 60&#xb0; C., about 65&#xb0; C. , about 70&#xb0; C., about 75&#xb0; C., about 80&#xb0; C., about 85&#xb0; C., about 90&#xb0; C., about 95&#xb0; C., about 100&#xb0; C., about 105&#xb0; C., about 110&#xb0; C., about 115&#xb0; C., about 120&#xb0; C., about 125&#xb0; C., about 130&#xb0; C., about 135&#xb0; C., about 140&#xb0; C., about 145&#xb0; C., or about 150&#xb0; C. In certain examples, the strip <b>102</b> is heated to a target temperature only with no soak time in the reheater <b>112</b>. The heated strip <b>102</b> is then rewound into coil form where it will cool naturally in still air. Pre-ageing occurs while the coil is at temperature and cooling while in coil form. In some examples, a conventional gas or other type of heating unit with the reheater <b>112</b> to assist with getting the temperature of the strip <b>102</b> uniform across the width because the more uniform the sheet temperature, the easier it may be to achieve uniform target properties across the width and along the length of the strip <b>102</b>. In certain examples with multiple magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B may optionally be controlled such that the amount of temperature rise of the metal strip <b>102</b> imparted by each magnetic rotor <b>114</b>A-B is limited.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some examples, in addition to heating the metal strip <b>102</b>, rotating the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B may also provide vertical stabilization that allows the metal strip <b>102</b> to pass over and/or between the magnetic rotors <b>114</b> without contacting the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B (e.g., the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B levitate or float the metal strip <b>102</b>). For example, in some cases, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B impart a force that is perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to a surface of the metal strip <b>102</b> to float the metal strip <b>102</b> and minimize and/or eliminate contact between the rotors <b>114</b>A-B and the metal strip <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In certain examples, the pre-ageing system <b>100</b> includes various sensors or monitors <b>126</b> at various positions relative to the reheater <b>112</b> and along the path of the metal strip <b>102</b>. These sensors <b>126</b> may detect and monitor a position of the metal strip <b>102</b>, movement of the metal strip <b>102</b>, a temperature of the metal strip <b>102</b>, a temperature distribution across the metal strip <b>102</b>, and/or various other information about the metal strip <b>102</b> as it is processed. In some examples, the information gathered by the sensors may be used by a controller to adjust the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B (e.g., rotational speed, direction of rotation, distance from metal strip <b>102</b>, etc.) and thereby control heating of the metal strip <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As one example, the reheater <b>112</b> may be controlled to reduce or prevent overheating of the metal strip <b>102</b> while the metal strip <b>102</b> is stopped. For example, the sensor or monitor <b>126</b> may detect when the metal strip <b>102</b> is moving through the reheater <b>112</b> and when movement of the metal strip <b>102</b> is stopped, such as when the coil <b>110</b>B is removed from the rewind coiler <b>108</b>. When the metal strip <b>102</b> is stopped, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b> of the reheater <b>112</b> may stop rotating (and thus stop heating the metal strip <b>102</b>) to prevent overheating of the metal strip <b>102</b>. Similarly, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B may start rotating again (and thus start heating the metal strip <b>102</b> again) when the metal strip <b>102</b> is about to move or while the metal strip <b>102</b> is moving. Accordingly, through the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B, the reheater <b>112</b> may rapidly heat or stop heating the metal strip <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As another example, the reheater <b>112</b> may be controlled to ensure a uniform or desired temperature profile of the metal strip <b>102</b>. In some examples, the temperature of the metal strip <b>102</b> for lubricant uniformity without degradation or migration depends on the lubricant. In one non-limiting example, the temperature of the metal strip without degradation or migration is from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C., although temperatures less than 20&#xb0; C. or greater than 100&#xb0; C. may be used. For example, the sensor or monitor <b>126</b> may detect a temperature and/or line speed of the metal strip <b>102</b> through the reheater <b>112</b>. In another non-limiting example, the temperature of the metal strip <b>102</b> may be held at a set point temperature, such as from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 45&#xb0; C., to prevent potential degradation or migration. Based on the detected temperature and/or line speed, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b> may be controlled (e.g., by adjusting power input to the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>, speed of the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B, distance of the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B from the metal strip <b>102</b>, etc.) to control the temperature of the metal strip <b>102</b> and/or temperature across the metal strip <b>102</b>. In some examples, a thermal model can be used to control various control variables of the reheater <b>112</b> to achieve a target strip temperature. Control variables of the reheater <b>112</b> include, but are not limited to, line speed, detected or modeled sheet temperature before and/or after the reheater <b>112</b>, measured air temperature in the reheater <b>112</b>, or various other variables.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As a further example, the reheater <b>112</b> may be controlled to accommodate different types of metal strips <b>102</b>. For example, depending on the type of metal strip <b>102</b> and/or desired process or product requirements, the metal strip <b>102</b> may be passed through the reheater <b>112</b> at different speeds. By controlling the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B, the temperature can be changed more quickly than conventional reheaters.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some examples, the reheater <b>112</b> may also be used to repair overaged solution heat treated products. Sometimes during metal processing, coils or blanks of the metal strip <b>102</b> may be stored for too long, which results in the metal strip <b>102</b> having high properties and low formability. Through the reheater <b>112</b>, the metal strip <b>102</b> of the overaged coils or blanks can be quickly reheated to temperatures above 540&#xb0; C. or other suitable temperatures to resolutionize the metal strip <b>102</b> and reverse the over-ageing effect.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates another example of a pre-ageing system <b>400</b>. The pre-ageing system <b>400</b> is substantially similar to the pre-ageing system <b>400</b> except that the pre-ageing system <b>400</b> also includes a lubricant dispenser <b>402</b>. The lubricant dispenser <b>402</b> is configured to apply a lubricant on the metal strip <b>102</b>. Traditionally, lubricants have maximum temperature limits for application, and exposure to high temperatures can make the lubricants less effective. High temperatures also increase lubricant migration on the metal strip <b>102</b> such that the lubricant may not be uniformly applied on the metal strip <b>102</b>. In traditional reheaters, the heating of the metal strip <b>102</b> must occur through the lubricant, and as such, the lubricants are heated. In the pre-ageing system <b>400</b>, the magnetic rotors <b>114</b>A-B heat the metal strip <b>102</b> without directly heating a lubricant on the metal strip <b>102</b> (e.g., the lubricant is only heated due to its contact with the metal strip <b>102</b> and not heated from the magnetic rotors). As such, the lubricant is heated to a lesser extent below the maximum temperature limits. In addition, because the lubricant is heated less than traditional systems, a more uniform or desired pattern of lubricant may be applied to the metal strip <b>102</b> through the lubricant dispenser <b>402</b>. Additionally, if the lubricant (such as a dry film) is applied non-uniformly (for example the lubricant is applied as discrete droplets rather than a uniform film) by the applicator, the reheater <b>112</b> warming the metal strip <b>102</b> may also melt the droplets allowing them to flow to form a more uniform film of lubricant.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> illustrates another example of pre-ageing systems <b>500</b> and <b>600</b>. The pre-ageing systems <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> are similar to the pre-ageing system <b>100</b> except that the pre-ageing systems <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> further include a second reheater <b>502</b>. In some examples, the second reheater <b>502</b> is upstream from the reheater <b>112</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). In other examples, the second reheater <b>502</b> is downstream from the reheater <b>112</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). In various examples, the second reheater <b>502</b> may be configured to heat the metal strip <b>102</b> through non-magnetic heating. For example, the second reheater <b>502</b> may be a gas-powered reheater <b>502</b> (direct such as direct flame impingement or indirect), an infrared reheater <b>502</b>, an induction reheater <b>502</b>, or various other suitable types of heaters. In various other examples, the second reheater <b>502</b> may be similar to the reheater <b>112</b> and include one or more magnetic rotors <b>114</b>. In certain examples, by providing the second reheater <b>502</b> with the reheater <b>112</b>, the amount of temperature rise in the reheaters <b>112</b> and <b>502</b> can be limited. Limiting the temperature rise may improve the shape performance of the metal strip <b>102</b>. As one non-limiting example, each reheater <b>112</b> and <b>502</b> may be configured to limit the amount of temperature rise to about 60&#xb0; C. In other examples, the temperature rise limit may be less than 60&#xb0; C. or greater than 60&#xb0; C. In one non-limiting example, the temperature rise limit may be about 150&#xb0; C. In other examples, the temperature rise limit may be greater than 150&#xb0; C. In various examples, a lower temperature rise per reheater <b>112</b> or per magnetic rotor <b>114</b> may allow for better control and/or uniformity of temperature and better control and/or uniformity of shape while allowing for rapid or fast-acting change as needed.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, in various examples, a method of pre-ageing the metal strip <b>102</b> includes receiving the metal strip <b>102</b> at the reheater <b>112</b>.

In some examples, deactivating the magnetic rotor <b>114</b> includes stopping the rotation of the magnetic rotor <b>114</b>, moving the magnetic rotor <b>114</b> away from the metal strip <b>102</b> such that a magnetic field is not induced into the metal strip <b>102</b>, or various other adjustments to stop heating the metal strip <b>102</b>.

The controller <b>1080</b> can couple to various parts of the system <b>1000</b> to provide manual or automatic (e.g., programmed and/or dynamic) control of any controllable part of the system. Controller <b>1080</b> can be coupled to the rotor motor(s) <b>1038</b>, vertical gap actuator(s) <b>1082</b> (e.g., rotor support arms), longitudinal position actuator(s) <b>1084</b>, and/or lateral position actuator(s) <b>1086</b> of any number of rotor sets <b>1004</b>, <b>1006</b> in order to provide proper control of the system <b>1000</b>.

When a temperature sensor is used, the controller <b>1080</b> may correlate changes in temperature of the metal strip to an adjustment of vertical gap that is necessary to maintain a low, near zero, or zero net change in tension for the first and second rotor sets <b>1004</b>, <b>1006</b>.

At block <b>1190</b>, a metal strip is passed through a first set of magnetic rotors. The metal strip can be passed through a first vertical gap between the first set of rotors. At block <b>1191</b>, a metal strip can be passed through a second set of magnetic rotors. The metal strip can be passed through a second vertical gap between the second set of rotors.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At block <b>1192</b>, a vertical gap of one of the first set of rotors or second set of rotors can be adjusted. The vertical gap can be increased or decreased as necessary to decrease or increase, respectively, the amount of tension induced in the metal strip by the adjusted rotor set. For example, if the first rotor set is applying too much downstream force to be compensated for by the second rotor set, the vertical gap of the first rotor set can be increased at block <b>1192</b> so that the first rotor set now applies less downstream force, which may be compensated for by the second rotor set. In some cases, block <b>1192</b> can be replaced by a block that adjusts a different parameter of the rotor set, such as rotational speed. In some cases, instead of adjusting a vertical gap, the distance adjacent the rotor can be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">At optional block <b>1196</b>, information about the metal strip can be provided to a model. Such information can be information about the type of metal used, the dimensions of the metal strip, the speed of the metal strip, or any other characteristics of the metal strip. By applying this information to a model, the system may be able to determine the necessary vertical gap for the first or second rotor set at block <b>1192</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">At optional block <b>1194</b>, the system can take a measurement of the metal strip, such as a temperature measurement or a tension measurement. The measurement can be taken by any suitable sensor. The measurement can be used to provide dynamic feedback to adjust the vertical gap at block <b>1192</b> based on the measurement. For example, a measurement received at block <b>1194</b> of increasing tension in the metal strip can be used at block <b>1194</b> to adjust the vertical gap of one of the rotor sets to bring the tension back to desired levels.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At optional block <b>1198</b>, a longitudinal position of at least one set of rotors can be adjusted.

In some cases, a lateral adjustment of one rotor of a set of magnetic rotors is accompanied by an equal and opposite lateral adjustment of an opposing rotor of the same set of rotors. For example, a top rotor that is laterally offset in a first direction towards a first edge of the metal strip can be accompanied by a bottom rotor of the same rotor set being laterally offset by the same amount in a second direction towards the second edge of the metal strip.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At optional block <b>1197</b>, the rotational speed of the rotors of at least one set of rotors can be adjusted. The rotational speed can be adjusted to change the amount of heat energy imparted onto the moving metal strip.
