Characteristics of good soil are high water holding capacity, adequate minerals such as boron, chlorine, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, magnesium, molybdenum, sulphur and zinc for promoting plant growth and it (the soil) being well-drained. The soil characteristics can be improved through the use of good management practices. The soil characteristics can also be improved using microorganisms containing the potential to decompose soil organic matter, which in turn promotes plant growth by producing metabolites, increasing water retention capacity of the soil and also improving the physical condition of the soil. The improvement in soil texture and thereby the overall soil physical property is termed as soil conditioning.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The organic contents of soils are reduced due to the extensive use of chemical fertilizers and repeated farming which leads to hardening of the soil. Further, soil particles become compact and are not able to retain nutrients and moisture due to repeated and overuse of chemical fertilizers. Due to this, higher amounts of chemical fertilizer are required to supplement mineral ions and macro nutrients which are gradually lost from the soil. Extensive use of chemical fertilizers is a major cause of imbalance in the micro and macro nutrients in the soil and has deteriorated soil health, which ultimately results in low productivity and stagnancy in agriculture growth. For optimum plant growth, nutrients must be available in sufficient and balanced quantities. Excessive and exclusive dependence on nitrogenous and phosphate fertilizers can be very harmful to the soil. As a result, overall agricultural productivity gradually declines.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The constant assault on land (soil) by agricultural and horticultural chemicals cause imbalance in the amount of essential nutrients in the soil. Thus, the soil is rendered unsuitable for sustained farming and at times the soil denatures to such an extent that normal levels of plant life cannot be supported.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">At present, waste decomposer are available in solid form but their shelf life is limited to 3 years or less than 3 years. Moreover, the efficacy lose in long storage as mother culture, and the culture dry in one year of storage in normal temperature. Furthermore, a number of other substances in the form of soil conditioners are available which claims for improving soil physical properties are very much available commercially in the market. However, these substances e.g. soil conditioners have limited activity and are not effective on all types of soil and/or crops/plants.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is felt a need for an agricultural composition that mitigates the aforementioned drawbacks.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some of the objects of the present disclosure, which at least one embodiment herein satisfies, are as follows:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present disclosure to ameliorate one or more problems of the prior art or to at least provide a useful alternative.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a semi liquid or gel form which has more than 5 years shelf life, survive in normal outside temperature, and also capable of improving soil condition and in turn promote plant growth.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another object of the present disclosure is to provide an agricultural composition comprising an additive for soil conditioning and plant growth regulator for promoting plant growth.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other objects and advantages of the present disclosure will be more apparent from the following description, which is not intended to limit the scope of present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An aspect of the present invention is to address at least the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention is an agricultural composition to improve the soil fertility.

To improve agricultural productivity, farmers use chemicals to fertilize plants and to fight pests and diseases. However, most of these chemicals destroy beneficial soil microorganisms and damage a plant's natural ability to fend off pests and diseases. Further, chemical fertilizers can build up in the soil and eventually reduce the overall productivity of the soil, and the plants become weaker and weaker in the process.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Plant productivity, crop yield and soil health are directly related to each other. An organic carbon deficient soil cannot produce better crop and plant, and is considered as less fertile. Soil fertility can be enhanced/improved by improving the soil physical, chemical and biological properties.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Therefore, there is a need for an environmentally friendly additive capable of improving soil condition and soil property of compact or rigid soil by providing loosening effect on soil resulting in soil becoming less rigid and less compact to facilitate favorable soil conditions for plants which allow roots to penetrate the soil more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Therefore, the present disclosure envisages a composition for improving soil condition which in turn promotes plant growth and that mitigates the aforestated drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention is directed to a composition or an agricultural composition to improve the soil fertility.
