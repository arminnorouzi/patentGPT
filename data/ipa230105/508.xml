Overview</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present disclosure relates to techniques and systems for controlling a medical device such as a basket retrieval device for retrieving urinary stones. The basket retrieval device can be used in different situations during a medical procedure, such as ureteroscopy. For example, the basket can be used to capture a urinary stone, release the urinary stone, reposition the urinary stone, shake off the tissue on the basket, and/or break up urinary stone congestion. Different scenarios utilize different techniques for operating the basket retrieval device. The basket can be controlled to open/close, insert/retract, and/or rotate, with varying velocities depending on the scenario. In some embodiments, movement of the basket retrieval device is coordinated with movement of a scope for better feedback and control. Typically, the basket retrieval device is operated by two people, a physician controlling the insertion/retraction of the basket retrieval device and an assistant controlling opening/closing the basket itself. As such, cooperation and coordination between the physician and assistant is needed for successful operation of the device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Kidney stone disease, also known as urolithiasis, is a relatively common medical condition that involves the formation, in the urinary tract, of a solid piece of material, referred to as &#x201c;kidney stones,&#x201d; &#x201c;urinary stones,&#x201d; &#x201c;renal calculi,&#x201d; &#x201c;renal lithiasis,&#x201d; or &#x201c;nephrolithiasis.&#x201d; Urinary stones can be formed and/or found in the kidneys, the ureters, and the bladder (referred to as &#x201c;bladder stones&#x201d;). Such urinary stones form as a result of concentrated minerals and can cause significant abdominal pain once they reach a size sufficient to impede urine flow through the ureter or urethra. Urinary stones can be formed from calcium, magnesium, ammonia, uric acid, cysteine, and/or other compounds.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">To remove urinary stones from the bladder and ureter, surgeons can insert a ureteroscope into the urinary tract through the urethra. Typically, a ureteroscope includes an endoscope at its distal end configured to enable visualization of the urinary tract. The ureteroscope can also include a lithotomy mechanism, such as the basket retrieval device, to capture or break apart urinary stones. As described above, during a ureteroscopy procedure, one physician/technician can control the position of the ureteroscope, while another other physician/technician can control the lithotomy mechanism.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one example operation, the physician tries to capture the stone while the assistant controls opening/closing of the basket. This requires some amount of coordination as the physician inserts and articulates the basket (and possibly a scope at the same time), while the assistant needs to quickly close the basket around the urinary stone until the stone is fully captured. In another operation involving releasing the stone, the assistant needs to open the basket to the full amount and at high speed to release the stone. In an operation for shaking off the tissue, the assistant or physician needs to jiggle the basket back and forth at high frequency so that the tissue falls off from the basket. In an operation for repositioning the stone inside the basket, the assistant may need to slightly open the basket to give the stone the room for rotation, while the physician jiggles the basket retrieval device back and forth, and sometimes inserts or retracts the basket retrieval device at the same time to help adjust the basket position.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described above, basket operation can have various levels of complexity, depending on the medical procedure. Conventional approaches employing a single, slow speed basket drive mode that require two users to operate do not provide the physician with sufficient flexibility or ease of use. Thus, there is a need for more advanced basket drive modes that allow physicians to unilaterally control the basket (e.g., adjusting basket velocity and/or opening/closing the basket) for more dynamic basket operation, as well as the ability to control multiple instruments at the same time.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In many embodiments, the techniques and systems are discussed in the context of a minimally invasive procedure. However, it should be understood that the techniques and systems can be implemented in the context of any medical procedure including, for example, percutaneous operations where access is gained to a target location by making a puncture and/or a minor incision into the body to insert a medical instrument, non-invasive procedures, therapeutic procedures, diagnostic procedures, non-percutaneous procedures, or other types of procedures. An endoscopic procedure can include a bronchoscopy, a ureteroscopy, a gastroscopy, nephroscopy, nephrolithotomy, and so on. Further, in many embodiments, the techniques and systems are discussed as being implemented as robotically-assisted procedures. However, it should also be appreciated that the techniques and systems can be implemented in other procedures, such as in fully-robotic medical procedures.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For ease of illustration and discussion, the techniques and systems are discussed in the context of removing urinary stones, such as kidneys stones from the kidneys. However, as noted above, the techniques and systems can be used to perform other procedures. Medical System</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example medical system <b>100</b> to perform or assist in performing medical procedures in accordance with one or more embodiments. Embodiments of the medical system <b>100</b> can be used for surgical and/or diagnostic procedures. The medical system <b>100</b> includes a robotic system <b>110</b> configured to engage with and/or control a medical instrument <b>120</b> to perform a procedure on a patient <b>130</b>. The medical system <b>100</b> also includes a control system <b>140</b> configured to interface with the robotic system <b>110</b>, provide information regarding the procedure, and/or perform a variety of other operations. For example, the control system <b>140</b> can include a display <b>142</b> to present a user interface <b>144</b> to assist the physician <b>160</b> in using the medical instrument <b>120</b>. Further, the medical system <b>100</b> can include a table <b>150</b> configured to hold the patient <b>130</b> and/or an imaging sensor <b>180</b>, such as a camera, x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) device, or the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the physician performs a minimally-invasive medical procedure, such as ureteroscopy. The physician <b>160</b> can interact with the control system <b>140</b> to control the robotic system <b>110</b> to navigate the medical instrument <b>120</b> (e.g., a basket retrieval device and/or scope) from the urethra up to the kidney <b>170</b> where the stone <b>165</b> is located. The control system <b>140</b> can provide information via a display <b>142</b> regarding the medical instrument <b>120</b> to assist the physician <b>160</b> in navigation, such as real-time images from the medical instrument <b>120</b> or the imaging sensor <b>180</b>. Once at the site of the kidney stone, the medical instrument <b>120</b> can be used to break-up and/or capture a urinary stone <b>165</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations of using the medical system <b>100</b>, a physician <b>160</b> can perform a percutaneous procedure. To illustrate, if the patient <b>130</b> has a kidney stone <b>165</b> in a kidney <b>170</b> that is too large to be removed through a urinary tract, the physician <b>160</b> can perform a procedure to remove the kidney stone through a percutaneous access point on the patient <b>130</b>. For example, the physician <b>160</b> can interact with the control system <b>140</b> to control the robotic system <b>110</b> to navigate the medical instrument <b>120</b> (e.g., a scope) from the urethra up to the kidney <b>170</b> where the stone <b>165</b> is located. The control system <b>140</b> can provide information via a display <b>142</b> regarding the medical instrument <b>120</b> to assist the physician <b>160</b> in navigating the medical instrument <b>120</b>, such as real-time images from the medical instrument <b>120</b> or the imaging sensor <b>180</b>. Once at the site of the kidney stone, the medical instrument <b>120</b> can be used to designate a target location for a second medical instrument (not shown) to access the kidney percutaneously (e.g., a desired point to access the kidney). To minimize damage to the kidney, the physician <b>160</b> can designate a particular papilla as the target location for entering into the kidney with the second medical instrument. However, other target locations can be designated or determined. Once the second medical instrument has reached the target location, the physician <b>160</b> can use the second medical instrument and/or another medical instrument to extract the kidney stone from the patient <b>130</b>, such as through the percutaneous access point. Although the above percutaneous procedure is discussed in the context of using the medical instrument <b>120</b>, in some implementations a percutaneous procedure can be performed without the assistance of the medical instrument <b>120</b>. Further, the medical system <b>100</b> can be used to perform a variety of other procedures.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the medical instrument <b>120</b> is implemented as a basket retrieval device. Thus, for ease of discussion, the medical instrument <b>120</b> is also referred to as &#x201c;the basket retrieval device <b>120</b>.&#x201d; However, the medical instrument <b>120</b> can be implemented as various types of medical instruments including, for example, a scope (sometimes referred to as an &#x201c;endoscope&#x201d;), a needle, a catheter, a guidewire, a lithotripter, forceps, a vacuum, a scalpel, a combination of the above, or the like. In some embodiments, a medical instrument is a steerable device, while other embodiments a medical instrument is a non-steerable device. In some embodiments, a surgical tool refers to a device that is configured to puncture or to be inserted through the human anatomy, such as a needle, a scalpel, a guidewire, and so on. However, a surgical tool can refer to other types of medical instruments. In some embodiments, multiple medical instruments may be used. For example, an endoscope can be used with a basket retrieval device <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the medical instrument <b>120</b> may be a compound device incorporating several instruments, such as a vacuum, a basket retrieval device, a scope or various combinations of instruments.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The robotic system <b>110</b> can be configured to at least partly facilitate a medical procedure. The robotic system <b>110</b> can be arranged in a variety of ways depending on the particular procedure. The robotic system <b>110</b> can include one or more robotic arms <b>112</b> (robotic arms <b>112</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>112</b>(<i>b</i>), <b>112</b>(<i>c</i>)) to engage with and/or control the medical instrument <b>120</b> to perform a procedure. As shown, each robotic arm <b>112</b> can include multiple arm segments coupled to joints, which can provide multiple degrees of movement. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the robotic system <b>110</b> is positioned proximate to the patient's <b>130</b> lower torso and the robotic arms <b>112</b> are actuated to engage with and position the medical instrument <b>120</b> for access into an access point, such as the urethra of the patient <b>130</b>. With the robotic system <b>110</b> properly positioned, the medical instrument <b>120</b> can be inserted into the patient <b>130</b> robotically using the robotic arms <b>112</b>, manually by the physician <b>160</b>, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The robotic system <b>110</b> can also include a base <b>114</b> coupled to the one or more robotic arms <b>112</b>. The base <b>114</b> can include a variety of subsystems, such as control electronics, a power source, pneumatics, an optical source, an actuator (e.g., motors to move the robotic arm), control circuitry, memory, and/or a communication interface. In some embodiments, the base <b>114</b> includes an input/output (I/O) device <b>116</b> configured to receive input, such as user input to control the robotic system <b>110</b>, and provide output, such as patient status, medical instrument location, or the like. The I/O device <b>116</b> can include a controller, a mouse, a keyboard, a microphone, a touchpad, other input devices, or combinations of the above. The I/O device can include an output component, such as a speaker, a display, a haptic feedback device, other output devices, or combinations of the above. In some embodiments, the robotic system <b>110</b> is movable (e.g., the base <b>114</b> includes wheels) so that the robotic system <b>110</b> can be positioned in a location that is appropriate or desired for a procedure. In other embodiments, the robotic system <b>110</b> is a stationary system. Further, in some embodiments, the robotic system <b>110</b> is integrated into the table <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The robotic system <b>110</b> can be coupled to any component of the medical system <b>100</b>, such as the control system <b>140</b>, the table <b>150</b>, the imaging sensor <b>180</b>, and/or the medical instruments <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the robotic system is communicatively coupled to the control system <b>140</b>. In one example, the robotic system <b>110</b> can receive a control signal from the control system <b>140</b> to perform an operation, such as to position a robotic arm <b>112</b> in a particular manner, manipulate a scope, and so on. In response, the robotic system <b>110</b> can control a component of the robotic system <b>110</b> to perform the operation. In another example, the robotic system <b>110</b> can receive an image from the scope depicting internal anatomy of the patient <b>130</b> and/or send the image to the control system <b>140</b> (which can then be displayed on the control system <b>140</b>). Further, in some embodiments, the robotic system <b>110</b> is coupled to a component of the medical system <b>100</b>, such as the control system <b>140</b>, to receive data signals, power, and so on. Other devices, such as other medical instruments, intravenous bags, blood packs or the like can also be coupled to the robotic system <b>110</b> or other components of the medical system <b>100</b> depending on the medical procedure being performed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The control system <b>140</b> can be configured to provide various functionality to assist in performing a medical procedure. In some embodiments, the control system <b>140</b> can be coupled to the robotic system <b>110</b> and operate in cooperation with the robotic system <b>110</b> to perform a medical procedure on the patient <b>130</b>. For example, the control system <b>140</b> can communicate with the robotic system <b>110</b> via a wireless or wired connection (e.g., to control the robotic system <b>110</b>, the basket retrieval device <b>120</b>, receive an image(s) captured by a scope, etc.), control the flow of fluids through the robotic system <b>110</b> via one or more fluid channels, provide power to the robotic system <b>110</b> via one or more electrical connections, provide optical signals to the robotic system <b>110</b> via one or more optical fibers or other components, and so on. Further, in some embodiments, the control system <b>140</b> can communicate with a scope to receive sensor data. Moreover, in some embodiments, the control system <b>140</b> can communicate with the table <b>150</b> to position the table <b>150</b> in a particular orientation or otherwise control the table <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the control system <b>140</b> includes various <b>110</b> devices configured to assist the physician <b>160</b> or others in performing a medical procedure. In some embodiments, the control system <b>140</b> includes an input device <b>146</b> that is employed by the physician <b>160</b> or another user to control the basket retrieval device <b>120</b>. For example, the input device <b>146</b> can be used to navigate the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> within the patient <b>130</b>. The physician <b>160</b> can provide input via the input device <b>146</b> and, in response, the control system <b>140</b> can send control signals to the robotic system <b>110</b> to manipulate the medical instrument <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although the input device <b>146</b> is illustrated as a controller in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the input device <b>146</b> can be implemented as a variety of types of <b>110</b> devices, such as a touchscreen/pad, a mouse, a keyboard, a microphone, a smart speaker, etc. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the control system <b>140</b> can include the display <b>142</b> to provide various information regarding a procedure. For example, the control system <b>140</b> can receive real-time images that are captured by a scope and display the real-time images via the display <b>142</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the control system <b>140</b> can receive signals (e.g., analog, digital, electrical, acoustic/sonic, pneumatic, tactile, hydraulic, etc.) a medical monitor and/or a sensor associated with the patient <b>130</b>, and the display <b>142</b> can present information regarding the health of the patient <b>130</b> and/or an environment of the patient <b>130</b>. Such information can include information that is displayed via a medical monitor including, for example, a heart rate (e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate variability (HRV), etc.), blood pressure/rate, muscle bio-signals (e.g., electromyography (EMG)), body temperature. oxygen saturation (e.g., SpO<sub>2</sub>). carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), brainwave (e.g., electroencephalogram (EEG)), environmental temperature, and so on.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the input device <b>146</b> is configured to directly control movement of the basket retrieval device <b>120</b>, as well as trigger pre-programmed motions. In one embodiment, direct control involves movement that continues as long as an active input is provided by the user, for example, by pushing up or down on a joystick or actuating a button. Direct control can include movement along one or more axes, such as inserting/retracting, rotating clockwise/counterclockwise, moving left/right and/or moving up/down. Pre-programmed motions can include rapid open, rapid close, jiggle, or other pre-defined movements that are triggered by a command but do not require continuing input from the user. By using pre-programmed motions, operation of the basket retrieval device is simplified as complex movements can be initiated by simplified commands. For example, rather than requiring coordinated actions between the physician <b>160</b> and an assistant to close the basket over a stone, a rapid close action can be triggered by a single user using a simplified command (e.g., pressing or double-tapping a button).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In contrast to a regular speed opening of the basket, rapid open opens the basket at a faster speed. In some scenarios, rapid open can be used by the user to quickly open the basket to prepare for stone capture and can also be used to release the stone. In an embodiment, regular open is directly controlled by the user. For example, the drive mechanism of the basket may open the basket as long as a button is being pressed, but stops when the button is released or a torque threshold level is reached, which usually indicates the basket is fully open. This provides finer control over the basket mechanism. Meanwhile, in certain embodiments, rapid open is pre-programmed to complete a series of actions when triggered, with the drive mechanism engaging the basket to open until the threshold torque level is reached or a new command (e.g., a button press) is received. In combination, regular open and rapid open can provide the user with greater control and flexibility during a medical procedure, with regular open being used when finer control is needed and rapid open being used when speed and/or timing is more important.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In contrast to a regular speed closing of the basket, rapid close closes the basket at a faster speed. In some scenarios, rapid close can be used for the user to grasp the stone quickly and also close the basket quickly when it not being used. In an embodiment, regular close is directly controlled by the user. For example, the drive mechanism of the basket may close the basket as long as a button is being pressed, but stops when the button is released or a torque threshold level is reached, which usually indicates the basket is fully close or a stone is captured. This provides finer control over the basket mechanism. Meanwhile, in certain embodiments, rapid close is pre-programmed to complete a series of actions when triggered, with the drive mechanism engaging the basket to close until the threshold torque level is reached or a new command (e.g., a button press) is received. In combination, regular close and rapid close can provide the user with greater control and flexibility during a medical procedure, with regular close being used when finer control is needed and rapid close being used when speed and/or timing is more important.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, a jiggle motion of the basket retrieval device can be triggered by holding two buttons on the input device <b>146</b> at the same time. Other embodiments can trigger the jiggle motion with other button presses, touch screen selections, voice commands, and/or other user inputs. In some embodiments, the jiggle motion is a pre-programmed motion where the basket retrieval device inserts forward and retracts backward for a small fixed amount of basket travel at a higher speed compared to a normal basket insertion speed. For example, during direct control, the basket retrieval device can move (e.g., insert/retract) at a normal speed (lx speed), while during a pre-programmed motion, the basket retrieval device can move at an accelerated speed (e.g., 1.5&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, 3&#xd7;, or the like). This high frequency dynamic movement can be used to shake off tissue that attaches to the basket, shake off the stone during stone release, and/or can be used to break up stone congestion.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the jiggle motion includes a variable movement. For example, the user can use a direct-control movement to move the basket retrieval device from a first location where it is performing a jiggle motion to a second location to continue performing the jiggle motion. In this scenario, the pre-programmed motion is combined with a direct-control movement. The variable jiggle motion can be used to adjust stone position to address the stone being stuck. In one embodiment, the variable jiggle motion is triggered by holding down a first button and a second button at the same time, while a joystick is moved to provide a direction of movement (e.g., insert/retract). While the user presses the first and second buttons, the basket jiggles back and forth for a fixed amount. If the user then uses the joystick to insert or retract while holding both buttons, the basket can move to a new position. When the user lets go of the insertion joystick, the basket will go back to the jiggle mode with the locus of its movement moved to the new position indicated by the user. With variable jiggle mode, the user can first jiggle to loosen or rotate the stone, then insert or retract to adjust the jiggle location based on, for example, visual feedback received from a scope or the imaging sensor <b>180</b>, then continue the jiggle motion until the stone repositioned to the desired location.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows various anatomy of the patient <b>130</b> relevant to certain aspects of the present disclosure. In particular, the patient <b>130</b> includes kidneys <b>170</b> fluidly connected to a bladder <b>171</b> via ureters <b>172</b>, and a urethra <b>173</b> fluidly connected to the bladder <b>171</b>. As shown in the enlarged depiction of the kidney <b>170</b>, the kidney includes calyxes <b>174</b> (e.g., major and minor calyxes), renal papillae (including the renal papilla <b>176</b>, also referred to as &#x201c;the papilla <b>176</b>&#x201d;), and renal pyramids (including the renal pyramid <b>178</b>). In these examples, a kidney stone <b>165</b> is located in proximity to the papilla <b>176</b>.

In particular, the robotic system <b>110</b> can be positioned within proximity to a lower abdominal region of the patient <b>130</b> and aligned for direct linear access to the urethra <b>173</b> of the patient <b>130</b>. From the foot of the table <b>150</b>, the robotic arm <b>112</b>(B) can be controlled to provide access to the urethra <b>173</b>. In this example, the physician <b>160</b> inserts a medical instrument <b>120</b> at least partially into the urethra along this direct linear access path (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;a virtual rail&#x201d;). The medical instrument <b>120</b> can include a lumen configured to receive the scope and/or basket retrieval device, thereby assisting in insertion of those devices into the anatomy of the patient <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Once the robotic system <b>110</b> is properly positioned and/or the medical instrument <b>120</b> is inserted at least partially into the urethra <b>173</b>, the scope can be inserted into the patient <b>130</b> robotically, manually, or a combination thereof. For example, the physician <b>160</b> can connect the medical instrument <b>120</b> to the robotic arm <b>112</b>(C). The physician <b>160</b> can then interact with the control system <b>140</b>, such as the input device <b>146</b>, to navigate the medical instrument <b>120</b> within the patient <b>130</b>. For example, the physician <b>160</b> can provide input via the input device <b>146</b> to control the robotic arm <b>112</b>(C) to navigate the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> through the urethra <b>173</b>, the bladder <b>171</b>, the ureter<b>172</b>, and up to the kidney <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The control system <b>140</b> can include various components (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;subsystems&#x201d;) to facilitate its functionality. For example, the control system <b>140</b> can include a variety of subsystems, such as control electronics, a power source, pneumatics, an optical source, an actuator, control circuitry, memory, and/or a communication interface. In some embodiments, the control system <b>140</b> includes a computer-based control system that stores executable instructions, that when executed, implement various operations. In some embodiments, the control system <b>140</b> is movable, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, while in other embodiments, the control system <b>140</b> is a stationary system. Although various functionality and components are discussed as being implemented by the control system <b>140</b>, any of this functionality and/or components can be integrated into and/or performed by other systems and/or devices, such as the robotic system <b>110</b> and/or the table <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The medical system <b>100</b> can provide a variety of benefits, such as providing guidance to assist a physician in performing a procedure (e.g., instrument tracking, patient status, etc.), enabling a physician to perform a procedure from an ergonomic position without the need for awkward arm motions and/or positions, enabling a single physician to perform a procedure with one or more medical instruments, avoiding radiation exposure (e.g., associated with fluoroscopy techniques), enabling a procedure to be performed in a single-operative setting, providing continuous suction to remove an object more efficiently (e.g., to remove a kidney stone), and so on. Further, the medical system <b>100</b> can provide non-radiation-based navigational and/or localization techniques to reduce physician exposure to radiation and/or reduce the amount of equipment in an operating room. Moreover, the medical system <b>100</b> can divide functionality into the control system <b>140</b> and the robotic system <b>110</b>, each of which can be independently movable. Such division of functionality and/or movability can enable the control system <b>140</b> and/or the robotic system <b>110</b> to be placed at locations that are optimal for a particular medical procedure, which can maximize working area around the patient, and/or provide an optimized location for a physician to perform a procedure. For example, many aspects of the procedure can be performed by the robotic system <b>110</b> (which is positioned relatively close to the patient) while the physician manages the procedure from the comfort of the control system <b>140</b> (which can be positioned farther way).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the control system <b>140</b> can function even if located in a different geographic location from the robotic system <b>110</b>. For example, in a tele-health implementation, the control system <b>140</b> is configured to communicate over a wide area network with the robotic system <b>110</b>. In one scenario, a physician <b>160</b> may be located in one hospital with the control system <b>140</b> while the robotic system <b>110</b> is located in a different hospital. The physician may then perform the medical procedure remotely. This can be beneficial where remote hospitals, such as those in rural areas, have limited expertise in particular procedures. Those hospitals can then rely on more experienced physicians in other locations. In some embodiments, a control system <b>140</b> is able to pair with a variety of robotic systems <b>110</b>, for example, by selecting a specific robotic system and forming a secure network connection (e.g., using passwords, encryption, authentication tokens, etc.). Thus, a physician in one location may be able to perform medical procedures in a variety of different locations by setting up a connection with robotic systems <b>110</b> located at each of those different locations.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the robotic system <b>110</b>, the table <b>150</b>, the medical instrument <b>120</b>, the needle and/or the imaging sensor <b>180</b> are communicatively coupled to each other over a network, which can include a wireless and/or wired network. Example networks include one or more personal area networks (PANs), one or more local area networks (LANs), one or more wide area networks (WANs), one or more Internet area networks (IANs), one or more cellular networks, the Internet, etc. Further, in some embodiments, the control system <b>140</b>, the robotic system <b>110</b>, the table <b>150</b>, the medical instrument <b>120</b>, and/or the imaging sensor <b>180</b> are connected for communication, fluid/gas exchange, power exchange, and so on via one or more support cables.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some embodiments the medical system <b>100</b> includes and/or is associated with a medical monitor configured to monitor health of the patient <b>130</b> and/or an environment in which the patient <b>130</b> is located. For example, a medical monitor can be located in the same environment where the medical system <b>100</b> is located, such as within an operating room. The medical monitor can be physically and/or electrically coupled to one or more sensors that are configured to detect or determine one or more physical, physiological, chemical, and/or biological signals, parameters, properties, states and/or conditions associated with the patient <b>130</b> and/or the environment. For example, the one or more sensors can be configured to determine/detect any type of physical properties, including temperature, pressure, vibration, haptic/tactile features, sound, optical levels or characteristics, load or weight, flow rate (e.g., of target gases and/or liquid), amplitude, phase, and/or orientation of magnetic and electronic fields, constituent concentrations relating to substances in gaseous, liquid, or solid form, and/or the like. The one or more sensors can provide the sensor data to the medical monitor and the medical monitor can present information regarding the health of the patient <b>130</b> and/or the environment of the patient <b>130</b>. Such information can include information that is displayed via a medical monitor including, for example, a heart rate (e.g., ECG, HRV, etc.), blood pressure/rate, muscle bio-signals (e.g., EMG), body temperature, oxygen saturation (e.g., SpO<sub>2</sub>).

In some embodiments, the medical monitor and/or the one or more sensors are coupled to the control system <b>140</b> and the control systern <b>140</b> is configured to provide information regarding the health of the patient <b>130</b> and/or the environment of the patient <b>130</b>.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Example Controller</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a perspective view and a top profile view of a controller <b>200</b> for the control system <b>140</b>, respectively, according to certain embodiments. As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the input device <b>146</b>, in some embodiments, is a controller <b>200</b> or includes a controller <b>200</b>. The face of the controller can include axis movement inputs, such one or more joysticks <b>205</b>, <b>215</b> and one or more directional pads <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the joysticks <b>205</b>, <b>215</b> provide analog input while the directional pad <b>210</b> provides digital input. The face of the controller can further include a plurality of buttons <b>220</b> to provide additional controls. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the controller <b>200</b> includes four buttons on the top side of the controller: R<b>1</b> <b>225</b>, R<b>2</b>, <b>230</b> L<b>1</b> <b>235</b>, and L<b>2</b> <b>240</b>. Other embodiments can include a different number of buttons and/or a different layout. In some embodiments, the controller <b>200</b> may be a game console controller repurposed to work with the robotic system <b>110</b>. For example, the controller game firmware may be overwritten with a medical device firmware and/or an input device manager may be installed in a component of the medical system <b>100</b> (e.g., the control system <b>140</b>) to convert inputs from the controller into inputs understandable by the robotic system <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, rapid open can be triggered by double tapping the pendant top lower right button (R<b>2</b> <b>225</b>) and rapid close can be triggered by double tapping the pendant top lower left button (L<b>2</b> <b>240</b>). Users can double tap to rapidly open the basket, and double tap to rapidly close the basket. Double tap operation provides the user with easy access to the pre-programmed commands using the top two buttons (R<b>2</b>, L<b>2</b>). Meanwhile, the other inputs on the controller can be used for other functions, including controlling other medical instruments, such as inserting the scope, articulating the scope, and/or inserting the basket. These other functions can be triggered at the same time or independent from the pre-programmed motions. As will be apparent, other embodiments can configure the controller in different ways. For example, rapid open/rapid close can be triggered using other buttons and/or other interactions (e.g., using single tap, double tap, holding down a button, etc.). In one embodiment, the button mappings are switched, with rapid open triggered by the L<b>2</b> button and rapid close triggered by the R<b>2</b> button <b>225</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, jiggle motion of the basket retrieval device can be triggered by holding both the top lower right button (R<b>2</b> <b>225</b>) and the top lower left button (L<b>2</b> <b>24</b>) at the same time. By requiring both buttons to be pressed, the buttons used for rapid open and rapid close (R<b>2</b>/L<b>2</b>) can be dual-purpose, allowing more commands to be mapped to the controller <b>200</b> inputs. In one embodiment, the R<b>2</b> and L<b>2</b> buttons are triple-purpose, with single taps of the R<b>2</b> and L<b>2</b> buttons, respectively, each triggering another action. For example, single tapping R<b>2</b> may initiate regular speed open of the basket while single tapping L<b>2</b> may initiate regular speed close of the basket or vice versa. Other embodiments can trigger the jiggle motion with other button presses.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the jiggle motion can include a variable movement. In one embodiment, the first joystick <b>205</b> may be configured to directly control insertion and retraction movement of the basket retrieval device <b>120</b>. While holding down R<b>2</b> and L<b>2</b> to trigger the jiggle motion, the user can move the joystick <b>205</b> up to further insert the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> to a new location in the patient's body. Alternatively, the user can move the joystick <b>205</b> down to retract the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> to a new location towards the entry point into the body. Once the user releases the joystick <b>205</b> (while still holding down R<b>2</b> and L<b>2</b>), the jiggle motion can continue with the locus at the new location. As will be apparent, insertion and retraction can be mapped to other controller inputs, such the second joystick <b>215</b> or the directional pad <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Controller <b>200</b> operation can be customizable in some embodiments. The control system <b>140</b> can include a user interface that allows assigning of pre-programmed motions (e.g., rapid open/close, jiggle, etc.) to a desired controller layout by the user. For example, the user can assign rapid open or rapid close to any of the top buttons <b>220</b>, the directional pad <b>210</b> or one of the joysticks <b>205</b>, <b>215</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, triggering the pre-programmed motions can be at least partially automated. Machine learning or computer vision algorithms can be implemented to recognize when the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> is in the right position to perform a pre-programmed motion. For example, the medical system <b>100</b>, using its imaging sensor <b>180</b>, scope, or other sensing device can recognize that the basket is sufficiently near to the urinary stone <b>165</b> that rapid open can be triggered to capture the device. Once a threshold distance is reached, rapid open can be triggered to rapidly open the basket. Additional pre-programmed motions can also be chained together with the rapid open. For example, after opening the basket, a pre-programmed motion to further insert the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> such that the urinary stone is surrounded by the basket (&#x201c;forward insertion&#x201d; pre-programmed motion) can be triggered. Next, a rapid close could then be automatically triggered to capture the urinary stone <b>165</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As a safety precaution, pre-programmed motions can be configured to only automatically trigger in a specific mode (&#x201c;auto-capture&#x201d; mode) where automated motions are allowed. This auto-capture mode could be enabled using one of the buttons or other inputs on the controller <b>200</b> or via a menu setting in the control system <b>140</b> interface. In one scenario, the physician <b>160</b> moves the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> to the correct location near the urinary stone <b>165</b> using directly-controlled movement. The physician can then enable the auto-capture mode. If the stone is sufficiently close to meet or exceed a distance threshold, the auto-capture pre-programmed motions (e.g., rapid open, forward insertion, and/or rapid close) is automatically triggered. If the distance is greater than the distance threshold, the physician can further adjust the location of the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> until the auto-capture pre-programmed motions are triggered.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> have illustrated one embodiment of a controller <b>200</b>, other types of controllers or other input devices can also be used with the control system <b>140</b>. For example, the input device <b>146</b> for the controls system <b>140</b> can be wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.) or wired (e.g., universal serial bus (USB)). In another example, the input device <b>146</b> can be a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented on a touch screen device, such as a tablet or smart phone.

In these examples, the medical system <b>100</b> is arranged in an operating room to remove a kidney stone from the patient <b>130</b>. In many instances of such a procedure, the patient <b>130</b> is positioned in a modified supine position with the patient <b>130</b> slightly tilted to the side to access the posterior or side of the patient <b>130</b>.

Various acts are described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> and throughout this disclosure as being performed by the physician <b>160</b>. It should be understood that these acts can be performed directly by the physician <b>160</b>, indirectly by the physician with the aid of the medical system <b>100</b>, by a user under direction of the physician, by another user (e.g., a technician), and/or any other user.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Although particular robotic arms of the robotic system <b>110</b> are illustrated as performing particular functions in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, any of the robotic arms <b>112</b> can be used to perform the functions.

In some scenarios, the physician <b>160</b> or other user uses the input device <b>146</b> to directly control movement of the basket retrieval device <b>120</b>. Such directly controlled movement can include insertion/retraction, flexing the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> left or right, rotation, and/or regular open/close of the basket. Using various movements, the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> is placed close to the stone.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">At block <b>310</b>, the rapid open pre-programmed movement is triggered in response to a user input (e.g., double-tapping a button). Rapid open causes the basket of the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> to open at an accelerated rate. Using rapid open allows the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> to more quickly get into position to capture the urinary stone <b>165</b>, reducing the chances that extraneous movement (e.g., by the basket retrieval device or due to respiration/circulatory/urine flow movements within the kidney) moves the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> out of position. The rapid open movement can be triggered by double tapping a controller <b>200</b> button, using different inputs on the controller, or by using another type of input device, such as a voice command.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, a laser, shock wave device, or other device is used to break up the stone. The laser or other device may be incorporated into the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> or may be a separate medical instrument. The device for breaking up the stone may also controlled by the same input device (e.g., controller <b>200</b>) as for triggering rapid open, rapid close and/or the jiggle motion. In some situations, the stone <b>165</b> is small enough that breaking up the stone into smaller pieces is not needed. In those cases, block <b>315</b> can be skipped and the process can proceed to block <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Optionally, at block <b>315</b>, the pre-programmed jiggle motion is triggered to aid in clearing stone congestion or otherwise move the stone(s). For example, if the urinary stone <b>165</b> is broken into smaller pieces as discussed above, the jiggle motion can be used to separate the stones apart. The jiggle motion can be a pre-programmed motion where the basket retrieval device inserts forward and retracts backward for a small fixed amount of basket travel at a higher speed compared to a normal basket insertion speed. The pre-programmed jiggle motion can be triggered by pressing two buttons of the controller <b>200</b> simultaneously, using a different inputs on the controller, or by using another type of input device, such as a voice command.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">At block <b>320</b>, the open basket is maneuvered to surround the urinary stone <b>165</b> or a smaller piece of the urinary stone. In some scenarios, maneuvering is accomplished by directly-controlled movement by the physician <b>160</b> of the basket retrieval device <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, a forward insertion pre-programmed motion can be used to surround the stone with the basket. For example, if the basket is formed by wires, the forward insertion movement can include a forward movement with, optionally, a slight sideways offset to one side to avoid hitting the stone with the wires forming the distal end of the basket. Once the stone has passed the distal end, an optional sideways motion opposite the first sideways offset motion can be applied to the basket to center the basket around the stone. In other embodiments, such as with a basket formed by plurality of tines, insertion of the basket is coordinated with closing the tines in order to center the basket longitudinally around the stone and avoid moving the stone during basket closure.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The forward insertion movement can be triggered by using inputs on the controller <b>200</b> or by using another type of input device, such as a voice command. While the above has described a pre-programmed forward insertion movement, this movement can also be accomplished by the user using directly controlled movement to surround the urinary stone.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">At block <b>325</b>, the rapid close programmed movement is triggered in response to a user input (e.g., double-tapping a button). Rapid close causes the basket of the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> to close at an accelerated rate. The closing motion can continue until the basket fully closes and/or a threshold torque is reached. When the drive mechanism of the basket reaches the torque threshold, that can indicate that the basket has closed over the stone, which is preventing further closing of the basket. Limiting the torque can protect the basket from any damage due to increased stress/force applied during closure. Using rapid close allows the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> to more quickly capture the urinary stone <b>165</b>, reducing the chances that extraneous movement (e.g., by the patient or the basket retrieval device <b>120</b>) moves the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> out of position. The rapid close movement can be triggered by double tapping a controller <b>200</b> button, using different inputs on the controller, or by using another type of input device, such as a voice command. Optionally, the jiggle motion can be triggered to help adjust the stone <b>165</b> position for easier withdrawal of the stone from the kidney.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">At block <b>330</b>, the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> is withdrawn from the kidney <b>170</b> and then out of the patient's body. The rapid open movement can optionally be triggered once the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> is outside the patient's body in order to quickly release the captured stone.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">If additional stones (or large pieces of a broken-up stone <b>165</b>) exist, the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> may be reinserted into the patient to capture the remaining large pieces. In some embodiments, a vacuum instrument can be used to facilitate removal of the pieces. In some situations, the stone pieces may be sufficiently small that they can be passed by the patient naturally.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Example Basket Retrieval Device</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates a basket retrieval device <b>120</b>, according to certain embodiments. The basket retrieval device <b>120</b> can include a basket <b>405</b> formed on the distal side, a handle <b>410</b> on the proximal side, a sheath <b>415</b> between the basket and the handle, and a basket drive mechanism <b>420</b>. The basket can be formed in a variety of ways to capture urinary stones. In some embodiments, the basket is formed by two or more wire loops <b>425</b> that expand to form a space into which a stone is maneuvered and contract around the stone to capture it. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the wires can be configured to form various shapes, such as a bulb, teardrop, helical, bowl shape or the like. In other embodiments, the basket is formed by two substantially oval or round bowls with recesses facing each other to form a hollow area for the urinary stone. In some embodiments, the basket is formed by a plurality of tines configured to close around a stone. The basket can be made from a variety of materials, such as nitinol, nickel, titanium, steel, cobalt-chrome alloy, other types of metals, ceramics, polymers such as plastic, or combinations of the same.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The handle <b>410</b> of the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> can be operated by a user or a robot. In some embodiments, the basket drive mechanism <b>420</b> is built into the handle. Engaging the drive, for example, with a sliding or twisting motion, can cause the basket to open or close. In one embodiment, engaging the drive to the open position causes basket wires to extend out of the sheath into an open basket position. Engaging the drive to the closed position can cause the basket wires to retract towards the sheath, collapsing the basket. If a urinary stone is inside the basket, the stone is captured by the closing of the basket wires.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">A scope (not shown), which may be part of the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> or used in conjunction with it, can be configured to navigate within the human anatomy, such as within a natural orifice or lumen of the human anatomy. For example, the scope can include a channel through which the distal portion of the basket retrieval device <b>120</b> can be inserted. A scope can include, for example, a ureteroscope (e.g., for accessing the urinary tract), a laparoscope, a nephroscope (e.g., for accessing the kidneys), a bronchoscope (e.g., for accessing an airway, such as the bronchus), a colonoscope (e.g., for accessing the colon), an arthroscope (e.g., for accessing a joint), a cystoscope (e.g., for accessing the bladder), and so on. A scope can also be articulable, such as a distal portion of the scope, so that the scope can be steered within the human anatomy. A scope can include telescoping parts, such as an inner leader portion and an outer sheath portion, which can be manipulated to telescopically extend the scope. In some embodiments, a scope includes a working channel for deploying medical instruments (e.g., lithotripters, basketing devices, forceps, etc.), irrigation, and/or aspiration to an operative region at a distal end of the scope. A scope can accommodate wires and/or optical fibers to transfer signals to/from an optical assembly and a distal end of the scope, which can include an imaging device, such as an optical camera. A scope can also accommodate optical fibers to carry light from approximately-located light sources, such as light-emitting diodes, to the distal end of the scope. The distal end of a scope can also include an opening for a working channel to deliver tools, irrigation, and/or aspiration to an operative site. The distal end of a scope can also include a port for an imaging device, such as a camera, that can be configured to capture images of an internal anatomical space. The distal end of a scope can include ports for light sources to illuminate an anatomical space when using an imaging device.

The slot <b>1106</b> includes a vertical translation interface to position and hold the carriage <b>1102</b> at various vertical heights relative to the base <b>114</b>(B). Vertical translation of the carriage <b>1102</b> allows the robotic system <b>110</b> to adjust the reach of the robotic arms <b>112</b> to meet a variety of table heights, patient sizes, physician preferences. etc. Similarly, the individually configurable arm mounts on the carriage <b>1102</b> allow a robotic arm base <b>1108</b> of the robotic arms <b>112</b> to be angled in a variety of configurations.

For example, the I/O device(s) <b>116</b> can include a touchscreen (e.g., a dual-purpose device) to receive input and provide a physician with pre-operative and/or intra-operative data. Example pre-operative data can include pre-operative plans, navigation, and/or mapping data derived from pre-operative computerized tomography (CT) scans, and/or notes from pre-operative patient interviews. Example intra-operative data can include optical information provided from a tool/instrument, sensor, and/or coordinate information from sensors, as well as vital patient statistics, such as respiration, heart rate, and/or pulse.
