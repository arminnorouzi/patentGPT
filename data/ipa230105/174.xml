The collar <b>100</b> is intersected by a central plane or axis <b>110</b> that divides the collar <b>100</b> into a first region <b>112</b> and a second region <b>114</b>. The central plane <b>110</b> may be positioned on the collar <b>100</b> so as to bisect the collar <b>100</b> into first and second regions <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> that are of equal size and mirrored about the central plane <b>110</b>. In some examples, the central plane <b>110</b> may be positioned so that the first region <b>112</b> and the second region <b>114</b> are not mirrored about the central plane <b>110</b>, or so that the first region <b>112</b> has different dimensions, appearance, performance properties, or other attributes that differ from the second region <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Unless otherwise specified, the first region <b>112</b> and the second region <b>114</b> are intended to define boundaries or areas of the collar <b>100</b>. To that end, the first region <b>112</b> and the second region <b>114</b> generally characterize sections of the collar <b>100</b>. Further, the leaf <b>102</b>, the stand <b>104</b>, and the fold line <b>106</b> may be characterized as having portions within the first region <b>112</b> and the second region <b>114</b>.

Accordingly, aspects of the collar <b>100</b> and components thereof, may be described with reference to general areas or portions of the collar <b>100</b>, with an understanding the boundaries of the first region <b>112</b> and the second region <b>114</b> as described herein may vary between collars. Furthermore, the aspects of the collar <b>100</b> and individual components thereof, may also be described with reference to exact areas or portion of the collar <b>100</b> and the scope of the appended claims herein may incorporate the limitations associated with these boundaries of the first region <b>112</b> and the second region <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The collar <b>100</b> includes an outer edge <b>124</b> and an inner edge or neck seam <b>126</b> that both extend between a first edge <b>128</b> and a second edge <b>130</b>, the outer edge <b>124</b> being disposed opposite the inner edge <b>126</b>. The first edge <b>128</b> extends between the outer edge <b>124</b> and the inner edge <b>126</b>, and the first edge <b>128</b> is disposed within the first region <b>112</b>. The second edge <b>130</b> extends between the outer edge <b>124</b> and the inner edge <b>126</b>, and the second edge <b>130</b> is disposed within the second region <b>114</b>, opposite the first edge <b>128</b>. Accordingly, the outer edge <b>124</b> and the inner edge <b>126</b> both extend across the first region <b>112</b> and the second region <b>114</b> of the collar <b>100</b>, and both the outer edge <b>124</b> and the inner edge <b>126</b> are spaced apart from each other and intersected by the central plane <b>110</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the outer edge <b>124</b> is linear (e.g., straight) and extends in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the central plane <b>110</b>. In other examples, the outer edge <b>124</b> may not be straight and may extend at least partially or entirely at an angle with respect to the central plane <b>110</b>. For example, the outer edge <b>124</b> may include curved portions or notched portions therealong.

That is, the first intersection <b>140</b> includes the intersection of the inner edge <b>126</b>, the first edge <b>128</b>, the fold line <b>106</b>, and the first plane <b>138</b> within the first region <b>112</b> of the collar <b>100</b>. Further, a first segment <b>142</b> of the inner edge <b>126</b> extends away from the first intersection <b>140</b> toward the central plane <b>110</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first segment <b>142</b> extends at an angle with respect to the central plane <b>110</b> and to a first inflexion point <b>144</b> of the inner edge <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the inner edge <b>126</b> extends substantially perpendicular to the central plane <b>110</b> between the first inflexion point <b>144</b> and the central plane <b>110</b>, and then the first segment <b>142</b> of the inner edge <b>126</b> extends at an angle or curves with respect to the central plane <b>110</b> between the first intersection <b>140</b> and the first inflexion point <b>144</b>. In this manner, the inner edge <b>126</b> of the collar <b>100</b> can be concavely curved relative to the outer edge <b>124</b>.

The curvature of the fold line <b>106</b> within the first region <b>112</b> may be defined by a radius of curvature about the first inflexion point <b>144</b>. In some examples, the radius of curvature is constant, but in other examples the radius of curvature may vary along the fold line <b>106</b>, e.g., the curvature may be steeper near the first intersection <b>140</b> and gradually flatten toward the central plane <b>110</b>. In this manner, the fold line <b>106</b> may be convexly curved within the first region <b>112</b> relative to the first inflexion point <b>144</b> of the inner edge <b>126</b>.

Further, a stand height H<sub>S </sub>is defined between the inner edge <b>126</b> and the fold line <b>106</b>, opposite the leaf height H<sub>L</sub>. The stand height H<sub>S </sub>also changes as the location and curvature of the fold line <b>106</b> changes.

In some examples, the radius of curvature is constant, but in other examples the radius of curvature may vary along the fold line <b>106</b>, e.g., the curvature may be steeper near the second intersection <b>160</b> and gradually flatten toward the central plane <b>110</b>. In this manner, the fold line <b>106</b> may be convexly curved within the second region <b>114</b> relative to the second inflexion point <b>164</b> of the inner edge <b>126</b>. In addition, the leaf height H<sub>L </sub>changes as the location and curvature of the fold line <b>106</b> changes and the stand height H<sub>S </sub>also changes as the location and curvature of the fold line <b>106</b> changes. The curvature of the fold line <b>106</b> may vary as a function of distance from the central plane <b>110</b> and, as a result, the leaf height H<sub>L </sub>and the stand height H<sub>S </sub>also vary as a function of distance from the central plane <b>110</b>. Further, the collar <b>100</b> has a width W, i.e., a distance between the first edge <b>128</b> and the second edge <b>130</b>, that is greater between the first corner <b>136</b> and the second corner <b>156</b> than between the first intersection <b>140</b> and the second intersection <b>160</b>. Accordingly, the first corner <b>136</b> is positioned farther from the central plane <b>110</b> than the first plane <b>138</b> and the first intersection <b>140</b>. In addition, the second corner <b>156</b> is positioned farther from the central plane <b>110</b> than the second plane <b>158</b> and the second intersection <b>160</b>. In other words, the collar <b>100</b> is widest (i.e., the width W is greatest) along the outer edge <b>124</b> between the first corner <b>136</b> and the second corner <b>156</b>, while the collar is narrowest (i.e., the width W is smallest) along the inner edge <b>126</b> between the first intersection <b>140</b> and the second intersection <b>160</b>. It is contemplated that the outer edge <b>124</b> and the inner edge <b>126</b> may define equal distances therealong but may still include first and second corners <b>136</b>, <b>156</b> spaced apart a greater distance than first and second intersections <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the collar <b>100</b> is attached to a garment <b>168</b> along the inner edge <b>126</b>, such that the collar <b>100</b> is disposed about a neck opening <b>170</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the leaf <b>102</b> of the collar <b>100</b> is folded over the stand <b>104</b> along the fold line <b>106</b>. The leaf <b>102</b> includes an outer leaf surface <b>174</b> that is opposite an inner leaf surface <b>176</b>, and the stand <b>104</b> includes an inner stand surface <b>178</b> and an outer stand surface <b>180</b> that is opposite the inner stand surface <b>178</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a leaf thickness T<sub>L </sub>is defined between the outer leaf surface <b>174</b> and the inner leaf surface <b>176</b>, and a stand thickness T<sub>S </sub>is defined between the inner stand surface <b>178</b> and the outer stand surface <b>180</b>. In some embodiments, the leaf thickness T<sub>L </sub>and the stand thickness T<sub>S </sub>may be identical and constant along the first region <b>112</b> and the second region <b>114</b>. In other embodiments the leaf thickness T<sub>L </sub>may be greater than the stand thickness T<sub>S</sub>, or vice versa, and each of the leaf thickness T<sub>L </sub>and the stand thickness T<sub>S </sub>may vary along the first region <b>112</b> and the second region <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an unfolded configuration, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the outer leaf surface <b>174</b> and the outer stand surface <b>180</b> are positioned to face the same direction as each other and to be coplanar with each other. Similarly, in the unfolded configuration, the inner leaf surface <b>176</b> and the inner stand surface <b>178</b> are positioned to face the same direction as each other and to be coplanar with each other, opposite the direction that the outer leaf surface <b>174</b> and the outer stand surface <b>180</b> are positioned to face. When the collar <b>100</b> is in a folded configuration, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the leaf <b>102</b> is rotated about the fold line <b>106</b> so the outer leaf surface <b>174</b> is placed proximate and adjacent to the stand <b>104</b>. More specifically, the outer leaf surface <b>174</b> is positioned to face the outer stand surface <b>180</b> when the collar <b>100</b> is folded.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the fold line <b>106</b> includes an inner fold portion <b>184</b> and an outer fold portion <b>186</b> that is opposite the inner fold portion <b>184</b>. The inner fold portion <b>184</b> is disposed between the inner leaf surface <b>176</b> and the inner stand surface <b>178</b>, and the outer fold portion <b>186</b> is disposed between the outer leaf surface <b>174</b> and the outer stand surface <b>180</b>. The inner fold portion <b>184</b> may protrude along the fold line <b>106</b> while the outer fold portion <b>186</b> may protrude into the fold line <b>106</b>, such that the fold line forms a gap <b>190</b> between the outer leaf surface <b>174</b> and the outer stand surface <b>180</b>. Further, the fold line <b>106</b> defines a fold thickness T<sub>F </sub>that is smaller than the leaf thickness T<sub>L </sub>and the stand thickness T<sub>S</sub>. In some embodiments, the fold line <b>106</b> may have a thickness T<sub>S </sub>that is approximately 70% or less of the leaf thickness T<sub>L </sub>or the stand thickness T<sub>S</sub>. In some embodiments, the fold thickness T<sub>F </sub>may be larger than the leaf thickness T<sub>L </sub>or the stand thickness T<sub>S</sub>. In addition, the density, i.e., a weight of a fabric in a particular region which is measured in grams per square meter (GSM), of the fold line <b>106</b> may be less than the density of the leaf <b>102</b> or the stand <b>104</b>. The density of the fold line <b>106</b> can be manipulated by using particular materials, methods of forming fabric, or the shape of the measured region itself. For example, the fold line <b>106</b> may have a greater thickness T<sub>F </sub>but still have a reduced density, such as by material selection or use of certain knitting or weaving methods, in comparison to the leaf <b>102</b> or the stand <b>104</b>. In this manner, the collar <b>100</b> is configured to be self-folding, such that the gap <b>190</b> and a reduced fold thickness T<sub>F </sub>cooperate to bias the collar <b>100</b> into a folded configuration. Alternatively, the gap <b>190</b> and the reduced density of the fold line <b>106</b> in comparison to the leaf <b>102</b> or the stand <b>104</b> may cooperate to bias the collar <b>100</b> into a folded configuration. Further, the gap <b>190</b> and the shape of the outer fold portion <b>186</b>, along with the difference in thicknesses among portions of the collar <b>100</b>, cooperate with the curvature of the fold line <b>106</b> and the shape of the leaf <b>102</b> and the stand <b>104</b> to retain the collar <b>100</b> flat against itself and against the garment <b>168</b> when in the folded configuration, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the stand <b>104</b> of the collar <b>100</b> can include a mesh structure or portion <b>192</b>.

The knitting method may occur in a single knitting direction, or in several knitting directions. The knitting method may take place on a knitting machine, such as a V-bed knitting machine. The knitting machine may include a first bed, a first set of needles, a second bed, and a second set of needles. The first set of needles may be selectively activated alone or simultaneously with the second set of needles, and a partial number of the first set of needles and the second set of needles may be selectively activated, such that only some of the first set of needles or some of the second set of needles are activated. Any portion of the collar <b>100</b>, such as the leaf <b>102</b> or the stand <b>104</b> or the fold line <b>106</b>, may be manufactured by activating some or all of the first set of needles, some or all of the second set of needles, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The collar <b>100</b> may be made out of a suitable material, such as nylon, carbon, polyurethane, polyester, cotton, aramid, polyethylene, polypropylene, spandex, elastane, or any other appropriate material or blend thereof, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the relevant art.
