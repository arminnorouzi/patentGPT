A method for deep treatment of household waste leachate by a biochemical process, comprising:<claim-text>arranging one anoxic tank and two aerobic tanks in series, wherein three tanks are respectively set as a primary anoxic reactor, a primary aerobic reactor and a secondary aerobic reactor;</claim-text><claim-text>introducing the household waste leachate into the primary anoxic reactor, diluting the household waste leachate to an concentration acceptable to microorganisms; then introducing the diluted household waste leachate into the primary aerobic reactor, and subjecting the diluted household waste leachate to an pre-nitrification reaction to obtain a reactant; and introducing the reactant into the secondary aerobic reactor, and subjecting the reactant to a main nitrification reaction to convert ammonia nitrogen into nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen by nitrification of nitrobacteria, to obtain a nitrification liquid, wherein the household waste leachate is gradually introduced from the primary anoxic tank to the secondary aerobic tank by way of overflow; and</claim-text><claim-text>refluxing the nitrification liquid, i.e. the nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen, to the primary anoxic reactor through a reflux pipeline, converting the nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen into nitrogen gas by denitrobacteria in the primary anoxic reactor, and discharging the nitrogen gas into atmosphere, thereby finishing an denitrification process,</claim-text><claim-text>wherein, carbon source is consumed by the denitrobacteria in the primary anoxic tank, and provides basic energy for the denitrification, and an amount of the carbon source is determined according to a ratio of C to N in an influent, an amount of the influent and a concentration of the carbon source; generally, the ratio of C to N after carbon source adjustment is in the range of 6-8;</claim-text><claim-text>reactions performed in both the primary aerobic reactor and secondary aerobic reactor are nitrification reaction; during the nitrification reaction, oxygen is needed and provided by an aeration device, and an aeration air volume of the aeration device is determined by an amount of dissolved oxygen in the household waste leachate; the amount of the dissolved oxygen in the household waste leachate during the nitrification reaction is in the range of 0-2 mg/L in the primary aerobic reactor, and 0-4 mg/L in the secondary aerobic reactor;</claim-text><claim-text>the secondary aerobic reactor is externally connected with a built-in ultrafiltration unit; the residual nitrification liquid after refluxing to the primary anoxic reactor is introduced into the built-in ultrafiltration unit, and stirred by introducing air to achieve a separation of sludge and supernate; and</claim-text><claim-text>a resulting mixture after the separation of sludge and supernate is introduced into a remaining sludge system, wherein a part of the sludge is refluxed to a front end to supplement sludge to ensure sludge concentration in tanks, and excess sludge is discharged from the remaining sludge system to a sludge tank for dewatering treatment.</claim-text></claim-text></claim><claim id="CLM-00002" num="00002"><claim-text><b>2</b>. The method of <claim-ref idref="CLM-00001">claim 1</claim-ref>, wherein the built-in ultrafiltration unit is composed of a membrane tank, a built-in ultrafiltration membrane, a membrane suction device, a membrane cleaning device, an aeration device, and a power device; and<claim-text>the residual nitrification liquid after refluxing to the primary anoxic reactor stirred by air is contacted with the built-in ultrafiltration membrane, and the membrane suction device is started to generate negative pressure in a membrane pipeline, so that the residual nitrification liquid after refluxing to the primary anoxic reactor is introduced into a membrane pipeline having small aperture, and sludge and particles are trapped outside the membrane pipeline, thereby realizing the separation of sludge and supernate.</claim-text></claim-text></claim><claim id="CLM-00003" num="00003"><claim-text><b>3</b>.
