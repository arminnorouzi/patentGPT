description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a supporting structure for receiving battery cells and more particularly to a supporting structure which can be used to assemble a modular battery system as a traction battery for a hybrid or electrical vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electric vehicles driven by an electric motor or hybrid vehicles, driven by both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine, carry on board a battery with a plurality of battery modules, which are electrically and mechanically connected to form a battery system as a traction battery. It is known to compose each battery module of a plurality of battery cells, placed inside a module housing. To form the traction battery, the battery modules are typically contained in a battery housing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There exists an increasing demand for always larger battery systems, in order to enable longer range of vehicles and on the other side to enable electrical propulsion of bigger vehicles like trucks, buses or construction vehicles. Usually battery modules are placed on a carrier plate of the battery housing, which has to be strong enough to carry the weight of the modules. The increasing amount of battery modules requires also increased stability of the battery system, especially of the carrier plate and this in turn results in increased weight of the whole system, which is unfavorable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Besides the growing number of battery modules, it is desirable that battery system construction remains adaptable, such that the shape of the battery system is adapted to the space available for its accommodation. This is especially advantageous for vehicles where the predefined space for the battery system is often very limited and/or of an irregular shape.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, temperature control of battery cells has to be tackled accordingly to ensure a good battery performance. It is advantageous to have fluid channels for temperature control already incorporated in a housing of a battery module to avoid additional building parts and installation requirements as well as additional weight. It is also advantageous for battery cells to be in direct contact with a cooling and/or heating plate in order to maximize heat transfer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">All these different perspectives have already been addressed in the past individually. DE102011077330A1 describes placement and fixation of battery cells directly on a base plate, wherein the base plate can also be a cooling plate at the same time. DE102012205810A1 discloses a housing for a battery module, which has fluid channels for temperature control implemented in its base plate. DE 102016213832A1 relates to a bottom shell of a battery pack housing, which is formed by extrusion and has build in fluid channels for temperature control of battery cells. US 2014287292A1 describes a temperature regulating element, which serves as a base plate for direct accommodation of battery cells thereon.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">EP3331055A1 describes a battery module carrier composed of a bottom plate and two side walls and a carrier frame accommodating a plurality of battery module carriers, wherein each battery module carrier can individually be attached or detached from the carrier frame. The battery module carrier also contains cooling channels for dissipating heat generated by battery cells.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved modular supporting structure for receiving battery cells in a battery system, preferably in a hybrid or electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The object is solved by a supporting structure defined as in claim <b>1</b>. Preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent claims, the general description of the invention as well as the description of specific embodiments and the drawings.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The supporting structure for receiving battery cells in a battery system, preferably in a hybrid or electrical vehicle, comprises a bottom plate and two side plates arranged on the bottom plate, wherein the inner sides of the two side plates and the bottom plate define an internal volume for receiving the battery cells. Each side plate comprises a flange at its outer side and each flange comprises fixation means for fastening the supporting structure to an adjacent supporting structure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">By the provision of the flanges and fixation means it is possible to assemble a modular battery system by connecting at least two adjacent supporting structures to one another and achieve a structurally sound arrangement. Depending on the actual needs of different specific vehicles, it is possible to adapt the dimensions of the resulting battery system while using the same components and in particular by using the same supporting structure for a greater number of different vehicles and battery systems.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">By using the flanges of the side plates of the supporting structure, the supporting structure can furthermore be attached directly to the chassis or to any other receiving frame or to another supporting structure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the supporting structure is self-supporting, meaning that no additional carrier plate or housing is needed to achieve a mechanically stable battery system. By this measure it is possible to build a mechanically intact modular battery system on the basis of the supporting structures only.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the bottom plate and/or the side plates are provided by an extruded material, preferably by an extruded profile and/or wherein the bottom plate and the side plates are integrally formed. Using extruded material and in particular extruded profiles the supporting structure can be provided in a cost effective manner and infinite in dimensions along the extrusion direction.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further preferred embodiment, the side plates may be fastened to the bottom plate by a form-locking connection or by a screw connection or may be glued or welded to the bottom plate.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, at least one flange extends from its respective side plate at an angle, preferably perpendicularly. By arranging the flange at an angle and in particular at a right angle, the supporting structure can be easily assembled to an adjacent supporting structure or any other neighboring structure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the flange of one side plate is arranged at a different distance from the bottom plate as the flange of the other side plate, wherein the distance of the flanges from the bottom plate preferably differs by the thickness of the material of the flanges. By arranging the flanges of a supporting structure at different heights it becomes possible to connect two neighboring supporting structures such that their respective adjacent flanges overlap without colliding.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the flanges on both side plates are positioned at different heights, such that two flanges of adjacent supporting structures come into close contact upon interconnection of the corresponding bottom plates.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, each flange is positioned approximately midway along the side plate. This leads to a structurally stable arrangement.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, each flange extends in a direction parallel to the plane defined by the bottom plate from its respective side plate further than the bottom plate, preferably for forming an overlap between two adjacent flanges of two adjacent supporting structures.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the bottom plate comprises a fluid channel for receiving a temperature control fluid for controlling the temperature of the internal volume, preferably for controlling the temperature of battery cells received within the internal volume. This way the cooling/heating system is incorporated into the supporting structure and no external system for temperature control is needed, which reduces weight, assembly time and production cost.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To maximize heat transfer between the fluid channels and the battery cells, in a preferred embodiment, the supporting structure forms part of a module housing, such that the battery cells are placed directly on the bottom plate and between the side plates. This again simplifies battery assembly and reduces maintenance costs.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the battery cells are positioned directly in the internal volume, preferably directly on the bottom plate and between the side plates of the supporting structure for forming a battery module.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, the bottom plate comprises a venting channel for receiving gases released from the battery cells in case of thermal runaway. The venting channel is connected to a common venting path, wherein the venting path connects venting outlets of all battery cells accommodated on the supporting structure and conveys released gases to the venting channel and through it to the outside of the battery system.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, the bottom plate comprises at least one edge having connection means, preferably a connection geometry enabling a form-locking and/or clip connection with an adjacent supporting structure. By connecting one support structure to an adjacent support structure not only at the flanges but also at the bottom plate, a very stable modular battery system can be achieved. In particular, as the planes in which the connection between the two bottom plates on the one hand and the two flanges on the other hand take place are spaced apart from one another, the structural and mechanical stability of the connection can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The above mentioned object is also solved by a battery system with the features of claim <b>14</b>. Preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent claims, the general description of the invention as well as the description of specific embodiments and the drawings.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Accordingly, the battery system comprises at least two supporting structures for receiving battery cells wherein the supporting structures are provided in the form as already discussed above and wherein the supporting structures are interconnected at the respective adjacent bottom plates as well as at the respective adjacent flanges.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably, each bottom plate comprises connection means for enabling a form-locking and/or clip connection of two adjacent bottom plates. Preferably, the appropriate geometry for the form-locking and/or clip connection is already incorporated into the bottom plate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Mechanical connection of the bottom plates ensures stability of the connected supporting structures in the plane defined by the bottom plate. By mechanically connecting the side plates of the two adjacent supporting structures via their respective flanges, the stability of the battery system is further enhanced, since this way also the movement perpendicular to the bottom plates is suppressed. Furthermore, a connection in two planes which are distanced from each other is achieved.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present disclosure will be more readily appreciated by reference to the following detailed description when being considered in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic perspective view of a supporting structure for receiving battery cells;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a schematic perspective view of a section of a battery system comprising two adjacent supporting structures in the process of being coupled;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a schematic perspective view of the section of the battery system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> comprising two adjacent supporting structures being coupled; and</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a schematic perspective view of a supporting structure with inserted battery cells.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the following, the invention will be explained in more detail with reference to the accompanying figures.

An internal volume <b>3</b> is defined between the bottom plate <b>2</b> and the side plates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The terms &#x201c;left&#x201d; and &#x201c;right&#x201d; are to be understood related to the Figures only and are intended to serve to more easily identify the different side plates. The terms are, however, not to be interpreted in an absolute sense such that in a different perspective or orientation of the supporting structure <b>1</b>, the &#x201c;left&#x201d; side plate could also be on the right or at the back or at the front or at the top or at the bottom.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Likewise the term &#x201c;side&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; are to be understood with respect to the Figures which show a preferred example of orientation. However, the components could also be situated in a different location in a different perspective or orientation of the support structure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A plurality of battery cells may be received in the internal volume <b>3</b> between the bottom plate <b>2</b> and the inner sides of the side plates <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>. The supporting structure <b>1</b> together with battery cells (and any wiring/contact bars and/or control electronics may constitute a battery module.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A plurality of battery modules <b>100</b> may be combined to a battery system <b>10</b> for a hybrid or electrical vehicle.

Such self-supporting bottom plate <b>2</b> may be produced by an extrusion process.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The bottom plate <b>2</b> may hence be made of an extruded aluminum profile, an aluminum casting part, reinforced plastic extrusion profile or casting part or of an aluminum or steel deep drawn part.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, the bottom plate <b>2</b> preferably comprises at least one fluid channel <b>5</b> for receiving a temperature control fluid for controlling the temperature of the internal volume <b>3</b> and, thus, of the battery cells received therein.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Providing temperature control of a battery module or a battery in a battery housing by means of a temperature control fluid is, in principle, known. If cooling of the battery components is required, the temperature control fluid is typically processed to have a lower temperature than the temperature in the internal volume <b>3</b>. If a heating of the battery components is required, the temperature control fluid is typically processed to have a higher temperature than the temperature in the internal volume <b>3</b>. The temperature control fluid is made to flow through the fluid channels <b>5</b> in order to enable temperature control of the inner volume <b>3</b> by means of temperature exchange.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">There are two fluid channels <b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which are part of the extruded profile forming the bottom plate <b>2</b>. The fluid channels <b>5</b> run in parallel to each other in the exemplary implementation of this invention. However, the number and realization of fluid channels may vary in different implementations of this invention. The fluid channels <b>5</b> are a feature of the extruded profile.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The bottom plate <b>2</b> may also comprise a venting channel <b>9</b> for receiving gases released from the battery cells in case of a thermal runaway. A venting opening <b>8</b> connects a common venting arrangement to the venting channel <b>9</b>. The common venting arrangement is arranged such that the venting outlets of a number or all battery cells received in the inner volume <b>3</b> of the supporting structure <b>1</b> are combined and connected such that gases released by one or more than one battery cells are conveyed to the venting channel <b>9</b> and through it to the outside of the battery system.
