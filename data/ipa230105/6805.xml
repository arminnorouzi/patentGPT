Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, and/or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A wireless communication network may include a number of base stations (BSs) that can support communication for a number of user equipment (UEs). A UE may communicate with a BS via the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the BS to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UE to the BS. As will be described in more detail herein, a BS may be referred to as a Node B, a gNB, an access point (AP), a radio head, a transmit receive point (TRP), a 5G BS, a 5G Node B, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless communication devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. 5G, which may also be referred to as New Radio (NR), is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). 5G is designed to better support mobile broadband Internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using OFDM with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink (DL), using CP-OFDM and/or SC-FDM (e.g., also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink (UL), as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. However, as the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, there exists a need for further improvements in LTE and 5G technologies. Preferably, these improvements should be applicable to other multiple access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some communications systems, such as 5G, a base station (BS) may transmit a medium access control (MAC) control element (CE) to configure a spatial relation for an uplink reference signal resource set for a cell. For example, the BS may provide, to a UE and for a component carrier associated with the cell, a MAC CE to activate a spatial relation for a sounding reference signal (SRS) resource (e.g., a semi-persistent SRS or an aperiodic SRS). To activate spatial relations for a plurality of component carriers, the BS may transmit a plurality of MAC CEs to the UE. However, when the BS transmits a plurality of MAC CEs, the BS may use excessive network resources. Moreover, to receive the plurality of MAC CEs, a UE may use excessive power resources.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some aspects described herein may enable a BS to group a plurality of component carriers and transmit a single indicator of a spatial relation to update uplink reference signal resource sets across the plurality of component carriers. For example, the BS may provide first information identifying one or more groups of component carriers and may provide second information, which may be the aforementioned single indicator, identifying a spatial relation for at least one component carrier of the one or more groups of component carriers. In this case, the UE may identify a particular group of component carriers that includes the at least one component carrier. Further, the UE may apply the spatial relation to SRS resource sets across the particular group of component carriers. In this way, the BS may reduce signaling and UE utilization of power resources relative to transmitting a plurality of MAC CEs to configure spatial relations for a corresponding plurality of uplink reference signal resource sets.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an aspect of the disclosure, a method, a UE, an apparatus, and a computer program product are provided.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some aspects, a method of wireless communication performed by a UE includes receiving a spatial relation update indication identifying a spatial relation for one or more sounding reference signal resources; and configuring communication on a plurality of component carriers with the spatial relation for the one or more sounding reference signal resources based at least in part on receiving the spatial relation update indication.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some aspects, a UE for wireless communication includes a memory and one or more processors operatively coupled to the memory, the memory and the one or more processors configured to: receive a spatial relation update indication identifying a spatial relation for one or more sounding reference signal resources; and configure communication on a plurality of component carriers with the spatial relation for the one or more sounding reference signal resources based at least in part on receiving the spatial relation update indication.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some aspects, a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing a set of instructions for wireless communication includes one or more instructions that, when executed by one or more processors of a UE, cause the UE to: receive a spatial relation update indication identifying a spatial relation for one or more sounding reference signal resources; and configure communication on a plurality of component carriers with the spatial relation for the one or more sounding reference signal resources based at least in part on receiving the spatial relation update indication.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some aspects, an apparatus for wireless communication includes means for receiving a spatial relation update indication identifying a spatial relation for one or more sounding reference signal resources; and means for configuring communication on a plurality of component carriers with the spatial relation for the one or more sounding reference signal resources based at least in part on receiving the spatial relation update indication.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Aspects generally include a method, apparatus, system, computer program product, non-transitory computer-readable medium, user equipment, base station, wireless communication device, and/or processing system as substantially described with reference to and as illustrated by the drawings and specification.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of examples according to the disclosure in order that the detailed description that follows may be better understood.

The wireless network <b>100</b> may be an LTE network or some other wireless network, such as a 5G network. The wireless network <b>100</b> may include a number of BSs <b>110</b> (shown as BS <b>110</b><i>a</i>, BS <b>110</b><i>b</i>, BS <b>110</b><i>c</i>, and BS <b>110</b><i>d</i>) and other network entities. A BS is an entity that communicates with user equipment (UEs) and may also be referred to as a base station, a 5G BS, a Node B, a gNB, a 5G NB, an access point, a transmit receive point (TRP), and/or the like. Each BS may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In 3GPP, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to a coverage area of a BS and/or a BS subsystem serving this coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">ABS may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a pico cell, a femto cell, and/or another type of cell. A macro cell may cover a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscription. A pico cell may cover a relatively small geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscription. A femto cell may cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and may allow restricted access by UEs having association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs in a closed subscriber group (CSG)). A BS for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro BS. A BS for a pico cell may be referred to as a pico BS. A BS for a femto cell may be referred to as a femto BS or a home BS. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be a macro BS for a macro cell <b>102</b><i>a</i>, a BS <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be a pico BS for a pico cell <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and a BS <b>110</b><i>c </i>may be a femto BS for a femto cell <b>102</b><i>c</i>. A BS may support one or multiple (e.g., three) cells. The terms &#x201c;eNB&#x201d;, &#x201c;base station&#x201d;, &#x201c;5G BS&#x201d;, &#x201c;gNB&#x201d;, &#x201c;TRP&#x201d;, &#x201c;AP&#x201d;, &#x201c;node B&#x201d;, &#x201c;5G NB&#x201d;, and &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, a cell may not necessarily be stationary, and the geographic area of the cell may move according to the location of a mobile BS. In some examples, the BSs may be interconnected to one another and/or to one or more other BSs or network nodes (not shown) in the wireless network <b>100</b> through various types of backhaul interfaces such as a direct physical connection, a virtual network, and/or the like using any suitable transport network.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Wireless network <b>100</b> may also include relay stations. A relay station is an entity that can receive a transmission of data from an upstream station (e.g., a BS or a UE) and send a transmission of the data to a downstream station (e.g., a UE or a BS). A relay station may also be a UE that can relay transmissions for other UEs. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a relay station <b>110</b><i>d </i>may communicate with macro BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and a UE <b>120</b><i>d </i>in order to facilitate communication between BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>d</i>. A relay station may also be referred to as a relay BS, a relay base station, a relay, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Wireless network <b>100</b> may be a heterogeneous network that includes BSs of different types, e.g., macro BSs, pico BSs, femto BSs, relay BSs, and/or the like. These different types of BSs may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, and different impacts on interference in wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro BSs may have a high transmit power level (e.g., 5 to 40 watts) whereas pico BSs, femto BSs, and relay BSs may have lower transmit power levels (e.g., 0.1 to 2 watts).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A network controller <b>130</b> may couple to a set of BSs and may provide coordination and control for these BSs. Network controller <b>130</b> may communicate with the BSs via a backhaul. The BSs may also communicate with one another, e.g., directly or indirectly via a wireless or wireline backhaul.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">UEs <b>120</b> (e.g., <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>120</b><i>c</i>) may be dispersed throughout wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE may be stationary or mobile. A UE may also be referred to as an access terminal, a terminal, a mobile station, a subscriber unit, a station, etc. A UE may be a cellular phone (e.g., a smart phone), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a tablet, a camera, a gaming device, a netbook, a smartbook, an ultrabook, a medical device or equipment, biometric sensors/devices, wearable devices (smart watches, smart clothing, smart glasses, smart wrist bands, smart jewelry (e.g., smart ring, smart bracelet)), an entertainment device (e.g., a music or video device, or a satellite radio), a vehicular component or sensor, smart meters/sensors, industrial manufacturing equipment, a global positioning system device, or any other suitable device that is configured to communicate via a wireless or wired medium.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Some UEs may be considered machine-type communication (MTC) or evolved or enhanced machine-type communication (eMTC) UEs. MTC and eMTC UEs include, for example, robots, drones, remote devices, sensors, meters, monitors, location tags, etc., that may communicate with a base station, another device (e.g., remote device), or some other entity. A wireless node may provide, for example, connectivity for or to a network (e.g., a wide area network such as Internet or a cellular network) via a wired or wireless communication link. Some UEs may be considered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and/or may be implemented as NB-IoT (narrowband internet of things) devices. Some UEs may be considered a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).

A UE may use spatial relation information for communicating with the BS, such as for aperiodic or semi-persistent SRS transmission. The UE may receive signaling from the BS indicating an update to a spatial relation for an SRS resource (e.g., a semi-persistent SRS or an aperiodic SRS), for example, an SRS resource set on a particular component carrier, and may apply the spatial relation to other SRS resources, for example, to other SRS resource sets on other component carriers based at least in part on a configured component carrier grouping.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In general, any number of wireless networks may be deployed in a given geographic area. Each wireless network may support a particular RAT and may operate on one or more frequencies. A RAT may also be referred to as a radio technology, an air interface, and/or the like. A frequency may also be referred to as a carrier, a frequency channel, and/or the like. Each frequency may support a single RAT in a given geographic area in order to avoid interference between wireless networks of different RATs. In some cases, 5G RAT networks may be deployed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, access to the air interface may be scheduled, wherein a scheduling entity (e.g., a base station) allocates resources for communication among some or all devices and equipment within the scheduling entity's service area or cell. Within the present disclosure, as discussed further below, the scheduling entity may be responsible for scheduling, assigning, reconfiguring, and releasing resources for one or more subordinate entities. That is, for scheduled communication, subordinate entities utilize resources allocated by the scheduling entity.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Base stations are not the only entities that may function as a scheduling entity. That is, in some examples, a UE may function as a scheduling entity, scheduling resources for one or more subordinate entities (e.g., one or more other UEs). In this example, the UE is functioning as a scheduling entity, and other UEs utilize resources scheduled by the UE for wireless communication. A UE may function as a scheduling entity in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, and/or in a mesh network. In a mesh network example, UEs may optionally communicate directly with one another in addition to communicating with the scheduling entity.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thus, in a wireless communication network with a scheduled access to time-frequency resources and having a cellular configuration, a P2P configuration, and a mesh configuration, a scheduling entity and one or more subordinate entities may communicate utilizing the scheduled resources.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As indicated above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is provided merely as an example.

Accordingly, the second information may be spatial relation information. For example, BS <b>110</b> may transmit first information, via radio resource control (RRC) signaling, identifying a list of component carriers. In some aspects, UE <b>120</b> may store the first information to enable UE <b>120</b> to subsequently apply same spatial relation information to uplink reference signal resources for each bandwidth part of each component carrier of the list of component carriers. In some configurations, the second information includes a spatial relation update indication (or indicator) indicating a spatial relation to update. For example, at a subsequent time, BS <b>110</b> may transmit a medium access control (MAC) control element (CE) conveying a spatial relation update indication identifying a spatial relation for one or more SRS resources. In some aspects, the spatial relation update indication may identify one or more component carriers corresponding to one or more component carrier groups. In this case, UE <b>120</b> may determine that the explicitly identified one or more component carriers are included in one or more component carrier groups identified in the list of component carriers and may determine to update each component carrier of the one or more component carrier groups based at least in part on the spatial relation information.

Based at least in part on receiving the MAC CE, UE <b>120</b> may update an SRS resource, such as an aperiodic (AP) or semi-persistent (SP) SRS resource set identified by a respective identifier (ID) included in an AP/SP SRS Resource Set ID field of a MAC CE (e.g., as shown by Octet (Oct) 2 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). In this case, the SRS resource set may be one of a plurality of sets of one or more of the 4 different component carrier lists with one or more spatial relations identified in the MAC CE. In this way, a bitmap may identify component carriers (e.g., explicitly or by association to a group of component carriers in a component carrier list).

Additionally, or alternatively, BS <b>110</b> may use a UE-specific parameter, such as a serving cell configuration, to convey the component carrier list identifier. Additionally, or alternatively, BS <b>110</b> may use an SRS resource set (e.g., a semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS resource set, such as an AP/SP SRS Resource Set ID field of the MAC CE) to convey the component carrier list identifier, and a MAC CE to select the list identifier for spatial relation update.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some aspects, BS <b>110</b> may transmit RRC signaling to identify a list of component carriers, and may configure a list identifier in an uplink reference signal resource set.
