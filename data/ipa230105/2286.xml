The invention further concerns gypsum boards prepared using this process, apparatuses for producing a gypsum board using this process and the use of a corresponding liquefier foam to minimize the amount of liquefier required to establish a desired flowability of a gypsum/water mixture.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methods for the production of gypsum products, in particular gypsum boards are well-known. Regularly such methods involve the mixing of calcium hemihydrate (also designated as &#x201c;stucco&#x201d;), water and other additives as desired to provide a flowable mixture, which is then poured on a substrate, often made from paper or a nonwoven, and dried. To provide the gypsum mixture with the required flowability that it can be evenly spread out on the substrate, and form an even and uniform surface, often liquefiers or dispersants are added to the gypsum mixture. Such liquefiers are e.g. materials such as naphthalene sulfonates or polycarboxylate dispersants, the latter of which are more commonly used with cements as &#x201c;superplasticizers&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The addition of liquefiers, in addition to improving the flowability of the gypsum mass, has been found to also affect the size distribution of foam bubbles and the voids created by these bubbles when the gypsum board is dried. In addition, the liquefiers can retard the set of the gypsum slurry, thus complicating the manufacture of gypsum products at high production speeds. For example, if a higher amount of liquefier is added, this may increase the set time. If a wallboard is not sufficiently set when the materials passes the cutting knife of the production machinery, the product may not holds its shape on cutting and may be damaged by handling of the board after it is cut. Thus, it may be necessary to reduce the speed of the production line to allow for sufficient hardening of the material.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the liquefier is also a cost factor for the production process. However, omitting the liquefier is not a commercially feasible option as the savings by not having to use a liquefier are overcompensated by the necessity to provide sufficient flowability by adding more water into the gypsum mixture. This leads to increased effort and cost for drying the boards produced. Thus, there is a general aim at providing compositions for the preparation of gypsum board which include a liquefier to provide sufficient flowability to the gypsum slurry, while keeping the amount of liquefier at a low level to maintain the desired physical and drying characteristics of gypsum boards prepared therefrom with an as high as possible production speed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method to use an aqueous foam and dispersants together to obtain a gypsum board, which is strong and lightweight, has been described in US 2006/0278128 A1. In this application, a minor part of the dispersant is mixed with soap and water to generate a foam to provide voids in the final board product. The major part of the dispersant is mixed with water, which is then combined with stucco to prepare the gypsum/water slurry. Prior to casting the gypsum board, the foam and slurry are combined. In the soap foam of US 2006/0278128 A1 the liquefier and soap account for about 3 wt.-% and 1 wt.-% of the foam, respectively.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the investigations underlying this invention, it has now unexpectedly been found that the introduction of a foamed liquefier into the gypsum slurry provides for a higher flowability of the slurry compared to a slurry prepared with the same amount of non-foamed liquefier. In addition, it has been observed that the effect is particularly pronounced when the liquefier is foamed in the presence of low amounts of water, i.e. e.g. if the foamed liquefier is foamed from a technical grade liquefier starting material such as from liquefier having a water content of about 40 to 80 wt.-%. Such liquefiers, when foamed e.g. with a mixer, provide stable foams, which can conveniently be incorporated into gypsum/water mixtures either as an additive to the make water to prepare a gypsum slurry, to the dry ingredients of the gypsum board prior to mixture with the water or to the gypsum slurry after the mixer and prior to casting the gypsum board.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, in a first aspect, the invention concerns a method for producing a gypsum board, characterized in that a liquefier for the gypsum slurry is foamed with a gas to provide a foam having a water content of less than 85 wt.-%, then incorporated into a gypsum/water mixture and the mixture thus obtained is applied on a two dimensional substrate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The term &#x201c;gypsum/water mixture&#x201d; in the context of the application is used interchangeably with &#x201c;gypsum/water slurry&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The calcium sulfate hemihydrate or stucco in the above gypsum/water mixture, also known as calcined gypsum, is present in amounts of at least 50% of the dry materials used for the production of the gypsum board. Preferably, the amount of gypsum is at least 80%. In many wallboard formulations, the dry component material is more than 90% or even 95% calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The method of calcination is not important, and either alpha or beta-calcined stucco is suitable. Use of calcium sulfate anhydrite is also contemplated, although it is preferably used in small amounts of less than 20%.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Water used to make the slurry should be as pure as practical for best control of the properties of both the slurry and the set composition. Salts and organic compounds are well known to modify the set time of the slurry, varying widely from accelerators to set inhibitors. Some impurities lead to irregularities in the structure as the interlocking matrix of dihydrate crystals forms, reducing the strength of the set product. Product strength and consistency is thus enhanced by the use of water that is as contaminant-free as practical.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The amount of water in the gypsum/water mixture is regularly such as to provide sufficient flowability to the mixture. The amount of water to be used varies greatly according to the application with which it is being used, the exact liquefier being used, the properties of the stucco and the additives being used. The water to stucco ratio (&#x201c;WSR&#x201d;) for wallboard is preferably about 0.1 to about 0.8 based on the dry weight of the stucco. Commonly, a WSR of about 0.2 to about 0.7 is preferred.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Concerning the liquefier in the practice of the invention, there are no relevant limitations except that the liquefier should be able to provide a foam which is stable under ambient conditions on standing to allow for incorporation into a gypsum/water mixture and application of the mixture on a two dimensional substrate. Suitable liquefier for this purpose are e.g. liquefiers selected from the group comprising lignosulfonate salts, in particular with alkali or alkaline earth metal ions, naphthalenesulfonates, melamine resins, polycarboxylates, polycarboxylate esters and mixtures thereof. A particularly preferred liquefier is naphthalenesulfonate.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Technical grade liquefiers are regularly sufficient for the purposes of the invention. Since such liquefiers often contain water, the liquefier in the practice of the invention is allowed to comprise a limited amount of water, provided that the water content is less than 85 wt.-%. A water content of equal to or less than 80 wt.-% and/or 40wt.-% or more is preferred, a particularly preferred water content is from about 55 to 60 wt.-%. Most preferably, the liquefier should not contain more water than is contained in the liquefier as commercially obtained.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As indicated above, the amount of liquefier in the inventive method should be adjusted such that a suitable flowability of the gypsum/water mixture is obtained, but that on the other hand the amount of liquefier is kept at a minimum to avoid costs and deterioration of the drying characteristics of the gypsum board. As a suitable amount to meet these requirements, a liquefier amount of 0.05 to 2.5 wt.-%, preferably 0.1 to 2 wt.-%, and more preferably 0.15 to 0.5 wt.-% based on the weight of the stucco, can be mentioned.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The foaming of the liquefier with a gas can be accomplished with any conventional foaming equipment, which has feed supply for gas. Particularly preferred foaming devices include stick mixers, which can be operated at high rotation speeds and which can induce high shearing in the liquefier to be foamed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The foam thus produced and used in the further method of the invention preferably has a liquefier density of 30 to 80%, preferably 40 to 65%, relative to the density of the non-foamed liquefier. In other words, the foam includes an amount of gas, which accounts for 70 to 20 vol.-% and preferably 60 to 35 vol.-% of the liquefier foam. A preferred gas for the production of the foam is air, albeit other gases such as in particular inert gases such as nitrogen can likewise be used for the preparation of the foamed liquefier in the practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The incorporation of the liquefier foam, as indicate above, is possible at various stages of the preparation of the gypsum/water mixture. In one alternative, it is e.g. possible to add the foamed liquefier to the make water of the gypsum/water mixture, i.e. to the water, to which the gypsum and possible other solid constituents of the gypsum board is added. This alternative has the advantage, that it only requires a minimum of adaptations to the standard process of preparing gypsum boards.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a second alternative, the foamed liquefier can be incorporated into the gypsum/water mixture by addition to the solid constituents thereof prior to mixing with water. In a third alternative, foamed liquefier can be incorporated into the gypsum/water mixture after it is formed in the mixer, e.g. in particular via a feed line in front of the dispensing device for application of the gypsum/water mixture onto the two dimensional substrate. In alternative thereto, if e.g. a mixing device is used for the preparation of the gypsum/water mixture, which has an outlet for the gypsum/water mixture at the tangential side thereof and has a slurry delivery conduit attached thereto, wherein the gypsum/water mixture is further mixed via a rotating motion (as e.g. disclosed in EP 1 637 302 B1), it is possible to direct the foamed liquefier into this slurry delivery conduit via an appropriate feed line. The second and third alternatives have the advantage that the improvement of flowability is higher (i.e. the same amount of liquefier provides for a higher flowability than in a process according to the first alternative).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As indicated above, the key finding of the application is that the introduction of a foamed liquefier into a gypsum/water mixture provides for a possible reduction in the amount of liquefier, which is used to prepare the gypsum board. While this does not exclude that also some liquefier is introduced into the gypsum/water mixture as a non-foamed liquefier, this reduces the advantage provided by the invention. Thus, in the practice of the invention, it is preferred that at least 60 wt.-%, more preferably at least 80 wt.-%, even more preferably at least 90 wt.-%, even more preferably at least 95 wt.-%, and most preferably all liquefier introduced into the gypsum/water mixture is introduced therein as a foam. The term &#x201c;introduced&#x201d; covers any embodiment, wherein the foam is mixed with any of the ingredients of the gypsum/water mixture to be formed or mixed with the gypsum/water mixture after it has been generated from the water and gypsum main ingredients.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For the production of light weight gypsum boards, it is conventional that a foam composed of a soap or surfactant and water is introduced into the gypsum/water mixture prior to the application or &#x201c;pouring&#x201d; thereof onto the two dimensional substrate. Thus, in the inventive method it is preferred that a further soap based foam is incorporated into a gypsum/water mixture prior to the application or &#x201c;pouring&#x201d; thereof onto the two dimensional substrate.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With regard to this foam, it is noted that this soap or surfactant foam is regularly water based, i.e. it is generated by foaming a mixture of water and the soap or surfactant to provide the foam wherein the water accounts for the major part of the mixture. E.g., the ratio of water to soap or surfactant in such mixtures is regularly at least 5:1, preferably at least 9:1 and more preferably at least 15:1. Suitable soaps/surfactants include e.g. alkali metal and/or ammonium salts of ethoxylated, sulfated alcohols as foaming agents such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,683,635.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">If a soap/surfactant based foam is incorporated into the gypsum/water mixture in the inventive method, it is preferred that the soap/surfactant based foam and the liquefier based foam are prepared independently from each other, i.e. that the soap/surfactant and the liquefier is not mixed with water to therefor generate the foam, but that the liquefier foam is prepared in a device separate from the soap/surfactant based foam. In this regard it is preferred that no significant quantity (i.e. less than 5 wt.-%) of the entire liquefier to be incorporated into the gypsum board is foamed together with the soap/surfactant water mixture.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As concerns the two dimensional substrate, to which the gypsum/water mixture is applied, any material can be used with is conventional in the preparation of gypsum boards, and which is in particular sufficiently flexible such that it can be bend without greater difficulty. Preferably, the two dimensional substrate is or comprises cardboard or a non-woven. In addition, in the inventive method it is preferred that the mixture is covered after the application with a further substrate, which may be constituted from the same material which forms the two dimensional substrate or a different material. Preferably, the two dimensional substrate and the further substrate are from or comprise the same material, e.g. cardboard. In the resulting gypsum board, the gypsum containing layer is sandwiched between the two substrate layers thus forming a core layer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A &#x201c;two dimensional substrate&#x201d; is a substrate with extends principally in two room dimensions and has a thickness, which is significantly less than the length and width of the material.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The physical characteristics of the gypsum board can be modified and adjusted by the addition of one or more of accelerators, fibers and other conventional additives.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A suitable accelerator is e.g. calcium sulfate dihydrate or potassium sulfate.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Fibers can be incorporated in the gypsum/water mixture to improve the stiffness of the resulting gypsum boards. A preferred type of fiber for this purpose are glass fibers, which can suitably be added to the mixture. Another preferred type of fibers are paper fibers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Conventional additives, which may be used in the method of the invention, include modifiers such as e.g. cement, lime, quicklime or calcium oxide, slaked lime, also known as calcium hydroxide, soda ash, also known a sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, also known as potash, and other carbonates, silicates, phosphonates and phosphates.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further additives, which may be used in the practice of the invention include starches (e.g. to increase the paper bond and strengthen the product), wax emulsions of siloxanes (e.g. to improve the water-resistence of the finished gypsum board), trimetaphosphate compounds (to enhance the strength of the product and to improve sag resistance of the set gypsum), set retarders, flame retarders and biocides (to reduce growth of mold, mildew or fungi).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Examples of suitable biocides include boric acid, pyrithione salts and copper salts; biocides may suitably be incorporated into either the two dimensional substrate or the gypsum core layer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Examples of suitable starches include in particular pregelatinized starches or acid-modified starches. The inclusion of the pregelatinized starch increases the strength of the set and dried gypsum cast and minimizes or avoids the risk of paper delamination under conditions of increased moisture.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Also, sugars such as dextrose can be added to improve the paper bond at the ends of the gypsum boards, or boric acid can be added to increase stiffness.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the inventive process, it is furthermore preferred that the liquefier is foamed in a device, which is spatially separated from the device in which the foamed liquefier is introduced into the gypsum/water mixture. I.e. the device for foaming the liquefier is not part of the same device, wherein the gypsum/water mixture is prepared, but is separate therefrom. The foamed liquefier in this case is transferred to this device via an appropriate line.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As conventional in methods to prepare gypsum boards, the inventive methods may contain further steps including the shaping of the gypsum/water mixture into an endless ribbon or strip and allowing the gypsum/water mixture to set. The ribbon or strip can be cut to obtain a gypsum board of the desired dimensions.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a second aspect, the invention concerns a gypsum/water mixture or gypsum board obtainable according to a method as described above.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a third aspect, the invention concerns an apparatus for producing a gypsum board, preferably for implementing a method as described hereinabove, wherein said apparatus comprises a foaming device, a mixer for producing a gypsum/water mixture, and, fluidly coupled thereto, an output device for dispensing a gypsum/water mixture prepared in the mixer on a two dimensional substrate, wherein the foaming device is fluidly coupled to a supply line of water to the mixer, a supply line for solid constituents of the gypsum board to be formed or with a discharge device of the mixed material from the mixer in front of the output device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a preferred embodiment of the apparatus, the apparatus comprises two separate foaming devices wherein the first of these is adapted to prepare a foam from a water and soap/surfactant mixture, and wherein the second foaming device is adapted to prepare a foam of a liquefier. In this case, the foaming device, which is adapted to prepare a foam from a water and soap/surfactant mixture, is preferably fluidly coupled to the apparatus via a supply line to a position between the mixer and the output device.

A foam of the liquefier was produced by subjecting the naphthalenesulfonate to mixing at 4200 U/min to provide a foam having a stability of between 5 and 30 min (i.e. in this time at most 10% of the liquid initially used may separate). The thus generated foam had a density of about 610 g/L.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The foamed naphthalenesulfonate was subsequently used for the preparation of gypsum boards prepared from 400 g stucco, 276 g water, 1 g accelerator (calcium sulfate dihydrate) and 2 g/1 g liquefier (0.50/0.25 wt.-% on stucco) as follows:</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Water, stucco, accelerator and liquefier were mixed in a KitchenAid mixer by introducing the stucco/accelerator premix into the water for 10 sec and mixing for 7 sec at full throttle. In samples 1 and 2, the foamed liquefier was added to the water prior to introduction of the stucco/accelerator premix. In samples 3 and 4 the foamed liquefier was added to the stucco/accelerator premix prior to introduction thereof into the water. In sample 5 and 6 half the amount of liquefier (1.0 g, 0.25 wt.-%) compared to samples 3 and 4 was used. For comparison, a further sample without liquefier (comp. 1) was tested.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The samples were subjected to slump flow testing as follows: A stucco slurry was prepared as indicated above. After the mixing at full throttle, the slurry was transferred into a testing cone (with a 5 cm height and 10 cm width ring) within 13 sec, and excess slurry was removed with a spatula. Then, after a total time of 30 sec, the ring was lifted from the surface, and the slump flow was determined as the largest dimension of the stucco mixture spread on the surface after the flowing of the mixture has stopped.
