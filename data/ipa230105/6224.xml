Among these techniques, there is the technique of producing dihydrogen based on the corrosion of a metal such as aluminum or zinc. This corrosion does not require a supply of electrical energy in the hydrogen production phase compared to other methods such as electrolysis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It could therefore be considered as a means of producing a fuel which would then be transportable and capable of equipping a means of transport. Nevertheless, the current yield and speed of said reaction are an obstacle to such development.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, this corrosion is a reaction that can be activated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, the solid state of the metal constitutes a difficulty in the development of such a solution for producing hydrogen. In fact, the operations for conditioning the elements participating in the reaction, for bringing them into contact with a corrosive medium, the recovery of the waste resulting from the reaction, the resupply in metal are all phases that are difficult to implement within the framework of a power supply for example of a vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Based on this observation, the applicants conducted research aimed at optimizing the production of dihydrogen from a corrosion reaction in order to make it industrially viable by seeking the best way not only to activate it but also to conditioning the different elements participating in it.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, an object of the invention relates to a hydrogen-generating fuel. The production of this fuel as well as its use for the purpose of hydrogen production are also objects of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the invention is the in-situ production and at the time of use of a hydrogen-based fuel or of a hydrogen-based fuel-oxidizer mixture and the use of this fuel or this fuel-oxidant mixture in internal and/or external combustion fireplaces and in particular in piston engines, in gas turbines, in jet engines of air vehicles and in rockets.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This fuel or this fuel-oxidant mixture can also be used in any combustion fireplace in an industrial or domestic environment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the invention is to produce hydrogen with a system energy density of up to 4 Kwh/Kg.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This research also led to a method allowing the increase of hydrogen production from a corrosion reaction while keeping the advantages of such a reaction without the disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method for producing a hydrogen-generating fuel according to the invention is remarkable in that it consists in mixing in a liquid, particles of one or more metals which are corrodible by a basic chemical substance or an acidic chemical substance for the purpose of hydrogen production, said particles being kept in suspension in said liquid and the mixture made up of the liquid and said particles being chemically stabilized so as to prevent the chemical reaction between the liquid and said particles.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">This feature makes it possible to package in a liquid form the substances involved in the production of hydrogen by corrosion of metal. This packaging makes it possible to store and transfer the provided fuel and to make the latter react on demand.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Such a method provides a better yield of the corrosion reaction for the purpose of hydrogen production by creating a suspension of metal powder guaranteeing a reaction on all of the metal.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The implementation of this reaction is facilitated because hydrogen can be produced on demand in a vehicle. According to this embodiment, it is then not mandatory to store the hydrogen and/or to condition it under pressure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The advantages of the method according to the invention are understood compared to the methods of the prior art which had the following disadvantages in particular:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">they required a lot of energy for their production,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0019">they required energy for the compression and possibly the recompression of the hydrogen produced,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0020">they required the transport of hydrogen under pressure by handling equipment and by vehicles using this energy,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0021">they required equipment with dedicated technologies.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">Of course, the applicants do not prohibit themselves from applying this method to the supply of a hydrogen distribution station since the method according to the invention always provides the advantage of a demand-driven supply of hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">In addition, the station itself is then supplied with non-flammable products, namely a corrosive medium on the one hand and a metallic suspension on the other hand.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">According to another particularly advantageous feature of the invention, the size of the particles of one or more metals is between 0.001 micron and 1000 microns and can be of different sizes, the size preferably being comprised in one of following ranges:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0025">between 1 and 500 microns,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0026">between 1 and 200 microns,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0027">between 100 and 200 microns.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0022" num="0028">The particle size is chosen depending on whether a fast or slow onset reaction is desired.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0029">According to another particularly advantageous feature of the invention, said liquid is a mineral liquid or an organic liquid or a mixture of both.
