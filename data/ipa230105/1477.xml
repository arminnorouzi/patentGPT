During such manufacturing, residual perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and other compounds exist in the effluent gas stream pumped from the process tool. PFCs are difficult to remove from the effluent gas and their release into the environment is undesirable because they are known to have relatively high greenhouse activity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Known radiant burners use combustion or radiant heat to remove the PFCs and other compounds from the effluent gas stream. Typically, the effluent gas stream is a nitrogen stream containing PFCs and other compounds. A fuel gas is mixed with the effluent gas stream and that gas stream mixture is conveyed into a combustion chamber that is laterally surrounded by the exit surface of a foraminous gas burner. Fuel gas and air are simultaneously supplied to the foraminous burner to affect flameless combustion at the exit surface, with the amount of air passing through the foraminous burner being sufficient to consume not only the fuel gas supply to the burner, but also all the combustibles in the gas stream mixture injected into the combustion chamber. Electrical-powered apparatus use heat generated electrically to achieve the same effect.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although techniques exist for fabricating burner elements, they each have their own shortcomings. Accordingly, it is desired to provide an improved technique for fabricating a burner element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in the background.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, there is provided a method of fabricating a burner element for an abatement apparatus, comprising: injection moulding a charge comprising metal particles and a flow compound into a mould defining the burner element to produce a moulded burner element; and sintering the moulded burner element. The first aspect recognizes that a problem with existing burner element fabrication techniques is that a perforated liner is required onto which metal fibres in a fluid suspension are accumulated through the application of a negative pressure and resultant fluid flow through the perforated liner. This results in requiring a thicker than desired accumulation of material forming the burner element to ensure that any local anomalies in the accumulation of the burner element material on the perforated support are compensated by the macro structure. Furthermore, using this approach, the liner necessarily becomes an integral part of the burner element and the design freedom relating to the detailed structure and properties of the burner element fabricated in this way is constrained.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a method is provided. The method may be for fabricating a burner element or burner structure. The burner element may be for an abatement apparatus. The method may comprise injection moulding a charge into a mould. The charge may comprise metal particles such as fibres, strips, lengths or pieces, or powder together with a flow compound. The mould may define a void which shaped to match the shape of the burner element. The charge when moulded in the mould may produce a moulded burner element. The method may comprise sintering the moulded burner element. In this way, injection moulding is used to produce the burner element, which provides far more flexibility regarding the design and properties of the burner element and avoids the necessity of incorporating a perforated support into the burner element. This allows burner elements of more intricate design to be produced, as well as burner elements which are thinner than those produced using existing techniques, which increases the volume of a combustion chamber defined by that burner element for any external burner element size, which in turn increases the amount of effluent gas that can be treated for any burner size.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method may comprise debinding the moulded burner element to allow the flow compound to escape from the moulded burner element prior to sintering. Accordingly, the flow compound, which is used to assist the metal fibre or powder flow within the mould, may be removed before sintering occurs. Alternatively, the debinding may occur as part of the sintering.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The charge may comprise a porogen. Accordingly, the charge injected into the mould may also be provided with particles used to make pores in the moulded structure. The size and amount of porogen may be selected to provide for a particular desired porosity.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method may comprise debinding the moulded burner element to allow the porogen to escape from the moulded burner element prior to sintering. Accordingly, the porogen may be removed from the moulded burner element before sintering occurs. Alternatively, the debinding may occur as part of the sintering.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The charge may comprise around 5% to 10% by volume of the flow compound, around 15% to 20% by volume of the metal fibres with the balance being the porogen. A suitable amount of the flow compound may be provided to enable the metal fibres to flow sufficiently within the mould. The ratio of metal fibres to porogen may then selected to provide the required porosity.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The charge may comprise the porogen selected to have a melting temperature which is higher than that of the flow compound. Accordingly, the flow compound may typically melt at a lower temperature than the porogen, enabling the flow compound to be removed while the metal fibres and the porogen remain.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The charge may comprise the porogen selected to have a melting temperature which is less than a sintering temperature of the metal fibres. Accordingly, the porogen may typically melt before the sintering of the metal fibres takes place.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The charge may comprise metal powder. Accordingly, a mixture of metal powder and metal fibres may be included in the charge, in order to provide a burner element with the required properties.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The injection moulding may comprise multi-shot injection moulding comprising injection moulding one charge having a metal powder and one flow compound and another charge having the metal fibres, the flow compound and the porogen. Accordingly, injection moulding with more than one shot may occur where multiple, typically different mixture (but not exclusively) charges are injected into the mould, which may be reconfigured between charges. This enables composite structures to be produced, which provides for additional design flexibility and for improved properties of the burner element. For example, one shot may utilize a metal powder and a flow compound. This shot will typically provide a non-porous structure to form usually a structural part of the burner element, such as an outer housing, which may help define a plenum, an endplate or intermediate structural components. Another charge may have metal fibres together with the flow compound and porogen, in order to provide a porous structure which may, for example, provide a burning surface having the required properties.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The one charge may comprise around 5% to 10% by volume of the flow compound with the balance being the metal powder. Accordingly, a suitable amount of flow compound may be provided to enable the metal powder to flow into the mould.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Each shot or charge may have differing amounts of porogen to provide differing porosities for different structures forming the burner element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The differing amounts of porogen may be provided by different shots, each of which has a different ratio of porogen to metal particles and/or by varying the ratio of porogen to metal particles within a shot.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The metal particles may comprise metal fibres.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The metal powder and the metal fibres may have an overlapping sintering temperature range. This enables both the metal powder and the metal fibres to be sintered together in a single sintering operation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The injection moulding of one of the first charge and the second charge may generate surface features shaped to enhance mechanical bonding between the first charge and the second charge. Accordingly, the moulded structure produced by the first charge and/or the second charge may define or create features which facilitate the connection or fixing between the two structures.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first charge and the second charge may be at least partially separated by a void material defining a void between the first charge and the second charge. Accordingly, an intermediate or temporary void material may be utilized, typically with a restructuring or reconfiguration of the mould to facilitate its incorporation, in order to separate or create a cavity or plenum between the structures created by the first charge and the second charge.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method may comprise removing the void material prior to sintering. Accordingly, once the void material has served its purpose during the injection moulding process it may be removed before sintering takes place.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">At least one surface of the mould may comprise a removable perforated layer which forms part of the moulded burner element. Accordingly, the mould itself may be provided with a removable perforated layer which forms part of the mould into which the charge is injected. The perforated layer may then be removed from the mould, together with the attached charge, together forming the moulded burner element.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At least one of the metal fibres and the metal powder may comprise FeCr alloy and/or stainless steel. It will be appreciated that a variety of suitable metal materials may be incorporated to form the moulded burner element.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The flow compound may comprise an organic and/or a polymeric compound.

Embodiments provide an arrangement for manufacturing one or more components or elements of an abatement apparatus produced by metal injection moulding. Embodiments may produce individual porous or non-porous elements of the abatement apparatus. Typically, the component comprise a one-piece burner element formed at least partly from a porous sintered metal part which is typically fused with a non-porous housing, with a hollow plenum space between the porous and non-porous structures. This approach enables complex structures to be produced, which can have thinner porous sintered metal parts than are possible using existing techniques, which in turn provides for an increased volume available for treating effluent gases per unit volume of abatement apparatus, since the burner element itself occupies less space. The burner element may be made from a single mixture of materials or may be made as a composite structure from different mixtures of materials. Typically, the mixtures or charges are made from a metal material formed into fibres, strands, shards, lengths, pieces or powder, together with a flow compound to facilitate the flow of the metal into a mould. The porosity of the resultant moulded burner element can be improved through the addition of a suitable porogen. Also, the porosity of portions of the elements can be varied within the parts by varying the amount and/or size of the porogen in those elements. For example, one portion can have no porogen to provide a non-porous body (such as a portion of the housing, such as a mount or a plate) with other portions having different porosities (such as the burner sleeve). Also, some portions can be have discrete or variable (graded) porosities within those portions (such as the burner sleeve having differing porosities at different, typically axial, positions along the burner sleeve) by varying the amount of porogen present in those portions. The porogen can have a particle size of between around 0.5 mm to 2 mm, and typically around 1 mm. The porogen can be provided in a ratio of between around 75% to 95% porogen with the balance being the metal particles. The metal fibres can have a diameter of between around 0.05 mm to 0.25 mm, and typically around 0.1 mm. The metal powder may have a particle size of around 0.0005 mm to 0.0025 mm, and typically around 0.001 mm.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Main Fabrication Steps</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the main processing steps performed when fabricating a burner element <b>130</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>H</figref> illustrate schematically the configuration of an injection moulding apparatus during such fabrication.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At step S<b>1</b>, the various charges to be used in the preparation of the burner element are prepared. In this embodiment, the burner element comprises a foraminous burner sleeve <b>10</b> (which is cylindrical in shape, but can be of any required shape that is mouldable) concentrically surrounded by an outer housing <b>20</b> having an integral endplate <b>30</b> (which is cylindrical in shape, but can be of any required shape that is mouldable). In this embodiment, a cylindrical plenum <b>40</b> is formed between the outer housing <b>20</b> and the foraminous burner sleeve <b>10</b>, into which fuel will be provided during operation of the abatement apparatus, which passes through the foraminous burner sleeve <b>10</b> to effect combustion within a combustion chamber <b>50</b> into which an effluent stream to be treated (typically together with an oxidant) is provided. Typically, an end annular ring (not shown) bridges between the burner sleeve <b>10</b> and the outer housing <b>20</b> to enclose the plenum <b>40</b>. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments, electrically-heated burner elements may be fabricated using a similar technique.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Accordingly, at step S<b>1</b>, a charge for forming the outer housing <b>20</b> and a charge for forming the burner sleeve <b>10</b> is prepared. Typically, the charge for the outer housing <b>20</b> is a mixture of a metal powder and a flow compound. Typically, the charge for the burner sleeve <b>10</b> is a mixture of metal fibres (possibly also with a metal powder), a flow compound and a porogen.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">At step S<b>2</b>, the moulds are prepared. In this case, an outer mould <b>60</b> and an inner core <b>70</b> are co-located to define an outer housing void <b>80</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. The inner core <b>70</b> may be provided with undulations on its surface (not shown) at the location where the foraminous burner sleeve <b>10</b> will be moulded to enhance mechanical coupling between the outer housing <b>20</b> and the foraminous burner sleeve <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At step S<b>3</b>, a charge is injected. In this example, the outer housing charge is injected to form the outer housing <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At step S<b>4</b>, the mould is reconfigured and processing returns to step S<b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the first core <b>70</b> is removed and a second core <b>90</b> is inserted in its place. The second core <b>90</b> has a smaller diameter than the first core <b>70</b>, and so defines a plenum void <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At step S<b>3</b>, the plenum void <b>100</b> is filled with a plenum void material <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step S<b>4</b>, the mould is reconfigured once more and processing returns to step S<b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>, the second core <b>90</b> is removed and a third core <b>120</b> is inserted in its place. The third core <b>120</b> is of a smaller diameter than the second core <b>90</b> and defines a burner sleeve void <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second charge is injected into the burner sleeve void <b>130</b> to form the burner sleeve <b>10</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Processing then proceeds to step S<b>5</b> where breakout occurs and the moulded burner element <b>130</b> is removed from the mould, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Processing then proceeds to step S<b>6</b>, where the plenum void material <b>110</b> is removed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Processing then proceeds to step S<b>6</b> where de-binding occurs and the flow compound is removed from the burner element, typically by heating to above the flow temperature of the flow compound. The temperature is then typically increased to remove the porogen from the burner sleeve <b>10</b>. Once both the flow compound and the porogen have been removed then processing proceeds to step S<b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At step S<b>7</b>, the burner element is then sintered by raising the temperature to the sinter temperatures of the burner sleeve <b>10</b> and the outer housing <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Typically, the first charge used to create the outer housing <b>20</b> and the end plate <b>30</b> will have no porogen present in order to create a non-porous outer housing <b>20</b> and end plate <b>30</b>. The second charge used to create the burner sleeve <b>10</b> has a porogen present typically within the sizes and ratios set out above in order to provide a porous burner sleeve <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the second charge used to create the burner sleeve <b>10</b> has a variable amount of porogen present typically selected from the sizes and ratios set out above in order to provide a graded or variable porosity along its axial length. In particular, the second charge may be delivered initially with a first amount of porogen, but the amount of porogen is changed as the second charge is delivered in order to create the burner sleeve <b>10</b> with differing porosities. In some embodiments, the burner sleeve <b>10</b> is formed from a plurality of different charges, each of which has a different amount of porogen present typically selected from the sizes and ratios set out above in order to provide a different porosity at different positions along its axial length. In particular, a first of the plurality of charges may be delivered with a first amount of porogen, a second of the plurality of charges may be delivered with a second amount of porogen, and so on, in order to build up the burner sleeve <b>10</b> with different porosities at different positions. In some embodiments, other charges can also used to create other porous and non-porous structures. It will be appreciated that the different ratios of porogen can be provided by changing the amount of porogen added to a charge by a single moulding station or by moving the mould to different moulding stations, each preconfigured to deliver a different charge with a different preselected amount of porogen.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although this embodiment envisages a cylindrical combustion chamber housed within a cylindrical outer housing, it will be appreciated that other arrangements are envisage, such as flared or conical arrangements, bell-shaped, wedge-shaped or pyramidal burner sleeves which may or may not be enclosed by a similar or differing shaped outer housing.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The flow compound is typically removed by heating, although other compounds are possible which may be removed by a solvent. Likewise, the porogen is typically removed by heating, but these may also be removed instead by a solvent. The void materials may also be removed by heating but can also be removed by a solvent. It will be appreciated that the properties of the flow compounds, the porogen and any void materials will need to be selected to ensure that they are not affected during subsequent injection procedures and are unaffected by any different de-binding stages required to reveal the moulded burner element. Although in this embodiment the de-binding and sintering takes place outside of the mould, it will be appreciated that these may be performed with the moulded burner element still either wholly or at least partially retained within the mould. In another embodiment, a perforated liner (not shown) is inserted during processing at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> into the burner sleeve void <b>130</b> to abut against the inner surface of the plenum void material <b>100</b>. The perforations in the support liner are typically selected to assist in flow control of fuel from the plenum <b>40</b> into the burner sleeve <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Embodiments provide a method of producing a one-piece radiant burner comprising a porous sintered metal part fused to a non-porous housing, with a hollow &#x201c;plenum&#x201d; space in between utilising metal injection moulding techniques. This may be of any shape and is particularly advantageous for complex shapes. The porous metal shape is formed by injection moulding of a material that when heated/de-bindered forms a shape of controlled porosity in green (unsintered) form that can be sintered to give the desired product. The formulation for injection moulding may comprise metal powder, metal fibres, organic binder/wax and a porogen. The porogen typically needs to remain intact at injection moulding temperatures but be removed during the subsequent debindering/sintering. The porogen may be formed of hollow glass beads or a water-soluble wax or PMMA. The porosity should typically be around 80%. The porous metal may have a formulation akin to Fecralloy or 314 stainless steel. The cavity of the plenum likewise needs to be formed via a core of material that will withstand the injection moulding temperature. Water soluble wax could also be used. The non-porous metal typically needs to be formulated to include a binder with a lower melting point than the core and porogen materials. The metal when fused may be 304 or 316 stainless steel. Ideally the porous and non-porous materials should typically be chosen to have the same sintering temperature, recognising that the porous material needs to have high temperature oxidation resistance for use as a radiant burner. The injection mould tool will typically be designed with moveable &#x201c;gates&#x201d; allowing the non-porous metal to be injected against one face of the plenum wax core and the porous metal to be injected against the second face of the wax before the complete part is ejected from the tool.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been disclosed in detail herein, with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is understood that the invention is not limited to the precise embodiment and that various changes and modifications can be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although elements have been shown or described as separate embodiments above, portions of each embodiment may be combined with all or part of other embodiments described above.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
