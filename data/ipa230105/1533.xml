As will be appreciated, the battery receptacle portion <b>60</b> receives a removable battery pack <b>100</b> which powers the sander <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Internals of the sander are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, in which the first side part <b>30</b> and the top housing part <b>50</b> have been removed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, a motor <b>80</b> rotates an output shaft <b>81</b> which rotates a fan <b>83</b> and the sanding platen <b>200</b>. A bearing <b>82</b> supports the output shaft <b>81</b>. The platen <b>200</b> receives the output shaft <b>81</b> in an eccentric manner so that the platen <b>200</b> moves in an orbital motion when driven by the motor <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the battery receptacle portion <b>60</b> includes a first rail <b>42</b> and a second rail <b>51</b>. It also includes an electrical connection section <b>62</b> which includes a number of electrical connectors <b>63</b>. The electrical connectors <b>63</b> engage electrical connectors from the battery pack <b>100</b> so that the pack <b>100</b> can provide power to the motor <b>80</b>. The first rail <b>42</b> is made up of a rail section <b>31</b> from the first housing part <b>30</b> and a rail section <b>41</b> from the second housing part <b>40</b>. The second rail <b>51</b> is formed from the top housing part <b>50</b>. As seen, the rails <b>42</b> and <b>51</b> are generally perpendicular to a rotational axis of the motor <b>80</b>. They also run horizontally when the sander <b>10</b> is placed on a flat horizontal surface. Additionally, the electrical connector section <b>62</b> is sandwiched between the second housing part <b>40</b> and the top housing part <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The three part construction of the sander housing <b>20</b> allows for an efficient design, assembly and for construction of the rails <b>42</b> and <b>51</b>. As can be appreciated, in order to assemble the sander <b>20</b>, various parts such as the motor <b>80</b> can be inserted into the second housing part <b>40</b>. After that, the first housing part <b>30</b> and the second housing part <b>40</b> are connected to one another to secure the motor <b>80</b> therebetween. Bringing the first housing part <b>30</b> and the second housing part <b>40</b> together forms the first rail <b>42</b> out of the rail section <b>31</b> from the first housing part <b>30</b> and the rail section <b>41</b> from the second housing part <b>40</b>. The electrical connector section <b>62</b> is inserted into the second housing part <b>40</b> at the slot <b>65</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the housing parts <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> without the electrical connector section <b>62</b>, which allows the slot <b>65</b> to be seen. After the electrical connector section <b>62</b> is inserted into the slot <b>65</b>, the top housing part <b>50</b> is then connected to the first and second housing parts <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> to provide the second rail <b>51</b> and to secure the electrical connector <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Some of the above steps may be done in various orders or configurations. For example, one or more of the motor <b>80</b>, bearing <b>82</b>, fan <b>83</b> and other parts may be inserted into the first housing part <b>30</b> instead of the second housing part <b>40</b> so long as they can be clamped between the two housing parts <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>. Additionally, the electrical connector section <b>62</b> may be inserted before or after the first housing part <b>30</b> and the second housing part <b>40</b> are connected.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The three-part housing construction of the exemplary embodiment may have several advantages. For example, clamping operations in more than one direction can be performed. That is, the motor <b>80</b> can be held between the first and second housing sections <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>. Due to its location and the construction of the housing <b>20</b>, the electrical connection section <b>62</b> cannot is not clamped between the first and second housing sections <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>. However, the electrical connection section <b>62</b> can be held between the second housing section <b>40</b> and the top housing section <b>50</b>. Particularly, the electrical connection section <b>62</b> can be inserted into the second housing part <b>40</b> from a vertical direction. The top housing section <b>50</b> can then be assembled onto the first and second housing parts <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> from the vertical direction to hold the electrical connection section <b>62</b> in place.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As will be appreciated, the exemplary embodiment of the present application allows for multiple clamping or holding operations between housing parts to take place. For example, the motor <b>80</b> can be held between the first and second housing parts <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> in a first operation in a first direction and the electrical connection section <b>62</b> can be held between the top housing part <b>50</b> and the second housing part.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The battery pack <b>100</b> for powering the sander <b>10</b> is shown in further detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a perspective view of the pack <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a perspective view of the pack <b>100</b> with a lower part of the pack housing <b>201</b> removed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a side view of the pack <b>100</b> with a lower part of the pack housing <b>201</b> removed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a top view of the pack <b>100</b> with the pack housing <b>201</b> removed.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The power tool battery pack <b>100</b> includes a set of rechargeable battery cells <b>220</b> disposed in a housing <b>201</b>.
