These characteristics include ethanol tolerance, low by-product yield, rapid fermentation, and the ability to limit the amount of residual sugars remaining in the ferment. Such characteristics have a marked effect on the viability of the industrial process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Yeast of the genus <i>Saccharomyces </i>exhibits many of the characteristics required for production of ethanol. In particular, strains of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>are widely used for the production of ethanol in the fuel ethanol industry. Strains of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>that are widely used in the fuel ethanol industry have the ability to produce high yields of ethanol under fermentation conditions found in, for example, the fermentation of corn mash. An example of such a strain is the yeast used in commercially available ethanol yeast product called ETHANOL RED&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Efforts to establish and improve pentose (e.g., xylose) utilization of the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>have been reported (Kim et al., 2013, <i>Biotechnol Adv. </i>31(6):851-61). These include heterologous expression of xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) from naturally xylose fermenting yeasts such as <i>Scheffersomyces </i>(<i>Pichia</i>) <i>stipitis </i>and various <i>Candida </i>species, as well as the overexpression of xylulokinase (XK) and the four enzymes in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), namely transketolase (TKL), transaldolase (TAL), ribose-5-phosphate ketol-isomerase (RKI) and D-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (RPE). Modifying the co-factor preference of <i>S. stipitis </i>XR towards NADH in such systems has been found to provide metabolic advantages as well as improving anaerobic growth. Pathways replacing the XR/XDH with heterologous xylose isomerase (XI) have also been reported (e.g., WO2003/062430, WO2009/017441, WO2010/059095, WO2012/113120 and WO2012/135110). Efforts to improve arabinose utilization have been described in e.g., WO2003/095627, WO2010/074577 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,977,083.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Despite improvement of ethanol production processes from cellulosic material over the past decade, uptake of pentoses (e.g., xylose, arabinose) across the yeast membrane remains a challenge. WO2019/096718 relates to variant hexose transporters which can be expressed in a yeast for improved arabinose fermentation. However, there remains a need for improved pentose sugar utilization in genetically-engineered yeast for production of bioethanol in an economically and commercially relevant scale.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Described herein are, inter alia, methods for producing a fermentation product, such as ethanol, from starch or cellulosic-containing material, and microorganisms suitable for use in such processes.

See, for example, Shallom and Shoham, 2003, <i>Current Opinion In Microbiology </i>6(3): 219-228). Hemicellulases are key components in the degradation of plant biomass. Examples of hemicellulases include, but are not limited to, an acetylmannan esterase, an acetylxylan esterase, an arabinanase, an arabinofuranosidase, a coumaric acid esterase, a feruloyl esterase, a galactosidase, a glucuronidase, a glucuronoyl esterase, a mannanase, a mannosidase, a xylanase, and a xylosidase. The substrates for these enzymes, hemicelluloses, are a heterogeneous group of branched and linear polysaccharides that are bound via hydrogen bonds to the cellulose microfibrils in the plant cell wall, crosslinking them into a robust network. Hemicelluloses are also covalently attached to lignin, forming together with cellulose a highly complex structure. The variable structure and organization of hemicelluloses require the concerted action of many enzymes for its complete degradation. The catalytic modules of hemicellulases are either glycoside hydrolases (GHs) that hydrolyze glycosidic bonds, or carbohydrate esterases (CEs), which hydrolyze ester linkages of acetate or ferulic acid side groups. These catalytic modules, based on homology of their primary sequence, can be assigned into GH and CE families. Some families, with an overall similar fold, can be further grouped into clans, marked alphabetically (e.g., GH-A). A most informative and updated classification of these and other carbohydrate active enzymes is available in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database.

In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) that can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about expression of the polynucleotide. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vector may be a linear or closed circular plasmid.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113">The vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one that, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids that together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the cell, or a transposon, may be used.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114">The expression vector may contain any suitable promoter sequence that is recognized by a cell for expression of a gene described herein.

Any leader sequence that is functional in the yeast cell of choice may be used.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0122">Suitable leaders for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for enolase (e.g., <i>S. cerevisiae </i>or <i>I. orientalis </i>enolase (ENO-1)), 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (e.g., <i>S. cerevisiae </i>or <i>I. orientalis </i>3-phosphoglycerate kinase), alpha-factor (e.g., <i>S. cerevisiae </i>or <i>I. orientalis </i>alpha-factor), and alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (e.g., <i>S. cerevisiae </i>or <i>I. orientalis </i>alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2/GAP)).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">The control sequence may also be a polyadenylation sequence; a sequence operably linked to the 3&#x2032;-terminus of the polynucleotide and, when transcribed, is recognized by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used. Useful polyadenylation sequences for yeast cells are described by Guo and Sherman, 1995, <i>Mol. Cellular Biol. </i>15: 5983-5990.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124">The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that encodes a signal peptide linked to the N-terminus of a polypeptide and directs the polypeptide into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5&#x2032;-end of the coding sequence of the polynucleotide may inherently contain a signal peptide coding sequence naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding sequence that encodes the polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5&#x2032;-end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding sequence that is foreign to the coding sequence. A foreign signal peptide coding sequence may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding sequence. Alternatively, a foreign signal peptide coding sequence may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding sequence in order to enhance secretion of the polypeptide. However, any signal peptide coding sequence that directs the expressed polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell may be used. Useful signal peptides for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>alpha-factor and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>invertase. Other useful signal peptide coding sequences are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">The control sequence may also be a propeptide coding sequence that encodes a propeptide positioned at the N-terminus of a polypeptide. The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide (or a zymogen in some cases). A propolypeptide is generally inactive and can be converted to an active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding sequence may be obtained from the genes for <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>alkaline protease (aprE), <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>neutral protease (nprT), <i>Myceliophthora thermophila </i>laccase (WO 95/33836), <i>Rhizomucor miehei </i>aspartic proteinase, and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>alpha-factor.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126">Where both signal peptide and propeptide sequences are present, the propeptide sequence is positioned next to the N-terminus of a polypeptide and the signal peptide sequence is positioned next to the N-terminus of the propeptide sequence.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127">It may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences that allow the regulation of the expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory systems are those that cause the expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory systems in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0128">The vectors may contain one or more (e.g., two, several) selectable markers that permit easy selection of transformed, transfected, transduced, or the like cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like. Suitable markers for yeast host cells include, but are not limited to, ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1, and URA3.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0129">The vectors may contain one or more (e.g., two, several) elements that permit integration of the vector into the host cell's genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0130">For integration into the host cell genome, the vector may rely on the polynucleotide's sequence encoding the polypeptide or any other element of the vector for integration into the genome by homologous or non-homologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector may contain additional polynucleotides for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids, such as 100 to 10,000 base pairs, 400 to 10,000 base pairs, and 800 to 10,000 base pairs, which have a high degree of sequence identity to the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding polynucleotides. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination. Potential integration loci include those described in the art (e.g., See US2012/0135481).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0131">For autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the yeast cell. The origin of replication may be any plasmid replicator mediating autonomous replication that functions in a cell. The term &#x201c;origin of replication&#x201d; or &#x201c;plasmid replicator&#x201d; means a polynucleotide that enables a plasmid or vector to replicate in vivo. Examples of origins of replication for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication, ARS1, ARS4, the combination of ARS1 and CEN3, and the combination of ARS4 and CEN6.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0132">More than one copy of a polynucleotide described herein may be inserted into a host cell to increase production of a polypeptide. An increase in the copy number of the polynucleotide can be obtained by integrating at least one additional copy of the sequence into the yeast cell genome or by including an amplifiable selectable marker gene with the polynucleotide where cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene, and thereby additional copies of the polynucleotide, can be selected for by cultivating the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0133">The procedures used to ligate the elements described above to construct the recombinant expression vectors described herein are well known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, <i>Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, </i>2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor, New York).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0134">Additional procedures and techniques known in the art for the preparation of recombinant cells for ethanol fermentation, are described in, e.g., WO 2016/045569, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0135">The host cell or fermenting organism may be in the form of a composition comprising a host cell or fermenting organism (e.g., a yeast strain described herein) and a naturally occurring and/or a non-naturally occurring component.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0136">The host cell or fermenting organism described herein may be in any viable form, including crumbled, dry, including active dry and instant, compressed, cream (liquid) form etc. In one embodiment, the host cell or fermenting organism (e.g., a <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>yeast strain) is dry yeast, such as active dry yeast or instant yeast.

The Ser residue is the nucleophile equivalent to Ser in the Asp, His, Ser triad of subtilisin, and the Glu of the triad is a substitute for the general base, His, in subtilisin.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0394">The peptidases of the S53 family tend to be most active at acidic pH (unlike the homologous subtilisins), and this can be attributed to the functional importance of carboxylic residues, notably Asp in the oxyanion hole. The amino acid sequences are not closely similar to those in family S8 (i.e. serine endopeptidase subtilisins and homologues), and this, taken together with the quite different active site residues and the resulting lower pH for maximal activity, provides for a substantial difference to that family. Protein folding of the peptidase unit for members of this family resembles that of subtilisin, having the clan type SB.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0395">In one embodiment, the protease used according to a process described herein is a Cysteine proteases.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0396">In one embodiment, the protease used according to a process described herein is a Aspartic proteases.

For example, a promoter sequence may be inactivated resulting in no expression or a weaker promoter may be substituted for the native promoter sequence to reduce expression of the coding sequence.

Such a gene disruption can eliminate gene expression if the inserted construct separates the promoter of the gene from the coding region or interrupts the coding sequence such that a non-functional gene product results. A disrupting construct may be simply a selectable marker gene accompanied by 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; regions homologous to the gene. The selectable marker enables identification of transformants containing the disrupted gene.</p><p id="p-0524" num="0515">The host cells and fermenting organisms comprising a gene disruption may also be constructed by the process of gene conversion (see, for example, Iglesias and Trautner, 1983, <i>Molecular General Genetics </i>189: 73-76). For example, in the gene conversion method, a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the gene is mutagenized in vitro to produce a defective nucleotide sequence, which is then transformed into the recombinant strain to produce a defective gene. By homologous recombination, the defective nucleotide sequence replaces the endogenous gene. It may be desirable that the defective nucleotide sequence also comprises a marker for selection of transformants containing the defective gene.</p><p id="p-0525" num="0516">The host cells and fermenting organisms comprising a gene disruption may be further constructed by random or specific mutagenesis using methods well known in the art, including, but not limited to, chemical mutagenesis (see, for example, Hopwood, <i>The Isolation of Mutants </i>in <i>Methods in Microbiology </i>(J. R. Norris and D. W. Ribbons, eds.) pp. 363-433, Academic Press, New York, 1970). Modification of the gene may be performed by subjecting the parent strain to mutagenesis and screening for mutant strains in which expression of the gene has been reduced or inactivated. The mutagenesis, which may be specific or random, may be performed, for example, by use of a suitable physical or chemical mutagenizing agent, use of a suitable oligonucleotide, or subjecting the DNA sequence to PCR generated mutagenesis. Furthermore, the mutagenesis may be performed by use of any combination of these mutagenizing methods.</p><p id="p-0526" num="0517">Examples of a physical or chemical mutagenizing agent suitable for the present purpose include ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, hydroxylamine, N-methyl-N&#x2032;-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), N-methyl-N&#x2032;-nitrosogaunidine (NTG) O-methyl hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS), sodium bisulphite, formic acid, and nucleotide analogues.

Removal of the selectable marker gene may be accomplished by culturing the mutants on a counter-selection medium. Where the selectable marker gene contains repeats flanking its 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends, the repeats will facilitate the looping out of the selectable marker gene by homologous recombination when the mutant strain is submitted to counter-selection. The selectable marker gene may also be removed by homologous recombination by introducing into the mutant strain a nucleic acid fragment comprising 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; regions of the defective gene, but lacking the selectable marker gene, followed by selecting on the counter-selection medium. By homologous recombination, the defective gene containing the selectable marker gene is replaced with the nucleic acid fragment lacking the selectable marker gene.

Pentose fermentation pathways and pathway genes and corresponding engineered transformants for fermentation of pentose (e.g., xylose, arabinose) are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0530" num="0521">Any suitable pentose fermentation pathway gene, endogenous or heterologous, may be used and expressed in sufficient amount to produce an enzyme involved in a selected pentose fermentation pathway. With the complete genome sequence available for now numerous microorganism genomes and a variety of yeast, fungi, plant, and mammalian genomes, the identification of genes encoding the selected pentose fermentation pathway enzymatic activities taught herein is routine and well known in the art for a selected host. For example, suitable homologues, orthologs, paralogs and nonorthologous gene displacements of known genes, and the interchange of genetic alterations between organisms can be identified in related or distant host to a selected host.</p><p id="p-0531" num="0522">For host cells without a known genome sequence, sequences for genes of interest (either as overexpression candidates or as insertion sites) can typically be obtained using techniques known in the art. Routine experimental design can be employed to test expression of various genes and activity of various enzymes, including genes and enzymes that function in a pentose fermentation pathway. Experiments may be conducted wherein each enzyme is expressed in the cell individually and in blocks of enzymes up to and including preferably all pathway enzymes, to establish which are needed (or desired) for improved pentose fermentation. One illustrative experimental design tests expression of each individual enzyme as well as of each unique pair of enzymes, and further can test expression of all required enzymes, or each unique combination of enzymes.

As one in the art will appreciate, in some instances (e.g., depending on the selection of host) the heterologous expression of every gene shown in the active pentose fermentation may not be required since a host cell may have endogenous enzymatic activity from one or more pathway genes. For example, if a chosen host is deficient in one or more enzymes of an active pentose fermentation pathway, then heterologous polynucleotides for the deficient enzyme(s) are introduced into the host for subsequent expression. Alternatively, if the chosen host exhibits endogenous expression of some pathway genes, but is deficient in others, then an encoding polynucleotide is needed for the deficient enzyme(s) to achieve pentose fermentation. Thus, a recombinant host cell of the invention can be produced by introducing heterologous polynucleotides to obtain the enzyme activities of a desired biosynthetic pathway or a desired biosynthetic pathway can be obtained by introducing one or more heterologous polynucleotides that, together with one or more endogenous enzymes, produces a desired product such as ethanol.</p><p id="p-0533" num="0524">Depending on the pentose fermentation pathway constituents of a selected recombinant host organism, the host cells of the invention will include at least one heterologous polynucleotide and optionally up to all encoding heterologous polynucleotides for the pentose fermentation pathway. For example, pentose fermentation can be established in a host deficient in a pentose fermentation pathway enzyme through heterologous expression of the corresponding polynucleotide. In a host deficient in all enzymes of a pentose fermentation pathway, heterologous expression of all enzymes in the pathway can be included, although it is understood that all enzymes of a pathway can be expressed even if the host contains at least one of the pathway enzymes.</p><p id="p-0534" num="0525">The enzymes of the selected active pentose fermentation pathway, and activities thereof, can be detected using methods known in the art or as described herein.

The predominant polysaccharide in the primary cell wall of biomass is cellulose, the second most abundant is hemicellulose, and the third is pectin. The secondary cell wall, produced after the cell has stopped growing, also contains polysaccharides and is strengthened by polymeric lignin covalently cross-linked to hemicellulose. Cellulose is a homopolymer of anhydrocellobiose and thus a linear beta-(1-4)-D-glucan, while hemicelluloses include a variety of compounds, such as xylans, xyloglucans, arabinoxylans, and mannans in complex branched structures with a spectrum of substituents. Although generally polymorphous, cellulose is found in plant tissue primarily as an insoluble crystalline matrix of parallel glucan chains. Hemicelluloses usually hydrogen bond to cellulose, as well as to other hemicelluloses, which help stabilize the cell wall matrix.</p><p id="p-0642" num="0633">Cellulose is generally found, for example, in the stems, leaves, hulls, husks, and cobs of plants or leaves, branches, and wood of trees. The cellulosic-containing material can be, but is not limited to, agricultural residue, herbaceous material (including energy crops), municipal solid waste, pulp and paper mill residue, waste paper, and wood (including forestry residue) (see, for example, Wiselogel et al., 1995, in Handbook on Bioethanol (Charles E.

In most cases the pretreatment step itself results in some conversion of biomass to fermentable sugars (even in absence of enzymes).</p><p id="p-0655" num="0646">In one embodiment, the cellulosic-containing material is pretreated with steam. In steam pretreatment, the cellulosic-containing material is heated to disrupt the plant cell wall components, including lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose to make the cellulose and other fractions, e.g., hemicellulose, accessible to enzymes. The cellulosic-containing material is passed to or through a reaction vessel where steam is injected to increase the temperature to the required temperature and pressure and is retained therein for the desired reaction time. Steam pretreatment is preferably performed at 140-250&#xb0; C., e.g., 160-200&#xb0; C. or 170-190&#xb0; C., where the optimal temperature range depends on optional addition of a chemical catalyst. Residence time for the steam pretreatment is preferably 1-60 minutes, e.g., 1-30 minutes, 1-20 minutes, 3-12 minutes, or 4-10 minutes, where the optimal residence time depends on the temperature and optional addition of a chemical catalyst. Steam pretreatment allows for relatively high solids loadings, so that the cellulosic-containing material is generally only moist during the pretreatment. The steam pretreatment is often combined with an explosive discharge of the material after the pretreatment, which is known as steam explosion, that is, rapid flashing to atmospheric pressure and turbulent flow of the material to increase the accessible surface area by fragmentation (Duff and Murray, 1996, <i>Bioresource Technology </i>855: 1-33; Galbe and Zacchi, 2002, <i>Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. </i>59: 618-628; U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0164730). During steam pretreatment, hemicellulose acetyl groups are cleaved and the resulting acid autocatalyzes partial hydrolysis of the hemicellulose to monosaccharides and oligosaccharides. Lignin is removed to only a limited extent.</p><p id="p-0656" num="0647">In one embodiment, the cellulosic-containing material is subjected to a chemical pretreatment. The term &#x201c;chemical treatment&#x201d; refers to any chemical pretreatment that promotes the separation and/or release of cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or lignin. Such a pretreatment can convert crystalline cellulose to amorphous cellulose. Examples of suitable chemical pretreatment processes include, for example, dilute acid pretreatment, lime pretreatment, wet oxidation, ammonia fiber/freeze expansion (AFEX), ammonia percolation (APR), ionic liquid, and organosolv pretreatments.</p><p id="p-0657" num="0648">A chemical catalyst such as H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>or SO<sub>2 </sub>(typically 0.3 to 5% w/w) is sometimes added prior to steam pretreatment, which decreases the time and temperature, increases the recovery, and improves enzymatic hydrolysis (Ballesteros et al., 2006, <i>Appl.

In dilute acid pretreatment, the cellulosic-containing material is mixed with dilute acid, typically H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and water to form a slurry, heated by steam to the desired temperature, and after a residence time flashed to atmospheric pressure. The dilute acid pretreatment can be performed with a number of reactor designs, e.g., plug-flow reactors, counter-current reactors, or continuous counter-current shrinking bed reactors (Duff and Murray, 1996, <i>Bioresource Technology </i>855: 1-33; Schell et al., 2004, <i>Bioresource Technology </i>91: 179-188; Lee et al., 1999, <i>Adv.

SSCF involves the co-fermentation of multiple sugars (Sheehan and Himmel, 1999, <i>Biotechnol. Prog. </i>15: 817-827). HHF involves a separate hydrolysis step, and in addition a simultaneous saccharification and hydrolysis step, which can be carried out in the same reactor. The steps in an HHF process can be carried out at different temperatures, i.e., high temperature enzymatic saccharification followed by SSF at a lower temperature that the fermentation organismcan tolerate. It is understood herein that any method known in the art comprising pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis (saccharification), fermentation, or a combination thereof, can be used in the practicing the processes described herein.</p><p id="p-0672" num="0663">A conventional apparatus can include a fed-batch stirred reactor, a batch stirred reactor, a continuous flow stirred reactor with ultrafiltration, and/or a continuous plug-flow column reactor (de Castilhos Corazza et al., 2003, <i>Acta Scientiarum. Technology </i>25: 33-38; Gusakov and Sinitsyn, 1985, <i>Enz. Microb. Technol. </i>7: 346-352), an attrition reactor (Ryu and Lee, 1983, <i>Biotechnol. Bioeng. </i>25: 53-65). Additional reactor types include fluidized bed, upflow blanket, immobilized, and extruder type reactors for hydrolysis and/or fermentation.</p><p id="p-0673" num="0664">In the saccharification step (i.e., hydrolysis step), the cellulosic and/or starch-containing material, e.g., pretreated, is hydrolyzed to break down cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or starch to fermentable sugars, such as glucose, cellobiose, xylose, xylulose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, and/or soluble oligosaccharides. The hydrolysis is performed enzymatically e.g., by a cellulolytic enzyme composition. The enzymes of the compositions can be added simultaneously or sequentially.</p><p id="p-0674" num="0665">Enzymatic hydrolysis may be carried out in a suitable aqueous environment under conditions that can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, hydrolysis is performed under conditions suitable for the activity of the enzymes(s), i.e., optimal for the enzyme(s). The hydrolysis can be carried out as a fed batch or continuous process where the cellulosic and/or starch-containing material is fed gradually to, for example, an enzyme containing hydrolysis solution.</p><p id="p-0675" num="0666">The saccharification is generally performed in stirred-tank reactors or fermentors under controlled pH, temperature, and mixing conditions. Suitable process time, temperature and pH conditions can readily be determined by one skilled in the art. For example, the saccharification can last up to 200 hours, but is typically performed for preferably about 12 to about 120 hours, e.g., about 16 to about 72 hours or about 24 to about 48 hours. The temperature is in the range of preferably about 25&#xb0; C. to about 70&#xb0; C., e.g., about 30&#xb0; C. to about 65&#xb0; C., about 40&#xb0; C. to about 60&#xb0; C., or about 50&#xb0; C. to about 55&#xb0; C. The pH is in the range of preferably about 3 to about 8, e.g., about 3.5 to about 7, about 4 to about 6, or about 4.5 to about 5.5. The dry solids content is in the range of preferably about 5 to about 50 wt. %, e.g., about 10 to about 40 wt. % or about 20 to about 30 wt. %.</p><p id="p-0676" num="0667">Saccharification in may be carried out using a cellulolytic enzyme composition. Such enzyme compositions are described below in the &#x201c;Cellulolytic Enzyme Composition&#x2019;-section below. The cellulolytic enzyme compositions can comprise any protein useful in degrading the cellulosic-containing material. In one embodiment, the cellulolytic enzyme composition comprises or further comprises one or more (e.g., several) proteins selected from the group consisting of a cellulase, an AA9 (GH61) polypeptide, a hemicellulase, an esterase, an expansin, a ligninolytic enzyme, an oxidoreductase, a pectinase, a protease, and a swollenin.</p><p id="p-0677" num="0668">In another embodiment, the cellulase is preferably one or more (e.g., several) enzymes selected from the group consisting of an endoglucanase, a cellobiohydrolase, and a beta-glucosidase.</p><p id="p-0678" num="0669">In another embodiment, the hemicellulase is preferably one or more (e.g., several) enzymes selected from the group consisting of an acetylmannan esterase, an acetylxylan esterase, an arabinanase, an arabinofuranosidase, a coumaric acid esterase, a feruloyl esterase, a galactosidase, a glucuronidase, a glucuronoyl esterase, a mannanase, a mannosidase, a xylanase, and a xylosidase. In another embodiment, the oxidoreductase is one or more (e.g., several) enzymes selected from the group consisting of a catalase, a laccase, and a peroxidase. The enzymes or enzyme compositions used in a processes of the present invention may be in any form suitable for use, such as, for example, a fermentation broth formulation or a cell composition, a cell lysate with or without cellular debris, a semi-purified or purified enzyme preparation, or a host cell as a source of the enzymes. The enzyme composition may be a dry powder or granulate, a non-dusting granulate, a liquid, a stabilized liquid, or a stabilized protected enzyme. Liquid enzyme preparations may, for instance, be stabilized by adding stabilizers such as a sugar, a sugar alcohol or another polyol, and/or lactic acid or another organic acid according to established processes.</p><p id="p-0679" num="0670">In one embodiment, an effective amount of cellulolytic or hemicellulolytic enzyme composition to the cellulosic-containing material is about 0.5 to about 50 mg, e.g., about 0.5 to about 40 mg, about 0.5 to about 25 mg, about 0.75 to about 20 mg, about 0.75 to about 15 mg, about 0.5 to about 10 mg, or about 2.5 to about 10 mg per g of the cellulosic-containing material.</p><p id="p-0680" num="0671">In one embodiment, such a compound is added at a molar ratio of the compound to glucosyl units of cellulose of about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to about 10, e.g., about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to about 7.5, about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to about 5, about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to about 2.5, about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to about 1, about 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to about 1, about 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to about 10<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, about 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>to about 10<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, about 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 10<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, or about 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 10<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>.

A liquor for cellulolytic enhancement of an AA9 polypeptide (GH61 polypeptide) can be produced by treating a lignocellulose or hemicellulose material (or feedstock) by applying heat and/or pressure, optionally in the presence of a catalyst, e.g., acid, optionally in the presence of an organic solvent, and optionally in combination with physical disruption of the material, and then separating the solution from the residual solids. Such conditions determine the degree of cellulolytic enhancement obtainable through the combination of liquor and an AA9 polypeptide during hydrolysis of a cellulosic substrate by a cellulolytic enzyme preparation. The liquor can be separated from the treated material using a method standard in the art, such as filtration, sedimentation, or centrifugation.</p><p id="p-0682" num="0673">In one embodiment, an effective amount of the liquor to cellulose is about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to about 10 g per g of cellulose, e.g., about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to about 7.5 g, about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to about 5 g, about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to about 2.5 g, about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to about 1 g, about 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to about 1 g, about 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to about 10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>g, about 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>to about 10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>g, about 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>g, or about 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>g per g of cellulose.</p><p id="p-0683" num="0674">In the fermentation step, sugars, released from the cellulosic-containing material, e.g., as a result of the pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis steps, are fermented to ethanol, by a host cell or fermenting organism, such as yeast described herein. Hydrolysis (saccharification) and fermentation can be separate or simultaneous.</p><p id="p-0684" num="0675">Any suitable hydrolyzed cellulosic-containing material can be used in the fermentation step in practicing the processes described herein. Such feedstocks include, but are not limited to carbohydrates (e.g., lignocellulose, xylans, cellulose, starch, etc.). The material is generally selected based on economics, i.e., costs per equivalent sugar potential, and recalcitrance to enzymatic conversion.</p><p id="p-0685" num="0676">Production of ethanol by a host cell or fermenting organism using cellulosic-containing material results from the metabolism of sugars (monosaccharides). The sugar composition of the hydrolyzed cellulosic-containing material and the ability of the host cell or fermenting organism to utilize the different sugars has a direct impact in process yields. Prior to Applicant's disclosure herein, strains known in the art utilize glucose efficiently but do not (or very limitedly) metabolize pentoses like xylose, a monosaccharide commonly found in hydrolyzed material.</p><p id="p-0686" num="0677">Compositions of the fermentation media and fermentation conditions depend on the host cell or fermenting organism and can easily be determined by one skilled in the art. Typically, the fermentation takes place under conditions known to be suitable for generating the fermentation product. In some embodiments, the fermentation process is carried out under aerobic or microaerophilic (i.e., where the concentration of oxygen is less than that in air), or anaerobic conditions. In some embodiments, fermentation is conducted under anaerobic conditions (i.e., no detectable oxygen), or less than about 5, about 2.5, or about 1 mmol/L/h oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, the NADH produced in glycolysis cannot be oxidized by oxidative phosphorylation. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate or a derivative thereof may be utilized by the host cell as an electron and hydrogen acceptor in order to generate NAD+.</p><p id="p-0687" num="0678">The fermentation process is typically run at a temperature that is optimal for the recombinant fungal cell. For example, in some embodiments, the fermentation process is performed at a temperature in the range of from about 25&#xb0; C. to about 42&#xb0; C. Typically the process is carried out a temperature that is less than about 38&#xb0; C., less than about 35&#xb0; C., less than about 33&#xb0; C., or less than about 38&#xb0; C., but at least about 20&#xb0; C., 22&#xb0; C., or 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0688" num="0679">A fermentation stimulator can be used in a process described herein to further improve the fermentation, and in particular, the performance of the host cell or fermenting organism, such as, rate enhancement and product yield (e.g., ethanol yield). A &#x201c;fermentation stimulator&#x201d; refers to stimulators for growth of the host cells and fermenting organisms, in particular, yeast. Preferred fermentation stimulators for growth include vitamins and minerals. Examples of vitamins include multivitamins, biotin, pantothenate, nicotinic acid, meso-inositol, thiamine, pyridoxine, para-aminobenzoic acid, folic acid, riboflavin, and Vitamins A, B, C, D, and E.

An inoculum of yeast was added to Growth Profiler plates containing 250 uL of medium (YNB with 0.5% arabinose or 0.5% xylose). Plates are secured in the Growth Profiler and grown at 250 RPM, 30&#xb0; C. for 120 hours. Time intervals between each photo was 10 minutes. Growth evaluation was quenched by adding and mixing 50 uL of 8% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

These components were transformed into the into <i>S. cerevisiae </i>strain S859-C01 following a yeast electroporation protocol. Transformants were selected on YPD+cloNAT to select for transformants that contain the Mad7 plasmid pMIBa771. Transformants were picked using a Q-pix Colony Picking System (Molecular Devices) to inoculate one well of 96-well plate containing YPD+cloNAT media. The plates were grown for 2 days then glycerol was added to 20% final concentration and the plates were stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until needed. Integration of specific phospholipase construct was verified by PCR with locus specific primers and subsequent sequencing.

Industrially obtained liquefied corn mash, where liquefaction was carried out using the Fortiva product from Novozymes, was supplemented with 24 ppm Lactrol and 283 ppm of urea. This mash was supplemented with both L-arabinose and D-xylose (solid) to a target concentration of 10 g/kg mash for each sugar. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) was performed via mini-scale fermentations. Approximately 5 g of C5 supplemented corn mash was added to 15 mL conical tubes. Each tube was dosed with 5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/g of mash with one of the yeast strains shown in Table 12 followed by the addition of 0.36 AGU/g of dry solids of an exogenous glucoamylase enzyme product (Innova Achieve F). Six replicate tube fermentations were conducted for each yeast strain. Glucoamylase and yeast dosages were administered based on the exact weight of corn slurry in each vial. Tubes were incubated at 32&#xb0; C. and mixed two to three times per day via brief vortex. After 70 hours fermentation time, tubes were centrifuged @3500 rpm for 5 min.
