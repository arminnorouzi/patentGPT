A person skilled in the pertinent art will recognize that other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the pertinent art that the present disclosure can also be employed in a variety of other applications.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is noted that references in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an example embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments,&#x201d; etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it would be within the knowledge of a person skilled in the pertinent art to affect such feature, structure or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context. For example, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; as used herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures or characteristics in a plural sense. Similarly, terms, such as &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the,&#x201d; again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context. In addition, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;nominal/nominally&#x201d; refers to a desired, or target, value of a characteristic or parameter for a component or a process operation, set during the design phase of a product or a process, together with a range of values above and/or below the desired value. The range of values can be due to slight variations in manufacturing processes or tolerances. As used herein, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; indicates the value of a given quantity that can vary based on a particular technology node associated with the subject semiconductor device. Based on the particular technology node, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; can indicate a value of a given quantity that varies within, for example, 10-30% of the value (e.g., &#xb1;10%, &#xb1;20%, or &#xb1;30% of the value).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, a staircase structure refers to a set of surfaces that include at least two horizontal surfaces (e.g., along x-y plane) and at least two (e.g., first and second) vertical surfaces (e.g., along z-axis) such that each horizontal surface is adjoined to a first vertical surface that extends upward from a first edge of the horizontal surface, and is adjoined to a second vertical surface that extends downward from a second edge of the horizontal surface. A &#x201c;step&#x201d; or &#x201c;staircase&#x201d; refers to a vertical shift in the height of a set of adjoined surfaces. In the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;staircase&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;step&#x201d; refer to one level of a staircase structure and are used interchangeably. In the present disclosure, a horizontal direction can refer to a direction (e.g., the x-axis or the y-axis) parallel with the top surface of the substrate (e.g., the substrate that provides the fabrication platform for the formation of structures over it), and a vertical direction can refer to a direction (e.g., the z-axis) perpendicular to the top surface of the structure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">NAND flash memory devices, widely used in various electronic products, are non-volatile, light-weighted, of low power consumption and good performance. Currently, planar NAND flash memory devices have reached their storage limit. To further increase the storage capacity and reduce the storage cost per bit, 3D NAND memory devices have been proposed. An existing 3D NAND memory device often includes a plurality of memory blocks. Adjacent memory blocks are often separated by a gate line slit (GLS), in which an array common source (ACS) is formed. To further control the memory cells in memory blocks, DSG cut structures, such as top-select-gate (TSG) cut structures, are formed in a memory block. TSG cut structures can be formed in both the core region and the staircase region of a 3D NAND memory device. Conductor layers, e.g., gate electrodes, divided by the TSG cut structures, can be selected so that various operations can be performed on the desired portion (e.g., memory cells) of the 3D NAND memory device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As the demand for higher memory capacity continues, 3D NAND memory devices with multi-deck structures have been proposed. Compared to existing 3D NAND memory devices, 3D NAND memory devices with multi-deck structures often have more levels (or conductor/dielectric layer pairs or stairs) along the vertical direction. Due to an increased number of levels, the existing methods to form TSG cut structures in the staircase region become challenging. For example, in the existing fabrication process to form a 3D NAND memory device with a dual-deck structure, stairs in the lower deck and upper deck are formed separately, before the formation of the channel structures. The TSG cut structures of the multi-deck structure are formed after the stairs of the upper deck are formed. The formation of the TSG cut structures often includes patterning the stairs and the core region and depositing a dielectric material. As the number of levels increases in a multi-deck structure, stairs of the entire multi-deck structure are formed after the channel structures are partially/fully formed. The TSG cut structures are formed before the formation of the stairs, e.g., by patterning the core region and the staircase region and transferring the pattern onto the stairs. This can cause undesired dielectric material that forms the TSG cut structures, e.g., silicon oxide, to remain on the surfaces of the stairs. The dielectric remains can affect the electrical contact between conductor layers and contacts that land on the conductor layers, impairing the performance of the 3D NAND memory devices.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present disclosure provides 3D memory devices (e.g., 3D NAND memory devices) having a multi-deck structure with TSG cut structures and methods for forming the 3D memory devices. The 3D memory device includes a stack structure having at least two decks stacking along a vertical direction (e.g., the z-axis) on a substrate. In the staircase region of the 3D memory device, stairs extend along a lateral direction (e.g., the x-axis). A TSG cut structure extends in the stairs, along the lateral direction and the vertical direction, dividing the stairs into a pair of portions. A plurality of support structures (e.g., support pillars or dummy channel structures) align with the TSG cut structure along the lateral direction and overlap with the TSG cut structure along the lateral plane (e.g., extend through or in the TSG cut structure). The support structure can include a dielectric material, such as silicon oxide, and can extend from the top surfaces of the stairs to the bottom of the staircase region (e.g., to be in contact with the substrate). The TSG cut structure includes the same dielectric material as the support structures and has a thickness/depth of at least four conductor/dielectric pairs along the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The lengths/depths of the support structures can be equal to or greater than the depth of the TSG cut structure. In some embodiments, the bottom surface of the TSG cut structure reaches or nominally reaches the bottom of the staircase region (or the top surface of the substrate). That is, the depth of the TSG cut structure can be equal to or nominally equal to the distance between the top surfaces of the stairs, in which the TSC cut structure is located, and the bottom of the staircase structure (or the top surface of the substrate). The lateral dimensions of a support structure can be greater than those of a conventional support structure. In some embodiments, along a second lateral direction (e.g., the y-axis) perpendicular to the lateral direction, the dimension of the support structure is greater than that of the TSG cut structure. In some embodiments, the support structure has an oval shape, of which the dimension along the lateral direction is greater than that of the second lateral direction.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present disclosure provides various methods to reduce or eliminate undesirable dielectric residues on the stairs in a 3D memory device, improving the electrical contact between conductor layers and the contacts. In the present disclosure, to accommodate more levels in the stack structure, the order to form the staircase region, the TSG cut structures in the core region and the staircase region, the support structures, and the channel structures can vary. The TSG cut structure and the support structures in the staircase region can be formed by the same operation or different operations. TSG cut structures in the staircase region and in the core region can be formed by the same operation or different operations. In some embodiments, the TSG cut structure and channel structures in the core region are formed before the formation of the TSG cut structure and support structures in the staircase region. For example, the portion of the stack structure in the staircase region can be patterned, e.g., using a single photomask and the same etching process, to form the openings of the TSG cut structure and the support structures in the staircase region. The openings to form the TSG cut structure and support structures in the staircase region can also be formed by separate operations. In some embodiments, openings to form the TSG cut structures in the staircase region and the core region can be formed by the same patterning operation after the stairs are formed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For ease of illustration, TSG cut structures are described, as an example, to explain the formation of DSG cut structures that can be at any suitable positions in a 3D memory device. Usually, a TSG cut structure is formed in the top portions of the core region and the staircase region. However, in various embodiments/applications, the position of a TSG cut structure can be changed as a result of the fabrication process. For example, the TSG cut structure can be, e.g., at the top, middle, or bottom, in a 3D memory device, depending on the fabrication process. In a 3D memory device formed by hybrid bonding, a TSG cut structure in the upper portion of one wafer can be flipped over and positioned at the bottom/middle portion of the bonded structure. That is, although the structure and formation of a TSG cut structure is described herein, the final position of the TSG cut structure in the 3D memory device should not be limited by the embodiments. Thus, the term &#x201c;DSG cut structure&#x201d; in the present disclosure is employed to represent a cut structure that is formed by the disclosed method and can be located at any suitable position in a 3D memory device. The DSG cut structure can be a TSG cut structure in a 3D memory device, or be another cut structure located in the middle or bottom of another 3D memory device. Meanwhile, the description of the embodiments in the present disclosure emphasizes the structures and methods to form the staircase region and core region of a 3D memory device. Structures and methods to form other portions of the 3D memory device, e.g., a transitional region between the staircase region and the core region, may be given little or minimal description.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> illustrate an exemplary 3D memory device <b>100</b> having a dual-deck structure, according to some embodiments. 3D memory device <b>100</b> may include a staircase region (&#x201c;SS REGION&#x201d;) and a core region (&#x201c;CORE REGION&#x201d;), and, optionally, a transitional region (&#x201c;TRANSITIONAL REGION&#x201d;) in between. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> each illustrate a cross-sectional view of 3D memory device <b>100</b> along the A-A&#x2032; direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> (e.g., along the x-z plane). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate possible different structures of 3D memory device <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrates a top view of 3D memory device <b>100</b> along the x-y plane.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>C</figref>, 3D memory device <b>100</b> may include a substrate <b>102</b> and a stack structure <b>104</b> over substrate <b>102</b>.
