Bolts/nuts, brackets and/or welding are the preferred means of coupling pipes and other structures together, but other equally acceptable and adequate means are known and could be employed as would be understood in the art. For the avoidance of doubt, the right and left sides of the door frame are preferably identically constructed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As should now also be understood, various modifications and reinforcements can be made to the invention without departing from the scope thereof. For example, members <b>30</b> are preferably steel or PVC although the use of other materials are within the scope of the invention. The spaced apart pockets <b>25</b> are preferably welded as would be understood in the art, and are preferably at 19&#x2033; high intervals on the door itself. In this way, the pocket height is preferably established to minimize the fabric sag of the door <b>20</b> as it is pulled up between one pocket and another. In addition, the pockets <b>25</b> provide for the elongated door members <b>30</b> to slide in from one end to another, acting as a rigid member to help with guiding the door vertically. Preferably, the elongated door members <b>30</b> can freely slide in the pockets <b>25</b> and fasteners or other locking means are not needed to maintain the members <b>30</b> within the pockets <b>25</b> by virtue of the unique implementation of couplers <b>35</b>, <b>40</b> at the ends thereof. That is, positioned at each of the respective ends of the elongated door members <b>30</b> are the aforementioned couplers <b>35</b>, <b>40</b>, which are preferably plastic caps with loops/rings on the ends as shown in the figures, where the loops/rings act as a guide to the door opening frame. The loops/rings on the couplers <b>35</b>, <b>40</b> may be rigid, or the loop/ring can be designed to rotate, allowing for easier functioning of the door. It should be understood that the terms &#x201c;loop&#x201d; and &#x201c;ring&#x201d; are meant to mean the same thing in this disclosure and can be used interchangeably herein without imparting any difference in structure or function therebetween.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The door lifting means preferably comprises one or more pulleys and/or one or more ropes on each side of the door <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, with the ends of the rope(s) terminating for example in or at the pocket <b>25</b>D and/or to and/or around the member <b>30</b> within the pocket <b>25</b>D closest to the ground. However, these door lifting means are only by example and not limitation, as other structures, alone or in combination, can be used, such as string, cord, and/or a chain (linked or otherwise) made of metal, plastic or the like. And, while pulleys are preferred, other additional or substitute components may be used, such as by example and not limitation, loops, rings and/or other eyelet structures.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Preferably, the rope, string or other lifting means <b>60</b> is arranged to go through each pocket <b>25</b> through a hole behind the respective member <b>30</b> within the pocket <b>25</b>, although it is also contemplated that the lifting means <b>60</b> could go through each respective member <b>30</b>. Preferably, the lifting means <b>60</b> go through the pulleys <b>55</b> at the top of the door assembly <b>10</b>, then through a grommet (not shown) for guiding the rope, cord, string, chain or the like to the outside when the pulleys are on the inside of the shelter of course understanding that a reverse configuration and/or modifications thereto are within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Preferably, there are two sections of rope, string or the like as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> wherein a first section of rope is indicated by reference <b>60</b>A, a second section of rope is indicated at section <b>60</b>B and the two sections of rope are joined, e.g. by a knot, tie and/or otherwise to a third section of rope <b>60</b>C so that pulling on section <b>60</b>C lifts both sides of the door <b>20</b> simultaneously and at the same rate. In this way, the lifting means <b>60</b> (e.g. rope or otherwise) can be pulled and/or released by a person as discussed above. In this way, the means for pulling (e.g. the rope, string, chain, cord or the like) the door upwardly (i.e. away from the ground on which the shelter is positioned) provides an opening into the shelter and for lowering the door for enclosing the shelter.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">To be sure however, the positioning of the pulleys, grommets and/or rope (or other means as disclosed herein) can be provided such that the lifting/lowering of the door is designed to be effectuated from inside the shelter <b>100</b>, as this is simply a design choice as to where to position such components. To secure the door when down, zippers (not shown) may be provided on each side of the door, but other options, such as Velcro, snaps, buttons or the like are also contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As would be known in the art and to the extent not dictated by function but rather by design constraints, combinations of metal, steel and/or plastic pieces may be used for the components disclosed herein.
