The display element, the display device, the display panel, the light-emitting element, or the light-emitting device includes at least one of an electroluminescence (EL) element (e.g., an EL element including organic and inorganic materials, an organic EL element, or an inorganic EL element), an LED (e.g., a white LED, a red LED, a green LED, or a blue LED), a transistor (a transistor that emits light depending on current), an electron emitter, a liquid crystal element, electronic ink, an electrophoretic element, a grating light valve (GLV), a plasma display panel (PDP), a display element using micro electro mechanical system (MEMS), a digital micromirror device (DMD), a digital micro shutter (DMS), MIRASOL (registered trademark), an interferometric modulator display (IMOD) element, a MEMS shutter display element, an optical-interference-type MEMS display element, an electrowetting element, a piezoelectric ceramic display, a display element including a carbon nanotube, and the like.

Providing such organic resin layer outside the glass layer, occurrence of a crack or a break in the glass layer can be suppressed and mechanical strength can be improved.

When the temperature of the heat treatment performed later is high, a substrate having a strain point of 730&#xb0; C. or higher is preferably used as the glass substrate. Note that by containing a large amount of barium oxide (BaO), a glass substrate which is heat-resistant and more practical can be obtained. Alternatively, crystallized glass or the like may be used.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">In the case where a glass substrate is used as the formation substrate, an insulating film such as a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, a silicon nitride film, or a silicon nitride oxide film is preferably formed between the formation substrate and the separation layer, in which case contamination from the glass substrate can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">The separation layer <b>203</b> and the separation layer <b>207</b> each have a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure containing an element selected from tungsten, molybdenum, titanium, tantalum, niobium, nickel, cobalt, zirconium, zinc, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and silicon; an alloy material containing any of the elements; or a compound material containing any of the elements. A crystal structure of a layer containing silicon may be amorphous, microcrystal, or polycrystal.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">The separation layer can be formed by a sputtering method, a plasma CVD method, a coating method, a printing method, or the like. Note that a coating method includes a spin coating method, a droplet discharging method, and a dispensing method.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">In the case where the separation layer has a single-layer structure, a tungsten layer, a molybdenum layer, or a layer containing a mixture of tungsten and molybdenum is preferably formed. Alternatively, a layer containing an oxide or an oxynitride of tungsten, a layer containing an oxide or an oxynitride of molybdenum, or a layer containing an oxide or an oxynitride of a mixture of tungsten and molybdenum may be formed. Note that a mixture of tungsten and molybdenum is an alloy of tungsten and molybdenum, for example.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">In the case where the separation layer is formed to have a stacked-layer structure including a layer containing tungsten and a layer containing an oxide of tungsten, the layer containing an oxide of tungsten may be formed as follows: the layer containing tungsten is formed first and an insulating film formed of an oxide is formed thereover, so that the layer containing an oxide of tungsten is formed at the interface between the tungsten layer and the insulating film. Alternatively, the layer containing an oxide of tungsten may be formed by performing thermal oxidation treatment, oxygen plasma treatment, nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) plasma treatment, treatment with a highly oxidizing solution such as ozone water, or the like on the surface of the layer containing tungsten. Plasma treatment or heat treatment may be performed in an atmosphere of oxygen, nitrogen, or nitrous oxide alone, or a mixed gas of any of these gasses and another gas. Surface condition of the separation layer is changed by the plasma treatment or heat treatment, whereby adhesion between the separation layer and the insulating film formed later can be controlled.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Each of the insulating layers can be formed by a sputtering method, a plasma CVD method, a coating method, a printing method, or the like. For example, the insulating layer is formed at a temperature higher than or equal to 250&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 400&#xb0; C. by a plasma CVD method, whereby the insulating layer can be a dense film with very low water permeability.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">Then, a material for the sealing layer <b>823</b> is applied to a surface of the formation substrate <b>205</b> over which the coloring layer <b>845</b> and the like are formed or a surface of the formation substrate <b>201</b> over which the light-emitting element <b>830</b> and the like are formed, and the formation substrate <b>201</b> and the formation substrate <b>205</b> are attached so that these two surfaces face each other with the sealing layer <b>823</b> provided therebetween (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">Next, the formation substrate <b>201</b> is separated, and the exposed insulating layer <b>813</b> and the substrate <b>801</b> are attached to each other with the adhesive layer <b>811</b>. Furthermore, the formation substrate <b>205</b> is separated, and the exposed insulating layer <b>843</b> and the substrate <b>803</b> are attached to each other with the adhesive layer <b>841</b>. Although the substrate <b>803</b> does not overlap with the conductive layer <b>857</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, the substrate <b>803</b> may overlap with the conductive layer <b>857</b>.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">Any of a variety of methods can be used as appropriate for the separation process. For example, when a layer including a metal oxide film is formed as the separation layer on the side in contact with the layer to be separated, the metal oxide film is embrittled by crystallization, whereby the layer to be separated can be separated from the formation substrate. Alternatively, when an amorphous silicon film containing hydrogen is formed as the separation layer between a formation substrate having high heat resistance and a layer to be separated, the amorphous silicon film is removed by laser irradiation or etching, whereby the layer to be separated can be separated from the formation substrate. Alternatively, after a layer including a metal oxide film is formed as the separation layer on the side in contact with the layer to be separated, the metal oxide film is embrittled by crystallization, and part of the separation layer is removed by etching using a solution or a fluoride gas such as NF<sub>3</sub>, BrF<sub>3</sub>, or ClF<sub>3</sub>, whereby the separation can be performed at the embrittled metal oxide film. Further alternatively, a method carried out as follows may be employed: a film containing nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, or the like (e.g., an amorphous silicon film containing hydrogen, an alloy film containing hydrogen, or an alloy film containing oxygen) is used as the separation layer, and the separation layer is irradiated with laser to release the nitrogen, oxygen, or hydrogen contained in the separation layer as gas, thereby promoting separation between the layer to be separated and the formation substrate. Still further alternatively, it is possible to use a method in which the formation substrate provided with the layer to be separated is removed mechanically or by etching using a solution or a fluoride gas such as NF<sub>3</sub>, BrF<sub>3</sub>, or ClF<sub>3</sub>, or the like. In this case, the separation layer is not necessarily provided.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">When a plurality of the above-described separation methods are combined, the separation process can be performed easily. In other words, separation can be performed with physical force (by a machine or the like) after performing laser irradiation, etching on the separation layer with a gas, a solution, or the like, or mechanical removal with a sharp knife, scalpel or the like so that the separation layer and the layer to be separated can be easily separated from each other.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">Separation of the layer to be separated from the formation substrate may be performed by soaking the interface between the separation layer and the layer to be separated in a liquid. Furthermore, the separation may be performed while a liquid such as water is being poured.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">As another separation method, in the case where the separation layer is formed using tungsten, it is preferable that the separation be performed while etching the separation layer using a mixed solution of ammonium water and a hydrogen peroxide solution.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">Note that the separation layer is not necessarily provided in the case where separation at an interface between the formation substrate and the layer to be separated is possible. For example, glass is used as the formation substrate, an organic resin such as polyimide, polyester, polyolefin, polyamide, polycarbonate, or acrylic is formed in contact with the glass, and an insulating film, a transistor, and the like are formed over the organic resin. In this case, heating the organic resin enables the separation at the interface between the formation substrate and the organic resin. Alternatively, separation at the interface between a metal layer and the organic resin may be performed in the following manner: the metal layer is provided between the formation substrate and the organic resin and current is made to flow in the metal layer so that the metal layer is heated.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">Lastly, an opening is formed in the insulating layer <b>843</b> and the sealing layer <b>823</b> to expose the conductive layer <b>857</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). In the case where the substrate <b>803</b> overlaps with the conductive layer <b>857</b>, an opening is formed also in the substrate <b>803</b> and the adhesive layer <b>841</b> so that the conductive layer <b>857</b> is exposed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>). There is no particular limitation on the method for forming the opening. For example, a laser ablation method, an etching method, an ion beam sputtering method, or the like may be used. As another method, a cut may be made in a film over the conductive layer <b>857</b> with a sharp knife or the like and part of the film may be separated by physical force.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In the above-described manner, the light-emitting panel can be manufactured.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">At least part of this embodiment can be implemented as appropriate in combination with any of the other embodiments described in this specification.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading><p id="p-0210" num="0209">In this embodiment, structure examples of a foldable touch panel that is applicable to a display portion included in the electronic device of one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A to <b>12</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A to <b>14</b>C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A to <b>15</b>C</figref>.
