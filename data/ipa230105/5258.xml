A few examples of such factors are weather conditions, soil characteristics, region, water availability and so on. Some crops grow in hot weather conditions, some grow in cold weather conditions, some in monsoon, and so on. Even though crops are planted taking such characteristics and requirements into consideration, sudden change in climatic conditions, occurrence of any localized calamity/natural event or any such factors can still adversely affect health of the crops.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many crop loss assessment/health monitoring systems exist in the market, and they use different approaches to monitor the crop loss/health. Image processing based crop loss estimation is an example, in which image of the crops, taken at two different time instances are compared using appropriate image processing mechanisms, to understand changes happened over a period of time. One disadvantage of the state of the art systems is that they do not convey to the users extent of damage. In addition to this, existing methods do not take into account the recovery factor of the crops due to multiple factors and end up in overestimating the loss. Also, even if there is a chance that the users can actually save the crop from complete damage, the user wouldn't know, which in turn affects the yield/results.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present disclosure present technological improvements as solutions to one or more of the above-mentioned technical problems recognized by the inventors in conventional systems. For example, in one embodiment, a processor implemented method for crop loss estimation is provided. The crop loss estimation is performed for each Region on Interest (ROI), which is a specific geographical area being considered. Initially, real-time information on one or more weather parameters, and one or more remote sensing indicators are collected via one or more hardware processors. Further, by processing the real-time information on the one or more weather parameters and the one or more remote sensing indicators, one or more critical time windows in at least one later time instance is determined wherein in each of the one or more critical time windows one or more crops in the ROI suffers a crop loss. Further, the crop loss in each of the one or more critical time windows is classified as one of a repairable damage and a permanent damage, via the one or more hardware processors. Further, the crop loss in each of the time windows is quantified. To quantify the crop loss, initially remote sensing time series data of at least one image of at least one hotspot in the time window for which crop loss is to be quantified is collected. Further, a time series estimator for each pixel in the at least one image is estimated, wherein the time-series estimator for a pixel is estimated using comparison of a pre-defined time-series of the pixel with a current time series of the pixel. Further, a temporal estimator for each pixel in the at least one image is estimated, wherein the temporal estimator for a pixel is estimated based on a long-term temporal average of a crop at a target pixel with a temporal data of the crop at the current pixel. Further, a spatial estimator for each pixel in the at least one image is estimated, wherein the spatial estimator for a pixel is estimated based on condition of the pixel in comparison with one or more other pixels in the image of the hotspot.
