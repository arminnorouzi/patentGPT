standardized as 3D audio for fixed viewpoint is based on an idea that an audio object moves in a space around the position of a listener as an origin (see Non-Patent Document 1, for example).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For this reason, with the fixed viewpoint, the position information of each audio object viewed from the listener at the origin is described by polar coordinates using the angle in the horizontal direction, the angle in the height direction, and the distance from the listener to the audio object.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">By using such an MPEG-H coding standard, in a fixed viewpoint content, a sound image of each audio object can be localized in the position of each audio object in the space, and audio reproduction with a high realistic feeling can be achieved.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li

other hand, a free viewpoint content in which an arbitrary position in the space can be set as the position of the listener is also known. With the free viewpoint, not only does the audio object move, but also the listener is movable in the space. That is, the free viewpoint is different from the fixed viewpoint in that the listener is movable.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such a free viewpoint audio, both the audio object and the listener move.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, in a case where the position information of each audio object in the space is coded, if the position of the audio object is expressed by polar coordinates around the listener used for coding in the fixed viewpoint, there may be a case where the position information is not transmitted efficiently.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, with the fixed viewpoint, if the audio object is stationary, the relative positional relationship between the listener and the audio object does not change. Hence, it is only necessary to code and transmit the position information when the audio object moves.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, with the free viewpoint, even if the audio object is stationary, if the listener moves, it is necessary to code and transmit the position information for all the audio objects. Hence, transmission efficiency is reduced.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Hence, from the viewpoint of transmission efficiency of position information, it is considered advantageous to express the position of each audio object by absolute coordinates in the free viewpoint.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in some cases, it may be desirable to reproduce sounds such as ground noise and reverberant sound around the listener, ground noise and reverberant sound having low dependence on the absolute position in the space and surrounding the listener.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additionally, other than ground noise and reverberant sound, it is also conceivable to use an audio object such as a sound effect intended for the listener.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The

id="p-0045" num="0044">At this time, the server may generate the absolute coordinate position information indicating the position of the object with accuracy corresponding to the positional relationship between the listener and the object, such as the distance from the listener to the object.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Specifically, for example, as the distance from the listener to the object decreases, absolute coordinate position information with higher accuracy, that is, absolute coordinate position information indicating a more accurate position is generated.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">This is because, while the position of the object is shifted depending on the quantization accuracy (quantization step size) at the time of coding, as the distance from the listener to the

num="0047">Accordingly, by generating and transmitting the absolute coordinate position information with appropriate accuracy according to the positional relationship between the listener and the object, the amount of information (bit depth) of the absolute coordinate position information can be reduced without causing the user to feel the shift of the sound image position.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Note that while absolute coordinate position information with necessary accuracy may be generated every time absolute coordinate position information is transmitted, it is also possible to prepare coded absolute coordinate position information with the highest accuracy in advance, and use the coded absolute coordinate position information to generate absolute coordinate position information with necessary accuracy.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Specifically, for example, assume that highest-accuracy absolute coordinate position information obtained by quantizing absolute

The highest-accuracy absolute coordinate position information is coded absolute coordinate position information.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The server obtains absolute coordinate position information obtained by quantizing absolute coordinates of an object with arbitrary quantization accuracy by extracting a part of the highest-accuracy absolute coordinate position information according to a condition on the listener side designated by the client, such as listener position information. That is, coded absolute coordinate position information indicating the position of the object can be obtained with arbitrary accuracy.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">On the other hand, in a case where polar coordinate position information in which the position of an object in the space is expressed in polar coordinates is coded and transmitted to the client, the server generates polar coordinate position information on the basis of position information such as absolute coordinates indicating the position of the object in the space prepared in advance and listener position information.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there are mainly two types of objects in three-dimensional space.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">That is, for example, in the example indicated by an arrow Q<b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an object OB<b>11</b> and an object OB<b>12</b> exist around a listener U<b>11</b> in three-dimensional space.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Here, the object OB<b>11</b> is, for example, an audio object having high dependence on the arrangement position in the space such as a musical instrument. In other words, the object OB<b>11</b> is an object that should be localized at an absolute position in the space at the time of audio reproduction. An object of a direct sound of a musical instrument or the like is also referred to as a dry object.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Hereinafter, an object having high dependence on the arrangement position in the space, such as the object OB<b>11</b>, is also referred to as an absolute coordinate object.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">On the other hand, the object OB<b>12</b> is an audio object having low positional dependence, that is, low dependence on the arrangement position in the space, such as a huge object in the background, a fixed object corresponding to ground noise or a reverberation component, for example.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In other words, for example, the object OB<b>12</b> is an object in which sound always reaches the listener U<b>11</b> from a relatively constant direction regardless of the position and movement of the listener U<b>11</b> in the space during audio reproduction.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Hereinafter, an object having a low dependence on the arrangement position in the space, such as the object OB<b>12</b>, is also referred to as a polar coordinate object.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the free viewpoint, for example, as indicated by an arrow Q<b>12</b>, since an object such as the object OB<b>11</b> has high dependence on the arrangement position in the space, it is considered advantageous to transmit absolute coordinate position information from the viewpoint of transmission efficiency.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">This is because, for example, in the case of transmitting absolute coordinate position information of the object OB<b>11</b>, once the absolute coordinate position information is transmitted, if the object OB<b>11</b> remains stationary even if the position of the listener U<b>11</b> changes, it is not necessary to transmit absolute coordinate position information.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">On the other hand, an object of background sound surrounding the listener U<b>11</b>, such as the object OB<b>12</b>, has low dependence on the position in the space, and is preferably regarded as an object arranged around the listener U<b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As described above, in a case where absolute coordinate position information of an object is transmitted with accuracy corresponding to the distance from the listener, mapping to the absolute coordinate position corresponding to an arbitrary position of the listener for maintaining the positional relationship with the listener as the center needs to be performed in real time, which causes inconvenience in terms of control and arithmetic processing. That is, it is necessary to perform control such as determining the quantization accuracy on the basis of the distance from the listener and arithmetic processing.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Additionally, in a case where the size of the space is large, it is necessary to arrange more objects having low position dependence such as ground noise to cover the area, for example. As a result, the increase in the number of objects to be transmitted may increase information to be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Hence, in the present technology, for an object such as the object OB<b>12</b> having a low dependence on the arrangement position, the position is not expressed by absolute coordinates, but polar coordinate position information expressing a position in a polar coordinate system centered on the listener U<b>11</b> is transmitted as indicated by an arrow Q<b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this case, polar coordinate position information including an azimuth angle and an elevation angle indicating positions in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction of the object OB<b>12</b> viewed from the listener U<b>11</b> and a radius indicating a distance from the listener U<b>11</b> to the object OB<b>12</b> is generated.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">If the polar coordinate position information is transmitted as the position information of the object having a low dependence on the arrangement position, it is not necessary to perform mapping to the absolute coordinate position, and the processing amount of data processing (arithmetic processing) can be reduced (processing efficiency can be improved). Moreover, for some objects, polar coordinate position information does not change even when the position of the listener U<b>11</b> changes. Hence, the number of times of transmission of the polar coordinate position information can be reduced and the transmission efficiency can be improved.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, by combining absolute coordinate position information and polar coordinate position information according to the nature (role) of the object, position information can be transmitted efficiently.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Note that as the application of the polar coordinate object, a sound effect centered on the listener and the like are also conceivable, similarly to the above-described ground noise and reverberant sound. In such a case, too, it is possible to achieve efficient transmission of position information by expressing the position of the object by polar coordinates.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Additionally, for a polar coordinate object, gain information may be coded and transmitted to the client together with the polar coordinate position information.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In such a case, polar coordinate objects can be classified into the following categories C<b>1</b> to C<b>3</b>, and the amount of information can be efficiently controlled by performing such category classification. Here, the angle indicating the position is an azimuth angle and an elevation angle.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Category C<b>1</b>: Both the angle indicating the position and the gain information are fixed</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Category C<b>2</b>: The angle indicating the position is fixed, but the gain information is variable</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Category C<b>3</b>: Both the angle indicating the position and the gain information are variable</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, a polar coordinate object such as ground noise is in Category C<b>1</b>, a polar coordinate object such as reverberant sound whose gain changes in conjunction with the position of the listener is in Category C<b>2</b>, and a polar coordinate object such as a sound effect is in Category C<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, a predetermined fixed coordinate value (fixed value) is used as the polar coordinate position information for a polar coordinate object of Category C<b>1</b> or Category C<b>2</b>. Hence, once the polar coordinate position information is transmitted to the client, the polar coordinate position information does not need to be transmitted thereafter.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Accordingly, not only the number of times of transmission of the polar coordinate position information can be reduced and transmission efficiency can be improved, but also the bit stream code amount can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In particular, for a polar coordinate object of Category C<b>1</b>, not only the polar coordinate position information but also the gain information has a fixed value. Hence, transmission efficiency can be improved and the code amount can be reduced by the gain information as well.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Additionally, for example, for a polar coordinate object of Category C<b>2</b>, the server side may calculate the gain amount according to the listener position information acquired from the client, code the gain information indicating the gain amount, and transmit the gain information to the client.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a bit stream format for transmitting the position information of the object described above.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, &#x201c;NumOfObjects&#x201d; indicates the total number of absolute coordinate objects and polar coordinate objects, that is, the total number of objects.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Additionally, &#x201c;PosCodingMode [i]&#x201d; indicates a position coding mode of the i-th object, that is, the type of the object, and position information, gain information, and the like of the object are stored in the bit stream according to the value of the position coding mode.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Here, the value &#x201c;0&#x201d; of the position coding mode indicates an absolute coordinate object.
