Generally, the same reference numbers in the drawing(s) and this description refer to the same or like parts. Although the drawings show layers and regions with clean lines and boundaries, some or all of these lines and/or boundaries may be idealized. In reality, the boundaries and/or lines may be unobservable, blended and/or irregular.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">High-voltage and/or high-current applications may utilize power electronic devices capable of efficient and effective operation at various operating conditions. In some such applications, power circuitry may deliver power to a load using power devices, which may be implemented utilizing transistors. Some such transistors (such as power transistors) may include field-effect transistors (FETs), metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), etc. A driver may be used to control a power device (such as a transistor) to achieve power delivery to a load.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some power circuitry may include a capacitively powered and isolated driver, a transistor, and isolation capacitors. In some such power circuitry, self-induced common-mode transients may cause power interruptions of the capacitively powered and isolated driver. The power interruptions may cause improper control of the transistor. For example, when the transistor is turned off, a transmit ground and a receive ground of the power circuitry may be approximately equipotential. In some such examples, when the transistor is turned on, the receive ground may rise relative to the transmit ground. The isolation capacitors may charge with common-mode current to support the ground difference. If the common-mode current is greater than the differential-mode current, then a current drought may occur. The current drought may cause an inadequate quantity of current to be provided to the driver when the transistor is to be turned on. The driver may not be enabled when needed if the quantity of current is inadequate and, if not enabled, the driver may not turn on the transistor at a time when the transistor is to be turned on. If the driver is not enabled when needed, then the driver may achieve improper control of the transistor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Examples described herein include example drain-derived supply circuitry as part of example isolation switch circuitry. The drain-derived supply circuitry may achieve drive control of a transistor (such as a driven transistor), which may be part of the isolation switch circuitry, during a self-induced common-mode transient. In some described examples, the drain-derived supply circuitry may cause charge (such as auxiliary charge) to be drawn from a drain of the driven transistor. The drawn charge may be provided to a power terminal of a driver, which may be part of the isolation switch circuitry. Advantageously, the drain-derived supply circuitry described herein may provide the charge to the driver to ensure that the driver has sufficient voltage to turn on (or off) the driven transistor. Advantageously, in response to the provided charge, the driver may achieve proper drive control of the driven transistor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of example isolated switch circuitry <b>100</b>A-<b>100</b>F that are part of an example battery electric vehicle system <b>102</b>.

In this example, the battery electric vehicle system <b>102</b> is battery charging circuitry part of a vehicle (such as an electric vehicle, a hybrid-electric vehicle, an aircraft, an unmanned aerial vehicle, etc.). Example power sources <b>104</b> part of the battery electric vehicle system <b>102</b> may provide power to a powertrain of the vehicle. In this example, the power sources <b>104</b> may be implemented by batteries (such as lithium-ion batteries). For example, the batteries may be adapted to output power to the vehicle.

For example, the relay circuitry <b>112</b> may implement an electromechanical switching device including a coil to be used to generate a magnetic force that mechanically operates an electric contact. The relay circuitry <b>112</b>, when enabled, achieves delivery of power from the charge ports <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> to the power sources <b>104</b>.

In some examples, the control unit <b>114</b> may determine isolation of the power sources <b>104</b> based on first measurements (ISOLATION CHECK) from first example sensors <b>116</b>A-<b>116</b>B.
