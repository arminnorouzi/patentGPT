In some embodiments, a method includes receiving an indication of a start of a session associated with a user and having an audio channel that is synchronized with a non-audio channel. Determinations are repeatedly made, after the receiving, as to whether a prompt on the non-audio channel has been received from the user.

Determinations are repeatedly made whether a prompt on the non-audio channel has been received from the user. An inaudible output is caused on the audio channel to the user in response to each determination that the prompt on the non-audio channel has not been received from the user.

Staff training and onboarding is often cost-intensive and unscalable. Known systems aim to solve these problems by using interactive voice response (IVR) technologies, which take callers through a series of steps involving entering numbers on a dial pad or speaking out information. Known IVR systems are often impractical, however, for tasks that involve user inputs of increased complexity (e.g., passwords, addresses, seat selections, etc.), which can be easily misunderstood by the known state-of-the-art IVR systems. Furthermore, known IVR systems often result in user frustration because of poor language understanding (e.g., producing the message &#x201c;Sorry, I didn't get that.&#x201d;) or system timeout issues (e.g., producing the message &#x201c;I did not get your input. Please try again&#x201d;). For use cases that are too complex, callers are generally transferred to a live agent (where it is not unusual to be stuck in a queue for a while), and are sometimes directed to a website or mobile app without further guidance (e.g., the call drops off or is terminated), which results in a negative user experience and wasted opportunities for automation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Known automated solutions also often fail to assist callers throughout the full path to resolution of a given task. Calls are either terminated or escalated to live agents, which leads to a significant cost and business impact. In many cases, callers either lack sufficient product education to self-service, or they expect a problem to be directly solved by the contact center agents.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">One or more embodiments of the present disclosure leverage digital assets (e.g., websites or apps to execute communication devices such as smartphones and computers) to guide callers towards resolution of their problems using an audio channel synchronized to one or more non-audio channels of digital assets. Contact center automation systems can be better automated to walk users through a given task/step by synchronizing audio channels to non-audio channels. For example, in the context of a phone call, a user (also referred to herein as a caller) receives a text message with a link that leads to a website or mobile application when the user selects that link. Once the link is selected and the related website/mobile application is accessed, the user will receive voice-/audio-based guidance on how to complete a specific task and will continue to follow the guidance, which changes based on the actions the user takes on the user interface (UI) of the respective digital asset. The phone call is active throughout the entire process on the digital asset until the task is resolved or the caller hangs up. As the user progresses through the steps at its own pace, the user gets voice audio feedback from the audio (phone) channel, which can be provided in one or more multiple voices (female or male) and/or one or more languages such as English or Spanish. Rather than terminating the call or escalating to an agent, the connection with the user is maintained while the user voice-guided all the way to task resolution.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, one or more embodiments can be implemented into any audio-capable device, including Smart Home devices such as Amazon Echo&#xae; or Google Home&#xae;. A user looking to reset their password could speak to their Smart Home device and request assistance. The Smart Home device artificial intelligence (AI) assistant, used in combination with one or more embodiments, would then send a message to the user's phone (SMS, push notification, email, etc.) with a link to a non-audio digital channel (e.g., a website or a mobile app running on the user's phone) where the user can change its password. Instead of terminating the Smart Home session upon responding to the user's request, the session is maintained by such embodiments and will remain active until the task is resolved through the multi-channel experience or upon an explicit termination request from the user (e.g., &#x201c;Alexa stop&#x201d;). Throughout the active Smart Home session, similar to interactions over a phone call, the Smart Home device will provide audio feedback whenever the user takes an action within the non-audio digital channel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, one or more embodiments can automate tasks for contact centers and training courses that currently require or involve human interaction, thus reducing costs and increasing operational efficiency.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">One or more embodiments leverage digital assets (e.g., smartphone) to guide users towards resolution of their problems using an audio channel synchronized to the respective digital asset (and to its non-audio channel(s)). The audio channel can be over the phone using a smart IVR, a smart home speaker (Amazon Echo&#xae;, Google Home&#xae;, etc.), smart headsets or earphones (Amazon Echo&#xae; Buds, Samsung Galaxy Buds&#xae;, etc.) or smart car integrated software (Apple CarPlay&#xae;, Amazon Echo Auto&#xae;, etc.). Digital assets can be websites accessed over smartphones, laptops or desktops, desktop applications (macOS&#xae;, Windows&#xae;, etc.), mobile applications over smartphones or tablets (iOS&#xae;, Android&#xae;) and IoT devices (smart fridges, smart vacuums, etc.).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">One or more embodiments includes the ability to synchronize (i.e., link) at least one audio channel with at least one non-audio channel to start/maintain a session. Synchronizing can refer to, for example, starting/maintaining a session where input/output of one channel is coordinated and/or sequenced based on the input/output of a different channel. A session can refer to a temporary and interactive information interchange between at least one audio channel and at least one non-audio channel. The session is established at a certain point in time, and ended at a later point in time. The session can include one or more messages sent in one direction and/or both directions. The session can be stateful and/or stateless. In some implementations, a session can refer to an event where at least one audio channel is synchronized with at least one non-audio channel, where the audio and non-audio channel(s) are associated with the same device, different devices, or a combination of both. When synchronized, prompts (i.e., actions) performed at the at least one non-audio channel can cause the at least one audio channel to output audio that can cause a user to perform one or more steps that help to accomplish a given task. A prompt can refer to any action performed at the at least one non-audio channel. Examples of prompts can include clicking/selecting an icon, typing text, scrolling, zooming in/out, etc.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">One or more embodiments includes the ability to synchronize an audio channel with one or more non-audio channels in the same session. In some implementations, an audio channel can output an audible output based on activities by a user on a single non-audio channel (e.g., smartphone). In some implementations, an audio channel can output an audible output based on activities by a user on a plurality of non-audio channels (e.g., smartphone and laptop).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">One or more embodiments includes the ability to operate over any device that has the capability of outputting audio based on signals received over a network (internet or local). For instance, a user may initially receive audible output from a first compute device capable of outputting audio (e.g., their smartphone). Thereafter, the user can receive audible output from a second compute device capable of outputting audio (e.g., their earphones) instead of (or in addition to) the first compute device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">One or more embodiments includes the ability to speak out audio in multiple languages, voices, and/or dialects. In some implementations, the language(s)/voice(s)/dialect(s) used to speak out audio can be selected by a user via a non-audio channel.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">One or more embodiments includes the ability to choose the voice before, after and/or during the synchronized multi-channel interaction. For example, audio can be output using a voice that is male, female, old, young, etc. during the synchronized multiple-channel interaction.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">One or more embodiments includes the ability to escalate to a different channel of communication such as live chat or a live agent. In some implementations, in response to the indication that that user would like to escalate to a different channel, a signal can be sent from a communication device associated with the user to connect with a communication device associated with a live agent or live chat. The indication can be, for example, selecting a button/typing text indicating that the user would like to escalate to a different channel, reaching a step in a task that requires a live agent or live chat, not receiving a prompt for a period time greater than a predetermined threshold, etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">One or more embodiments includes the ability to capture/log events at every step of the process (i.e., from initiating a session to ending the session). In some implementations, attributes related to interactions at the non-audio channel (e.g., how long it took a user to respond) can be used to provide insights for improving audio output by an associated audio channel (e.g., update how an audio output is phrased). In some implementations, a metric can be tracked associated with how often a session reached a predefined phase (e.g., completing a given task, changing to a different channel).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">One or more embodiments can perform a method that includes the three steps described below.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Step 1: A user can request assistance for a task using one of the following: (i) call a phone number via communication device (e.g., a smartphone) and engage with a smart IVR that identifies the task to be resolved, (ii) engage with a voice-powered automated assistant such as a digital voice-powered automated assistant (e.g., website, mobile app) or a physical voice-powered automated assistant (e.g., a smart speaker) that identifies the task to be resolved, or (iii) click a button or fill out online a form that schedules an outbound call to the user's mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Step 2: The user is presented with a method to start the audio synchronization: (i) a short message service (SMS) text is sent to the user's phone number, the SMS text containing a unique link that when selected causes the user's phone to connect to a digital asset, and (ii) a code is sent to the user's phone (e.g., via SMS, mobile app, etc.) or spoken to the user (e.g., via a Smart Speaker), such that the user has to enter the code into an input field on a digital asset of choice (i.e., website, mobile app, TV app, etc.).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Alternatively, no action is needed to start the synchronization in instances such as a callback, where the synchronized audio session can begin without additional prompts from the user. This can happen, for example, when the user expresses advance interest in a voice-guided/synchronized experience (e.g., by scheduling a callback).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Step 3: The audio synchronization is confirmed by an application programming interface (API) call to an embodiment, which synchronizes the audio channel with the non-audio channel(s) into a session. Once the synchronized session is established, the audio channel will output relevant audio-based information based on actions taken through the non-audio channel. Such actions taken through the non-audio channel can include, for example, the press of a button, selection of a list item or filling out an input field (e.g., via the user's phone).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Any noise transmitted over the audio channel from the user or the environment can be ignored. The audio synchronization is done using an infinite loop that continuously (or repeatedly over short time periods) checks whether an action by the user was performed on the digital asset or not. If an action was performed by the user, the audio channel will output the relevant audio-based information pertaining to the action taken. If no action was taken, the audio channel will output audio silence (e.g., an audio output at a frequency that is inaudible to people) at intervals as little as 2 milliseconds. The repeatedly and/or continuously checking of whether an action was performed or not can be performed because the user may need time to complete an action on the non-audio channel before being told another audible output (e.g., being told the next step in a process, being told a reminder of a current action that needs to be performed). Said similarity, upon a user being audibly told a step (i.e., a compute device outputting audio to the user), the user may need time to comprehend the step and complete the step, in which case a period of inaudible audio can be desirable.

At <b>502</b>, a representation of a request from a compute device associated with a user to complete a task including a first step and a second step is received. For example, the user with the compute device may type and/or speak into their compute device (e.g., compute device <b>304</b>) a task that they would like to accomplish, such as changing an airline seat or opening a new bank account. Steps refers to sub-tasks that can be completed to complete a task, such as entering in a name, selecting a seat, entering payment information, picking a bank account type, etc. In some implementations, the representation of the request is received via a phone call, where a user can audibly describe a task, and a smart IVR can be used to determine the task.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">At <b>504</b>, an audio channel associated with the user is caused to synchronize with at least one non-audio channel associated with the user.

In some implementations, the first audible output can be a voice speaking the first step to the user. For example, if a task is changing an airline seat, the first audible output can audibly request the user to enter a confirmation code of a purchased ticket into a text box associated with the at least one non-audio channel.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">At <b>508</b>, it is determined whether a prompt on the at least one non-audio channel has been received from the user. The prompt may or may not be in accordance with the first step. The prompt can be, for example, the user entering a valid confirmation code of a purchased ticket into a correct text box. The prompt can also be, for example, the user entering an incorrect confirmation code into the correct text box, the user entering a correct confirmation code into the wrong text box, etc. If <b>508</b> is no, proceed to <b>510</b>. If <b>508</b> is yes, proceed to <b>512</b>.

The second step can refer to the next sub-task that needs to be performed after the first step to complete a task. For example, if the first step/first audible output was to enter a confirmation code, the second step/second audible output can be to select a new airline seat. At <b>516</b>, the second audible output is caused to output on the audio channel.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">At <b>518</b>, a third audible output is selected. The third audible output can be the same as or different than the second audible output. In some implementations, the third audible output is a repeat of the first audible output. In some implementations, the third audible output indicates that the first step has not been completed correctly. In some implementations, the third audible output indicates an action that can be performed at the at least one non-audio channel to terminate the session and/or connect with a live user and/or chat. At <b>520</b>, the third audible output is caused to output on the audio channel.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the method <b>500</b> can continue to receive additional prompts and output additional audible outputs based on the additional prompts to finish a given task and/or until the session is terminated. For instance, if the prompt at <b>508</b> is a first prompt, it can be repeatedly determined whether a second prompt on the at least one non-audio channel has been received from the user (the second prompt occurring after the first prompt). A fourth signal to cause the inaudible output on the audio channel to the user can be sent in response to each determination that the prompt on the at least one non-audio channel has not been received from the user. In response to the determination that the second prompt on the at least one non-audio channel has been received from the user, (1) a fourth audible output is selected based on an activity by the user on the at least one non-audio channel, and (2) a fourth signal is sent to cause the fourth audible output to be output on the audio channel. The fourth audible output can be selected based on whether the second prompt was in accordance with the second audible output if <b>512</b> was yes, or whether the second prompt was in accordance with the third audible output if <b>512</b> was no.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some implementations, method <b>500</b> further comprises transmitting a hyperlink to the compute device, where the compute device is a mobile device.
