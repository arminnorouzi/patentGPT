Various components cooperate to provide a system <b>100</b> which may be used, for example, to initiate a transfer of resources. As shown, the system <b>100</b> includes a first computing device <b>110</b>, a server <b>120</b> and a digital identity network server <b>130</b> coupled to one another through a network <b>140</b>, which may include a public network such as the Internet and/or a private network.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The server <b>120</b> may be associated with an institution and may be a resource transfer server or financial institution server. The server <b>120</b> may maintain a database that includes various data records. A data record may, for example, reflect a transfer of resources. The data records may include a quantity (amount and/or value) of the resources, a type of the resources, identity data associated with a customer or user purchasing or requesting transfer of the resources, and information indicating an authentication channel used to initiate the transfer of resources. The identity data may include a name of the customer or user purchasing or requesting transfer of the resources and an address. The address may be a shipping or delivery address. A threshold defining a quantity of resources that may be purchased using each supported authentication channel within a particular time period may be stored in the database. The threshold may be defined or predefined by an administrator of the server <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The computing device <b>110</b> may take a variety of forms such as a smartphone, a tablet computer, a wearable computer such as a head-mounted display or smartwatch, a laptop or desktop computer, or a computing device of another type. In certain embodiments, a user may operate the computing device <b>110</b> to cause the computing device <b>110</b> to request to transfer a quantity of resources. Further, the computing device <b>110</b> may be used to authenticate the user.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The computing device <b>110</b> is adapted to present a graphical user interface that allows for communication with the server <b>120</b>. For example, the computing device <b>110</b> may be adapted to send, to the server <b>120</b>, a signal representing a request to transfer a first quantity of resources.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The server <b>120</b> may be adapted to authenticate a user via a first authentication channel. The server <b>120</b> may be adapted to receive, from the computing device <b>110</b>, the signal representing the request to transfer the first quantity of resources. The server <b>120</b> may be adapted to determine that the first quantity of resources is less than a first threshold associated with the first authentication channel. The server <b>120</b> may be adapted to obtain identity data associated with the request to transfer the first quantity of resources. The server <b>120</b> may be adapted to determine, based on the identity data, that a request to transfer a second quantity of resources has been previously initiated by the user via a second authentication channel that is different than the first authentication channel. The server <b>120</b> may be adapted to determine that the sum of the first quantity of resources and the second quantity of resources is less than the first threshold, and in response to determining that the sum of the first quantity of resources and the second quantity of resources is less than the first threshold, initiate the transfer of the first quantity of resources.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The digital identity network server <b>130</b> is a server associated with a digital identity network. Although the digital identity network server <b>130</b> is illustrated as a single block, it may be a network consisting of numerous computer systems. For example, the digital identity network may be a blockchain network which includes a number of nodes. The blockchain network is a decentralized peer-to-peer network in which nodes may maintain respective copies of an append-only ledger.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The blockchain network may be a permissioned blockchain network in which only authorized nodes are permitted to add blocks to the blockchain. For example, only verified nodes may be granted permission to write to the blockchain. The verified nodes may be trusted nodes such as nodes associated with government organizations or other trusted entities such as banks. By way of example, the verified nodes may be associated with a driver's license bureau, a credit bureau, a government identity issuing office such as an entity registry office, or an office of another type. Given ones of these nodes may maintain identity records of various types. For example, a node associated with a passport office may maintain digital passport records, a node associated with a driver's license bureau may maintain digital licensing records, a node associated with a credit bureau may maintain digital credit records, and a node associated with a bank may maintain digital banking records. Various verified nodes may maintain contact information records which may, for example, specify an email address, postal address, telephone number, or other type of contact information.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, at least some verified nodes may write to the blockchain. At least some of the blocks written to the blockchain may be related to identity data. The digital identity network server <b>130</b> may store identity data associated with a plurality of users. In at least some embodiments, identity data may not be included in the blockchain. Instead, the blocks may store a private secret that is related to such identity data. The private secret may act as proof to the existence of the identity data and may be used to verify the authenticity of the data. For example, in at least some embodiments, the private secret may be a hash of the identity data such that, when the identity data is provided to another system (i.e., a system apart from the verified node maintaining the identity data), it may be verified from the hash stored in a block on the blockchain.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The blockchain network may, for example, be implemented using Hyperledger Fabric, for example.
