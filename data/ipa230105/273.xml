The extension device can extend the height of a drapery system while advantageously allowing use of the mounting slots of the original upright drapery pipe to receive a drape support.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Common temporary drapery systems used in decorating event spaces, such as weddings and conferences, are typically configured as a slip fit pipe and drapery system. The system typically includes at least two uprights, two bases, at least one drape support (or crossbar), and one or more drapery panels. The upright drapery pipes are vertical poles that set the height of the display. The uprights typically feature three or four slots positioned at 90&#xb0; angles near the upper end of the upright drapery pipe. The horizontal drape supports may be mounted by engaging a mounting hook of a drape support with one of the slots of the upright.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pipe and drape uprights are available in a variety of fixed or adjustable heights. Additionally, there are extension devices for increasing the height of fixed uprights by inserting the extension device into the upper end of the upright drapery pipe. However, existing extension devices obstruct the existing slots of the upright drapery pipe such that it is not possible to mount a drape support at the original height of the upright. Accordingly, there is a need for an upright extension device that allows for use of the slots of the original upright.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an exemplary extension device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional exploded view of an exemplary extension device.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This disclosure relates to a double-sided extension device for upright drapery systems, such as those used in decorating temporary event spaces. The extension device can extend the height of a drapery system while advantageously allowing for use of slots of the original upright to receive a drape support.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the extension device <b>10</b> for a drapery system includes a cylindrical body <b>7</b> having a first end <b>4</b> and a second end <b>5</b>. Each of the first end <b>4</b> and second end <b>5</b> is configured to mount to an upright drapery pipe (not shown).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Typically, the cylindrical body <b>7</b> is has a tubular structure with a hollow lumen to reduce the weight of the device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cylindrical body <b>7</b> may be configured as an assembly of an inner tube <b>1</b>, an outer tube <b>2</b> and an abutment support <b>3</b>, each having a tubular configuration. A portion of the inner tube <b>1</b> is nested within a portion of the outer tube <b>2</b> such that the inner tube <b>1</b> extends from the outer tube <b>2</b>. Additionally, the abutment support <b>3</b> may be nested entirely within the inner tube <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A slot <b>6</b> is positioned at each of the first end <b>4</b> and second end <b>5</b> of the cylindrical body <b>7</b>, such that both ends of the cylindrical body <b>7</b> include at least one slot (shown as <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>). Each slot <b>6</b> is generally aligned with a longitudinal axis of the cylindrical body <b>7</b>. The slots <b>6</b> are configured to overlap or coincide with at least one upright slot of an upright drapery pipe when the extension device <b>10</b> is mounted to the upright drapery pipe. As a result, a horizontal drape support (not shown) may be mounted by inserting and engaging a mounting hook of a drape support through one of the slots <b>6</b> of the extension device <b>10</b> and the overlapping or coinciding upright slot of the upright drapery pipe. Advantageously, a mounting hook of a second drape support may be inserted through and engage with one of the slots <b>6</b> on the end of the cylindrical body <b>7</b> opposite the upright drapery pipe to allow for double vertical draping.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As upright drapery pipes typically have a plurality of upright slots, a plurality slots <b>6</b> may be positioned at each of the first end <b>4</b> and second end <b>5</b> of the cylindrical body <b>7</b>. Suitably, the first end <b>4</b> and second end <b>5</b> of the cylindrical body <b>7</b> may each comprise two, three, four, five or more slots <b>6</b>. In such examples, each of the plurality of slots <b>6</b> on the first end <b>4</b> or the second end <b>5</b> are configured to overlap with one of a plurality of upright slots of the upright drapery pipe when the extension device <b>10</b> is mounted to the upright drapery pipe. As a result, each of the existing upright slots of the upright may remain available to be used for mounting a drape support when the extension device <b>10</b> is mounted on the upright drapery pipe.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As conventional upright drapery pipes typically include between three and four upright slots, it is contemplated that the first end <b>4</b> and second end <b>5</b> of the cylindrical body <b>7</b> may comprise between three and four slots <b>6</b>. The first end <b>4</b> and second end <b>5</b> of the cylindrical body <b>7</b> may comprise the same number or a different number of slots <b>6</b>. For example, if one of the first end <b>4</b> and second end <b>5</b> of the cylindrical body <b>7</b> has three slots, the other of the first and second ends may have four slots.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first end <b>4</b> and second end <b>5</b> of the cylindrical body <b>7</b> may be configured to mount to an upright drapery pipe by selecting a size and shape based on the desired upright drapery pipe. Typically, the size and shape will be selected to allow for the first end <b>4</b> or the second end <b>5</b> to receive an upper end of the upright drapery pipe therein as in slip fit pipe assembly. A suitable diameter of the cylindrical body <b>7</b> may be between 35 and 55 mm, although a larger or smaller diameter may be used depending on the dimensions of the upright drapery pipe of the drapery system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The length of the extension device <b>10</b> may be selected according to need. A suitable distance between the slots positioned at each of the first end and second end of the cylindrical body in between about 8 and 30 inches, preferably 8 and 20 inches, although longer or shorter lengths are possible. The individual lengths of the inner tube <b>1</b>, outer tube <b>2</b> and abutment support <b>3</b> are not limited. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the length of the inner tube <b>1</b> may be approximately 200 mm, the outer tube <b>2</b> may be approximately 120 mm and the abutment support <b>3</b> may be approximately 50 mm.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Rivets <b>8</b> may be used to fix the elements of the cylindrical body <b>7</b> to one another. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, rivet <b>8</b><i>a </i>may join the inner tube <b>1</b> and the abutment support <b>3</b> and rivet <b>8</b><i>b </i>may join the inner tube <b>1</b> and the outer tube <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The extension device <b>10</b> may be constructed of any suitable material. Aluminum is preferred in view of cost, strength, weight and ease of manufacture.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In use, the extension device <b>10</b> may be mounted to an upright drapery pipe of a drapery display system by positioning either the first end <b>4</b> or the second end <b>5</b> of the extension device <b>10</b> over an upper end of the upright drapery pipe such that the upright drapery pipe is received within the first end or the second end. If the first end <b>4</b> is mounted to the upright drapery pipe, the upper end of the upright drapery pipe abuts an end-side of the abutment support <b>3</b> facing the first end <b>4</b>. As a result, the extension device <b>10</b> rests on the top of the upright drapery pipe and the abutment support <b>3</b> provides a weight bearing surface. Alternatively, if the second end <b>5</b> is mounted to the upright drapery pipe, the upper end of the upright drapery pipe abuts an end-side of the inner tube <b>1</b> facing the second end <b>5</b>. As a result, the extension device <b>10</b> rests on the top of the upright drapery pipe and the inner tube <b>1</b> provides a weight bearing surface. In either case, the extension device can be rotated around the upright drapery pipe to align the slots <b>6</b> with the slots of the upright drapery pipe. Once the extension device <b>10</b> is mounted to the upright drapery pipe, a horizontal drape support may be mounted to the extension device <b>10</b> by inserting and engaging a mounting hook of a drape support through one of the slots <b>6</b> of the extension device <b>10</b> and the overlapping or coinciding upright slot of the upright drapery pipe. Additionally, if desired, a mounting hook of a second drape support may be inserted through and engage with one of the slots <b>6</b> on the end of the cylindrical body <b>7</b> opposite the upright drapery pipe to provide for double vertical draping.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
