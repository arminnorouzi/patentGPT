When deployed in the heart, a heart pump assembly pulls blood from the left ventricle of the heart and expels blood into the aorta, or pulls blood from the right ventricle and expels blood into the pulmonary artery. Specifically, the blood enters the heart pump assembly via a blood inlet located at a distal end of the heart pump assembly, travels through a cannula of the heart pump assembly, and expels via a plurality of apertures defined at a proximal end of the heart pump assembly. However, the design of the currently available blood inlet of a heart pump assembly produces large blood flow recirculation at the entry (or inlet) of the blood inlet, thereby reducing blood flow into the heart pump assembly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there exists a need for a blood inlet used with a heart pump assembly to prevent large blood recirculation at the entry to maximize the blood flow into the heart pump assembly.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Described herein is a heart pump assembly having a blood inlet.

It is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely examples of the disclosure, which may be embodied in various forms. Well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail to avoid obscuring the present disclosure in unnecessary detail. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present disclosure in virtually any appropriately detailed structure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The heart pump assembly may be percutaneously inserted into the heart through the aorta. The blood inlet may be positioned past the aortic valve in the left ventricle, in order to pull blood from the left ventricle and expel the blood into the aorta. Although the atraumatic tip spaces the heart pump assembly from the heart walls, in some instances, the blood inlet may be positioned near to the walls of the heart or various heart structures, such as the leaflets of the mitral valve. The heart pump assembly described herein provides a heart pump assembly with an improved blood inlet. The blood inlet is configured and designed to prevent or reduce blow flow resistance and blood flow recirculation at the entry of the blood inlet, thereby increasing blood flow into the heart pump assembly, as will be described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a heart pump <b>10</b> assembly comprising an improved blood inlet <b>12</b> in accordance with the present technology. The heart pump assembly <b>10</b> includes a motor housing <b>14</b>, a cannula <b>16</b>, and an atraumatic tip <b>18</b> for stabilizing the heart pump assembly <b>10</b> in the ventricle of the heart. The heart pump assembly <b>10</b> can vary in any number of ways. For example, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> herein may exclude a motor housing. Instead, the motor can be configured to be positioned outside of a patient's body and can operatively couple to the rotor via a drive shaft or cable.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The motor housing <b>14</b> is configured to accommodate an impeller (not shown) and a motor (not shown) therewithin. The motor is used to rotate the impeller to draw blood from the heart into the heart pump assembly <b>10</b>. Specifically, rotation of the blades of the impeller creates suction through the cannula <b>16</b> for the blood to flow into the heart pump assembly <b>10</b>. The blood enters the cannula <b>16</b> and travels therethrough and exits the heart pump assembly <b>10</b> from a plurality of blood exhaust outlets <b>20</b> defined adjacent to or on the motor housing <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cannula <b>16</b> extends between a proximal end <b>22</b> and a distal end <b>24</b>. At the distal end <b>24</b> of the cannula <b>16</b>, the cannula <b>16</b> and blood inlet <b>12</b> are connected and are in fluid communication with each other. The cannula <b>16</b> is also connected to the motor housing <b>14</b> at the proximal end <b>22</b> thereof. The blood inlet <b>12</b> is also connected to the atraumatic tip <b>18</b>. Thus, the blood inlet <b>12</b>, cannula <b>16</b>, motor housing <b>14</b>, and atraumatic tip <b>18</b> are all connected and are all in fluid communication with each other.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the blood inlet <b>12</b> extends between a distal end <b>28</b> and a proximal end <b>30</b>, and includes a distal body portion <b>32</b>, a proximal body portion <b>34</b>, and a plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> defined and positioned between the distal and proximal body portions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The distal body portion <b>32</b> of the blood inlet <b>12</b> includes a connector <b>38</b> for connecting the atraumatic tip <b>18</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to the blood inlet <b>12</b> at its distal end <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The atraumatic tip <b>18</b> may be shaped as a flexible extension having a pigtail as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Alternatively, the atraumatic tip <b>18</b> is configured as a straight extension or as a ball. Also, the atraumatic tip <b>18</b> may include a lumen for the passage of a guidewire through the atraumatic tip <b>18</b>. The atraumatic tip <b>18</b> acts as a mechanical spacer that provides a space between the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> of the blood inlet <b>12</b> and the inner surface of the heart. This space prevents the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> from suctioning to the walls of the heart, heart valves (e.g., the mitral valve), or any other anatomical structure in the heart. This can reduce the risk of blockage of the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> and may reduce or prevent damage to the heart tissues.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The proximal body portion <b>34</b> defines an inlet conduit <b>40</b> therewithin for the drawn blood to travel therethrough and into the cannula <b>16</b>. The inlet conduit <b>40</b> of the proximal body portion <b>34</b> of the blood inlet <b>12</b> extends between a first open end <b>42</b> of the proximal body portion <b>34</b> and a second open end <b>44</b> of the proximal body portion <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the inlet conduit <b>40</b> is frustrum-shaped. Thus, the inlet conduit <b>40</b> has a first inner diameter at the first open end <b>42</b> that is less than a second inner diameter at the second open end <b>44</b>. The blood inlet <b>12</b> having a tapered inlet conduit <b>40</b> reduces the flow resistance of the blood at the inlet of the proximal body portion <b>34</b> of the blood inlet <b>12</b> as the blood enters the heart pump assembly <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), thereby increasing the blood flow. The first inner diameter at the first open end <b>42</b> and the second inner diameter at the second open end <b>44</b> are approximately 3.5 cm and 4.1 cm, respectively.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> are oriented radially around a circumference of the blood inlet <b>12</b> with an evenly spaced distance between each of the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b>. Each of the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> has an associated height measured parallel to a longitudinal axis <b>37</b>, a width measured transverse to the longitudinal axis <b>37</b>, and an area. For example, each cage opening <b>36</b> has a height, a width, and an area through which blood may enter and flow through the cannula <b>16</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) from the inlet of the blood inlet <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, each of the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> has identical measurements (e.g., height, width, and area) such that the cage openings <b>36</b> are also substantially identical.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the illustrated embodiment, each of the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> has a shape with flat distal and proximal edges <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and curved outer edges <b>50</b>. The plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> may have any suitable shape to allow blood to enter the cannula <b>16</b>. For example, the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> can be oblong, oval, square, tear-shaped, round or any other suitable shape.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A valve leaflet or other portion of the anatomy that is suctioned against some of the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b>, or into the heart pump assembly <b>10</b>, decreases the area through which blood can enter the cannula <b>16</b>, thereby potentially decreasing the flow rate of the blood through the heart pump assembly <b>10</b>. Because the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> are relatively small in size, the cage openings <b>36</b> are less likely to allow a valve leaflet to enter the heart pump assembly <b>10</b> at the inlet, allowing the interior of the cannula <b>16</b> to be clear for the passage of blood.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each of the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> are defined by edges. Specifically, a distal edge <b>46</b> and a proximal edge <b>48</b> of each cage opening <b>36</b> are defined by a portion of the distal body portion <b>32</b> and a portion of the proximal body portion <b>34</b> of the blood inlet <b>12</b>, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. In addition, outer edges <b>50</b> of each of the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> are defined by a plurality of struts <b>52</b> included in the blood inlet <b>12</b> such that each of the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b> is separated by the plurality of struts <b>52</b>. In one embodiment, the distal edge <b>46</b> and the proximal edge <b>48</b> are filleted. In another embodiment, the plurality of struts <b>52</b> are filleted. In yet another embodiment, all of the distal edge <b>46</b>, the proximal edge <b>48</b>, and the plurality of struts <b>52</b> are filleted.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The plurality of struts <b>52</b> are connected to the distal body portion <b>32</b> and proximal body portion <b>34</b> of the blood inlet <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the plurality of struts <b>52</b> are outwardly bowed or curved. These bowed or curved struts <b>52</b> provide a smooth transition into the curve-shaped distal body portion <b>32</b> of the blood inlet <b>12</b> and the tapered proximal body portion <b>34</b> to reduce the force absorbed when it is inserted into the patient's body. The plurality of struts <b>52</b> can function as a screen to prevent the suctioning of valve leaflets and other vascular or heart tissues to the plurality of cage openings <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the blood inlet <b>12</b> further includes a cutoff <b>54</b> defined on an outer surface of the proximal body portion <b>34</b> of the blood inlet <b>12</b>. The cutoff <b>54</b> provides a place for a sensor (not shown) to be mounted and secured thereon. In addition, a barb <b>56</b> is defined on the outer surface of the proximal body portion <b>34</b> of the blood inlet <b>12</b> for providing a tight connection and securing the cannula <b>16</b> to the blood inlet <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The heart pump assembly <b>10</b> is made of one or more materials having suitable properties for a desired application, including strength, weight, rigidity, etc. Plastic (e.g., polypropylene, polyethylene, etc.) is preferred for the blood inlet <b>12</b>, atraumatic tip <b>18</b>, and motor housing <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. is a side cross-sectional view of an exemplary prior art blood inlet <b>102</b> of a heart pump assembly. The prior art blood inlet <b>102</b> has a plurality of struts <b>104</b> that are straight, instead of bowed as are the struts <b>52</b> in the blood inlet <b>12</b> described herein. The design of the prior art blood inlet <b>102</b> produces large blood flow recirculation at the entry (inlet) <b>103</b> of the blood inlet <b>102</b>, as shown at the location <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Therefore, the blood flow at the entry of the prior art blood inlet <b>102</b> has some turbulence, illustrated as <b>106</b>, caused by the transition from the blood inlet <b>102</b> to the inlet <b>103</b>. As stated above, the design and construction of the blood inlet <b>12</b> of the heart pump assembly <b>10</b> in the illustrated embodiment effectively reduces the blood flow recirculation that occurs at the entry of the prior art blood inlet <b>102</b>, thereby providing more laminar blood flow into the inlet conduit <b>40</b> of the blood inlet <b>12</b>. Specifically, the improved design of the blood inlet <b>12</b> having a tapered contour of the blood inlet <b>12</b> and frustrum-shaped inlet conduit <b>40</b> effectively reduces flow turbulences at the blood inlet <b>12</b> and the inlet conduit <b>40</b>, thereby increasing the blood flow into the heart pump assembly <b>10</b>.
