The lit time mentioned above can be calculated by multiplying the period of the UART communication by the above set value and then dividing the result by 255.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The current source <b>44</b>_<i>k </i>is connected to the cathode of the light emitting element circuit <b>5</b>A_k (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and is PWM-driven by the PWM signal SPWMk (where k represents a natural number of 1 or more but 8 or less). When the PWM signal SPWMk is at high level, the current source <b>44</b>_<i>k </i>is on and drives the light emitting element circuit <b>5</b>A_k. By contrast, when the PWM signal SPWMk is at low level, the current source <b>44</b>_<i>k </i>is off and does not drive the light emitting element circuit <b>5</b>A_k.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As the light emitting element driving device <b>4</b>A operates as described above and also the light emitting element driving devices <b>4</b>B to <b>4</b>D operate in a similar manner to the light emitting element driving device <b>4</b>A, all the light emitting element driving devices <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>D operate in synchronization with the reference signal SREF. Thus, it is possible, without using a clock signal common to the light emitting element driving devices <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>D, to adapt the light emission pattern of the light emitting system <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to a desired light emission pattern (the light emission pattern that the microcomputer <b>2</b> instructs the light emitting element driving devices <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>D to use).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Even when the PWM dimming on-duty is equal among the channels, it is not necessary to synchronize the timing of switching from extinction to lighting. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the timing of switching from extinction to lighting may be shifted by a predetermined shift time A. Although, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the PWM dimming on-duty is equal among channels, needless to say, the PWM dimming on-duty may be different among channels. In addition, it is possible, in each channel, to change the PWM dimming on-duty for each PWM period.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Although the above description deals with a case where there is nothing abnormal in the voltage level of the communication bus <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), there may be a case where something abnormal occurs in the voltage level of the communication bus <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) due to a fault in the microcomputer <b>2</b>, the effects of noise, etc.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, if a period L<b>1</b> in which the communication bus <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) turns to low level occurs before the first predetermined time PT<b>1</b> elapses after the end of the communication of the UART signal S<b>1</b>, the generator <b>42</b> does not erroneously recognize the stat time point of the period L<b>1</b> as the start time point of the start bit in the UART signal (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">However, if the period L<b>1</b> in which the communication bus <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) turns to low level occurs after the first predetermined time PT<b>1</b> has elapsed after the end of the communication of the UART signal S<b>1</b>, the generator <b>42</b> erroneously recognizes the start time point of the period L<b>1</b> as the start time point of the start bit in the UART signal.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">To prevent such erroneous recognition, a configuration is possible where, when the period in which the communication bus <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is at low level does not continue for a second predetermined time after the time point at which low level appears on the communication bus <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the falling edge detector <b>422</b>, as an exception, does not detect the time point at which low level appears on the communication bus <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) as the start time point of the start bit in the UART communication. For example, a filter circuit that can eliminate a low level signal that only lasts for the second predetermined time or shorter can be provided in the falling edge detector <b>422</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The second predetermined time is set to be shorter than the first predetermined time PT<b>1</b> described above. More specifically, the second predetermined time is set to be shorter than the low level period of the communication bus <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that corresponds to the start bit in the UART communication.
