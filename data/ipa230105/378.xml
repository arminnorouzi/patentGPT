For example, a combination of a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope may be used for determining a user's blood pressure. The sphygmomanometer may include an inflatable cuff for collapsing a user's artery and, subsequently, releasing the user's artery in a controlled manner for determining blood pressure of the patient user. Upon collapsing and releasing the patient user's artery, the stethoscope may be used to determine at what pressure blood begins flowing in the artery, and at what pressure the blood flow becomes unimpeded. Such specialized equipment and methods for measuring blood pressure may not be worn for extended periods of time and, thus, may not be suitable for obtaining numerous blood pressure measurement readings over time. Further, such specialized equipment may be invasive or uncomfortable to the user. The user may experience discomfort as the inflatable cuff may be used to collapse an artery, preventing blood flow. Less invasive devices for acquiring physiological statistics over a duration of time may be desirable.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, devices or apparatus for determining physiological statistics, such as blood pressure, may be provided in a garment. The garment may be a t-shirt or a long sleeve shirt having one or more sleeves for receiving a patient user's arms. At least one shirt sleeve may include a sensor array configured to be secured, via consistent pressure, to the patient user's arm. In some embodiments, the sensor array may be secured to the user's arm in a consistent or repeatable way, such that the device for determining physiological statistics may collect a plurality of blood pressure readings over time. Because example devices may collect blood pressure readings over time, in some scenarios, trends and deviations therefrom may be determined.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Examples described in the present disclosure may be directed to measuring blood pressure based on physiological data acquisitions using a sensor array secured to a user arm. It may be appreciated that devices for measuring other physiological statistics based on one or more sensor arrays secured, via consistent pressure, to any other type of user limb or body part may be contemplated. Embodiments described in the present disclosure may be directed to shirts and shirt sleeves. It may be appreciated that the apparatus and devices for acquiring physiological data may be provided for other types of garments, such as pants, hats, or other types of garments that may receive a user limb or a part of the user's body.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which illustrates a system for detecting physiological data, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The system may include a controller device <b>100</b> and one or more sensor panels <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the one or more sensor panels <b>110</b> may be affixed to a garment, and the one or more sensor panels <b>110</b> may be positioned against a user's skin for detecting physiological data.

In some embodiments, the garment may be formed of other textile forms and/or techniques such as weaving, knitting (warp, weft, etc.) or the like. In some embodiments, the smart garment may include one of a knitted textile, a woven textile, a cut and sewn textile, a knitted fabric, a non-knitted fabric, in any combination and/or permutation thereof. Example structures and interlacing techniques of textiles formed by knitting and weaving are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/267,818, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, &#x201c;textile&#x201d; refers to any material made or formed by manipulating natural or artificial fibres to interlace to create an organized network of fibres. Generally, textiles are formed using yarn, where yarn refers to a long continuous length of a plurality of fibres that have been interlocked (i.e., fitting into each other, as if twined together, or twisted together). Herein, the terms fibre and yarn are used interchangeably. Fibres or yarns can be manipulated to form a textile according to any method that provides an interlaced organized network of fibres, including but not limited to weaving, knitting, sew and cut, crocheting, knotting and felting.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Different sections of a textile can be integrally formed into a layer to utilize different structural properties of different types of fibres. For example, conductive fibres can be manipulated to form networks of conductive fibres and non-conductive fibres can be manipulated to form networks of non-conductive fibers. These networks of fibres can comprise different sections of a textile by integrating the networks of fibres into a layer of the textile. The networks of conductive fibres can form one or more conductive pathways that electrically connect sensors and actuators embedded in the smart garment, for conveying data and/or power to and/or from these components.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments described in the present disclosure, the sensors embedded in the smart garment may be the one or more sensor panels <b>110</b> for detecting physiological data. The network <b>150</b> may include the network of conductive fibres of the smart textile for conveying data and/or power between the one or more sensor panels <b>110</b> and the controller device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, multiple layers of textile may be stacked upon each other to provide a multi-layer textile.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the present disclosure, &#x201c;interlace&#x201d; refers to fibres (either artificial or natural) crossing over and/or under one another in an organized fashion, typically alternately over and under one another, in a layer. When interlaced, adjacent fibres touch each other at intersection points (e.g., points where one fibre crosses over or under another fibre). In one example, first fibres extending in a first direction can be interlaced with second fibres extending laterally or transverse to the fibres extending in the first connection. In another example, the second fibres can extend laterally at 90&#xb0; from the first fibres when interlaced with the first fibres. Interlaced fibres extending in a sheet can be referred to as a network of fibres.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the present disclosure, &#x201c;integrated&#x201d; or &#x201c;integrally&#x201d; refers to combining, coordinating or otherwise bringing together separate elements so as to provide a harmonious, consistent, interrelated whole. In the context of a textile, a textile can have various sections comprising networks of fibres with different structural properties. For example, a textile can have a section comprising a network of conductive fibres and a section comprising a network of non-conductive fibres. Two or more seconds comprising networks of fibres are said to be &#x201c;integrated&#x201d; together into a textile (or &#x201c;integrally formed&#x201d;) when at least one fibre of one network is interlaced with at least one fibre of the other network such that the two networks form a layer of the textile. Further, when integrated, two sections of a textile can also be described as being substantially inseparable from the textile. Here, &#x201c;substantially inseparable&#x201d; refers to the notion that separation of the sections of the textile from each other results in disassembly or destruction of the textile itself.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some examples, conductive fabric (e.g., group of conductive fibres can be knit along with (e.g., to be integral with) the base fabric (e.g., surface) in a layer. Such knitting may be performed using a circular knit machine or a flat bed knit machine, or the like, from a vendor such as Santoni or Stoll.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The controller device <b>100</b> includes a processor <b>102</b> configured to implement processor readable instructions that, when executed, configure the processor <b>102</b> to conduct operations described herein.
