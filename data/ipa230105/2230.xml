In particular, the disclosure relates to novel methods for constructing anthracitic networks from different types of two-dimensional building blocks, including carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous types.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure also relates to novel, synthetic anthracitic networks that are crosslinked by structural dislocations. In particular, the disclosure relates to perimorphic materials and frameworks comprising synthetic anthracitic networks that obtain hierarchical crosslinking via structural dislocations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lastly, the disclosure also relates to novel methods for inducing superconducting states in materials under ambient conditions and to novel ambient superconductors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Structures that are two-dimensional at the molecular scale, such as graphenic carbon, have been demonstrated to possess outstanding properties. However, to facilitate the practical use of these two-dimensional structures in many macroscopic or even microscopic applications, it is necessary to use them to build hierarchical materials that are three-dimensional at larger scales. Constructing these hierarchical materials that are simultaneously two-dimensional at the molecular scale and three-dimensional at higher scales has proven challenging.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The usual approach to constructing larger-scale systems is to bring two-dimensional lattices-often graphenic lattices-into contact with one another and to cohere them into a system comprising multiple lattices. This type of system, comprising a plural membership of distinct two-dimensional lattices, is described in the present disclosure as an &#x201c;assembly.&#x201d; Macroscopic, three-dimensional assemblies can be readily constructed from two-dimensional lattices.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In assembly-type systems, the two-dimensional lattice members are typically cohered to one another at areas where they come into overlapping van der Waals (&#x201c;vdW&#x201d;) contact. Such systems are principally cohered via intermolecular attractions at these contacts. We describe this type of assembly, in which the principal mechanism of cohesion is intermolecular attractions between members in vdW contact, as a &#x201c;vdW assembly.&#x201d; VdW assemblies, irrespective of their physical architecture, share the common attribute of covalent disconnectedness at the system level.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Intermolecular attractions are weaker than covalent bonds, and weak cohesion enables the overlapping members of vdW assemblies to slide over one another. This tendency to shear-yield limits the modulus of graphitic carbons and softens them. Since the intermolecular attraction between two lattices is a function of their contact area and contact distance, vdW assemblies of small lattice members are often especially weak.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other assemblies, multiple two-dimensional lattice members may be principally cohered to one another via chemical bonds. In this sort of bonded assembly, chemical bonds between the individual lattice members may inhibit shear-yielding and render the assembly more robust than a vdW assembly cohered only via intermolecular forces. In the prior art, bonded assemblies have been formed by chemically altering the surfaces of graphenic lattices, for instance via grafting chains to them that may then be used to crosslink them to other lattices. While this may represent an improvement over vdW assemblies, the junctions between bonded lattice members still limits the realization of universal two-dimensional molecular structuring.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In principle, some limitations of assemblies might be overcome by constructing a &#x201c;graphenic network,&#x201d; which herein describes a structure with a two-dimensional molecular-scale geometry that is at some scale three-dimensionally crosslinked. As a function of a graphenic network's crosslinking and network geometry, it cannot be broken without breaking some portion of its two-dimensional molecular structure. Intuitively, this should be the best way to construct ordinary objects, usually macroscopic in size, that exhibit properties similar to two-dimensional structures. Such objects would benefit if the network geometry could be architected rationally.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One source of inspiration for how a graphenic network might be constructed is anthracite, a naturally occurring, mature coal that comprises an &#x201c;anthracitic network,&#x201d; which herein describes a layered graphenic network that is three-dimensionally crosslinked via certain characteristic dislocations (&#x201c;anthracitic dislocations&#x201d;) and in which z-adjacent layers are nematically aligned. These three-dimensionally crosslinked anthracitic networks are created when organic matter is exposed to high temperatures and pressures over geologic periods of time. As the organic matter matures, its carbon content increases, and its molecular structure becomes increasingly dominated by two-dimensional, polycyclic arrangements of carbon that eventually coalesce upon evolving structural dislocations that provide polycyclic crosslinks between these polycyclic arrangements (thereby creating a unified polycyclic network).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">There are a few types of anthracitic dislocations that serve to crosslink an anthracitic network. One type is described herein as a &#x201c;Y-dislocation.&#x201d; Briefly, a Y-dislocation is formed when an atomic monolayer bifurcates into an atomic bilayer, with the intersection comprising a polycyclic line of rings (what we describe as a polycyclic line of rings may comprise multiple orbital hybridization states despite the term &#x201c;polycyclic&#x201d; commonly being applied to purely sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized polycyclic structures). A second type of anthracitic dislocation is a screw dislocation, comprising a multilayer helicoidal arrangement of an atomic monolayer. Other anthracitic dislocations may have elements of both a Y-dislocation and a screw dislocation. All of these dislocations have the common effect of forming lateral and vertical, polycyclic, molecular-scale crosslinks between two-dimensional molecular structures. This molecular-scale three-dimensional crosslinking has a hardening and rigidifying effect on anthracitic networks, which is why anthracite is sometimes called &#x201c;hard coal.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">While its crosslinking makes it an interesting example of a macroscopic graphenic network, natural anthracite has practical limitations. Due to its geologic formation, organic and inorganic inclusions may be embedded as secondary phases. No engineering control is exercised during formation, so imperfections cannot be prevented, and rational design principles cannot be applied. These shortcomings mostly limit anthracite's usefulness to fuel applications but could potentially be overcome if synthetic anthracitic networks could be made. Exemplary synthetic methods are detailed in the '760 and '918 applications, in which template-directed chemical vapor deposition (&#x201c;CVD&#x201d;) or what we describe in those applications as &#x201c;surface replication&#x201d; is used to synthesize perimorphic frameworks. If rationally designed perimorphic frameworks crosslinked via anthracitic dislocations could be constructed, these synthetic, geomimetic architectures would represent an improvement over natural anthracite.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Non-anthracitic graphenic networks constructed from two-dimensional materials have arguably been demonstrated via surface replication in the prior art. Small schwarzite-like graphenic networks appear to have been synthesized using CVD deposition on Zeolite Y template particles. Zeolite Y is considered a large-pore zeolite with a supercage diameter of approximately 13 &#x212b;. While its larger pore structure offers improved internal gas diffusion compared to smaller-pore zeolites, it appears that Zeolite Y's micropores are still small enough that spatial confinement effects cause growing graphenic lattices to coalesce into a single, continuous graphenic network that is three-dimensionally crosslinked, but not by anthracitic dislocations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Spatial confinement in small zeolite pores appears to force lattices to coalesce but also creates significant challenges. One problem is the tendency for deposited carbon to occlude the zeolite template's pores, thereby prematurely terminating deposition in the template's interior. As a result, zeolite-templated carbons are seldom complete. Another problem is the extremely slow, diffusion-limited deposition kinetics throughout the microporous template's interior. The maximum template depth over which a substantially complete schwarzite network has arguably been demonstrated (as evidenced by an average of 72 carbon atoms per zeolite supercage) is only about 20 nm. Obtaining completion at even this shallow depth required 6 hours of deposition on Zeolite Y nanoparticles.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition to these challenges, there is potentially another fundamental shortcoming of schwarzites, which is their approximation of a Schwarz minimal surface geometry. While theoretical work has supported the goal of creating graphenic networks modeled on these surfaces due to their minimal nature, we make the case herein that minimal surface geometries may not be as desirable as the denser, layered architecture of anthracitic networks. Namely, we find that schwarzite's geometry may limit or effectively eliminate the interlayer vdW interactions that would contribute to system cohesion in layered anthracitic networks. For this reason, rather than sacrificing vdW cohesion to obtain molecular-scale density reduction, our preference is to obtain density reduction via hierarchical, larger-scale pore engineering, as demonstrated by the tunable mesoporous or macroporous perimorphic frameworks described in the '760 and '918 applications.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Besides schwarzite-like networks, we speculate that the prior art may include heretofore unrecognized instances of synthesizing graphenic networks. This speculation is based on the analysis and concepts developed and advanced in the present disclosure, and the analysis is discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one instance, based on our own ex post facto analysis, we find evidence that a graphenic network was constructed on a magnesium oxide (MgO) template by grafting together the edges of graphenic domains grown over the MgO templating surface [1]. Prior to extraction of the endomorphic MgO, the perimorphic carbon phase formed over the MgO comprised an atomic monolayer. Because anthracitic dislocations comprise interlayer crosslinks of multiple z-adjacent layers, they cannot be present in a monolayer, and our ex post facto analysis finds that this network lacked anthracitic dislocations on the strength of its characterization as a monolayer perimorphic phase on the templating surface. Accordingly, its molecular-scale crosslinking was only lateral, or intralayer, and this anisotropy prevented the framework from realizing some of the basic benefits (e.g. hardness and structural rigidity) associated with more three-dimensional molecular-scale crosslinking. Consequently, upon extraction of the endomorphic template and drying of the perimorphic framework, the pores within the framework collapses, resulting in an as-dried graphenic network with bilayer structuring but without the interlayer, molecular-scale crosslinking of these bilayers that anthracitic dislocations would have provided.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another instance, we find evidence that nano-onions grown with metallic catalysts comprise a graphenic network in which z-adjacent graphenic layers with substantially parallel alignment (i.e. more ordered alignment than the nematic alignment found in anthracitic networks) are vertically crosslinked via anthracitic dislocations but typically over lateral intervals measuring no smaller than 5 nm. These large intervals of nanocrystalline graphitic order make these graphenic networks' molecular-scale crosslinking so anisotropic and lateralized that they resemble graphite more so than anthracite. We therefore describe these graphite-like networks as &#x201c;graphitic networks&#x201d; and differentiate them from anthracitic networks. Like the graphenic networks we speculate are present in the first instance of prior art mentioned above, these graphitic networks exhibit anisotropic, lateralized molecular-scale crosslinking.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure demonstrates methods for synthesizing microscopic or macroscopic anthracitic networks by grafting together two-dimensional molecular building blocks.

Basic Terms &#x26; Concepts</heading><p id="p-0155" num="0171">The term &#x201c;graphenic,&#x201d; as used herein, describes a two-dimensional, polycyclic structure of sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized or sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized atoms. While graphene denotes a form of carbon, we utilize the term &#x201c;graphenic&#x201d; herein to describe a variety of graphene polymorphs (including known or theorized polymorphs such as graphene, amorphous graphene, phagraphene, haeckelites, etc.), as well as to describe other two-dimensional graphene analogues (e.g. atomic monolayers of BN, BC<sub>x</sub>N, etc.) Hence, the term &#x201c;graphenic&#x201d; is intended to encompass any hypothetical polymorph meeting the basic criteria of two-dimensionality, polycyclic organization and sp<sup>2 </sup>or sp<sup>3 </sup>hybridization.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0172">&#x201c;Two-dimensional&#x201d; herein describes a molecular-scale structure comprising a single layer of atoms. A two-dimensional structure may be embedded or immersed in a higher-dimensional space to form a larger-scale structure that, at this larger scale, might be described as a three-dimensional. For instance, a graphenic lattice of subnanoscopic thickness might curve through three-dimensional space to form the atomically thin wall of a nanoscopically three-dimensional cell. This cell would still be described two-dimensional at the molecular scale.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0173">A &#x201c;ring&#x201d; is defined herein as a covalent chain of atoms that together comprise a closed, polyatomic polygon of fewer than 10 atomic vertices. Each of the cyclic structures in a polycyclic arrangement comprise a ring. Each of the atoms comprising a given ring may be described as an atomic member belonging to that ring, and the ring may be described accordingly (i.e. a &#x201c;6-member&#x201d; ring describes a hexagonal ring formed by 6 atomic members).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0174">An &#x201c;sp<sup>2 </sup>ring&#x201d; is herein defined as a ring comprising all sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized atomic members.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0175">An &#x201c;sp<sup>x </sup>ring&#x201d; is herein defined as a ring comprising atomic members that do not all share the same orbital hybridization.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0176">A &#x201c;chiral ring&#x201d; is defined herein as an sp<sup>x </sup>ring in which the covalent chain of atomic members comprises one or more chiral segments, wherein the two atomic termini of these chiral segments are sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized atoms connected to each other via sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds. Chiral rings occur at tectonic zone transitions.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0177">A &#x201c;chiral column&#x201d; is defined herein as a series of z-adjacent chiral rings connected to one another via one or more z-directional chains of sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds. A chiral column tends to form over a base-layer chiral ring and represents the lateral terminus of a diamondlike seam. A chiral column may contain one or more sp<sup>x </sup>helices.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0178">An &#x201c;sp<sup>x </sup>helix&#x201d; is defined herein as a type of helical, one-dimensional chain constructed from both sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized and sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized atomic members. The axis of an sp<sup>x </sup>helix is z-oriented.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0179">An &#x201c;sp<sup>x </sup>double helix&#x201d; is defined herein as the structure formed by two sp<sup>x </sup>helices sharing the same chirality and the same axis.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0180">An &#x201c;sp<sup>2 </sup>helix&#x201d; is defined herein as a type of helical, one-dimensional chain constructed from only sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized atomic members. The axis of an sp<sup>x </sup>helix is z-oriented.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0181">An &#x201c;sp<sup>2 </sup>double helix&#x201d; is defined herein as the structure formed by two sp<sup>2 </sup>helices sharing the same chirality and the same axis.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0182">&#x201c;Adjacent rings&#x201d; herein describes two rings that have at least two common atomic members, and thus share at least one common side. In organic chemistry these rings might comprise fused or bridged rings, but not spirocyclic rings. Two adjacent rings may be described as &#x201c;ring-adjacent.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0167" num="0183">&#x201c;Ring-connected&#x201d; herein describes a structure that is connected via a &#x201c;ring pathway,&#x201d; or path of adjacent rings. We may speak of ring-connectedness according to two usages. In the first usage, we may say that one part of a structure is ring-connected to some other part of the structure. This means that there is a ring pathway that connects the two referenced parts. For example, a ring R<sub>1 </sub>within a graphenic structure is ring-connected to another ring R<sub>2 </sub>within the structure if there exists a path of adjacent rings starting at R<sub>1 </sub>and ending at R<sub>2</sub>. In the second usage, we may say that a referenced structure is itself ring-connected. This means that any part of the referenced structure can be reached from any other part via at least one ring pathway. We may also describe structures that are not ring-connected as ring-disconnected.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0184">A &#x201c;ring pathway&#x201d; herein describes a pathway of adjacent rings that connects two referenced structures.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0185">A &#x201c;ring connection&#x201d; herein describes a single ring that ring-connects two referenced structures.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0186">&#x201c;Sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected&#x201d; herein describes a structure that is connected via an &#x201c;sp<sup>2 </sup>ring pathway,&#x201d; or pathway of adjacent sp<sup>2 </sup>rings. Like ring-connectedness, we may speak of sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connectedness according to two usages. In the first usage, we may say that one part of a structure is sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected to some other part of the structure. This means that there is an sp<sup>2 </sup>ring pathway that connects the two referenced parts. In the second usage, we may say that a referenced structure is itself sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected.

Surface Replication</heading><p id="p-0227" num="0252">Pyrolysis involves the decomposition of a gas, liquid, or solid carbonaceous material and may be used to form graphenic structures. In some pyrolysis procedures, this decomposition occurs over a substrate surface. The substrate may comprise the simple, flat surface of a foil or the more complex surfaces of particles. The graphenic systems synthesized on particles may inherit some of the particles' morphological attributes. In the '918 and '760 applications, we define a number of terms related to template-directed synthesis. These terms are defined below.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0253">A &#x201c;template,&#x201d; as defined herein, is a potentially sacrificial structure that imparts a desired morphology to another material formed in or on it. Of relevance for surface replication techniques are the template's surface (i.e. the &#x201c;templating surface&#x201d;), which is positively replicated, and its bulk phase (i.e. the &#x201c;templating bulk&#x201d;), which is negatively replicated. The template may also perform other roles, such as catalyzing the formation of the perimorphic material. A &#x201c;templated&#x201d; structure is one that replicates some feature of the template.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0254">A &#x201c;perimorph&#x201d; or &#x201c;perimorphic&#x201d; material is a material formed in or on a solid-state or &#x201c;hard&#x201d; template material.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0255">&#x201c;Surface replication,&#x201d; as defined herein, comprises a templating technique in which a template's surface is used to direct the formation of a thin, perimorphic wall of adsorbed material, the wall substantially encapsulating and replicating the templating surface upon which it is formed. Subsequently, upon being displaced, the templating bulk is replicated, in negative, by an endocellular space within the perimorphic wall. Surface replication creates a perimorphic framework with a templated pore-and-wall architecture.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0256">A &#x201c;perimorphic framework&#x201d; (or &#x201c;framework&#x201d;), as defined herein, is the nanostructured perimorph formed during surface replication.

In particular, magnesium oxide (MgO) templates are often employed in chemical vapor deposition (&#x201c;CVD&#x201d;) processes due to their stability at high temperatures. Many of these templates are described in the '918 application and the '154 application. All that is required for many surface replication procedures involving CVD is a surface and the nucleation of a lattice that can be grown via autocatalysis or as a free radical condensate.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">III. Free Radical Condensate Growth &#x26; Tectonics</heading><p id="p-0235" num="0260">In the free radical condensate theory of growth, a free radical condensate (i.e. &#x201c;condensate&#x201d; or &#x201c;FRC&#x201d;) is formed during pyrolytic decomposition of a reactive vapor. A carbon FRC is a charged, hydrogenated precursor to the graphenic structure that can rapidly rearrange its carbon skeleton without breaking covalent bonds; hence it can be envisioned as a kind of charged, covalent liquid. A carbon FRC grows in the presence of a reactive vapor via radical addition reactions at its edges. As the condensate releases molecular hydrogen, its concentration of radicals diminishes, its self-rearrangement ceases, and it becomes an uncharged carbon structure. A gradual release of molecular hydrogen provides the FRC more time to rearrange itself into an energy-minimizing configuration&#x2014;typically one that eliminates high-energy edge defects. This has been shown to promote edgeless graphenic structures like fullerenes. A sudden loss of hydrogen, by contrast, does not provide sufficient time for these energy-minimizing rearrangements to occur, which promotes the formation of graphenic structures with more edges.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0261">If grown over a common substrate surface, graphenic structures may come into lateral contact with one another. These tectonic encounters, and the underlying factors that determine how they are resolved, have been the subject of scant research. In one case we have found, researchers observing the growth of ring-ordered, crystalline graphenic structures on copper foil found that a tectonic encounter (as illustrated by the two graphenic structures approaching each other over a common substrate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) could be resolved in one of two ways.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0262">In the first scenario, the edge of one of the graphenic structures is subducted by the edge of the other&#x2014;an event described herein as a &#x201c;subduction event.&#x201d; A subduction event allows continued growth of the subducting region over the subducted region, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. The subducting region's continued growth is indicated by the black arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, whereas the subducted region's growth is quenched due to its position between the substrate (hatched in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) and the subducting region. This quenching is indicated by the black &#x201c;x&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. A subduction event forms an edge dislocation comprising two overlapping, z-adjacent graphenic structures weakly cohered via van der Waals interactions.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0263">In the second scenario described by the researchers, the edge of one of the graphenic structures may graft to the edge of the other via sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bond formation between the opposing edge atoms. This sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting causes the two graphenic structures to coalesce to form a larger graphenic structure. The outcome of this event is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>. The researchers showed that sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting between laterally or rotationally misaligned edges may result in the formation of non-hexagonal rings in the new graphenic structure. It follows that the regional presence of these non-hexagonal rings within the sp<sup>2</sup>-grafted domain may induce local lattice curvature, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>. The underlying substrate is hatched in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0264">The complexity of tectonics between graphenic structures is increased when the substrate surface becomes more topologically and topographically complex. It is further increased if we postulate edge disorder. We surmise herein that these factors are important in determining the outcomes of tectonic encounters. Lastly, it is increased if the tectonics occur in a substantially unconfined space, where steric effects of surrounding structures can be ignored. This may not be the case when pyrolysis occurs in certain microporous template particles, like Zeolite Y, where sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting between graphenic structures (as opposed to subduction) may be forced due to the z-directional confinement in these templates' micropores&#x2014;i.e. a lack of overhead clearance.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">IV. Surfaces in Three Dimensions</heading><p id="p-0240" num="0265">To describe the local space around curved, two-dimensional graphenic structures, it is helpful to establish an intuitive orientation.

Consistent with this, a z-axis normal to this xy-plane is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. While the orientations of the tangent plane and z-axis will vary across a curved surface, we find it helpful to describe the local space generally above or below a graphenic region as the &#x201c;z-space,&#x201d; and to describe the direction of the local z-space as &#x201c;vertical.&#x201d; We also find it helpful to describe the direction perpendicular to the local z-axis as &#x201c;lateral.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0241" num="0266">An example of a ring-disordered graphenic domain with nonzero curvature is modeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.

The resulting domain is rotated as indicated by the black arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in order to facilitate visualization from different perspectives. One segment of its edge is hatched for orientation.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0267">From the vertical perspective in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the ring disorder can be observed. The domain incorporates a randomized tiling of 5-member, 6-member, and 7-member rings. From the diagonal perspectives, regions possessing positive or negative curvature can be observed. From the horizontal perspective, we can trace the hatched edge, which provides a sense of the z-directional lattice deflections (i.e. &#x201c;z-deflections&#x201d;) created by the ring disorder. The domain's z-deflections impart an undulating shape to the edge, which z-deflects alongside the local lattice. As ring disorder increases, the amplitude and frequency of the edge's z-deflections may increase.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">V.

Hence, R<sub>A </sub>meets the definition of a ring.

Since all of the remaining 38 atoms of the graphenic structure belong to a ring and are incompletely surrounded by rings, they are all edge atoms. Starting from any given edge atom, we trace a chain of nearest neighbors such that any two nearest neighbors within the chain are both edge atoms and co-members of exactly one ring. This results in a traced edge. Following this tracing rule, we find that we cannot perform a trace that includes all of the 38 edge atoms in the graphenic structure. So, once an edge has been traced, we select any edge atom that remains unassigned to an edge and trace a new edge, and this process is continued until all edge atoms have been assigned to an edge.

Two main spectral features are typically associated with optical excitation of sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon: the G band (typically exhibiting a peak intensity value at approximately 1580 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 1585 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in graphitic sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon), and the D band (exhibiting a peak intensity value at approximately 1350 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>under optical excitation). The &#x201c;2D&#x201d; band representing a second order of the D band is also observed in some graphitic carbons, and its peak intensity value is typically located at approximately 2700 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The G band is assigned to the vibrations of sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds. The D band is assigned to the radial breathing mode of sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in rings, and for Raman observation this requires back-scattering of electrons at a defect site.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0287">Researchers have described an amorphization trajectory in the spectra of graphitic carbon showing a progression in disorder from graphite to amorphous carbon that is helpful to understand the dynamics of the D band. In graphite, no D peak is present due to the absence of activating defects. In carbons comprising smaller graphenic domains, the density of edge states is increased, and as edge states increase the D peak is activated by backscattering at the edge defects. The D peak intensity increases toward a maximum, corresponding to a nanocrystalline graphite. Further amorphization in the form of ring disorder diminishes the intensity of the D peak. Lastly, the D peak disappears as further amorphization eliminates a polycyclic, sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized structure altogether.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0288">The Raman spectral peaks associated with sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized carbon include a peak at 1306 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(associated with hexagonal diamond), a peak at 1325 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(associated with hexagonal diamond) and a peak at 1332 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(associated with cubic diamond). Cubic diamond comprises 100% chair conformations, whereas hexagonal diamond comprises both chair conformations and boat conformations, giving it a lower Raman frequency and lower thermodynamic stability.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0289">Raman-active phonons are known to be strain-dependent. Because the presence of strain within a lattice causes the lattice's vibrational frequencies to shift, Raman spectroscopy can be utilized to understand the strain states within a lattice. However, strain can also shift spectral peaks from their normally identified positions to new positions, making identification more ambiguous. The primary indicator of strain in a ring-ordered graphene structure is the position of the G peak and 2D peak, both of which are sensitive to tension and compression. The G peak has been shown to shift to lower frequencies (i.e. a &#x201c;red-shift&#x201d;) when the sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds are stretched and to higher frequencies (i.e. a &#x201c;blue-shift&#x201d;) when they are compressed. In graphenic structures with non-uniform strain fields, multiple modes of the G band may be present.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0290">In disordered carbons, several Raman spectral features have been observed in addition to the D peak. A broad Raman peak (sometimes referred to as D&#x2033;) often fitted between 1500 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1550 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in amorphous sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbons is generally observed to increase with ring disorder. It is herein attributed to low-correlation, red-shifted modes of the G band associated with stretched, weakened sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds, which proliferate as ring disorder and lattice distortion increase in sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized graphenic structures. Ferrari &#x26; Robertson have shown that the G peak red-shifts into this range in Stage II of the amorphization trajectory. In graphene oxide, this red-shifted mode of the G peak may be found alongside the normal G peak, indicating the presence of weaker sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds alongside normal sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds within the lattice. This is in good agreement with the customary interpretation of graphene oxide as a non-uniform lattice with both ring-disordered and ring-ordered regions.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0291">Another feature (referred to as the D&#x2032; peak) observed in disordered carbons is fitted at 1620 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, where it may appear as a shoulder on the G peak. This feature is often observed to accompany the D peak in sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbons with a high density of edge states, and its intensity relative to the D peak has been shown to increase in proximity to lattice edges.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0292">Another feature observed in disordered carbons, sometimes referred to as the D* peak, is a broad band fitted between 1100 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. A peak intensity value at 1175 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>within this range has been attributed to the sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds formed between sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms at the transitions between sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>networks found within soot. It has also been attributed to hexagonal diamond. The assignment of this peak to sp<sup>3 </sup>carbon in nanodiamond and diamondlike materials by some researchers has been disputed by Ferrari &#x26; Robertson, who provided evidence that it should be assigned, along with a broad peak at &#x2dc;1240 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, to trans-polyacetylene, a protonated aliphatic sp<sup>2 </sup>chain arguably present in those carbons.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0293">In the present disclosure, Raman spectral analysis may involve reference to unfitted or fitted spectral features. &#x201c;Unfitted&#x201d; spectral features pertain to spectral features apparent prior to deconvolution via profile-fitting software. Unfitted features may therefore represent a convolution of multiple underlying features, but their positions are not subjective. &#x201c;Fitted&#x201d; spectral features pertain to the spectral features assigned by profile-fitting software. Imperfect profile fitting indicates the potential presence of other underlying features that have not been deconvoluted.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0294">For clarity, features pertaining to the unfitted Raman profile are labeled with a subscript &#x201c;u&#x201d;&#x2014;e.g. the &#x201c;G<sub>u</sub>&#x201d; band.

These fitted features are labeled with an &#x201c;f&#x201d;&#x2014;e.g. the &#x201c;D<sub>f</sub>&#x201d; band. The software's Gaussian-Lorentzian lineshape setting was used by default, allowing a fitted band to adopt a Gaussian and Lorentzian character, with the fractional Gaussian character being determined by the software in order to optimize the fit. Other profile-fitting methods may change the locations, intensities, and trends of fitted peaks.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0295">An additional unfitted feature defined within the present disclosure is the trough (&#x201c;Tr&#x201d;), a region of lower Raman intensity values located between the D<sub>u </sub>and G<sub>u </sub>bands in the overall spectral profile. The Tr<sub>u </sub>intensity is defined as the minimum intensity value occurring between the D<sub>u </sub>peak and the G<sub>u </sub>peak. The trough intensity value indicates underlying spectral dynamics such as red-shifting of the G band corresponding to ring disorder and lattice distortion and can be analyzed without resorting to subjective profile-fitting judgments, making it a practically useful feature.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0296">Averaged Raman spectra, where utilized herein, represent the average of multipoint spectral measurements made of the sample over a rectangular grid.

The carbon powder made via this procedure is herein referred to as &#x201c;Sample G1.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0358" num="0371">Procedures&#x2014;Study H</p><p id="p-0359" num="0372">Procedure H: An aqueous Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>solution may be produced by mixing 16 kg deionized water and 1.39 kg of a commercial-grade MgO powder (Versamag) in a pressure vessel equipped with an overhead stirring system and gas-inducing impeller. The mixture may be mixed at 700 RPM and cooled to 5&#xb0; C. while being fed CO<sub>2 </sub>gas up to 850 psi for 2 hours. The resulting solution may be withdrawn from the pressure vessel at atmospheric pressure and fed at a rate of 56 mL/min into a BETE XA air atomizing nozzle comprising an FC7 Fluid Cap and AC1802 Air Cap. Compressed air for droplet atomization may be delivered into the nozzle at a flow rate of 5 SCFH air at 54 psi. The inlet temperature of the spray dryer may be set to 200&#xb0; C., producing an outlet temperature ranging between 108&#xb0; C. and 109&#xb0; C. The ambient conditions during the spray drying process may be 28.4&#xb0; C. and 48% RH. Approximately 1400 mL of solution may be sprayed, and 208 g of spray-dried, hydrous magnesium carbonate (Mg(CO<sub>3</sub>).xH<sub>2</sub>O) template precursor powder with a hollow-spherical morphology may be collected via a cyclonic separator.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0373">Next, the template precursor powder may be converted into a template via thermal treatment using a muffle furnace (Vulcan 3-550 Model, 1440 W max). Approximately 10 g of the template precursor powder may be placed in ceramic boats and heated to 580&#xb0; C., then held at this temperature for 13.5 hours, followed by heating to 1050&#xb0; C. and holding for another 1 hour to yield approximately 3.9 g of MgO powder. The heating ramp rates for both steps may be 5&#xb0; C./min and the cool-down was allowed to happen naturally overnight over 8 hours. Approximately 0.47 g of the MgO powder may be pelletized in a 15.7 mm ID hydraulic press by applying 7.8 ksi of uniaxial compression for 1 minute. The resulting disc-shaped template may have a diameter of 15.7 mm and thickness of 2.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0374">Next, a Thermcraft tube furnace with a 60 mm OD quartz tube may be employed in a template-directed CVD procedure. The furnace may be kept level (i.e. not tilted), with the 0.47 g pelletized template sample being placed in a ceramic boat in the heating zone prior to initiating the procedure. Ceramic blocks may be inserted outside each side of the furnace's heating zone, and glass wool may be used to fix the position of the ceramic blocks. The tube may be fitted with two stainless steel flanges. Gas may be flowed in through a gas inlet on one flange and out through a gas outlet in the other flange. After initiating a 815 sccm flow of CO<sub>2 </sub>gas, the furnace may be heated from room temperature to a temperature setting of 540&#xb0; C. at a ramp-rate of 20&#xb0; C./min and held at this condition for 5 minutes. Next, a 144 seem flow of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>gas may be initiated while maintaining CO<sub>2 </sub>flow, and this condition may be held for 90 minutes. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>flow may then be discontinued, and the furnace allowed to cool to room temperature under sustained CO<sub>2 </sub>flow. During cooling, the clam-shell furnace lid may be opened completely, exposing the quartz tube to the outside air. A perimorphic composite pellet obtained after cooling may be characterized. Finally, the same CVD growth procedure may be repeated twice more, with the pellet being again cooled, for a total of 3 CVD growth steps with the pellet being allowed to cool between each step. The resulting perimorphic composite pellet comprises a macroscopic, perimorphic carbon that may be tested for ambient superconductivity.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0375">A vacuum chamber like the one associated with the Cober-Muegge microwave system utilized in Study G (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>) may be utilized, but without any microwave irradiation. The vacuum chamber may be equipped with a 4-point probe (Lucas/SignatoneSP4-40045TFJ) for measuring sheet resistance without lead and contact resistance. The probe specifications may be 40 mil spacing between the Tungsten Carbide tips, a 5 mil tip radius, and a 45 gram spring pressure. The 4-point probe may be placed inside the vacuum chamber and wired to a Keithley Series 2400 Sourcemeter located outside the vacuum chamber. The Keithley Sourcemeter may be set to 4 wire mode with the auto-ohms method selected and operates as a conventional constant-current source ohmmeter with a starting current of 10 mA. The auto-range function was selected and the current stepped up to 100 mA if the measured resistance dropped below 20 Ohms/sq. The chamber pressure may be measured concurrently with the sheet resistance of the sample using a convection-enhanced Pirani vacuum gauge module (CVM201 Super Bee) capable of reading down to 0.1 mTorr with an accuracy of 0.1 mTorr resolution and a repeatability of 2% of the reading. Lastly, the chamber may be equipped with a vacuum pump. This setup should enable the vacuum chamber to be pumped down while the chamber pressure and sheet resistance are read concurrently.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0376">The points of the 4-point probe may be placed into static contact with the flat surface of the macroform as lightly and delicately as possible to obtain a steady, continuous sheet resistance reading. This delicate placement should be done to avoid compressing the macroform surface with the probe tips, which may be necessary due to the apparent pressure-sensitivity of the sp<sup>x </sup>macroforms we tested. We theorize that this pressure-sensitivity is attributable to localized mechanical compression reducing the interlayer distance and thereby inducing interlayer electronic coupling near the voltage-sensing points of contact. Additionally, a soft, non-conductive backing underneath the carbon macroform may be utilized in order to minimize local compression. To make contact, the Sourcemeter may be turned on to get an initial reading at ambient conditions, and the chamber may then be closed and evacuated. During the evacuation of the chamber, readings of the chamber pressure and the sample's sheet resistance may be noted.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">VIII. Study A&#x2014;Analysis</heading><p id="p-0364" num="0377">SEM images of Sample A1 confirms the presence of perimorphic frameworks. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an SEM micrograph of Sample A1 after removal of the endomorphic phase of the perimorphic composite powder. It is unclear if there is one or more distinct perimorphic frameworks in this SEM micrograph. The morphology appears to consist of conjoined, macroporous subunits. This mirrors the template, which was a partially sintered powder. Unlike the frameworks that will be studied in Sample A2, which appeared fragmented and deformed (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>) after liquid-phase processing and evaporative drying, the frameworks in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> appear largely intact and mostly unaffected by the processing and drying. This shows that the perimorphic walls in Sample A1 were better able to withstand the stresses encountered during processing.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0378">To achieve better transparency, and to study the smaller-scale structure of the perimorphic wall in Sample A1, TEM analysis was also performed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> is a TEM micrograph in which we can observe a typical framework against the background grid of lacy carbon (this grid is used to support TEM samples and is not the carbon of interest). The framework in this micrograph appears to comprise at least 9 macroporous subunits, which are numbered in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. The cavities match the morphology of the displaced endomorph (not imaged) in both size and shape. No signs of buckling or wrinkling are present within the wall.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0379">Closer examination of the perimorphic wall is possible in a higher-magnification view, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>. This image shows a cross-section of the perimorphic wall and endomorphic cavity. Some walls observed in Sample A1 were consistently as thick as &#x2dc;12 nm (or &#x2dc;30-35 layers), indicating that the growth of graphenic structures was not terminated by occlusion of the catalytic template surface, but rather by cessation of CVD. This is evidence of the contribution of an autocatalyzed growth mechanism, without which we could not expect so many layers, no matter how long CVD might be continued. N<sub>2 </sub>gas adsorption was performed to obtain the BET surface area of 142 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and BJH porosity of 0.35 cm<sup>3</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This BJH porosity value was undoubtedly less than the real specific porosity given the inability to measure larger macropores using the N<sub>2 </sub>adsorption method.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0380">In the highest magnification view, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>, the perimorphic wall's layered structure can be discerned. It comprises a multilayer stack of overlapping, z-adjacent graphenic regions, which are evidenced by the alternating dark and bright fringes. Each fringe line either represents a two-dimensional graphenic region or the z-interval between two z-adjacent regions.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0381">Care must be taken during HRTEM analysis that the fringe lines corresponding to the actual positions of the graphenic layers are not confused with the fringe lines corresponding to the z-intervals between these layers. Depending on the defocus value, the fringes associated with the actual atomic positions may be either dark or bright. Whichever color they are, the lines associated with the z-intervals will be the opposite color. In the literature, we can find examples of either dark or bright fringes being associated with graphenic layers. In order to make a confident assignment of the exact atomic positions in HRTEM images, it helps to have corroborating information about the actual molecular structure.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0382">The presence of fringe lines indicates that this section of the perimorphic wall in Sample A1 comprises a stacked arrangement of z-adjacent graphenic regions. In the main frame of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>, a few dark fringe lines are traced. While z-adjacent fringe lines appear to be generally xy-aligned over distances up to several nanometers, the fringe lines are not parallel throughout the entire perimorphic wall. Due to the local xy-alignment of z-adjacent graphenic regions, however, the wall in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> exhibits nematic alignment. The layers in all sections of the wall that were imaged exhibited nematic alignment.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0383">An xy-alignment between z-adjacent graphenic regions allows smaller z-intervals and higher-density arrangements, which should in turn increase interlayer coupling and vdW cohesion. We consider this a desirable feature of a layered graphenic system as opposed to the lower-density, nonlayered network architecture exhibited by schwarzite. If density reduction is desired, this can be accomplished by introducing larger-scale modes of porosity (such as the macropores in Sample A1), while preserving a high-density layered organization at smaller scales.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0384">Another helpful example of nematic alignment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, which is an HRTEM image of a perimorphic wall with nematically aligned layers (from a different sample). We include this example here because the fringe lines were clearer in the HRTEM images taken of this sample. Different sections of the wall are highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. In each highlighted region, the fringe pattern exhibits a nematic alignment with that section of the wall. This likely arises from the conformal growth of the graphenic structures over the templating surface and then over each other.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0385">While the layers throughout Sample A1 are nematically aligned, it is visually difficult to trace dark fringe lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> for more than a few nanometers. An exemplary portion of the perimorphic wall is magnified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>'s inset. While the diffraction contrast and focus of this image are not sharp, the fringe lines can be discerned and traced. The dark fringe lines from the HRTEM micrograph are traced with black lines. The bright fringe lines from the HRTEM micrograph are traced with solid white lines.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0386">In addition to the z-intervals between the white line segments in the magnified inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>, there appear to be lateral discontinuities separating them. This pattern could be observed throughout the HRTEM images of Sample A1. If the black tracing within the magnified inset represented the location of the graphenic regions, then each lateral discontinuity in the black tracing would indicate an edge. If this interpretation were correct (we shall demonstrate that it is not), the ubiquitousness of this fringe pattern throughout the perimorphic wall would suggest that the wall comprises a vdW assembly of small graphenic domains-no larger than 3 nm on average, perhaps, since these lateral discontinuities were frequent. Additionally, if this interpretation were correct, we would have to conclude that the graphenic edges of z-adjacent layers were aligned. This might be explained if the edges were caused by a fracture; however, this possible explanation is implausible based on the ubiquitousness of the fringe pattern throughout the wall.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0387">The alternative (and correct) explanation is that the bright fringes (corresponding to the white tracing in the magnified inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>) represent the actual atomic positions. The solid white lines in the center of the inset form a distinct, horizontal &#x201c;Y&#x201d; shape, as labeled by the horizontal Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>. This bright Y indicates that the bilayer on the branched side of the Y and the graphenic monolayer on the stem side of the Y were just different regions of the same ring-connected graphenic structure. Additionally, in this scenario, the bright fringes traced with the dashed white line, while lower in diffraction contrast than the fringes traced with the solid white line, also indicate some presence of atoms. Together, these solid and dashed white tracings indicate ring-connectedness throughout the magnified region&#x2014;the opposite of the disconnectedness that would be indicated by the black tracings.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0388">This observation has a precedent in the anthracite literature. HRTEM fringes of anthracite have been analyzed by researchers to generate a model of anthracite's structural dislocations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref> are borrowed from this HRTEM analysis. Each figure contains a model representing a structural dislocation found in anthracite and, below the model, the simulated HRTEM fringe pattern associated with it. These simulated fringe patterns are consistent with the actual fringe patterns observed in anthracite, validating the dislocation models. In each simulated fringe pattern, the bright fringe lines represent the graphenic regions, and the dark fringe lines represent the space between layers.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0389"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> is an illustration, drawn from the anthracite literature, of an edge dislocation, wherein a graphenic region is trapped between two z-adjacent regions&#x2014;one above and one below. The edge of the trapped region represents the local terminus of some graphenic structure, and its members may comprise sp<sup>2 </sup>radicals. In a van der Waals assembly formed primarily by subduction events (typical of carbons formed by template-directed CVD), the edge of a subducted region&#x2014;and the z-adjacent regions between which it is trapped-together comprise an edge dislocation. The simulated HRTEM fringe pattern formed by an edge dislocation is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>. The pattern is characterized by a bright fringe line, representing the position of the trapped region, terminating between a dark, Y-shaped fringe line, which represents the interlayer spacing.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0390"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> is an illustration, drawn from the anthracite literature, of a Y-dislocation, which can be thought of as the horizontal Y-shaped structure that would be formed if the edge atoms of the trapped graphenic region in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> were bonded covalently to one of the z-adjacent regions. The geological conversion of an edge dislocation (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>) into a Y-dislocation (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>) reduces the dislocation energy. This would occur via a radical addition reaction that results in a line of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms at the junction between the three layers in the Y-dislocation. It has been suggested by researchers that anthracite's Y-dislocations are evolved in this way.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0391">The simulated HRTEM fringe pattern formed by a Y-dislocation is shown below the dislocation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>. The pattern is the inverse of the simulated pattern in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>&#x2014;i.e. a dark fringe line terminates between a bright, Y-shaped fringe line. The bright, Y-shaped fringe line represents the location of the Y-shaped graphenic structure, a small version of which was illustrated by the molecular model in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>. The simulated fringe pattern looks very similar to the Y-shape traced in the magnified inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0392">Geologically-formed anthracitic networks are a natural demonstration of how structural dislocations can create a three-dimensional graphenic network. Substantially all of the carbon atoms in anthracite are members of the graphenic network resulting from these crosslinking dislocations, with the exception of an occasional CH, CH<sub>2 </sub>or CH<sub>3 </sub>group (which solid state C NMR has indicated are present only in very small quantities) attached to a ring. It is this crosslinking of the graphenic network that lends anthracite its hardness and that prevents its exfoliation or solubilization. NMR spectroscopy has been used to show that dodecylation of anthracite only affects the edge atoms of this singleton, wherein &#x201c;the graphenic layers appear to merge.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0380" num="0393">Returning to the fringe pattern shown in the magnified inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>, we can conclude that this pattern is associated with crosslinking dislocations. The solid white tracing indicates a Y-dislocation. The lower-contrast fringes traced by the dashed white lines likely indicate Y-dislocations that are less in focus or more disordered. The segments traced by black lines represent the spaces between graphenic layers. Since Y-dislocations are constructed from a diamondlike seam that preserves lateral and vertical ring-connectedness, we can conclude that the magnified inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> represents a ring-connected region within the perimorphic wall. Furthermore, the ubiquitous occurrence of Y-dislocations like this throughout the wall indicates that the perimorphic frameworks in Sample A1 comprise anthracitic networks.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0394">The case for this is further reinforced by our comparative analysis of Samples A2 and A3. Namely, if the perimorphic frameworks in Sample A1 comprised vdW assemblies, the conspicuously superior robustness of Sample A1's less crystalline particles vs. Sample A2's more crystalline particles (their relative crystallinity being ascertained by HRTEM, Raman, and XRD analysis) would conflict with findings reported in the literature. Researchers have shown that vdW assemblies of small graphenic domains are more fragile&#x2014;not more robust&#x2014;than vdW assemblies of larger, more crystalline domains. For example, &#x201c;amorphous graphene nanocages&#x201d; that possess a similar morphology to the particles in Sample A1 and comprise assemblies of small, overlapping graphenic domains (often smaller than 10 nm), are easily broken and deformed. Their fragility is explained by the weakness of the vdW interactions between these assemblies' small graphenic domains, which are easily sheared apart. Researchers' side-by-side comparison of amorphous graphene nanocages with more crystalline graphene nanocages constructed from larger domains have demonstrated the superior cohesion of the latter. However, what we actually see is a dramatic improvement in mechanical robustness in every particle throughout Sample A1 compared to the more fragile, nanocrystalline particles found in Sample A2.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0395">Based on this, we can state that the perimorphic framework in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> comprises an anthracitic network of approximately 18.5 layers, on average (a figure arrived at by dividing the theoretical specific surface area of graphene, 2630 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, by the BET surface area of Sample A1, which was 142 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The observable portion of the anthracitic network in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> comprises 9 spheroidal, macroporous subunits. In total, this represents a graphenic network with a significant amount of lattice area in vdW contact. A conservative estimate of this area is 48 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, which is arrived at based on the following. First, for this estimate, we ignore the 8<sup>th </sup>and 9<sup>th </sup>subunits that are only partially observable in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. The average radius of the remaining subunits, while difficult to calculate exactly, is definitely larger than 200 nm (for reference, spheroid #4 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> has a radius of approximately 200 nm, as indicated by the dotted black line), but we use this radius for our conservative estimate. The theoretical surface area of 7 spheres with a radius of 200 nm would be approximately 3.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>nm<sup>2 </sup>(i.e. 7&#xd7;4&#x3c0;r<sup>2</sup>, where r=200 nm). We note that this would be reduced if the spheres were conjoined, as they are in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, so we reduce our theoretical surface area by 25%, resulting in a value of 2.6&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>nm<sup>2</sup>. Lastly, based on the estimated average wall thickness at 18.5 layers, we might estimate the total lattice area throughout the wall as approximately 4.8&#xd7;107 nm<sup>2 </sup>(i.e. 18.5 layers&#xd7;2.64&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>nm<sup>2</sup>), or 48 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0396">Since all of this networked lattice area is organized in nematically aligned layers, substantially all of this lattice area is subject to interlayer vdW interactions. For the same reason that crystalline graphene nanocages constructed from large-area domains exhibit better vdW cohesion relative to amorphous graphene nanocages constructed from small-area domains, we can infer that as we construct progressively larger anthracitic networks, we can begin to derive a considerable vdW contribution to system cohesion. This is one of the reasons that we find the anthracitic networks more appealing than schwarzite-like graphenic networks ((illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) like those synthesized on zeolite templates. Shorter, more consistent z-intervals and better vdW cohesion may be obtained with a denser, layered architecture. The increased local density incurred may then be offset by introducing larger-scale modes of porosity, such as the templated pores in perimorphic frameworks.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0397">More information about the bonding within the frameworks in Sample A1 can be derived from the sample's Raman spectrum. A single-point Raman spectrum, taken using a 532 nm laser at 2 mW power, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. No smoothing has been performed. For reference, the full spectrum is shown in the inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The D<sub>u </sub>band appears centered between 1345 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1350 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which is typical for 532 nm (&#x2dc;2.33 eV) excitation. On this basis, The G<sub>u </sub>band is centered between 1590 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1595 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, compared to the usual 1585 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, indicating the presence of some compressive strain in the sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds. Additionally, there is a high Tr<sub>u </sub>peak between the D<sub>u </sub>and G<sub>u </sub>bands, corresponding to an I<sub>Tr</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>peak intensity ratio of approximately 0.50 and indicating the possible presence of an underlying peak to be examined via profile fitting. The I<sub>D</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>peak intensity ratio is less than 1.0.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0398">Another unfitted peak that is apparent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> appears as a weak shoulder on the D<sub>u </sub>band located between 1100 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This feature's position coincides with the D* peak found in the 1150 to 1200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>region. Researchers in the field have attributed this peak to sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds at the transitions between sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>regions in soot-like carbons. Such an assignment is therefore in good agreement with the sp<sup>x </sup>rings from which the diamondlike seams are constructed.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0399">In order to elucidate the underlying features of the Raman profile in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the OMNIC Peak Resolve software was used. Initially, the software was restricted to the use of only two peaks. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows the two fitted peaks, the fitted profile, the actual profile, and the residual representing the difference between the fitted profile and the actual profile. The residual at the bottom of the chart indicates the ranges where the fitted profile deviates from the actual profile, and the magnitude of the deviations. A flat residual (taking into account that the noise in the unsmoothed actual will also be reflected in the residual) is indicative that the fitted profile is good and coincides with the actual profile. For only two peaks, the fitted profile is still poor, with large residuals occurring between approximately 1150 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1650 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Of note are the especially poor fits at the peaks, in the trough region, and at the shoulder around 1150 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0400">Next, the OMNIC Peak Resolve software was allowed a third peak, which was manually placed at a starting position of 1500 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>prior to re-running the profile-fitting routine. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows the three fitted peaks, the fitted profile, the actual profile, and the residual representing the difference between the fitted profile and the actual profile. This fitted profile, which incorporates a broad fitted peak at 1566 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, appears significantly better than the fit obtained with only two fitted peaks. However, a significant residual is still present between 1150 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0401">Next, the OMNIC Peak Resolve software was allowed a fourth peak, which was manually placed at a starting position of 1150 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>prior to re-running the fitting routine. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows the four fitted peaks (labeled f-1 through f-4). This fitted profile, which further incorporates a broad fitted peak at 1185 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, appears significantly better than the fitted profiles obtained with either two or three fitted peaks. The f-1 peak at 1185 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>reduces the residual associated with the shoulder feature in this range. With these 4 fitted peaks, a satisfactory fitted profile is obtained.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0402">Analysis of the four fitted bands indicate a split in the G band (usually found at approximately 1585 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in unstrained sp<sup>2 </sup>lattices) into the f-4 peak at 1596 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and abroad f-3 peak at 1514 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The f-4 band represents a blue-shifted mode of the G band. The increased frequency of these blue-shifted phonons is caused by compressive strain in some sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds. The much broader f-3 peak at 1514 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>coincides with the D&#x2033; peak found in graphene oxide and represents a red-shifted mode of the G band. The lower frequency of these red-shifted phonons is caused by the stretching and weakening of sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds in ring-disordered regions, as described by Ferrari &#x26; Robertson. In addition to inducing tensile strain, the ring disorder of these regions disallows a uniform strain field, which broadens the f-3 band. From the split of the G band into the f-3 and f-4 peaks, we can therefore discern the presence of certain regions of compressed sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds, and certain ring-disordered regions of stretched sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0403">A blue-shifted band like f-4 is not observed in graphene oxide, in which the G peak, in addition to its normal mode at 1585 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, is also present in the red-shifted mode (called the D&#x2033; peak and characterized herein by the trough height). This, in conjunction with Sample A1's lack of oxygen moieties (evidenced by the near-zero rate of mass loss below 400C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>) and the layered architecture of its graphenic systems, establishes that its Raman spectrum arises from a different structure than graphene oxide.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0404">The f-2 peak in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> represents a slightly red-shifted D<sub>f </sub>peak located at 1343 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. While the D band of sp<sup>2 </sup>carbons is dispersive, and the D peak position can change based on excitation, 1343 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>is somewhat lower than the D peak position typically associated with sp<sup>2 </sup>carbon under 532 nm excitation (around 1350 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). This red-shifting indicates some underlying interpolation of the sp<sup>2 </sup>vibrational density of states (VDOS) with lower-frequency bands found in the sp<sup>3 </sup>VDOS.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0405">Interpolation of the VDOS in an alloy structure occurs when there is strong coupling between the phases. Interpolation between the D band (associated with sp<sup>2 </sup>hybridization) and lower-frequency bands indicates the strong coupling of sp<sup>3 </sup>states and sp<sup>2 </sup>states in their immediate proximity. These regions of strong coupling activate the radial breathing mode (&#x201c;RBM&#x201d;) phonons found throughout the graphenic system's entire sp<sup>2 </sup>ring structure. Hence, even a trace-level presence of sp<sup>3 </sup>carbon states can be discerned in the Raman spectrum due to their activation of RBM phonons that are found throughout the much larger sp<sup>2 </sup>component. In other words, RBM phonons in grafted singletons are activated by backscattering from the sp<sup>3 </sup>states in sp<sup>x </sup>rings, where the sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>phases are strongly coupled, and therefore the D band associated with RBM phonons is interpolated. Conversely, the preponderance of sp<sup>2 </sup>states comprising the sp<sup>2 </sup>layers between diamondlike seams are neither immediately proximal to the sp<sup>3 </sup>states, nor strongly coupled to them, and accordingly the G band, associated with sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>vibrations, is not interpolated. Based on this analysis, the red-shifted position of the f-2 (i.e. the D<sub>f </sub>peak) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> corroborates the observations of ubiquitous Y-dislocations throughout the anthracitic networks comprising Sample A1.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0406">What dictates the degree of D band interpolation is not the fraction of sp<sup>3 </sup>states within the graphenic systems, but instead the fraction of RBM phonons activated by sp<sup>3 </sup>states vs. the fraction of RBM phonons activated by sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states. Even a trace level of sp<sup>3 </sup>states may activate a majority of the RBM phonons if there are even fewer sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states. This may cause the D band to interpolate, and the degree of interpolation may be expected to increase with an increasing prevalence of sp<sup>3 </sup>states and decreasing prevalence of sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states. Of course, the respective prevalence of these two states is negatively correlated, since the sp<sup>x </sup>rings are formed by the conversion of sp<sup>2 </sup>edges states into sp<sup>2 </sup>interior states or sp<sup>3 </sup>states.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0407">Therefore, interpolation of the D band in Sample A1 can be viewed as evidence of the conversion of sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states into sp<sup>3 </sup>states associated with diamondlike seams. The conversion of the sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states into sp<sup>3 </sup>states associated with diamondlike seams also hints at a tectonic mechanism behind the formation of the seams, and this causal mechanism is explored further in connection with Sample A3 and the samples pertaining to Study B.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0408">Outside of the f-2 peak position, another possible indication of the presence of sp<sup>3 </sup>states in the Raman spectrum is the shoulder feature associated with the D<sub>u </sub>peak. This shoulder, which appears between 1100 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, is fitted by the broad f-1 peak in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> and is centered at 1185 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. A broad peak between 1150 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>has been assigned by previous researchers to sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds and would therefore be consistent with the transitions that occur at diamondlike seams. To demonstrate that this feature was not related to trans-PA, we annealed Sample A1 at 1050&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. The fitted Raman spectrum of the sample after annealing is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> for comparison.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0409">The shoulder feature is reduced in intensity and shifted slightly from 1185 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 1180 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>but not eliminated. This shows that it is not trans-PA. However, the annealing has reduced the f-1 peak's area ratio (i.e. the ratio of its area vs. the total area of all 4 fitted peaks) from 0.16 to 0.11. This reduction indicates a reduction of sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonding and likely a reduction of the sp<sup>3 </sup>content. Hence, the f-1 peak may also corroborate the diamondlike seam in Sample A1.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0410">A review of the anthracite literature shows red-shifted D bands in the optical Raman spectra in some grades of natural anthracite-unfitted D peaks can be occasionally found with positions below 1340 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x2014;while in other less mature or more mature grades the D band appears un-interpolated. In the less mature grades, it may be reasoned that this is because diamondlike seams have not yet been geologically formed. In more mature grades (e.g. meta-anthracites), it may be reasoned that diamondlike seams have been formed and subsequently destabilized, eliminating sp<sup>3 </sup>states and evolving screw dislocations.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0411">To our knowledge, the basis for the D peak's occasional red-shift has neither been investigated, nor assigned to the diamondlike seams. In optical Raman, the I<sub>D</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>ratio in anthracite tends to be below 1.0, like Sample A1's. Additionally, anthracite often exhibits a blue-shifted G peak, positioned between 1595 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1605 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, as well as a broad underlying peak that can be fitted between 1500 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 1550 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, consistent with a red-shifted mode of the G peak. Additionally, some grades of anthracite exhibit a shoulder in the range of 1100 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 1200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Therefore, the spectrum of Sample A1, along with its HRTEM fringe patterns, are consistent with a synthetic anthracitic network.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0412">Further characterization of the anthracitic networks in Sample A1 was obtained via XRD analysis.

The area under Peak II is set to a value of 100% for comparison with the other peak areas. Peak II's FWHM value is 5.237&#xb0;, indicating a relatively broad range of interlayer spacings. The d-spacing and FWHM values of Peak II together indicate an interlayer spacing within Sample A1 that is more varied and larger than the interlayer spacing in graphitic carbon.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0414">Peak I has a maximum height at 2&#x3b8;=20.995&#xb0;, equivalent to a d-spacing of 4.23 &#x212b;. Like Peak II, Peak I is also broad, with a FWHM value of 4.865&#xb0;. The area under Peak I is 32% of the area under Peak II, making it a significant phase of interlayer spacing. A d-spacing of 4.23 &#x212b; is too large to be associated with the interlayer phase in graphitic carbon. This peak may reflect the presence of z-adjacent, curved graphenic regions where the curvature is not in phase. Out-of-phase z-deflections disrupt the uniformity of the interlayer spacing and create expanded spaces between the curved regions. This curvature is consistent with anthracitic networks.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0415">Peak III indicates the presence of a phase of smaller interlayer spacing, as well. With a maximum height at 2&#x3b8;=30.4010, equivalent to a d-spacing of 2.93 &#x212b;, the interlayer spacing represented by Peak III is smaller than any interlayer phase in a graphitic carbon. Like Peaks I and II, Peak III is broad, with a FWHM value of 8.304&#xb0;. The area under Peak III is 80% of the area under Peak II, making it a nearly equivalent phase of interlayer spacing. D-spacing values in the range of 2.93 &#x212b; are not found in graphitic carbons, which typically have a &#x3c;002&#x3e; d-spacing value of 3.36 &#x212b; and no other d-spacings larger than graphite's &#x3c;100&#x3e; d-spacing value of 2.13 &#x212b;. Heated compression of glassy carbons causes buckling of sp<sup>2 </sup>regions, sp<sup>2</sup>-to-sp<sup>3 </sup>rehybridization, and the formation of sp<sup>2</sup>/sp<sup>3 </sup>alloys with interlayer spacings between 2.8 &#x212b; and 3 &#x212b;. Sample A1's Peak III, with a d-spacing of 2.93 &#x212b;, is consistent with this, further corroborating the presence of sp<sup>3 </sup>states in Sample A1.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0416">Consistent with Sample A1's blue-shifted mode of the G peak, its XRD profile reflects &#x3c;100&#x3e; compression.

The peak is broad, indicating a broad range of &#x3c;100&#x3e; d-spacing values.

The derivative of the sample's mass loss with respect to temperature is plotted. Sample A1's onset of thermal oxidation occurs between 450C and 500C. This is higher than Sample A3, and approximately the same as Sample A2. This indicates that compared to oxidized carbons like graphene oxide, there is a negligible amount of labile mass in Sample A1. The temperature of peak mass loss, at roughly 608C, is lower than Sample A2's and higher than Sample A3's. Overall, these results are consistent with the temperature at which the CVD was performed; higher-temperature pyrolysis processes will typically create carbons with higher-temperature onset of thermal oxidation and peak mass loss due to increased crystallinity. The only exception in the trend is the early onset of thermal oxidation for Sample A2, which can be attributed to a minor presence of soot that was observed in certain regions of the sample. This soot-like phase was non-conformal to the substrate and presumably formed via gas-phase pyrolysis in free space due to the higher-temperature pyrolysis in Procedure A2. The remainder of Sample A2 exhibits more thermal oxidation stability than other samples, leading to the highest temperature of peak mass loss of all three samples.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0418"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is an SEM image of Sample A2. Analysis of the image reveals the presence of carbon particles that appear to be fragmented perimorphic frameworks. Like Sample A1, the frameworks' templated morphology is apparent, and the perimorphic walls appear to have encapsulated and replicated the templating surface. Unlike Sample A1, however, the frameworks appear broken and deformed in many cases. This loss of their native morphology evidences the perimorphic walls' diminished ability to withstand the mechanical stresses encountered during liquid-phase template extraction and drying. This breakage, in view of the mildness of the extraction procedure, which involved gentle stirring and subsequent drying, suggests that the perimorphic frameworks do not comprise complete anthracitic networks, but instead vdW assemblies that can be easily broken and deformed by shear-related failure.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0419">TEM analysis of Sample A2 corroborates the deformed, fragmented appearance of the frameworks in the SEM imagery. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref> is a TEM image revealing the extent of the damage incurred during template extraction. The appearance is very different compared to the largely intact, undeformed particles observed in Sample A1 (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref>, the perimorphic walls are revealed to be of comparable thickness to the walls of Sample A1. The BET specific surface area of Sample A2 was measured at 127 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which was approximately 10% lower than Sample A1's (142 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), suggesting that Sample A2's average wall thickness is between 20 and 21 layers-slightly thicker than Sample A1. The BJH specific porosity of Sample A2, at 0.37 cm<sup>3</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, was also similar to Sample A1's (0.35 cm<sup>3</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), although we again note that this measurement underestimates the contribution of larger macropores.</p><p id="p-0408" num="0420">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>C</figref>, the fringe lines associated with the layered architecture can be observed. In spite of the long-range curvature of the perimorphic wall, both dark and bright fringe lines are generally linear. This indicates the reduced ring-disorder and curvature of these graphenic regions compared to the regions observed in Sample A1. The fringe lines, as shown by the tracing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>C</figref>, are substantially parallel, and we can therefore describe the layers as nematically aligned. While a few potential instances of fringe patterns associated with crosslinking dislocations could be identified, these were considerably scarcer than in Sample A1. While occasional crosslinking dislocations are present in these perimorphs, they were insufficient to form an anthracitic network.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0421">More information about the bonding structure of Sample A2 can be derived from its Raman spectra. A single-point Raman spectrum, taken using a 532 nm laser at 2 mW power, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>. No smoothing has been performed. The three dominant features of the profile are the D<sub>u </sub>peak at approximately 1349 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the G<sub>u </sub>peak at approximately 1587 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and the 2D<sub>u </sub>peak at approximately 2700 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0422">Compared to Sample A1, Sample A2 has a much lower intensity Tr<sub>u </sub>feature, with an I<sub>Tr</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>ratio of less than 0.15. This is consistent with less contribution from an underlying, red-shifted mode of the G peak and the absence of ring disorder-induced tensile strain. The lack of ring disorder and associated stretching is in good agreement with the observation of less curvature in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>C</figref>. Additionally, the G<sub>u </sub>peak's natural position at 1587 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>signifies an absence of the compressed regions that were present in Sample A1.

This, along with the emergence of a 2D<sub>u </sub>peak (with an average I<sub>2Du</sub>/I<sub>Gu </sub>ratio of 0.265) reflects the increased crystalline order of Sample A2 compared to Sample A1. While an increase in D band intensity in the spectrum of crystalline carbons corresponds to a decrease in crystallinity (e.g. in the amorphization of graphite to nanocrystalline graphite), Sample A1 is nanocrystalline, and so its higher D band intensity indicates increased crystalline order compared to Sample A2.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0424">The G<sub>u </sub>peak is slightly asymmetrical due to the presence of a shoulder at approximately 1620 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.

The prevalence of sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states is also indicated by the narrow D<sub>u </sub>peak centered at 1349 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This D band does not appear to be significantly interpolated with any lower-frequency sp<sup>3 </sup>bands, indicating that most RBM phonons are being activated by sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states, not by sp<sup>3 </sup>states associated with diamondlike seams.

The onset of thermal oxidation for Sample A2 occurs between 450&#xb0; C. and 500&#xb0; C., which is higher than Sample A3, and approximately the same as Sample A1. Sample A2's temperature of peak mass loss, at 650&#xb0; C., is higher than both Sample A1's and Sample A3's, reflecting the increased stability of its nanocrystalline graphite structure. The greater breadth of temperature over which Sample A2 is thermally oxidized corresponds to the presence of easily oxidized soot, which causes an early onset of thermal oxidation.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0431">A further practical demonstration of the degraded mechanical properties in Sample A2 vs. Sample A1 was obtain via a uniaxial compression test. In this test, the Sample A1 and Sample A2 powders were each uniaxially compressed to the same pressure. After compression, Sample A1 retained its powder form, suggesting a lack of compaction, while the Sample A2 powder was compacted into a firm, monolithic pellet.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0432">SEM was performed to obtain a better understanding of the powders under compression. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> is an SEM image of the Sample A1 perimorphic frameworks post-compression. The frameworks can be observed to have retained their porous morphology. While breakage of the perimorphic wall can be observed in many of the particles, other perimorphic walls exhibit linear features that were not present prior to compression. These linear features are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> and magnified in the inset. In the inset, the perimorphic wall can be observed to have buckled inward, creating an internal fold that results in a linear surface feature. Many of the Sample A1 particles after compression exhibit local buckling, indicating that their perimorphic walls were able to bend locally. The retention of the frameworks' porous morphology indicates the walls' ability to resist inelastic shear yielding and to store elastic potential energy, springing back upon release of the uniaxial compression. This elasticity, owing to the anthracitic networking within the walls, prevents the frameworks from compacting irreversibly into a paper-like pellet.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0433">By contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> is an SEM image of the Sample A2 perimorphic frameworks after compression. The porous morphology of the Sample A2 frameworks have been destroyed. The resulting paper-like assembly of sheets is consistent with the observation of these frameworks' increased tendency to deform plastically and fragment during liquid-phase processing and drying. During compression, the layers within the perimorphic walls are able to shear apart due to the lack of anthracitic networking. The frameworks' lost porosity and compaction into a laminated structure is what creates the pellet, which cannot spring back upon release of the uniaxial compression due to a lack of stored elastic potential energy. Hence, the lack of anthracitic networking in the walls prevents the perimorphic frameworks in Sample A1 from being able to rebound.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0434"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref> is an SEM image of Sample A3. Like the particles in Samples A1, the perimorphic frameworks in Sample A3 retain their native pore-and-wall morphology without much sign of deformation. This morphology mirrors the template, which comprises a partially sintered powder of conjoined, polyhedral MgO crystals, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>. The conjoined subunits of the perimorphic frameworks possess large, flat facets and appear more polyhedral than those in Sample A1. In the SEM micrograph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>, it is unclear where individual frameworks begin or end, or how many distinct frameworks there might be in this image.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0435">Compared to the perimorphic walls in Samples A1 and A2, which exhibited a consistent appearance, the walls in Sample A3 have regions that are transparent and regions that are opaque. The transparent regions are found within the flat facets of the frameworks and at first glance appear to be holes in the perimorphic wall. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref> is a magnified view of a polyhedral perimorphic structure present in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>. Two transparent areas (&#x201c;windows&#x201d;) are circled. The windows are located in the central area of flat facets, as labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>, and they are ringed by a narrow, more electron-opaque strip running around the perimeter of the facet. These strips are referred to herein as &#x201c;framing,&#x201d; because they give the windows a framed appearance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>. The framing on a facet typically hugs the facet's edges, although occasional, more electron-opaque tendrils can be observed extending inward.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0436">As shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>C</figref>, the opaque framing around a window generally points across the window toward the framing on the opposing side, as though the framing were cohered to a transparent surface. In the facet shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>C</figref>, and in many other instances that were readily identified, the gentle, inward (i.e. toward the cell's interior) curvature of the framing could be extrapolated to extend across a slightly concave, transparent surface. This slight concavity is indicated by the curvature of the arrows. This is the first indication that the windows are not physical holes in the perimorphic walls.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0437">If no such transparent surface were in fact present to guide the framing, we would expect to see it bent, frayed, or curled irregularly by the mechanical stresses of template removal and drying. These irregularities would not be expected, however, if the framing were supported by a transparent region of the wall stretching across the facet, like a connective tissue. Instead, it would indicate the geometry of the transparent surface, which might be expected to be slightly concave due to the inward pull of the receding water during evaporative drying of the framework, creating a slight concavity. Indeed, this was the appearance of all of the framing. The conclusion from SEM analysis is that the windows observed in Sample A3 are not holes, but a more electron-transparent phase of the wall.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0438">A phase change in the carbon from the edges of a flat facet to the central area of the facet has been observed by previous researchers. When performing CVD growth of perimorphic frameworks on NaCl cubes, a distinct phase of the wall was identified at the edges and corners of the NaCl facets (where nucleation occurred due to localized melting of the NaCl in these areas). Based on Raman analysis, these regions comprised a multilayer vdW assembly of small graphenic domains. A second phase of larger, more crystalline domains within the perimorphic wall was found in the central area of each facet&#x2014;i.e. the area where there was less melting and nucleation. These perimorphic walls were broken during dissolution of the template and drying, creating platelet-like fragments. The degeneration of these frameworks stands in contrast to the intactness of the perimorphic frameworks in Sample A3, where no observable platelet-like fragments were observed in the dried carbon powder. The observation that the windows in Sample A3 do not break away and become independent platelet-like particles is a compelling indication that the walls in Sample A3 comprise an anthracitic network rather than a vdW assembly.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0439"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>A</figref> is an HRTEM image of Sample A3 that shows its overall microstructure. The macroporous subunits of the perimorphic framework shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>A</figref> are cuboidal, and dotted lines are used to facilitate a visualization of their cuboidal shape. The more electron-transparent windows on the flat facets of the subunits have been circled with dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>A</figref>. Sintering of the MgO template crystals, upon displacement of the template, imparts the endocellular passages that can be observed between the subunits.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0440">The perimorphic walls in Sample A3 are somewhat thinner than the walls in Samples A1 and A2. Consistent with this, Sample A3 has a higher BET specific surface area of 328 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This BET measurement suggests an average wall thickness of approximately 8 layers (2630 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>/328 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>=8.0). Cross-sections of the perimorphic walls reveal that they are fairly uniform in thickness and do not exhibit any discontinuities, even in the central regions of flat facets. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>C</figref>, where the cross-section of the cell wall across several flat facets (indicated by the dashed rectangles) is uniformly thick and uninterrupted. This was confirmed by observation of numerous facets from many different angles and is another indication that the windows are not holes, but simply transparent regions of the perimorphic wall.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0441">Like Sample A1, Sample A3 exhibits numerous Y-dislocations. A typical fringe pattern drawn from Sample A3 and associated with a Y-dislocation is shown in the magnified inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>B</figref>. The ubiquitous presence of Y-dislocations is another indication of the anthracitic networking responsible for the robustness of the Sample A3 frameworks. Additionally, the layering within Sample A3's walls, like the layering in Sample A1's walls, exhibits nematic alignment. However, distinct fringe lines in Sample A3 are more difficult to trace visually over any distance greater than 1-2 nm, suggesting a more crosslinked anthracitic network.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0442">These observations are corroborated by Sample A3's Raman spectra. A single-point Raman spectrum, taken using a 532 nm laser at 2 mW power, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>. No smoothing has been performed. For reference, the full spectrum is shown in the inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>. The overall Raman profile of Sample A3 looks similar to Sample A1 and to anthracite. No 2D<sub>u </sub>peak is present. The D<sub>u </sub>peak is centered at approximately 1340 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, reflecting more D band interpolation than was observed in Sample A1 (A1's D<sub>u </sub>peak was centered between 1345 and 1350 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). This increased interpolation of the D band reflects an increasing prevalence of RBM phonons activated by sp<sup>3 </sup>states vs. sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states. Like Sample A1, Sample A3 has a shoulder between 1150 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1200 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, indicating an underlying D* peak that is consistent with the transitions that occur at sp<sup>x </sup>diamondlike seams. This shoulder is labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0443">Also similar to Sample A1, Sample A3 exhibits a relatively sharp, blue-shifted G<sub>u </sub>peak (the usual G peak position at 1585 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>is marked with a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>). This blue-shifted mode implies compressive strain. Compared to Sample A1, Sample A2 exhibits a slightly lower trough (I<sub>Tr</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>peak=0.40). However, the trough is still high enough to indicate the presence of a broad, underlying peak. We again assign this to a red-shifted mode of the G band, associated with the presence of ring-disordered regions.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0444">The I<sub>D</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>peak intensity ratio is approximately 0.77, indicating a lower D<sub>u </sub>peak intensity in Sample A3 compared to Sample A1. This downward trend in the D<sub>u </sub>peak intensity (A2&#x3e;A1&#x3e;A3) is positively correlated with the CVD temperature (1050&#xb0; C.&#x3e;750&#xb0; C.&#x3e;650&#xb0; C.) and also positively correlated with D band interpolation (i.e. with the increasing prevalence of RBM phonons activated by sp<sup>3 </sup>carbon). This decreasing D<sub>u </sub>peak intensity in disordered carbons is attributable to the progressive loss of sp<sup>2 </sup>ring structure; in the case of Sample A3, this occurs as sp<sup>2 </sup>rings are replaced with sp<sup>x </sup>rings. The D band's intensity falls as the density of diamondlike seams increases. Therefore, this is consistent with the appearance of a more crosslinked anthracitic network in HRTEM images of Sample A3.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0445">From our characterizations of Samples A1, A2, and A3, we can deduce the tectonic pathway by which diamondlike seams are formed during growth. We begin this discussion with the observation that the window regions of the perimorphic wall are electron-transparent, whereas the surrounding framing, and curved regions of the perimorphic wall, are not. We then connect this to an analysis of nucleation and growth of primordial domains over a templating surface. Finally, we model tectonic encounters between these primordial domains, and show how, under the right circumstances, diamondlike seams are evolved from these encounters.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0446">The non-uniformity of electron transparency in Sample A3, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, arises due to different charging behaviors in different regions of the perimorphic wall. During imaging, more charging occurs in areas of the perimorphic wall that are more electrically insulating. This charging behavior is clearly tied to the geometry of the templating surface. The more conductive windows are associated with atomically flat templating surfaces, such as the facets labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, where nucleation of primordial domains was minimal or absent. The less conductive framing and rounded regions of the perimorphic wall are associated with more defective regions of the templating surface, where nucleation of primordial domains was comparatively dense.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0447">Next, we recall that, based on the interpolation of Sample A3's D<sub>u </sub>peak, a significant fraction of Sample A3's RBM phonons are activated by sp<sup>3 </sup>states, which we have associated with diamondlike seams throughout the anthracitic network. In regions of the wall with a greater density of diamondlike seams, and therefore a greater density of sp<sup>3 </sup>states, we would expect charging to increase due to discontinuities in the &#x3c0; cloud, through which conduction occurs. In regions of the wall with a lesser density of diamondlike seams, and therefore a lesser density of sp<sup>3 </sup>states, we would expect less charging should occur. Tying these observations together, it appears that regions of the perimorphic wall associated with higher nucleation density appear to charge more, and we attribute this to a greater density of sp<sup>3 </sup>states associated with diamondlike seams. We further attribute the greater density of sp<sup>3 </sup>states and diamondlike seam in these regions to their origin in the grafting that occurs at the tectonic interfaces of primordial domains growing over a common substrate surface. Dense, localized nucleation causes the primordial domains to proliferate, leading to increased tectonic interactions, more grafting, and therefore more sp<sup>3 </sup>states and diamondlike seams.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0448">Next, we analyze the tectonic encounters between these primordial domains. Ring-disordered lattices possess nonzero Gaussian curvature, and their edges have an undulating geometry determined by the local lattice curvature. The ring disorder of primordial domains grown via pyrolysis at temperatures below 900&#xb0; C. has been evidenced by several examples in the prior art, including the growth of ring-disordered domains on single-crystal MgO &#x3c;100&#x3e; wafers and single-crystal germanium &#x3c;100&#x3e; wafers. When two such primordial domains are grown over a common substrate surface, a tectonic encounter may occur between their edges. Since the domains' local lattice curvatures and undulating edges are not in phase, this tectonic encounter creates a stochastic, incoherent tectonic interface between the nearby edge segments. Adding to this complexity, the edges of the primordial domains can be conceptualized as a constantly self-rearranging fluid of free radicals. The incoherence of the interface, where the edge atoms of one primordial domain are not consistently above, below, or level with the edge atoms of the other domain, prevents resolution via simple subduction or sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0449">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>36</b></figref>, we provide a stepwise illustration of how sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting at an incoherent tectonic interface may lead to the sp<sup>3 </sup>states and diamondlike seams that cause local charging in perimorphic regions associated with dense tectonic activity, as observed in Sample A3. In reference to the molecular models provided in these figures, and also in reference to all of the other molecular models that follow throughout the remainder of the disclosure, a few comments are in order. First, while we must represent these systems statically, our molecular models should be understood as static representations of dynamic, self-rearranging structures. Second, all such illustrations, which were made using molecular models constructed using Avogadro 1.2.0 software, should be considered as representing only rough, geometric approximations of actual systems. They are meant to provide a helpful, visual illustration of the phenomena described herein. Third, while we do not illustrate the substrates, the pyrolytic growth processes with which we are most concerned in the present disclosure are directed by substrates, and the absence of the substrate in the system is not intended to imply that no substrate is present. Fourth, we do not represent hydrogen atoms in these illustrations because our primary focus is on the evolution of the graphenic structures, which exclude hydrogen by definition. However, in actuality, we understand that hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of these graphenic structures is theorized to be occurring dynamically throughout pyrolytic carbon formation. Fifth, we provide multiple perspectives in order to facilitate visual inspection and understanding of these systems in three dimensions. An edge of the molecular model is traced with dashed tracing in both the V and H1 perspectives to help with orientation. Sixth, while for purposes of explanation we often represent a sequential evolution of the systems under consideration, we do not mean to imply that the sequences, as illustrated, are strict or universal. Seventh, what we intend to demonstrate is how diamondlike seams, chiral columns, and screw dislocations are derived from sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting and sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting across tectonic interfaces. We attempt to model how this happens using the simplest models possible for the purposes of communicating the basic concepts.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0450">In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, an incoherent tectonic interface is shown. The interface is formed by the tectonic encounter between two edge segments (E<sub>1 </sub>and E<sub>2</sub>), each of these participating edge segments belonging to a different ring-disordered graphenic structure (G<sub>1 </sub>and G<sub>2</sub>, respectively). These edge segments and graphenic structures are labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>. The tectonic interface between them is described as the E<sub>1</sub>-E<sub>2 </sub>interface. We can think of G<sub>1 </sub>and G<sub>2 </sub>as primordial domains nucleated on a common substrate surface.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0451">The E<sub>1</sub>-E<sub>2 </sub>tectonic interface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> comprises a zigzag-zigzag interface&#x2014;i.e. an interface in which both of the participating edge segments are in the zigzag orientation. This configuration may evolve as the growing, graphenic structures rearrange themselves, in keeping with free radical condensate growth. From the H2 perspective in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, we can see that the primordial domains G<sub>1 </sub>and G<sub>2 </sub>are both curved. Accordingly, their edges have an undulating geometry. The incoherence of the edges' z-deflections at the tectonic interface results in three distinct interfacial zones-two offset zones, labeled as &#x201c;Offset Zone I&#x201d; and &#x201c;Offset Zone II,&#x201d; which are located to the sides of the E<sub>1</sub>-E<sub>2 </sub>tectonic interface, and a level zone between them. These tectonic zones are labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0452">The vertical offset within an offset zone is such that opposing edge atoms cannot form sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds to their counterparts without severe lattice distortion subduction. Subduction of one edge by the other is also unfavorable. In an offset zone, under the right pyrolytic conditions, edge atoms may undergo sp<sup>2</sup>-to-sp<sup>3 </sup>rehybridization and form a sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond line, grafting the primordial domains together is edge-to-edge.

In these zones, under the right pyrolytic conditions, the edge atoms may form a line of sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds to one another. This is similar to the sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting that has been observed between ring-ordered domains in the prior art, except that sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting at incoherent interfaces is localized at level zones.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0454">In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, the system has been modified by sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting within the level zone, which is premised upon the minimal vertical offset between opposing sp<sup>2 </sup>atomic members of E<sub>1 </sub>and E<sub>2 </sub>and sufficient alignment of their 2sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>orbitals. The resulting line of 2 sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds forms a new 6-member ring that ring-connects the primordial domains E<sub>1 </sub>and E<sub>2</sub>, which thereby coalesce into a new graphenic structure, designated G<sub>3</sub>. The new graphenic structure G<sub>3 </sub>is labeled in the vertical perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>. The formation of the new sp<sup>2 </sup>ring, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, causes some aligning distortion of the resulting G<sub>3 </sub>domain.

R<sub>1 </sub>was formed by grafting across Offset Zone I, where E<sub>2 </sub>was elevated over E<sub>1</sub>; therefore, R<sub>1 </sub>is elevated on what was originally the E<sub>2 </sub>side.

First, the non-uniform charging observed in Sample A3's perimorphs (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>27</b></figref>) is attributed to localization of sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting and diamondlike seams at tectonic interfaces. These interfaces are densest in areas of heavy nucleation, which correspond to rounded or near-defect regions of the templating surfaces. On the other hand, regions of the perimorphic walls formed on flatter templating surfaces exhibit fewer sp<sup>3 </sup>states and less charging. Second, because sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting across incoherent tectonic interfaces eliminates many sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states, and because sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting leads to strong sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>coupling at the defect sites that activate the RBM phonons throughout the sp<sup>2 </sup>rings, sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting leads to interpolation of the sp<sup>2 </sup>Raman D band. Lastly, because the grafted base contains elevated radicals in sp<sup>3</sup>-grafted regions, higher layers are readily nucleated without growth being quenched even when access to the template/substrate is unavailable. This forms a multilayer sp<sup>x </sup>network that comprises a ring-connected singleton, which exhibits superior mechanical robustness when compared to vdW assemblies.</p><p id="p-0465" num="0476">In Study A, we observe that the Raman D band's interpolation increases as the temperature at which pyrolysis occurs is reduced. This is consistent with the slower release of hydrogen at lower temperatures, which gives the dynamic, self-rearranging condensate at tectonic interfaces more time to relax into an energy-minimizing configuration. Sp<sup>2 </sup>or sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting, which eliminates high-energy sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states at the tectonic interfaces, is therefore promoted by lower temperatures.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0477">In Procedure A1, the 750&#xb0; C. CVD temperature allows gradual dehydrogenation and carbonization of the condensates. This facilitates some sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting at tectonic interfaces, and as sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states are eliminated via grafting, the D band begins to show underlying, interpolated modes, as evidenced by difference between its average D<sub>u </sub>peak, which is positioned above 1345 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and its average D<sub>f </sub>peak, which positioned at 1343 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. On this basis, we classify the perimorphic frameworks in Sample A1 as minimally grafted z-sp<sup>x </sup>networks.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0478">In Procedure A2, the 1050&#xb0; C. CVD temperature accelerates dehydrogenation and carbonization of the condensates. High-energy edge dislocations get locked in, creating a vdW assembly. RBM phonons are activated by these sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states, and the D band of Sample A2 is therefore not interpolated. On this basis, we classify the perimorphic frameworks in Sample A1 as vdW assemblies.</p><p id="p-0468" num="0479">In Procedure A3, a further reduction in temperature to 650&#xb0; C. allows the growing condensates more time to rearrange and relax into energy-minimizing, grafted configurations that eliminate sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states. Consequently, Sample A3's D<sub>u </sub>peak, positioned at 1340 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>reflects the most D band interpolation of any of the samples in Study A, and is located between the sp<sup>2 </sup>edge-activated D band at &#x2dc;1350 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and the cubic diamond peak at 1332 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.

The peak FWHM does not appear drastically changed. This trend of reducing peak intensity and area signifies an overall reduction in the RBM phonons associated with sp<sup>2 </sup>rings. This is known to occur as sp<sup>3 </sup>content increases in disordered carbons&#x2014;in diamondlike carbons with no sp<sup>2 </sup>rings, the D feature disappears entirely. The decreasing D<sub>u </sub>peak intensities observed in Study B can therefore be assigned to a progressive decrease in the presence of sp<sup>2 </sup>rings, which are transformed into sp<sup>x </sup>rings by the sp<sup>2</sup>-to-sp<sup>3 </sup>rehybridization associated with sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting. As the pyrolysis temperature is reduced, not only do condensates have more time to relax into lower-energy sp<sup>3</sup>-grafted configurations at tectonic interfaces, but the primordial domains' ring disorder is increased, which should promote offset zones at the expense of level zones. Both of these should increase sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting and sp<sup>x </sup>rings.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0488">Evaluation of Samples B1-B3 also shows that as the CVD temperature is reduced in Study B, the D<sub>u </sub>peak also becomes progressively more interpolated with lower-frequency sp<sup>3 </sup>bands. This indicates a decreasing prevalence of sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states. As discussed in Study A, this establishes that sp<sup>2 </sup>edges are increasingly being eliminated at tectonic interfaces, consistent with the adoption of lower-energy, grafted configurations. Interestingly, the interpolation trend observed in Samples B1-B3 does not stop at the cubic diamond peak position of 1332 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>but progresses to even lower frequencies.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0489">Surprisingly, as temperature drops and grafting is promoted, it also appears that the overall level of lattice distortion in sp<sup>2 </sup>clusters is reduced. This is evidenced by the trend in the trough height for Samples B1-B3&#x2014;a trend that was not observed in Study A, where it was found that Samples A1 and A3, while being synthesized at lower temperatures than Sample A2, exhibited higher troughs. This trend in Study B can potentially be explained by compression arising from the increasing prevalence of sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting and, in particular, from the increasing prevalence of more strained sp<sup>x </sup>ring conformations, such as boat conformations.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0490">Another trend observed in of Samples B1-B3 is that with decreasing pyrolysis temperatures, the G<sub>u </sub>peak position gradually blue-shifts from its usual position at 1585 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>up to 1596.6 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This indicates an overall increase in the compressive strain of sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds, and this compression is also attributed to increasing grafting. Additionally, the G band becomes narrower, indicating less variance in the strain states. Hence, Study B corroborates the correlation observed in Study A of grafting and compression. This compression also helps to explain the declining height of the trough. We can see in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b>B</figref> that as the G<sub>u </sub>peak position increases, the I<sub>Tr</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>ratio decreases, indicating that tensile strain states are being reduced as the sp<sup>x </sup>networks become more compressed.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0491">Another spectral observation in Study B is that the progressive interpolation of the D<sub>u </sub>peak position to below 1328.6 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(in Sample B3) under 532 nm excitation. Because of the proximity of Sample B3's D<sub>u </sub>peak position of 1328.6 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to the cubic diamond peak position at 1332 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and because anthracitic networks are known to be prone to beam-induced heating, which could affect the D<sub>u </sub>peak position, Sample B4 was evaluated at a lower laser power setting of 0.5 mW. The Raman spectrum gathered for Sample B4 at the 0.5 mW laser power setting demonstrates conclusively that the D band is red-shifted below the 1332 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>cubic diamond peak position. This interpolation below 1332 nm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>indicates the presence of sp<sup>x </sup>rings in hexagonal diamond arrangements. Hexagonal diamond has been shown to have an intense Raman peak at 1324.4 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>by some workers, whereas in other instances it has been shown to have peaks between 1318 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1325 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Hence, Sample B4's average D<sub>u </sub>peak position of 1324.5 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and multiple point spectra with D<sub>u </sub>peak positions between 1318 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1320 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, is strong evidence of sp<sup>x </sup>rings in non-chair conformations.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0492">In addition to its greater degree of interpolation, the D<sub>u </sub>band in Sample B4 is also conspicuously narrower than the D<sub>u </sub>bands in Samples B1-B3. This indicates that a higher fraction of its RBM phonons is being activated by backscattering at sp<sup>x </sup>interfaces, and that RBM phonons activated by backscattering at sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states are being eliminated. The more these sp<sup>2 </sup>edge atoms are eliminated, and the more highly grafted the sp<sup>x </sup>network becomes, the narrower this peak should become. This improvement in grafting in Sample B4 may be attributed to three factors: (i) the increased stability at lower pyrolysis temperatures of strained sp<sup>x </sup>conformations required for grafting across certain tectonic interfaces; (ii) slower dehydrogenation at lower pyrolysis temperatures, allowing condensates more time to finding grafting configurations; and (iii) the use of smaller, less sterically hindered C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>gas molecules.</p><p id="p-0483" num="0493">We start with the first factor, which is premised upon the idea that certain tectonic interfaces may not allow chair conformations, i.e. cubic diamond. This premise would be consistent with previously published graphene-to-diamond bonding research. In this work, it was found that for a graphene domain's edge to bond to a diamond surface, it was necessary for the atomic positions of the graphene's dangling bonds to be matched as closely as possible to the atomic positions of some line of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms present on the diamond surface. For certain graphenic edge configurations, lonsdaleite (i.e. hexagonal diamond) surfaces offered a better-matching line of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms than cubic diamond surfaces.</p><p id="p-0484" num="0494">In our discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>36</b></figref>, we illustrated diamondlike seams comprising sp<sup>x </sup>rings in the chair conformation&#x2014;i.e. cubic diamondlike seams. Extrapolating from the logic of the prior art, wherein graphene-diamond bonding required a match between a graphenic edge configuration and a line of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms on a diamond surface, we theorize that in order for two graphenic edges at a tectonic interface to be sp<sup>3</sup>-grafted, each must be grafted to a matching line of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms, and then these two lines of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms must be sufficiently matched to form a sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond line. Sometimes this requires a non-cubic polymorph of diamond.</p><p id="p-0485" num="0495">In a hypothetical zigzag-zigzag interface in which the edges are sufficiently close to bond directly, such as the E<sub>1</sub>-E<sub>2 </sub>interface presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, the two lines of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms can be generated via sp<sup>2</sup>-to-sp<sup>3 </sup>rehybridization of the graphenic edges themselves, which may then bond directly to each other due to their close proximity. This effectively matches each of the two graphenic structures to a line of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms, then forms a sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond line between them, generating two-dimensional cubic diamondlike seams.</p><p id="p-0486" num="0496">Since the spacing between participating edge atoms in a tectonic interface is stochastic in nature, though, we must consider that in some interfaces, opposing edge atoms may be too far apart to bond directly to each other. To illustrate this, in Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref> we model an offset zone of a zigzag-zigzag tectonic interface involving two edges, E* and E**, where E** is elevated over E*. For simplicity, no hydrogen atoms are represented. The spacing between the sp<sup>2 </sup>edge atoms in Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref> is too large for sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting to occur. However, there is still room remaining between the edges for interstitial atoms to be inserted via continued radical addition.</p><p id="p-0487" num="0497">In Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, we insert a line of sp<sup>3 </sup>interstitial atoms at the elevated edge E**. This line of sp<sup>3 </sup>interstitial atoms is matched to the E** edge and is close enough to the sp<sup>2 </sup>edge atoms of E* for bonding, but the vertical offset inhibits sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting.</p><p id="p-0488" num="0498">In Frame III, the opposing line of sp<sup>2 </sup>edge atoms in E* undergoes sp<sup>2</sup>-to-sp<sup>3 </sup>rehybridization, forming a line of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms, and these are bonded to the line of interstitial atoms via sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds, as illustrated in in Frame III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>). This line of sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds ring-connects the graphenic structures. The elevated sp<sup>3 </sup>radicals on the E** side allow continued radical addition, resulting in the formation of sp<sup>x </sup>rings in the boat conformation (since chair conformations are geometrically disallowed). With continued growth, a seam may be evolved, as shown in Frame IV of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>. Such a seam will no longer comprise cubic diamond, but instead an amorphous, hexagonal diamond polymorph that can be expected to have lower-frequency Raman spectral peaks.</p><p id="p-0489" num="0499">Hence, the lateral spacing at tectonic interfaces play an important role in determining the conformations of the sp<sup>x </sup>rings evolved by sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting. If the spacing between zigzag edges is close enough, opposing sp<sup>2 </sup>edge atoms may be able to rehybridize and sp<sup>3</sup>-graft directly to each other, resulting in sp<sup>x </sup>rings in chair conformations. If the spacing between zigzag edges is too far, an interstitial line of atoms may be inserted, and sp<sup>2 </sup>edge atoms may be rehybridized, forming two lines of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms that can then form a sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond line. This will result in less thermodynamically stable conformations that may not be stable at higher temperatures, meaning that complete grafting of tectonic interfaces may not be possible at higher temperatures. We may confidently conclude that, based on the inevitability of these interfacial configurations and their necessitation of sp<sup>x </sup>rings in boat conformations, if an sp<sup>x </sup>network does not exhibit D peak interpolation with sp<sup>3 </sup>modes below 1332 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, it is incompletely grafted.</p><p id="p-0490" num="0500">The insertion of interstitial atoms, as modeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, increases the local atomic packing density&#x2014;in many interfaces, the interstitial atoms may be packed or wedged into an interface, compressing the sp<sup>2 </sup>regions around the interface. The fineness of this spacing, and the need for molecular rearrangement during dissociative adsorption, suggests that smaller gas-phase species, like C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, will be less sterically hindered from reacting and inserting atoms at these interfaces, facilitating more grafting and compression. We suspect this is a major reason why, although produced at the same temperature of 580&#xb0; C., Sample B4 (produced from C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>pyrolysis) had a significantly lower D<sub>u </sub>peak position than Sample B2 (produced from C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>pyrolysis).</p><p id="p-0491" num="0501">The logic of tight atomic &#x201c;packing&#x201d; at tectonic interfaces applies not only to offset zones, where sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting occurs, but also to level zones, where sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting occurs. The insertion of interstitial atoms at tectonic interfaces explains the progressively higher G peak positions observed in Study B, with Sample B4 reaching an average position of 1603.3 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and point positions of 1604.2 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. In procedures utilizing C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>feedgas at pyrolysis temperatures below 580&#xb0; C., we have observed average G<sub>u </sub>peak positions of greater than 1606 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, with point positions of up to 1610 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0492" num="0502">Other stochastically-formed tectonic interfaces may easily be envisioned, and sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting at these interfaces may evolve other sp<sup>x </sup>ring morphologies. These may include 5-member rings, 7-member rings, 9-member rings, and potentially others, all of which ring-connect the participating graphenic structure. Any sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting event that evolves these sp<sup>x </sup>rings may, upon further addition, form a diamondlike seam.</p><p id="p-0493" num="0503">As an example of this, in Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> we illustrate a tectonic interface formed by a zigzag edge segment and an armchair edge segment (i.e. a &#x201c;zigzag-armchair&#x201d; interface). Vertical and horizontal perspectives are shown. For simplicity, we illustrate only an offset zone of the zigzag-armchair interface, and hydrogen atoms are again excluded. In Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, the interfacial spacing is such that opposing sp<sup>2 </sup>edge atoms are close enough to graft directly but are vertically offset.</p><p id="p-0494" num="0504">Sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting therefore proceeds via sp<sup>2</sup>-to-sp<sup>3 </sup>rehybridization of these opposing sp<sup>2 </sup>edge atoms, forming two lines of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms with atomic positions that allow the formation of an sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond line between the two graphenic structures. This is illustrated in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, with sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms being represented in the magnified inset by crosshatched circles and white circles, respectively.

The atomic positions within this line of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms, like the z-adjacent line of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms below it, can be incorporated in a zigzag edge of sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms, which is circled in the magnified inset in Frame III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>. In this way, a diamondlike seam is formed at the zigzag-armchair interface.</p><p id="p-0496" num="0506">If the spacing of a zigzag-armchair interface is too large for bond formation between opposing edge atoms, interstitial atoms may need to be inserted.

They also explain the observation of Raman spectral features that are consistent with cubic and hexagonal diamond motifs.</p><p id="p-0500" num="0510">Next, we consider more broadly the tectonic interactions and pyrolytic growth of a larger population of primordial domains, which gives rise to higher-layer tectonic activity that we have not yet considered. To illustrate this, we diagram the formation of an sp<sup>x </sup>network over a substrate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>. The diagram is drawn from a horizontal perspective. Growth is divided into three stages.</p><p id="p-0501" num="0511">In Stage I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>, independently nucleated primordial domains grow toward one another over a common substrate. The substrate is hatched in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>, and the growing domains are represented by arrows. The arrows indicate that the primordial domains are growing radially outward based on radical addition at their edges. If growth is terminated during Stage I, before much grafting has occurred, the sp<sup>2 </sup>radial breathing modes will be predominately activated by sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states associated with these isolated, ring-disconnected domains.</p><p id="p-0502" num="0512">In Stage II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>, the domains are grafted to form the base and begin to nucleate higher layers over the base. Diamondlike seams (each seam is represented by an &#x201c;X&#x201d; in Stage II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>) are formed, and associated with them, an anthracitic sp<sup>x </sup>network. The tectonic interfaces are stochastic and dynamic in nature, with the hydrogenated condensates self-rearranging and relaxing into energy-minimizing grafted configurations. Some tectonic interfaces allow opposing edge atoms to be directly grafted to one another, while others require the insertion of interstitial atoms (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref>) to enable grafting. This increases the atomic packing and causes compression in the sp<sup>x </sup>network. If growth is terminated during Stage II, the activation of RBM phonons will occur via some concert of sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states (left in place when growth is terminated) and sp<sup>3 </sup>states. Therefore, we may expect some interpolation of the D band, and different modes of the D band.</p><p id="p-0503" num="0513">In Stage III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>, a steady state of vertical and lateral growth of the sp<sup>x </sup>network drives higher-layer tectonic encounters and associated grafting. As with the tectonic activity between primordial domains, this proceeds stochastically. Dislocations tend to replicate z-periodically, creating transverse diamondlike seams, but this z-periodicity is not deterministic. Meanwhile, new seams may be nucleated from higher-layer tectonic encounters, as these too can be expected to create incoherent interfaces. This may help to distribute the dislocations more evenly throughout the sp<sup>x </sup>network. If growth is terminated during Stage III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>, the activation of RBM phonons may be dominated by sp<sup>3 </sup>states (depending on the efficiency of grafting at interfaces), and we may see more interpolation of the D band than we would if growth were terminated in Stage I or II.</p><p id="p-0504" num="0514">Our staged depictions of vertical and lateral growth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>36</b></figref> notwithstanding, lateral growth is expected to be far more rapid than vertical growth mode. In other words, nucleation of higher layers is likely rate-limiting. Since higher-layer nucleation occurs at tectonic interfaces, overall growth may be accelerated by measures that increase tectonic activity and sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting. Faster lateral growth enables uniform coverage of the substrate and the formation of perimorphic walls of consistent thickness, so long as gas-phase species are abundant. This explains our observation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>C</figref> of uniformly thick perimorphic walls-even in the &#x201c;window&#x201d; regions where nucleation of primordial domains would have been inhibited. We have seen signs that on many substrates, the carbon yielded over extended periods of time remains linear, indicating a steady-state of higher-layer nucleation. This &#x201c;evergreen&#x201d; kinetic model is a fundamental advantage of anthracitic networks over graphenic networks in which the only mode of growth is lateral.</p><p id="p-0505" num="0515">The G<sub>u </sub>peak position (as a relative indicator of compressive strain), the D<sub>u </sub>peak position (as a relative indicator of the elimination of sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states), and therefore the spectral interval between them (as an indicator of both compressive strain and the elimination of sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states) may provide a useful metric for characterizing the extent to which different sp<sup>x </sup>networks have been able to form grafting bonds across the various stochastically-formed tectonic interfaces created during growth. This interpeak interval-defined herein as the distance in wavenumbers between the G<sub>u </sub>and D<sub>u </sub>peak positions&#x2014;is commonly used in the anthracite literature to determine the vitrinite reflectance via the Raman spectrum. The vitrinite reflectance, in turn, is a measure of the maturity of a coal. As coal matures, its interpeak interval expands, corresponding to increasing vitrinite reflectance. For an immature to mature coal, using 532 nm excitation, previous workers have calculated the vitrinite reflectance as: &#x3bd;R<sub>0</sub>%=0.0537(G<sub>u</sub>&#x2212;D<sub>u</sub>)&#x2212;11.21, where &#x3bd;R<sub>0</sub>% is the vitrinite reflectance (as calculated by Raman parameters).</p><p id="p-0506" num="0516">In Sample B4, the interpeak interval is 278.8 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, corresponding to a vitrinite reflectance of 3.76. This vitrinite reflectance is typical of anthracite. Beyond this value, the interpeak interval saturates at approximately 280 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(varying a bit with excitation due to dispersion of the D peak), whereupon the interval begins to shrink again as anthracite matures into meta-anthracite and finally graphite. As this maturation happens, the I<sub>D</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>peak intensity ratio begins to increase, and the interpeak interval ceases to be useful for calculating vitrinite reflectance. For a mature anthracite or meta-anthracite, using 532 nm excitation, previous workers have calculated vitrinite reflection using the I<sub>D</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>peak intensity ratio according to the equation &#x3bd;R<sub>0</sub>%=1.1659 (I<sub>D</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>)+2.7588.</p><p id="p-0507" num="0517">Next, we characterized Sample B4 via XRD analysis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref> shows the overall XRD profile.

In particular, we note the broad fitted peak at 2&#x3b8;=43.138&#xb0;, which is equivalent to a &#x3c;100&#x3e; d-spacing of 2.095 &#x212b;. This reflects an average in-plane compressive strain of around 2% based on graphite's &#x3c;100&#x3e; d-spacing of 2.13 &#x212b;. We can also see signs of in-plane compressive strain at 2&#x3b8;=79.501&#xb0;, which is equivalent to a &#x3c;110&#x3e; d-spacing of 1.21 &#x212b;. This again reflects a compressive strain of around 2% based on graphite's &#x3c;110&#x3e; d-spacing of 1.23 &#x212b;. This is in good agreement with the blue-shifted G<sub>u </sub>peak position exhibited by Sample B4.</p><p id="p-0509" num="0518">The most prominent feature of the XRD profile of Sample B4 is its main peak at 2&#x3b8;=24.489&#xb0;, which reflects a &#x3c;002&#x3e; d-spacing of 3.63 &#x212b;. This is significantly larger than the 3.35 &#x212b;&#x3c;002&#x3e; d-spacing associated with AB-stacked graphite or the 3.45 &#x212b;&#x3c;002&#x3e; d-spacing associated with turbostratic graphite. We attribute this expansion to forced AA-stacking at a large number of the cubic diamondlike seams distributed throughout the sp<sup>x </sup>network. In AA-stacked regions, Pauli repulsion produced by alignment of the &#x3c0; electron orbitals can be expected to increase the minimum interlayer spacing. Indeed, the interlayer spacing of AA-stacked layers has been predicted to have 3.6-3.7 &#x212b;, which is in good agreement with the main interlayer peak at 2&#x3b8;=18.454&#xb0;. Additionally, we observe a related, minor &#x3c;004&#x3e; peak at 2&#x3b8;=50.192&#xb0;, reflecting a d-spacing of 1.82 &#x212b;-one-half of the &#x3c;002&#x3e; d-spacing of 3.63 &#x212b;.</p><p id="p-0510" num="0519">A second interlayer peak is fitted at 2&#x3b8;=18.454&#xb0;, reflecting an interlayer d-spacing of 4.80 &#x212b;. These values, and the breadth of the peaks, indicate a broad range of large interlayer spacings-larger than we observed in Study A. This is explained as follows. Increased atomic packing as a result of grafting in a highly grafted x-sp<sup>x </sup>network causes in-plane compressive strain that exceeds the critical buckling strain. Regions that are compressed beyond this critical buckling strain are forced to buckle in the positive z-direction, this direction representing their only degree of freedom. For this to occur requires them to overcome their vdW attraction to the underlying layer. If they are sufficiently strained, this occurs, and they bow out from the z-adjacent layer below, reaching a maximum z-deflection amplitude somewhere near the geometric center between the lateral seams anchoring their periphery. This z-deflection relieves these regions' in-plane compressive strain but also increases their interlayer d-spacing. We would expect bowing to create a broad continuum of interlayer d-spacings, and this is exactly what we observe in Table 4 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>, where the broad peak centered at 2&#x3b8;=18.454&#xb0; reflects a significant phase of interlayer d-spacings larger than 7 &#x212b;. Therefore, we assign this second interlayer peak at 2&#x3b8;=18.454&#xb0; to z-directional bowing of xy-compressed graphenic regions between the diamondlike seams that pin them peripherally.</p><p id="p-0511" num="0520">With this association established, we can see signs of bowing even in the interlayer d-spacings of Sample A1 (a minimally grafted z-sp<sup>x </sup>network) and Sample A2 (a vdW assembly), and we can see that these samples also exhibit states of in-plane compression based on their &#x3c;100&#x3e; peaks, which indicate d-spacings below 2.13 &#x212b;. From this, we can that similar phenomena are occurring in these less-grafted systems. In Sample A2, specifically, it is likely that localized sp<sup>x </sup>networks are being constructed, but these do not extend throughout the whole perimorphic wall. In other words, the sp<sup>x </sup>networks formed within the perimorphic walls in Sample A2 are too poorly grafted to extend the ring-connected network throughout the whole perimorphic wall.</p><p id="p-0512" num="0521">Based on our findings presented in Experiments A and B, it is possible to speculate ex post facto about instances within the prior art where sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting may have occurred in graphitic networks.</p><p id="p-0513" num="0522">In one such instance, Cui employed a template-directed CVD procedure using methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and MgO template particles at 950&#xb0; C., which produced a monolayer graphenic structure that, as synthesized on the template, possessed a D<sub>u </sub>peak position of 1322 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(under 633 nm excitation). Barring any interpolation of the D band, under 633 nm excitation we would have expected the D<sub>u </sub>peak of this graphenic monolayer to be found around 1332 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. As we have discussed, this would be consistent with sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting and the formation of sp<sup>x </sup>rings in the chair conformation. Therefore, the reported D peak position of 1322 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>reported might represent a red-shift caused by interpolation.</p><p id="p-0514" num="0523">However, we note a few points. First, in order to satisfy ourselves on whether or not Cui's procedure produced an sp<sup>3</sup>-grafted system, we attempted to replicate the reported results. We were pleased by the close agreement in the BET and TGA characterizations of the replicated sample we were able to synthesize with these characterizations of the sample reported by Cui. Furthermore, our Raman spectral analysis (performed under 532 nm excitation) revealed a very similar Raman spectrum in terms of the I<sub>D</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>peak intensity ratio. However, it did not reveal any obvious interpolation of the D peak position. Our attempt did not replicate the interpolation of the D peak.</p><p id="p-0515" num="0524">Second, irrespective of the of the D band interpolation in the sample reported by Cui, the sample could not be described as an anthracitic network or an sp<sup>x </sup>network insomuch as the graphenic particles generated were natively monolayer, as synthesized on the template, and as such any crosslinking was lateral. The case for this was made convincingly in the prior art based on extensive BET, TGA, and XRD characterization. Hence, the vertical crosslinking between layers afforded by an anthracitic network was not realized, as these dislocations require a native, multilayer structure. It is true that the monolayer network, upon removal of the template, were reported to collapse into a bilayer structure. However, these bilayers would not have been crosslinked by dislocations, sacrificing this important third dimension of molecular-scale crosslinking present in anthracitic networks. The lack of dislocations was apparent in HRTEM imagery of the bilayers, where the fringe lines were uninterrupted, visually distinct and traceable over distances of 10 nm or more.</p><p id="p-0516" num="0525">In another work within the prior art, Chung flame-synthesized carbon nano-onions at measured temperatures of 700&#xb0; C. or less (the measured temperatures varied based on where measurements were taken). This process involved rapid chemical vapor deposition over metallic catalyst nanoparticles, creating graphitic carbon nano-onions via precipitation. Based on our ex post facto analysis, it appears that these graphitic carbon nano-onions comprised diamondlike seams. However, the mechanisms and patterns of crosslinking would have been different, given the graphitic alignment of the layers comprising the layered network (this graphitic alignment was evident in HRTEM analysis and also established by the reported &#x3c;002&#x3e; interlayer d-spacing of 3.45 &#x212b;). In particular, there would have been far fewer chiral rings and columns in these graphitic networks, due to the scarcity of zone transitions at tectonic interfaces between their highly ring-ordered domains. These transitions are directly related to the undulating edge geometry associated with ring-disordered domains grown via a free radical condensate growth mechanism. Additionally, these carbon nano-onions offer less versatility and diminished control over important morphological attributes compared to the growth procedures demonstrated herein. Nevertheless, it is foreseeable that certain aspects of this flame-synthesis process, such as partial oxidation, could be employed in tandem with the use of non-metallic catalysts and free radical condensate-based growth.</p><p id="p-0517" num="0526">X.

Namely, in addition to the increased stability of C&#x2014;H bonds at lower CVD temperatures, inside the porous template, where gas-exchange is diffusion-limited, we would expect an increased proportion of H<sub>2</sub>. Unable to carbonize due to the inability to release molecular hydrogen, the free radical condensate in such regions would ultimately relax back into neutral, smaller molecular weight hydrocarbon species. Workers in the field of free radical condensates have shown this phenomenon via time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. To corroborate this, Sample C2 was immersed in ethanol under gentle stirring conditions.

Based on this, we can infer that, in addition to the pyrolysis temperature, the C:H ratio of the carbon source gas, the rate of H<sub>2 </sub>release and diffusion from growth, the presence of an H<sub>2 </sub>feedgas, the morphology and pore structure of the substrate, the size of template particles, the activity of the substrate surface, the presence of H<sub>2 </sub>scavenging species, and numerous other factors are significant insomuch as they will all affect the dynamic equilibrium of the free radical condensate's hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.</p><p id="p-0528" num="0535">Understanding this may allow faster kinetics to be obtained by rationally balancing these many factors.

The deinterpolation of the D<sub>u </sub>peak, together with the increased sp<sup>2 </sup>ring structuring, evidence an sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization that transforms sp<sup>x </sup>rings into sp<sup>2 </sup>rings. The increased trough heights of the annealed samples indicate a red-shifted mode of the G peak consistent with the creation of sp<sup>2 </sup>lattice distortion. Taken together, the elimination of sp<sup>3 </sup>states, the lattice distortion, and the increased rigidity of the particles' crosslinking, are evidence that sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization is eliminating diamondlike seams and forming sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized screw dislocations. These screw dislocations provide both vertical and lateral crosslinking and impose a helicoidal geometry on the mature network. This helicoidal network architecture can be conceptualized as a mesh formed by numerous screw dislocation loops like the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0542" num="0548">To demonstrate the maturation of the sp<sup>x </sup>precursor into a helicoidal network, we start by modeling the effect of sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization on diamondlike seams. Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref> illustrates a multilayer singleton traversed vertically by a cubic diamondlike seam. The illustrated system can be thought of as a small region within a much larger sp<sup>x </sup>precursor system. The seam comprises sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds, and sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds.</p><p id="p-0543" num="0549">During annealing, as shown in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>, the sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization of each of the structure's sp<sup>3 </sup>members requires scission of one of its bonds. Two bonds cannot be broken without creating a high-energy sp<sup>2 </sup>radical. The sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds are the least stable and are destabilized first during annealing (these broken bonds are indicated by dashed lines in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>). Because the sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms and the sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond lines between them comprise lateral lines, the rehybridization of one sp<sup>3 </sup>atom, and the scission of one of its sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds, destabilizes the xy-adjacent sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds along the bond line, resulting in a linear unzipping. The unzipping of entire lines leads to an ABAB pattern of scission and retention&#x2014;if a sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond line is broken, the two z-adjacent bond lines are preserved in order to avoid forming high-energy sp<sup>2 </sup>radicals.</p><p id="p-0544" num="0550">In this way, the diamondlike seams via lateral unzipping, and the associated ring-connections between z-adjacent layers are also eliminated. The singleton from Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref> is therefore disintegrated into a vdW assembly of distorted, disconnected layers. This is illustrated in Frame III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>. This clarifies the diamondlike seams' role in laterally and vertically ring-connecting an sp<sup>x </sup>network. During scission, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>, the lateral mode of crosslinking is retained, but the vertical mode of crosslinking is eliminated. Based on this, we can conclude that the maturation of an sp<sup>x </sup>network eliminates the vertical crosslinking associated with diamondlike seams. If no other vertical crosslinking mechanism were present, maturation would transform the sp<sup>x </sup>precursor into a vdW assembly, which, deprived of vertical crosslinking, would be less rigid than its three-dimensionally crosslinked precursor.</p><p id="p-0545" num="0551">Next, we consider the effects of maturing an sp<sup>x </sup>precursor with chiral rings and chiral columns. Since we already modeled the formation of such a system (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>) in Study A, we appropriate this model as an exemplary sp<sup>x </sup>precursor. However, in order to improve visualization of its maturation, we consider only half of the system from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>, which is shown from two perpendicular horizontal perspectives (H1 and H2) in Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>. Similar to the precursor we modeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>, this new precursor in Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref> comprises a diamondlike seam. However, unlike the precursor modeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>, this precursor's diamondlike seam terminates in a chiral column. The chiral column is highlighted in the H2 perspective of Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, with the chiral chains being indicated by dashed tracing and the sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds connecting the z-adjacent chiral chains being indicated by dashed/dotted tracing.</p><p id="p-0546" num="0552">During maturation, sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>3 </sup>rehybridization of the sp<sup>3 </sup>sites results in bond scission. The sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds are the least stable and are destabilized first. The sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds between the two terminal atomic members of each chiral chain are broken. Each such bond represents the terminus of a lateral sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond line, and its scission destabilizes the rest of the sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond line. Accordingly, the linear unzipping of sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond lines (previously illustrated in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>) occurs in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>. These broken bonds are indicated by dashed lines in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>. To avoid the creation of high-energy sp<sup>2 </sup>radicals, an ABAB pattern of sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond scission and retention is formed.</p><p id="p-0547" num="0553">In the H1 perspective of Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, we can see that the system's diamondlike seams are eliminated as these sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond lines are unzipped. As they are eliminated, the vertical crosslinking associated with them is also eliminated, while the lateral crosslinking remains. If there were no chiral rings or columns, this loss of vertical crosslinking would again result in a vdW assembly of disconnected z-adjacent layers, as it did in the system demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>. However, in this case, a chiral column is present, and the ABAB scission leaves intact the bonds comprising the sp<sup>x </sup>helix within the chiral column. This occurs because, as the sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds between the terminal atomic members of each chiral chain are broken, the z-adjacent sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds between the chiral rings are retained, in keeping with the ABAB pattern of scission and retention. These retained bonds are transformed into sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds due to sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization. This transforms the one-dimensional sp<sup>x </sup>helix into a one-dimensional sp<sup>2 </sup>helix comprising sp<sup>2 </sup>atoms and sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds. These bonds are indicated by dashed tracing in the H2 perspective in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>. Despite the loss of vertical crosslinking associated with diamondlike seams, the system retains vertical crosslinking associated with the chiral columns due to the retention of this sp<sup>2 </sup>helix, which ring-connects the z-adjacent layers. Hence, both lateral and vertical crosslinking are retained during maturation. Chiral rings (and the associated chiral columns of connected chiral rings) are the key to the retention of vertical crosslinking during maturation.</p><p id="p-0548" num="0554">This retention of lateral and vertical crosslinking is shown in Frame III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, which represents the relaxed system illustrated in Frame II. From Frame III, we can see that the helicoidal, ribbon-like graphenic structure formed by maturation has, at its center, a z-directional screw dislocation. The atoms in the central sp<sup>2 </sup>helix are all members of a ring both before and after sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization. Because of this, the formation of an sp<sup>2 </sup>helix during maturation is accompanied by the formation of a helicoidal path of adjacent sp<sup>2 </sup>rings to which the sp<sup>2 </sup>helix belongs as an edge segment. Therefore, from the formation of an sp<sup>2 </sup>helix, we can infer the formation of a graphenic helicoid to which the sp<sup>2 </sup>helix belongs, and from the retention of vertical crosslinking by virtue of the sp<sup>2 </sup>helix, we can infer the retention of vertical ring-connectedness.</p><p id="p-0549" num="0555">We can see from Frame III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref> that, in order to preserve vertical ring-connectedness, the helicoidal graphenic structure must be distorted. Graphenic screw dislocations have been shown to exhibit torsional strain, and along with this torsional strain, we would expect to see a proliferation of lower-frequency, strain-induced phonon states. The higher troughs of Samples S1A and S2A are evidence of this lattice distortion caused by this helicoidal geometry. Additionally, we can see from Frame III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref> that the sp<sup>3 </sup>states are exchanged for sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states. The elimination of sp<sup>3 </sup>states and proliferation of sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states is reflected by the deinterpolation of the D<sub>u </sub>peak position in Samples E1A and E2A. The proliferation of sp<sup>2 </sup>rings associated with the conversion of sp<sup>x </sup>rings into sp<sup>2 </sup>rings is reflected in the increased D<sub>u </sub>peak intensity in Samples E1A and E2A. Hence, the formation of helicoids around chiral columns explains a number of spectral changes associated with maturation.</p><p id="p-0550" num="0556">The edge segment comprising the sp<sup>2 </sup>helix represents an interesting structure. While it comprises a zigzag edge configuration, it is unique in that every atomic member of the segment is bonded to three nearest-neighbor carbon atoms, whereas in a normal zigzag edge configuration only half of the edge atoms are bonded to three carbon atoms. This unique attribute of a helical zigzag results from the fact that it represents the chain of atoms created by a broken-open polygon, in which the internal angles of the broken-open polygon are all less than 180&#xb0;, and thus 3 carbon neighbors are allowed at every edge site (as opposed to a normal zigzag edge, which comprises reflex angles that prevent every edge site from being bonded to three carbon atoms). This novel edge configuration may yield novel electromagnetic and thermal properties, which are known to be dependent on edge configuration in graphenic nanoribbons.</p><p id="p-0551" num="0557">To further clarify the process by which an sp<sup>2 </sup>helix is evolved from an sp<sup>x </sup>helix, we illustrate the transformation diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>. In Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>, a chiral column of 3 z-adjacent chiral rings is represented. Crosshatched circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref> represent sp<sup>2 </sup>atoms, while sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms are represented by white circles.</p><p id="p-0552" num="0558">During maturation, the sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond within each of the chiral rings is broken, as we previously discussed in connection with Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, producing the ABAB pattern of sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond scission and retention. The broken sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds, representing the &#x201c;B&#x201d; phase of the ABAB pattern, are represented as dashed lines and labeled &#x201c;B&#x201d; in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>. Meanwhile, the retained sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds, representing the &#x201c;A&#x201d; phase of the ABAB pattern, are transformed via rehybridization into sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds, which are labeled &#x201c;A&#x201d; in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>. The result is a one-dimensional, helical chain of sp<sup>2 </sup>atoms connected via sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds. Upon relaxation, this sp<sup>2 </sup>helix's curvature becomes more uniform, as shown in Frame III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0553" num="0559">Next, we consider the transformation of the two-dimensional graphenic structure surrounding these one-dimensional helices. As we have established, the formation of an sp<sup>2 </sup>helix is necessarily accompanied by the formation of a graphenic helicoid, within which the sp<sup>2 </sup>helix represents an edge segment. The diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref> mirrors the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>, except that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref> we attempt to represent the ring-connected structure surrounding the sp<sup>x </sup>and sp<sup>2 </sup>helices, such that we can diagram the formation of the helicoidal geometry. In Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref>, we illustrate a diamondlike seam that terminates in the same chiral column we diagrammed in Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>. In keeping with our established convention, the crosshatched circles in Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref> represent sp<sup>2 </sup>atoms and the white circles represent sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms. The white space surrounding the chiral chains represents a ring-connected sp<sup>2 </sup>space surrounding the chiral chains. We can imagine this space extending into the foreground and into the background. The hatched space indicates the ring-connected sp<sup>3 </sup>space associated with the diamondlike seam, and we can imagine this space extending into the foreground.</p><p id="p-0554" num="0560">During maturation, the central sp<sup>x </sup>helix in Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref> undergoes the same transformation that we diagrammed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>. Namely, the sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond within each of the chiral rings is broken, and followed by this, as represented in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref>, the associated sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond line is unzipped. This eliminates the fraction of ring-connected sp<sup>3 </sup>space associated with the &#x201c;B&#x201d; phase of the ABAB pattern. In Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref>, this eliminated space is indicated by dashed lines and labelled &#x201c;B,&#x201d; and we can imagine the eliminated space extending into the foreground of the diagram, like the diamondlike seam illustrated in Frame I. Meanwhile, the retained sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond line representing the &#x201c;A&#x201d; phase of the ABAB pattern is transformed via rehybridization into a sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bond line.

These diagrams illustrate how maturation of an sp<sup>x </sup>network with diamondlike seams and chiral rings can generate a laterally and vertically ring-connected mature network. To illustrate the principles of this transformation, we utilized a simple sp<sup>x </sup>precursor comprising a single diamondlike seam and a single sp<sup>x </sup>helix. However, reasonably large sp<sup>x </sup>networks might comprise countless seams and chiral rings formed via tectonic interactions and grafting. In many cases, as we showed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>, a single tectonic encounter between two edge segments may evolve multiple seams and chiral rings.</p><p id="p-0556" num="0562">For this reason, it is desirable to model the transformation of a simple, exemplary sp<sup>x </sup>precursor that comprises multiple seams and chiral rings. Since we already modeled the formation of such a system (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>) in Study A, we return to it for this present purpose. We derived this hypothetical sp<sup>x </sup>network from the tectonic encounter and subsequent pyrolytic growth that were illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>36</b></figref>. In order to facilitate visual evaluation of the system's transformation, we illustrate it from two perpendicular horizontal perspectives (H1 and H2) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0557" num="0563">In Frame I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>, we can see that the sp<sup>x </sup>precursor comprises two distinct diamondlike seams (each seam is circled in the H2 perspective), as well as chiral columns representing the lateral termini of those seams (in the H2 perspective of Frame I, the chiral columns are indicated by dashed tracing). During maturation, sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization leads to scission of the sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bond within each of the chiral rings, as discussed in connection with the transformation of the system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref> (itself a subsystem of the system under consideration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>, as may be recalled).

First, the broad peak fitted at 2&#x3b8;=18.454&#xb0; in Sample B4, which accounted for 30.4%, is not fitted in this range in Sample B4A's profile. We attributed this peak in Sample B4 to a phase of expanded interlayer spacing caused by z-directional bowing of graphenic regions due to intralayer compression beyond their critical buckling strain. At the same time, in Sample B4A, we see the emergence of an even broader fitted peak at 2&#x3b8;=29.489&#xb0;, corresponding to a d-spacing of 3.03 &#x212b;, with a peak area of 33.2%. These spectral changes suggest an overall shift toward smaller interlayer d-spacings, and the peak center at 2&#x3b8;=29.489&#xb0; indicates potential interlayer compression.</p><p id="p-0564" num="0569">Additionally, comparing Sample B4 to Sample B4A, we note a shift in the &#x3c;100&#x3e; peak from 2&#x3b8;=43.138&#xb0; to 2&#x3b8;=43.3960, respectively, corresponding to a reduction in &#x3c;100&#x3e; d-spacing from 2.10 &#x212b; to 2.08 &#x212b;. We also see an increase in the main &#x3c;002&#x3e; peak at 2&#x3b8;=23.535&#xb0;, corresponding to an increase in the average interlayer d-spacing from 3.63 &#x212b; to 3.78 &#x212b;.</p><p id="p-0565" num="0570">These changes are explained by the transformed crosslinking structure. The cross-section of a diamondlike seam in the &#x3c;100&#x3e; plane is a line (i.e. one-dimensional), whereas the cross-section of a screw dislocation in the &#x3c;100&#x3e; plane is a point (i.e. zero-dimensional). Therefore, the elimination of one-dimensional pins during maturation leaves only zero-dimensional pins coinciding with the endpoints of the eliminated one-dimensional pins. With the diamondlike seams unzipped, the bowed layers are only pinned at points, instead of along entire lines, and they have more freedom to relax.</p><p id="p-0566" num="0571">The lateral relaxation of these bowed regions has the effect of reducing the amplitude of their z-deflections (thereby eliminating Sample B4's broad peak at 2&#x3b8;=18.454&#xb0;, which was attributed to bowing), but obtains this by distributing intralayer compressive strain and lattice distortion more globally. This increases the average interlayer d-spacing (the d-spacing associated with the main &#x3c;002&#x3e; peak increases from 3.78 &#x212b; to 3.63 &#x212b;). It also is reflected in the shift of the broad interlayer peak from 2&#x3b8;=18.454&#xb0; to 2&#x3b8;=29.489&#xb0;. We see increased compressive strain in the &#x3c;100&#x3e; peak, the d-spacing of which is reduced by maturation from 2.10 &#x212b; to 2.08 &#x212b;.</p><p id="p-0567" num="0572">Unlike the other fitted peaks, which are broad and represent low correlations, the peaks at 2&#x3b8;=21.660&#xb0; and 2&#x3b8;=35.9440 are sharp, suggesting features with high periodicity. The most likely cause for these are interlayer periodicities that are consistently formed at the screw dislocation cores of the helicoids.</p><p id="p-0568" num="0573">Having now explored the formation of sp<sup>x </sup>networks and their maturation into helicoidal networks and having understood the basic features of these anthracitic networks, we now turn to understanding tectonic zone transitions and their effect on mature, helicoidal networks, and we demonstrate how tectonic zone transitions can lead to the formation of structural variants, including sp<sup>x </sup>double helices, sp<sup>2 </sup>double helices, and double helicoids.</p><p id="p-0569" num="0574">First, we return to the helicoidal network illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref>, wherein the two conjoined helicoids, and the screw dislocations from which they derive, have the same chirality.

In Frame I, corresponding to the original scenario, we show the base resulting from sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting across an interface in which the edge elevations are inverted between Offset Zone I and Offset Zone II. In this scenario, we have already seen that the chiral rings R<sub>2-C </sub>and R<sub>4-C </sub>are formed at the transitions between each of the two offset zones and the level zone between them.

In this alternative scenario, the chiral rings R<sub>2-C </sub>and R<sub>4-C </sub>are still formed at the transitions between each of the two offset zones and the level zone between them.

If this singleton were then transformed into a helicoidal network via sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization, the screw dislocation loop formed by the two sp<sup>2 </sup>helices of opposite chirality would be less strained. From initial formation of the base-layer chiral rings to the intermediate formation of an sp<sup>x </sup>network with mixed dislocations, to the ultimate formation of the helicoidal network, chirality is preserved. Anthracite researchers have observed that screw dislocation loops often involve two xy-adjacent screw dislocations with opposite chirality.

Instead, only sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting occurred across the E<sub>1</sub>-E<sub>2</sub><sup>c </sup>interface, so the primordial domains G<sub>1 </sub>and G<sub>2 </sub>were only ring-connected by virtue of the sp<sup>x </sup>ring-connections (R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3-C</sub>R<sub>4</sub>, R<sub>5 </sub>and R<sub>6</sub>) formed from these sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds. After its formation, the base layer remains sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected while G<sub>IV </sub>is constructed over it. As a result, during maturation, the base layer of G<sub>IV </sub>is completely unzipped along this sp<sup>3</sup>-grafted interface, such that the primordial regions associated with G<sub>1 </sub>and G<sub>2 </sub>become once again disconnected at the base. For the system to remain ring-connected, these two primordial regions of the base must be ring-connected via some path of adjacent rings across the higher layers.

Grafting across these stochastic interfaces and subsequent higher-layer growth leads to the formation of complex, arbitrarily large sp<sup>x </sup>networks. Maturation of these sp<sup>x </sup>precursors forms helicoidal networks of comparable size, comprising numerous screw dislocations. The geometry of these mature networks can be intuited as networks of seamlessly conjoined helicoids-similar to a class of parametric surfaces that have been described as &#x201c;rheotomic surfaces&#x201d; in the field of architectural design.</p><p id="p-0591" num="0596">A natural question to ask is whether or not a mature, screw-dislocation network comprises a singleton or an assembly&#x2014;i.e. whether its membership of graphenic structures is singular or plural. This determination may be straightforward if the mature system is derived in silico from a small-scale, hypothetical precursor with a precisely defined molecular structure. However, to make this determination for a larger-scale, macromolecular precursor system would require mapping its exact molecular structure, which we cannot practically accomplish. What we can establish generally&#x2014;i.e. for any real sp<sup>x </sup>precursor, without having mapped its exact molecular structure&#x2014;is that its maturation will result in the formation of a helicoidal network comprising either a helicoidal singleton or a helicoidal assembly. We can also establish that each outcome is consistent with our empirical observations in Study E (i.e. observations of generalized, system-level rigidification and strengthening after maturation).</p><p id="p-0592" num="0597">The first possibility is an outcome herein described as a &#x201c;singleton-to-singleton&#x201d; maturation. In this type of maturation, a sp<sup>x </sup>network, which comprises a singleton, is matured into a helicoidal singleton. This type of maturation would be consistent with the empirical observations in Study E (i.e. observations of increased system-level rigidity and strength after rehybridization). A singleton-to-singleton transformation is produced from sp<sup>x </sup>precursors constructed upon an sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected base. To illustrate how a singleton-to-singleton maturation might occur in a reasonably large, complex system, we describe a first scenario in which this outcome is favored. We shall refer to this scenario as &#x201c;Scenario A.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0593" num="0598">In Scenario A, we firstly postulate that, during pyrolytic nucleation and growth of an sp<sup>x </sup>precursor, a multitude of tectonic encounters occur between ring-disordered primordial domains, resulting in a multitude of tectonic interfaces. Due to the out-of-phase edge deflections of the ring-disordered primordial domains, the interfaces are incoherent and stochastic in nature. Wherever level zones occur between two primordial domains, sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting creates sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connections between the participating domains, and wherever offset zones or crossover points occur between two primordial domains, sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting creates sp<sup>x </sup>ring-connections between the participating domains.</p><p id="p-0594" num="0599">In Scenario A, we secondly postulate that all tectonic interfaces include at least one level zone. From this it follows that, after grafting, all of the primordial domains under consideration will be sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected to one another, such that there will exist a path of adjacent sp<sup>2 </sup>rings connecting every primordial domain to every other primordial domain. Hence, the base itself will be sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected. It also follows that any tectonic interfaces that include an offset zone in addition to the level zone(s) will comprise at least one interfacial zone transition where a chiral ring will be formed. Lastly, it follows that any higher layers grown over the base will also themselves be sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected (by virtue of sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting across higher-layer interfaces).</p><p id="p-0595" num="0600">In Scenario A, we thirdly postulate that continued vertical and lateral growth over the base layer forms an sp<sup>x </sup>network comprising the base layer and some number of higher layers that are ring-connected to the base via diamondlike seams (formed over sp<sup>3</sup>-grafted offset zones) and via chiral columns (formed over tectonic zone transitions between sp<sup>3</sup>-grafted offset zones and sp<sup>2</sup>-grafted level zones). As we have already established, these chiral columns formed over level-to-offset zone transitions will comprise a single sp<sup>x </sup>helix and will each be positioned at the terminus of a seam.</p><p id="p-0596" num="0601">In instances consistent with Scenario A, we have already observed (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>36</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>) that, so long as the underlying base formed by grafting is sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected, an sp<sup>x </sup>network constructed over it will not disintegrate into multiple distinct graphenic structures during maturation but will instead remain ring-connected. Since sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds (and therefore sp<sup>2 </sup>rings) are retained during sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization, the sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected base will remain sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected via base-layer sp<sup>2 </sup>ring pathways. Furthermore, any sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected higher layers that are sp<sup>x </sup>ring-connected to the base via diamondlike seams and chiral columns will remain ring-connected to the base as the sp<sup>x </sup>helices within the chiral columns are transformed into sp<sup>2 </sup>helices. Hence, higher layers will remain ring-connected with respect to the base layer, and the base layer will remain itself ring-connected, creating a helicoidal singleton.</p><p id="p-0597" num="0602">The other possible type of maturation for a sp<sup>x </sup>precursor is a &#x201c;singleton-to-assembly&#x201d; maturation. In this type of maturation, the sp<sup>x </sup>precursor, which comprises a singleton, is matured into an assembly of multiple graphenic structures. A singleton-to-assembly maturation is associated with a ring-connected, sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected base. To illustrate how a singleton-to-assembly maturation might occur in a reasonably large system, we describe a second scenario in which this outcome could theoretically occur. We shall refer to this scenario as &#x201c;Scenario B.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0598" num="0603">In Scenario B, we firstly postulate that, during pyrolytic nucleation and growth of an sp<sup>x </sup>precursor, a multitude of tectonic encounters occur between ring-disordered primordial domains, resulting in a multitude of tectonic interfaces. Due to the out-of-phase edge deflections of the ring-disordered primordial domains, the interfaces are incoherent and stochastic in nature. Wherever level zones occur between two primordial domains, sp<sup>2 </sup>grafting creates sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connections between the participating domains, and wherever offset zones or crossover points occur between two primordial domains, sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting creates sp<sup>x </sup>ring-connections between the participating domains.</p><p id="p-0599" num="0604">In Scenario B, we secondly postulate that none of the tectonic interfaces pertaining to some subset of primordial domains include a level zone. Instead, their tectonic interfaces include only offset zones and crossover points formed via the stochastic crisscrossing of the participating edges. During grafting, these primordial domains are only able to undergo sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting due to the total absence of level zones in their tectonic interfaces. It follows that only sp<sup>x </sup>rings are formed at their interfaces and that this subset of domains is therefore sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected with respect to the surrounding base, of which they are part. It also follows that the base itself is sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected.</p><p id="p-0600" num="0605">In Scenario B, we thirdly postulate that continued vertical and lateral growth over the base layer forms an sp<sup>x </sup>network comprising the base layer and some number of higher layers that are ring-connected to the base via diamondlike seams (formed over sp<sup>3</sup>-grafted offset zones) and via chiral columns (formed over crossover points). As we have already established, these chiral columns formed over crossover points will each contain an sp<sup>x </sup>double helix and will each be positioned at the terminus of a seam.</p><p id="p-0601" num="0606">In a scenario like Scenario B, we have already observed (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>61</b>-<b>62</b></figref>) that if the underlying base form by grafting is sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected, then it is possible for the base&#x2014;and an sp<sup>x </sup>network constructed over it&#x2014;to disintegrate into a helicoidal assembly during rehybridization. Specifically, it follows from our second postulate in Scenario B&#x2014;i.e. that some subset of the primordial regions are exclusively grafted to the surrounding base layer via sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds&#x2014;that sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization may lead to the complete unzipping of the sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds and severing of these primordial regions' sp<sup>x </sup>ring connections to the surrounding base. Additionally, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>61</b>-<b>62</b></figref>, this unzipping, extended into higher layers, may eliminate any higher-layer pathways that might preserve the ring-connectedness of the severed primordial regions, resulting in the singleton's disintegration into a helicoidal assembly comprising multiple, distinct graphenic structures.</p><p id="p-0602" num="0607">Therefore, in Scenario B, where an sp<sup>x </sup>network is constructed over an sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected base, it is theoretically possible for a singleton-to-assembly maturation to occur. However, for this outcome to be consistent with the empirical observations in Study E (i.e. observations of increased system-level rigidity and strength after rehybridization), the resulting assembly must be able to resist the shear failure observed in a typical vdW assembly. The creation of an assembly of disconnected members seems inconsistent with these observations. However, we can in fact conclude that even in the instance of a singleton-to-assembly maturation, resulting in disintegration, the resulting assembly will be interlocked so that it cannot shear apart.</p><p id="p-0603" num="0608">This conclusion follows from our third postulate in Scenario B&#x2014;i.e. that the sp<sup>x </sup>network comprises at least one higher layer. So long as an sp<sup>x </sup>network comprises at least one higher layer, even if a singleton-to-assembly maturation occurs, such that disintegration results in double helicoids of distinct graphenic members, the double helicoids will result in a where double helicoids are formed, even if disintegration occurs, the braid-like geometry of the double helicoids will create an open, interlocking chain preventing the individual, disconnected helicoids from being separated.</p><p id="p-0604" num="0609">The dependency on this interlocking mechanism on the presence of higher layers is demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b></figref>, for helpful reference, we show again Stages I and II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref>, wherein the hypothetical E<sub>1</sub>-E<sub>2</sub><sup>c </sup>interface comprised a crossover point in the center, such that only sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting occurred and an sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected base was formed. In Stages III and IV of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref>, we modeled the growth of a multilayer sp<sup>x </sup>network G<sub>IV </sub>over this base, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>62</b></figref>, we modeled the singleton-to-assembly maturation associated with G<sub>IV</sub>. In this maturation, the precursor G<sub>IV </sub>disintegrated into the two graphenic structures G<sub>i </sub>and G<sub>ii</sub>, which together comprised a double helicoid possessing an interlocking, braid-like geometry.</p><p id="p-0605" num="0610">In Frame II-F of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b></figref>, we illustrate what the final result would have been if the sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected base in Frame II was matured prior to any further growth. As shown in Frame II-F, the unzipping of sp<sup>3</sup>-sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds along the original E<sub>1</sub>-E<sub>2</sub><sup>c </sup>tectonic interface causes the base to disintegrate, but without any higher layers in the sp<sup>x </sup>precursor, the two resulting graphenic structures do not interlock with each other. Instead, the assembly comprises a truncated double-helicoid in which neither of the constituent helicoids complete a turn around the axis.</p><p id="p-0606" num="0611">For interlocking to occur, at least one higher layer is needed in the sp<sup>x </sup>precursor, such that the double-helicoid formed during maturation is not so truncated. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref>, wherein Frames I, II and III from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref> are shown again for helpful reference. In Frame III, a sp<sup>x </sup>network comprising Y-dislocations and a nucleated second layer has been formed over the base. In Frame III-F of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref>, we illustrate what the final result might have been if the sp<sup>x </sup>network in Frame III was matured. In this case, the double-helicoid is elongated enough for the two graphenic structures to form an interlocking braid. This demonstrates the need for higher layers above the tectonic interfaces of the base. A monolayer base, when matured, cannot form these interlocking braids.</p><p id="p-0607" num="0612">While the graphenic structures in an individual double helicoid could theoretically shear apart via differential rotation around their common axis, this rotational mobility is impossible in a network of multiple double-helicoids. Returning to Scenario B, it follows from our postulates that the helicoidal assembly formed via a singleton-to-assembly maturation would comprise a network of many double-helicoids. Even those primordial domains postulated in Scenario B to be sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected with respect to the surrounding base would have crossover points distributed along their incoherent tectonic interfaces&#x2014;a feature that we have established would create double helicoids. These arrays of double helicoids lack the rotational mobility to be sheared apart, making it necessary to break a graphenic structure in order to break the assembly.</p><p id="p-0608" num="0613">Scenarios A and B are not intended to be limiting, but rather to demonstrate the only two theoretically possible outcomes of sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization of an sp<sup>x </sup>precursor&#x2014;i.e. a singleton-to-singleton maturation or a singleton-to-assembly maturation- and furthermore to demonstrate how, regardless of which outcome might pertain to a given precursor, the mature system evolved might be expected to exhibit increased rigidity and strength. Either outcome is accompanied by the formation of a helicoidal network that cannot fail via shear, but only via breakage of some graphenic region. This is consistent with our observations of the superior mechanical properties of the mature perimorphic frameworks in Samples E1A and E2A compared to the frameworks in Samples E1 and E2.</p><p id="p-0609" num="0614">To conclude our discussion of singleton-to-singleton and singleton-to-assembly maturations, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>B</figref> we represent these potential outcomes with multigraphs that permit us to analyze ring-connectedness of the base before and after maturation. Each of the 5 nodes in one of these multigraphs represents a primordial domain, and the multigraph as a whole represents the base constructed from grafting between these 5 primordial domains (although the base in most real systems may comprise many more primordial domains). A link connecting two nodes indicates the ring-connectedness of the two associated primordial domains with respect to each other. The color of the link indicates the type of ring-connectedness. A solid link represents a path constructed exclusively from sp<sup>2 </sup>rings. Two nodes that are reachable from each other by a path of one or more solid links are therefore sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected with respect to each other. A dashed link represents a path that includes an sp<sup>x </sup>ring.</p><p id="p-0610" num="0615">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>A</figref>, we represent a singleton-to-singleton maturation. In the left-hand multigraph, the 5 nodes represent a hypothetical base formed via the grafting and coalescence of 5 primordial domains. Every node in the multigraph is reachable from every other node via a path of one or more solid links or, alternatively, a path of one or more dashed links. The reachability of any node from any other node via a path of solid links indicates that each of the 5 primordial domains that form the base are sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected to one another. Therefore, the base itself is sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected. The reachability of any node from any other node via a path of dashed links indicates that the 5 primordial domains are also ring-connected to one another via at least one path of adjacent rings that includes an sp<sup>x </sup>ring.</p><p id="p-0611" num="0616">In the right-hand multigraph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>A</figref>, we represent the base after the singleton-to-singleton maturation of the sp<sup>x </sup>network grown over the base. The elimination of sp<sup>x </sup>rings during sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization is indicated in this right-hand multigraph by the absence of dashed links between the nodes. This occurs because the sp<sup>x </sup>rings in the system are either eliminated or transformed into sp<sup>2 </sup>rings during rehybridization. Every node remains reachable from every other node via a path of one or more solid links, indicating the persistence of the base's sp<sup>2 </sup>rings, and therefore the retention of its sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connectedness. Any higher layers grown over this base become sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected to it via conversion of sp<sup>x </sup>helices to sp<sup>2 </sup>helices and the associated formation of helicoids. Therefore, by showing the retention of the base's sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connectedness, we show the sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connectedness of the mature network constructed on it. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>A</figref> therefore represents a singleton-to-singleton maturation.</p><p id="p-0612" num="0617">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>B</figref>, we represent a singleton-to-assembly maturation. In the left-hand multigraph, the 5 nodes represent a hypothetical base formed via the grafting and coalescence of 5 primordial domains. In this multigraph, every node is reachable from every other node via a path of links. This indicates that each of the 5 primordial domains are ring-connected to one another, and that the base itself is ring-connected. Additionally, four nodes (Nodes 1, 2, 4 and 5) are reachable from one another via a path of one or more solid links, indicating that these four primordial domains are sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-connected with respect to one another. However, Node 3 is not reachable from the other nodes by a path of solid links. Node 3 therefore represents a primordial domain that is sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected with respect to the other primordial domains. Accordingly, the base itself is sp<sup>2 </sup>ring-disconnected.</p><p id="p-0613" num="0618">In the right-hand multigraph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>B</figref>, we represent the base after the singleton-to-assembly maturation of the sp<sup>x </sup>network grown over the base.

Node 3, however, is no longer linked to the surrounding nodes by either solid or dashed links, indicating that this primordial domain has been disconnected from the surrounding base, and that a disintegration into multiple distinct graphenic domains has occurred.</p><p id="p-0614" num="0619">However, while the primordial domain associated with Node 3 is represented as disconnected in the right-hand multigraph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>B</figref>, we know that, so long as a multilayer precursor was grown over the base, this primordial domain will be physically interlocked with the four other domains. This interlocking geometry is indicated by the solid links between the other nodes and Node 3. Each solid link represents the existence of at least one path of sp<sup>2 </sup>rings extending from a primordial domain into higher layers and interlocking in a braidlike, open chain with an analogous, higher-layer path extending from Node 3. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>B</figref> therefore represents singleton-to-assembly maturation, wherein a disconnected region of the base may be physically interlocked with the surrounding regions of the base.</p><p id="p-0615" num="0620">This concept is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b></figref>, an helicoidal assembly of two graphenic structures comprising two double-helicoids.

The fringe lines exhibit a distinctive &#x201c;sliced&#x201d; pattern, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b>B</figref>, with the slices cutting across the nematically aligned layers. Several &#x201c;slices&#x201d; are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b>C</figref> with a dashed line. This sliced appearance is due to a regular vertical offset in the positions of laterally adjacent fringe segments. The vertical offset corresponds to the z-displacement of a helicoidal graphenic lattice over each 180&#xb0; turn around the dislocation line. In other locations, the fringe lines are blurred, as indicated by the circled region in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b>C</figref>; these regions likely correspond to curved regions between screw dislocations.

By analyzing the HRTEM image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b>D</figref>, we can see that the sp<sup>2 </sup>helices at the centers of these two nearby helicoids were less than 1 nm apart. These images show that the screw dislocations at the center of the graphenic helicoids can extend across numerous layers, and that they can be arranged in xy-periodic, z-aligned arrays. Because the screw dislocations are formed from the chiral columns at the end of diamondlike seams, their density reflects the density of the diamondlike seams and the spacing between chiral columns.</p><p id="p-0619" num="0624">A preferred variant of a helicoidal network is one that averages between 2 and 5 layers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>A</figref> shows a helicoidal x-network comprising a perimorphic framework with an equiaxed, cuboidal morphology (synthesized from 1050&#xb0; C. annealing of x-sp<sup>x </sup>frameworks formed via 580&#xb0; C. pyrolysis of C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>over porous MgO template particles derived from precipitated magnesite template precursor particles). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>B</figref>, the controlled mesoporous architecture of the perimorphic framework is shown, with a highly consistent perimorphic wall thickness. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>72</b>B</figref>, the perimorphic wall is shown at higher magnification. It averages 2-3 layers and appears more kinked than thicker walls because of its increased flexibility. For some applications, a flexible anthracitic network may be preferred. This is an example of how synthetic anthracitic networks can be rationally engineered to have properties unavailable from natural anthracitic networks.</p><p id="p-0620" num="0625">The various anthracitic networks described in the present disclosure share certain generic attributes as a function of their layered architecture and nematic alignment. First, they provide more interlayer coupling than non-layered architectures, and we expect system cohesion to benefit substantially from &#x3c0;-&#x3c0; interactions. Compared to schwarzite or other non-layered geometries, we intuit that a denser, layered architecture at the nanometer-scale is preferred due to its combination of covalent and non-covalent modes of cohesion. Density reduction may be obtained by coupling this denser, layered architecture with mesoscale, density-reducing pore phases, following hierarchical design principles. Mesoporous and macroporous perimorphic morphologies constructed from helicoidal networks represent a way to obtain controllable density without sacrificing subnanometer-scale interlayer spacing.</p><p id="p-0621" num="0626">Analogous to the hierarchical approach to density reduction, a hierarchical approach to crosslinking density is also appealing. With respect to the perimorphic framework shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>72</b>A-<b>72</b>B</figref>, the system's crosslinking can be conceptualized as occurring at two distinct scales, both of which are engineerable. At the local scale, the crosslinking derives from dislocations. Local crosslinking is represented by the crosshatching in the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b></figref>. At this scale, crosslinking density is determined by dislocation density, which is in turn determined by the areal density of tectonic interfaces and linear density of interfacial zone transitions along the interfaces. However, the system also possesses mesoscale crosslinking deriving from the topology of the perimorphic wall and even more primordially from the templating surface, and its density may be modulated independently of the local crosslinking. Mesoscale crosslinking is diagrammed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b></figref>, where mesoscale crosslinking density descends (i.e. I&#x3e;II&#x3e;III), while local crosslinking density is constant, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b></figref> by the crosshatching. The modulation of mesoscale crosslinking density (i.e. &#x201c;compactness&#x201d;) is described in the '760 and '918 applications.</p><p id="p-0622" num="0627">Other benefits may be derived specifically from the helicoidal network geometry. The superelasticity and spring-like nature of graphenic helicoids has been established, with in silico studies showing a single helicoid sustaining tensile deformation of 1500% without fracture. Failure of a helicoidal network would likely initially occur via covalent breakage of network locations, following by a plastic yielding and unravelling. The mesh-like architecture should offer good toughness properties.</p><p id="p-0623" num="0628">Helicoidal networks (and also sp<sup>x </sup>networks) contain numerous edges on the surface that may be easily chemically functionalized&#x2014;a fundamental requirement in many applications. Both helicoidal networks and sp<sup>x </sup>networks are easily oxidized with mild oxidants (e.g. sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide) in line with the procedures described in the '580 application. These surface edges represent the tops of the conjoined and interlocking helicoids. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>A</figref>, which shows the hydroxylated edge formed by the vertical terminus of two conjoined helicoids. The hydroxyls consist of an oxygen atom (hatched in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>A</figref>) and a hydrogen atom (speckled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>A</figref>). Additionally, sp<sup>x </sup>networks can be expected to have numerous edge sites on the surface, left behind when their higher-layer growth is terminated. Edge sites on anthracitic surfaces have the added benefit of promoting phenolic hydroxyl groups with increased thermal stability. Upon oxidation of these edges (as well as reactive basal plane sites) a rich variety of secondary phases may be applied to the surface of the anthracitic networks, including inorganic, preceramic oligomers and polymers.</p><p id="p-0624" num="0629">Another appealing surface feature of helicoidal networks is the ubiquitous presence of mouths representing entrances into the network's interlayer labyrinth. One such mouth is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>B</figref>. These mouths offer ubiquitous access points for infiltration or exfiltration of fluids, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>74</b>B</figref>. This make helicoidal networks an appealing architecture for electrodes where rapid mass transfer into and out of an interlayer pore space is desired for charging and discharging. Additionally, the expanded interlayer d-spacing observed in helicoidal networks should increase their storage capacity compared to graphitic electrodes. In particular, helicoidal networks should be highly appealing for high-rate, high-capacity battery electrodes.</p><p id="p-0625" num="0630">In systems where the primordial level zones are longer (perhaps due to less lattice curvature), longer rows of xy-adjacent sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds are formed, increasing the number of xy-adjacent sp<sup>2 </sup>rings between sp<sup>3</sup>-grafted offset zones. This will increase the average distance between the helicoids, creating a less densely crosslinked helicoidal network. In systems where the primordial level zones are shorter (perhaps due to more lattice curvature and more frequent crisscrossing), shorter rows of xy-adjacent sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds are formed, decreasing the number of xy-adjacent sp<sup>2 </sup>rings between sp<sup>3</sup>-grafted offset zones. This will reduce the average distance between helicoids, creating a more densely crosslinked helicoidal network.</p><p id="p-0626" num="0631">Helicoidal networks comprise the preferred variant of synthetic anthracitic frameworks. They generally exhibit superior mechanical properties compared to sp<sup>x </sup>networks. The difference is readily observed in applications. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>A</figref> is the fracture surface of an epoxy specimen containing a 0.5% weight loading of an sp<sup>x </sup>network. Similar to Samples E1 and E3, each particle comprises a perimorphic framework with a sheet-of-cells morphology and an sp<sup>x </sup>network. The pyrolytic formation of these sp<sup>x </sup>networks was directed by the same hydromagnesite-derived MgO templates utilized in Samples E1 and E3. Pyrolysis of C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>was utilized to create a few-layer sp<sup>x </sup>network on the template particles. After extraction of the template, the singletons were lightly oxidized and dispersed into a DGEBA-type epoxy resin, which was then cured using an aliphatic amine.</p><p id="p-0627" num="0632"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>C</figref> are higher-resolution images of the same epoxy fracture surface. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>C</figref>, a wavy cluster of sheet-like frameworks are embedded in the surrounding epoxy matrix. The cluster is circled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>C</figref>. Close examination of the texture of the clusters reveals the nanocellular subunits within the sheet-of-nanocells particle morphology. The waviness indicates the sheets' flexibility. No significant epoxy debris was observed around the frameworks embedded throughout the fracture plane, and it appears that the fracture was at the interface between the epoxy and the frameworks.</p><p id="p-0628" num="0633">By comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b>A</figref> is the fracture surface of an epoxy specimen containing a similar loading of perimorphic frameworks of the same derivation and morphology, but in this case the frameworks represent helicoidal networks, matured on the template. Unlike the clean fracture surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>A</figref>, the fracture surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b>A</figref> appears to be covered with debris (the debris appears as bright spots scattered across the fracture surface). This debris was not removable from the fracture surface by any amount of cleaning with compressed air. Upon examination at higher magnification, we can deduce that the debris is produced by explosive failure of the cured epoxy nanocomposite in the vicinity of the perimorphic frameworks. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b>B</figref>, we can see the result of one such explosive failure. The perimorphic framework cannot be distinguished at the point of failure, which comprises a brightly charged composite structure, and it does not appear that the failure occurred at the interface. This point of failure and the surrounding debris field are circled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b>B</figref>. At yet higher magnification, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b>C</figref>, we can observe that the fragments are fragments of epoxy, and that they are not just resting on the fracture surface but are physically embedded in the surface, explaining why they could not be removed. It was also confirmed that a corresponding debris field was present on the opposing fracture surface in the same location. This embedding of the epoxy fragments in the fracture surfaces suggests the force of these explosive failures.</p><p id="p-0629" num="0634">This demonstrates the utility of synthetic anthracitic networks in composite applications. In the '473 application and '843B2 patent, the use of &#x201c;cellular carbons&#x201d; comprising perimorphic frameworks is shown to be advantageous compared to non-perimorphic morphologies. These applications are herein incorporated by reference.

However, practical considerations might still restrict the size of the objects that could be made. To fabricate macroscopic anthracitic networks, it would be appealing to be able to fuse smaller, individual anthracitic networks. We now demonstrate how this may be done by creating a macroscopic preform comprising an assembly of distinct sp<sup>x </sup>networks (i.e. an &#x201c;sp<sup>x </sup>preform&#x201d;), then maturing the sp<sup>x </sup>preform to ring-connect the distinct sp<sup>x </sup>networks during maturation.

The outermost layer of the sp<sup>x </sup>precursor G<sub>A </sub>is represented (above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>78</b></figref>). This layer is in vdW contact with the outermost layer of the sp<sup>x </sup>precursor G<sub>B </sub>(below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>78</b></figref>). The non-native bilayer shown in Frame I includes two lines of sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms in G<sub>B</sub>. These sp<sup>3 </sup>states, which represent the z-directional termini of diamondlike seams, are potential reaction sites during maturation.</p><p id="p-0633" num="0638">While in static contact, the sp<sup>x </sup>networks G<sub>A </sub>and G<sub>B </sub>are heated and matured, during which the two lines of tertiary sp<sup>3 </sup>atoms in G<sub>B </sub>are dehydrogenated and rehybridized, becoming sp<sup>2 </sup>radicals as the underlying diamondlike seams are unzipped. The geometry of the underlying helicoids pushes G<sub>B</sub>'s sp<sup>2 </sup>radicals toward G<sub>A</sub>, as we attempt to illustrate in Frame II of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>78</b></figref>, where the radicals are circled. A radical cascade reaction bonds G<sub>B</sub>'s lines of sp<sup>2 </sup>radicals with z-adjacent atoms in G<sub>A</sub>, forming sp<sup>2 </sup>rings. This reaction extends the helicoids across the non-native bilayer, as shown in Frame III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>78</b></figref>, and pushes radical-terminated edge dislocations to surfaces.</p><p id="p-0634" num="0639">In this way, an assembly-to-singleton or an assembly-to-assembly maturation occurs, depending on whether the sp<sup>x </sup>precursors disintegrate during maturation. However, in either scenario, a larger helicoidal network is formed that extends across the bilayer contacts of the sp<sup>x </sup>precursors. The non-native bilayers are cinched together by the helicoidal geometry. If this larger helicoidal network comprises a helicoidal assembly, its graphenic member structures are interlocked with one another in braidlike double helicoids.</p><p id="p-0635" num="0640">Sample F1 comprises perimorphic x-sp<sup>x </sup>networks with a sheet-of-cells morphology similar to the samples in Study E.

Pressing these granules pushed the sheet-like frameworks further together, removing the majority of the interstitial pores between frameworks. This densification increases the alignment and contact area of the frameworks, creating a vdW assembly. The densification is reflected in Sample F2's reduced porosity of 0.079 cm<sup>3</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and surface area of 451 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, as shown in Table 10. The Sample F2 adsorption-desorption isotherm is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b>B</figref>, and the pore size distribution is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref>. The reduced specific porosity of Sample F2 is accompanied by an elimination of most of the mesopores in the range of 3 to 4 nm and an increase in the mesopores in the 2 to 2.5 nm, demonstrating compaction and deformation of the perimorphic walls of the cellular subunits. The increased formation of non-native bilayers, and associated vdW cohesion, causes pelletization, as observed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>79</b>B</figref>. A 4-pt conductivity probe was used to measure the surface resistivity of the sample, which was 16 &#x3a9;/sq.</p><p id="p-0638" num="0642">Sample F3 comprises the Sample F2 pellet after being annealed at 1050&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. During annealing, the specific porosity and specific surface area is reduced to 0.028 cm<sup>3</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 233 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, respectively, as shown in Table 10. This represents a 65% reduction in the pore volume. The pellet thickness is reduced by 6.7%. Assuming an isotropic reduction the pellet's overall shrinkage would only be 19%. Together, the 65% reduction in pore volume, as measured by N<sub>2 </sub>adsorption (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b>C</figref> is the adsorption-desorption isotherm for Sample F3), and the pellet's shrinkage of only 19%, indicate that some of the pore structures have been sealed with respect to the N<sub>2 </sub>gas during adsorption.</p><p id="p-0639" num="0643">This indicates that, during maturation, the lines of sp<sup>2 </sup>ring connections formed between the layers at bilayer contacts not only cinch the non-native bilayers together, but have a zipper-like effect, drawing together surrounding regions of the layers. This zipping effect occurs via the same mechanism at both inter-network and intra-network non-native bilayers. The zipped regions cause bottlenecking of a fraction of the mesopores (i.e. pores over 2 nm) behind micropores (i.e. pores under 2 nm), as shown in the pore size distribution in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref>. These mesopores become inaccessible to N<sub>2</sub>. This indicates the formation of a macroscopic helicoidal x-network. This is corroborated by Sample F3's reduced surface resistivity of 0.06 &#x3a9;/sq&#x2014;a 2 to 3 order of magnitude reduction from Sample F2. This reflects the sp<sup>3</sup>-to-sp<sup>2 </sup>rehybridization associated with maturation, an elimination of junction resistance (due to transport requiring interlayer tunneling) between microscopic anthracitic networks, and the associated formation of a macroscopic x-carbon.</p><p id="p-0640" num="0644">Sample F4 comprises the Sample F1 granules after a two-step sequence of annealing and then pressing (in that sequence). Unlike Sample F2, Sample F4 did not comprise a pellet-despite having been pressed under the same conditions as Sample F3, the annealed granules would not form a pellet. The BJH specific porosity and BET specific surface area for Sample F4 was 0.249 cm<sup>3</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 473 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, respectively, as shown in Table 10. The Sample F4 adsorption-desorption isotherm is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b>D</figref>, and the pore size distribution is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0641" num="0645">Sample F4 did not form a pellet because maturation caused the anthracitic networks to rigidify (as observed in Study E) prior to pressing them together. In other words, the annealed granules that were pressed in Procedure F4 had already matured into macroscopic, equiaxed helicoidal x-networks. The granules were densified and broken during pressing, so Sample F4 had a mixed granular-powdery consistency. However, the rigidified perimorphic walls could not obtain adequate vdW contact and cohesion, so the pressed system was not pelletized like Sample F2. Additionally, they were not collapsed to the same degree during pressing, as evidenced by the retention of the 3 to 4 nm mesopores of Sample F1.</p><p id="p-0642" num="0646">Raman spectra of Samples F1, F2, F3 and F4 averaged over 16 points are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>82</b>A</figref>, FIG. <b>82</b>B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>82</b>C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>82</b>D</figref>, respectively, for the range of the G<sub>u </sub>and D<sub>u </sub>peaks (no 2D peak feature was observed). The Raman spectra for the Sample F1 powder and Sample F2 pellet are very similar to each other, indicating that pelletization of the granules caused no changes in the bonding structure. The spectra for the Sample F3 pellet and the Sample F4 powder are also similar, although Sample F4 exhibits a somewhat higher I<sub>D</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>peak intensity ratio. This is likely due to the breakage of the graphenic structures that must occur for the macroscopic anthracitic granules to be densified in the press. In other words, the failure of the helicoidal networks is associated with breakage of the graphenic sp<sup>2 </sup>ring structure and conversion of sp<sup>2 </sup>interior atoms to sp<sup>2 </sup>edge atoms.</p><p id="p-0643" num="0647"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref> shows the overlay of the Sample F2 and Sample F3 spectra. The spectral changes associated with maturation are indicated via black arrows. As we established in Study E, the D peak of mature, helicoidal networks produced from sp<sup>x </sup>precursors is deinterpolated by the proliferation of sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states and the reduction in sp<sup>3 </sup>edge states. The trough increases with the increased lattice distortion of the helicoidal networks. The interpolated D<sub>u </sub>peak positions in Samples F1 and F2 indicate the presence of sp<sup>3 </sup>states associated with diamondlike seams. Based on the D<sub>u </sub>peak position of 1331 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the frameworks from Sample F1 and Sample F2 comprise highly grafted x-sp<sup>x </sup>precursors. By comparison, the D<sub>u </sub>peak positions of Samples F3 and F4 are above 1348 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and fall into the D band's normal range under 532 nm Raman excitation. As such, Sample F3 and F4 comprise highly mature, helicoidal x-networks.</p><p id="p-0644" num="0648">Sample F5 is another example of a flat macroform, comprising a helicoidal network, being constructed from flat microforms.

However, the point spectra shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>88</b>C</figref> reveal D<sub>u </sub>peak positions as low as 1336 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which is indicative of localized sp<sup>3 </sup>states and diamondlike seams. The localized D band interpolation is consistent with the microcrystalline K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>template particles on which the perimorphic frameworks were grown. The atomically flat surfaces of these crystals minimize nucleation of primordial domains, which grow over the surfaces with few tectonic interactions. Because the formation of sp<sup>3 </sup>states and diamondlike seams arise from tectonic interfaces, the RBM phonons in regions with few tectonic interfaces are predominately activated by sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states&#x2014;point defects within the basal plane. In these regions, there is no obvious interpolation in the D<sub>u </sub>peak. In other, more nucleated regions, tectonic activity creates the sp<sup>3 </sup>states and diamondlike seams that cause interpolation of the D band. This explains the breadth of the scatter in D<sub>u </sub>peak positions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>88</b>C</figref>. Additionally, it means that Sample F5 comprises an sp<sup>x </sup>network.</p><p id="p-0652" num="0655">The presence of large regions with minimal tectonic activity also explains other spectral features. The high I<sub>Tr</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>value of 0.68 in Sample F5 is indicative of ring disorder-induced lattice curvature, which seems to increase in the absence of diamondlike seams. This may be related to the lack of compressive stress created by sp<sup>3 </sup>grafting at tectonic interfaces. Sample F5 exhibits a slightly red-shifted G<sub>u </sub>peak, as indicated by the scatter plot in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>88</b>C</figref>, which is consistent with ring-disorder. All of this is consistent with the previous observations that progressive D peak interpolation was accompanied by progressive reduction in the trough height and blue-shifting of the G<sub>u </sub>peak.</p><p id="p-0653" num="0656">The lack of tectonic activity during the formation of Sample F5 explains why its I<sub>Tr</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>value (0.68) is much higher than Sample B2's I<sub>Tr</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>value (0.46), despite the pyrolysis temperature for these two samples being the same (640&#xb0; C.). The most primordial cause is the substrate-defect-rich substrates cause dense nucleation, tectonic activity, and sp<sup>3 </sup>formation, while defect-poor substrates suppress it.</p><p id="p-0654" num="0657">The local absence of sp<sup>3 </sup>states also explains the spectral changes that occur during maturation of Sample F5. Thus far, we have observed that maturation leads to increased lattice distortion and increased trough height. However, in Sample F6, the trough height is considerably reduced compared to Sample F5. This is because of the local absence of screw dislocations in the resulting helicoidal network&#x2014;in other words, the helicoids are so large that the dominant spectral effect of maturation is the elimination of ring disorder, which reduces lattice distortion and therefore reduces the trough. The combination of the increased ring order and the absence of screw dislocations is also reflected by the emergence of a 2D<sub>u </sub>peak in the Sample F6 spectra. The emergence of a 2D peak is indicative of longer-range, in-plane sp<sup>2 </sup>crystallinity. Based on Sample F6's I<sub>2D</sub><sub><sub2>u</sub2></sub>/I<sub>G</sub><sub><sub2>u </sub2></sub>peak intensity ratio, which is slightly higher than 0.40 &#x212b;, and its D<sub>u </sub>peak position of 1347 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, the Sample F6 macroform comprises an example of a minimally crosslinked, highly mature helicoidal z-network.</p><p id="p-0655" num="0658">So far in Study F, we have demonstrated a process for creating macroscopic anthracitic networks. This involves creating a static, macroscopic vdW assembly from distinct, smaller-scale anthracitic networks (i.e. &#x201c;microforms&#x201d;) and ring-connecting them to one another via an assembly-to-assembly or assembly-to-singleton maturation. We have demonstrated this process using flat microforms, which we have used to create both flat and equiaxed macroforms. This basic approach of cohering perimorphic microforms to create a macroform is described in the '308 application, where the macroforms are described as &#x201c;peritactic macroforms.&#x201d; Study F therefore demonstrates that a peritactic macroform can comprise a single anthracitic network.</p><p id="p-0656" num="0659">However, these are only exemplary variants of the inventive concept, which can encompass different densification techniques (e.g. mechanical compaction, evaporative drying, etc.) and forming techniques (printing, 3-D printing, molding, extrusion, injection, drawing, spinning, etc.), without limitation. These and other techniques may be used to create a peritactic macroform of any arbitrary size, geometry and aspect ratio, including elongated, flat, and equiaxed shapes. In particular, we foresee the fabrication of continuous helicoidal networks in the form of yarns, ropes, sheets, and coatings. The only requirements are to bring the sp<sup>x </sup>microforms together into a vdW assembly of the desired geometry and to hold the assembly in a substantially static configuration during maturation. Maximum flexibility and contact between the sp<sup>x </sup>microforms are preferred for obtaining maximum interconnectivity in the final macroform. For this reason, natively few-layer sp<sup>x </sup>precursors are preferred.</p><p id="p-0657" num="0660">The inventive concept also includes the use of microforms of different geometries. A large variety of potential microforms are described and envisioned in the '918 and '760 applications, and these can be utilized to make different peritactic macroforms, as described in the '308 application. These microforms may include perimorphic frameworks comprising elongated fibers, flat sheets, or equiaxed prisms, as well as more complex, hierarchical geometries (e.g. rosette-like structures). The rosette-like structures may be especially attractive due to their ability to flex and flatten into aligned plates during densification. This list of microform variants is not exhaustive&#x2014;other variants may be readily envisioned. Microforms may also be used in combinations of different sizes and geometries.</p><p id="p-0658" num="0661">As an example of one such variant, Sample F7, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>89</b></figref>, comprises a thin macroform constructed from elongated microforms. These microforms comprise flexible fibers with diameters ranging from submicron to micron-scale, with lengths ranging from 10 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m. These were chosen for their enhanced flexibility and ability to entangle with one another, creating a textile.

These petals may be densified such that they stack upon each other, forming non-native bilayers and fusing into a lamellar stack during maturation. Lamellar stacking arrangements are also possible from collapsing and densifying flexible, hollow-spherical microforms. A rigid version of this type of structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>94</b>A</figref>, and a flexible version is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>94</b>B</figref>.

The use of either natively flat perimorphic frameworks, or flat-upon-collapse petaloid or hollow frameworks, allows for a high degree of interconnectivity in the matured network due to the high intra-network and inter-network contact area in the lamellar macroform.</p><p id="p-0661" num="0664">Other microforms comprise equiaxed perimorphic frameworks. In one variant, the microforms may comprise hollow spheres. These may be especially useful if a low-density, macroporous anthracitic network is desired. In another variant, the microforms may comprise perimorphic frameworks with a prismatic or polyhedral superstructure, like those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>95</b>A</figref> (at lower magnification) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>95</b>B</figref> (at higher magnification). Where equiaxed perimorphic frameworks are utilized, the mature, macroscopic network may benefit from packing efficiency and flexibility.</p><p id="p-0662" num="0665">XIV. Study G&#x2014;Analysis</p><p id="p-0663" num="0666">Study G was performed to ascertain whether microwave irradiation could be utilized as a rapid technique for maturing sp<sup>x </sup>precursors. It was hypothesized that a combination of high temperature, short annealing time, and rapid cooling was desired to mature the sp<sup>x </sup>network fully, while preserving a high density of dislocations. A rapid microwave treatment, it was theorized, would offer this combination.</p><p id="p-0664" num="0667">In Test I of Study G, a Cober-Muegge microwave system was utilized to perform a microwave treatment on the G1 carbon sample. The system consisted of a 2.45 GHz magnetron, 3000W power supply, steel vacuum chamber, and vacuum pump. The vacuum chamber was outfitted with a rotating platform to facilitate uniform sample exposure and a gas inlet/outlet. The rotating platform could be switched on or off A quartz viewing window located near the top of the vacuum chamber allowed video observation of the sample during the microwave treatment. The microwave assembly is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0665" num="0668">A 101.0 mg quantity of Sample G1 powder was placed in a medium quartz beaker (&#x201c;A&#x201d;). A 100.4 mg quantity of another carbon powder was placed in a small quartz beaker (&#x201c;B&#x201d;). The powder bed in each beaker was leveled to a uniform thickness. Beakers A and B were both then placed within a large quartz beaker in case the smaller beakers shattered from rapid heating during the microwave treatment. The large beaker was placed in the vacuum chamber in a centrally located position to maximize microwave exposure. The vacuum chamber was then sealed and vacuumed down to approximately 2 torr, at which point the chamber was refilled to &#x2dc;710 torr with nitrogen gas. This was repeated two more times to remove any remaining oxygen in the nitrogen atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0666" num="0669">Microwave irradiation was commenced at a power level of 2400 W. This condition was held for 2 minutes and then the magnetron was switched off. The samples were then permitted to cool back down to room temperature prior to opening the vacuum chamber. The mass of the carbon collected from Beaker A was 95.2 mg and the mass collected from Beaker B was 98.5 mg.</p><p id="p-0667" num="0670">During the 2-minute microwave irradiation treatment, the samples were observed via a video feed. This treatment occurred at approximately 1 atm. Within a few seconds of the commencement of the microwave treatment, Sample G1 began to glow red, and within 10 seconds from commencement, the red glow became bright white. This was likely the period over which rehybridization was occurring. From this point, the brightness continued to grow in intensity, with the video camera auto-adjusting its brightness settings several times to accommodate the growing intensity of light. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>96</b></figref> shows a frame from the video feed during the treatment. Sample G1 is radiating such an intense white light that the sample cannot be discerned; the entire beaker appears bright white.</p><p id="p-0668" num="0671">While temperature data was not gathered for this experiment, similarly intense white light was emitted in other treatments in which carbon sublimation and re-condensation above the sample as soot could be observed by video. This should only happen at temperatures significantly higher than 3,000&#xb0; C. Some of the mass loss observed in Samples G1 and the other carbon powder can be attributed to vaporization of oxidized carbon sites (some oxidized sites are retained, despite the lack of an oxidation procedure, due to the nucleation of the carbon lattices on the template's oxygen anions) and adsorbed water. The increased mass loss in Sample G1 may be attributable to some sublimation occurring in this sample.</p><p id="p-0669" num="0672">The remarkably intense Joule heating demonstrated by Sample G1 during microwave irradiation indicates the formation of high-density electrical currents in the carbon particles. Study G demonstrates that microwave heating may be utilized for annealing. It also demonstrates that helicoidal networks may be utilized for resistive heating applications.</p><p id="p-0670" num="0673">In Test II of Study G, a new (i.e. not previously subjected to microwave irradiation) portion of the Sample G1 powder was subjected to microwave irradiation under a lower N<sub>2 </sub>pressure and power level. The microwave system utilized was the same as the one utilized in Test I. As before, the experiment was performed at room temperature. The lower power setting was selected in order to avoid the formation of a sustained plasma inside the vacuum chamber during microwave irradiation. A small mound of 0.103 mg of Sample G1 carbon powder was placed centrally in a quartz boat, which was placed centrally on the platform. The vacuum chamber was then sealed and vacuumed down to approximately 2 torr, at which point the chamber was refilled to &#x2212;710 Torr with nitrogen gas. This was repeated two more times to remove any remaining oxygen in the nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the chamber was vacuumed down to 32.5 Torr.</p><p id="p-0671" num="0674">Microwave irradiation was commenced at a power level of 450 W. Surprisingly, the G1 carbon powder did not grow visibly hot, as it had in Test I, but instead remained black, exhibiting no signs of heating. Additionally, almost immediately upon commencement of irradiation, the carbon powder was observed to spread, adopting an extremely fine, smoky appearance that slowly filled the quartz boat. Throughout the irradiation, the powder never showed any signs of heating. Upon terminating the irradiation, the particles collapsed back into a pile at the bottom of the boat.</p><p id="p-0672" num="0675">The absence of resistive heating, coupled with the spreading of the particles in a vacuum, may be explained by a strong diamagnetic response consistent with a resistanceless, superconducting state. Without resistance, Joule heating does not occur. The strong diamagnetic response in this superconducting state is a phenomenon known as the Meissner Effect. In a typical demonstration of the Meissner Effect, a permanent magnet is used to levitate a superconducting compound that has been cooled below its critical temperature (T<sub>c</sub>). This occurs due to the formation of screening currents formed near the surface of the superconductor in the presence of an applied magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0673" num="0676">In the case of Test II, we conclude that, under reduced pressure and at approximately 300K, Sample G1 enters a superconducting state, wherein microwave-induced supercurrents flow without resistance through the t electron cloud of electronically decoupled, graphenic monolayers. These supercurrents generate an opposing magnetic field, according to Lenz's law, causing the superconducting particles to repel one another and to spread out into a fine smoke. In effect, each particle becomes a superconducting magnet, and each particle repels the particles around it. This repulsion levitates particles and pushes them outward. Upon terminating the microwave irradiation, the particles stabilize back into a pile at the bottom of the boat.</p><p id="p-0674" num="0677">While it is well-known that pyrolytic carbon is strongly diamagnetic, a diamagnetic response of this strength could not be observed at ambient pressure, nor does the diamagnetism of pyrolytic carbons explain the extraordinary lack of resistive heating under slightly reduced gas pressure. These combined phenomena demonstrate the formation of a resistanceless, superconducting state that is dependent upon gas pressure&#x2014;in other words, dependent upon reduced gas-surface collisions. Test II occurred at approximately 300 K. Hence, Sample G1 comprises a demonstrated room-temperature superconductor, making it potentially the first among a theorized class of superconductors with T<sub>e </sub>of 300 K or higher.</p><p id="p-0675" num="0678">Without being bound by theory, we propose the following explanation for the observed superconducting state. First, as we have already demonstrated, the diamondlike seams present in sp<sup>x </sup>networks force AA-stacking (and also bowing), increasing the &#x3c;002&#x3e; distance and reducing the electronic coupling between z-adjacent graphenic layers. It has been shown that at the atomic two-dimensional limit, correlation effects become more pronounced, and superconductivity may be achieved with far lower carrier density than in bilayers and bulk structures. Electronically decoupling the layers via AA stacking therefore enables a superconducting state with fewer charge carriers. Second, we propose that the sp<sup>3 </sup>states within Sample G1 may act as dopants that increase carrier density. This concept of doping via sp<sup>3 </sup>defects has been explored in connection with carbon nanotubes. Third, we propose that gas-surface collisions at ambient pressures lead to out-of-plane phonon perturbations that break the electronically decoupled state of the atomic monolayer superconductor. This is indicative of a phonon-electron coupling mechanism that, while integral to conventional BCS superconductivity, has not heretofore been conclusively determined for high-T<sub>c </sub>superconductors. At the atomic two-dimensional limit, we are able to observe the phonon-electron coupling mechanism experimentally. The superconducting state should be enhanced with further suppression of gas-surface collisions achieved at progressively lower pressures. It may also be enhanced with further doping.</p><p id="p-0676" num="0679">In Test III of Study G, the Sample G1 carbon powder was exposed to microwave irradiation at low pressure in order to demonstrate superconductivity. The microwave system utilized was the same as the one utilized in Tests I and II. As before, the experiment was performed at approximately 300 K. A small mound of 0.1027 mg of Sample G1 powder was placed in a quartz boat. The powder was pushed into a small pile located in the center of the boat, as shown Frame 1 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>97</b></figref>. An approximate outline of the pile is traced in Frame 1. The boat was then placed centrally in the vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber was then sealed and vacuumed down to approximately 2 torr, at which point the chamber was refilled to &#x2dc;710 torr with nitrogen gas. This was repeated two more times to remove any remaining oxygen in the nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the vacuum chamber was vacuumed down to 32 torr.</p><p id="p-0677" num="0680">Microwave irradiation was commenced at a 300 W power setting. Immediately (within 1 second of commencement) the pile of carbon powder began migrating outward, visible in the camera as a slight change in the outline of the pile. This migration was continued for a couple of seconds, whereupon the magnetron was switched off and the pile stopped moving. The G1 carbon powder remained black, exhibiting no signs of heating. The pile after this initial irradiation is shown in Frame 2 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>97</b></figref>. The movement was most visible in the upper-right and lower-left corners of the pile as it began migrating along the length of the boat.</p><p id="p-0678" num="0681">At this point, irradiation was again commenced&#x2014;this time at an increased power setting of 750 W. Again, within just 1-2 seconds of microwave exposure, the carbon powder was observed to levitate, this time migrating down the length of the boat as a black, particulate cloud. This migration, which occurred over a period of approximately 10 seconds, is shown in Frames 3 through 5 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>97</b></figref>. During this time, the powder both expanded along the length of the boat and pushed upward along its walls, especially at the center, where it nearly reached the lip of the boat, as indicated by the circle in Frame 7 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>97</b></figref>. The progress along the length of the boat appeared as the steady drift of a fine smoke, which is indicated by the orange arrow in Frame 4 at the upper-right end of the boat. After stabilizing in the configuration shown in Frame 5, the powder did not move at all. Throughout the procedure, it never showed any signs of heating, although a few occasional microplasmas were observed within the bed. In Frame 6 and 7 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>97</b></figref>, photographs of the boat upon removal from the microwave chamber reveal the final shape of the powder.

As before, the experiment was performed at room temperature. Piles of 101 mg, 101 mg, 101 mg and 130 mg of Samples G2, G3, G4 and G5, respectively, were placed in separate ceramic boats. The powder was pushed into a small pile located in the corner of their respective boats as shown and labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>98</b>A</figref>.

We theorize that the out-of-plane acoustic phonons created by these collisions disrupt the electronic decoupling of the atomic monolayers in these pyrolytic carbons, whereas this decoupling is otherwise obtained by AA stacking faults forced by the diamondlike crosslinks. The same crosslinks pin the layers together and enforce these high-energy stacking faults, which persist where otherwise they might be minimized upon relaxation of the bilayers.</p><p id="p-0692" num="0694">In Study G, an ambient superconducting powder exhibits both diamagnetic and flux-pinning responses to magnetic fields, indicating a Type II superconductivity. Testing at different pressures ranging from 720 to 10 torr indicate a continuum of strengthened superconductivity as gas-surface collisions are reduced and superconducting pathways are lengthened. The persistence of flux-pinning responses upon returning the powders to ambient pressure indicates that the process of evacuation has modified the particles. In Study H, we observe a similar phenomenon, which is temporary and appears related to the persistence of an internally evacuated state in some nearly impermeable regions of the porous particles for some minutes after evacuation. Reduced permeability in some regions inside the particles and granules is to be expected especially in those samples in which template-directed CVD was utilized, the endomorphic templates were extracted, and carbon-catalyzed CVD growth was then performed again on the porous perimorphic frameworks. We expect that this would begin to close many of the framework's internal pores.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">XV.

During repressurization of the vacuum chamber to 1 atm, which occurred over a period of several minutes, the sheet resistance remained stable at 0.22 f/sq.</p><p id="p-0696" num="0698">Following this, the door of the chamber was opened, and the 4-point probe was removed from the sample. Upon removal of contact, the multimeter showed an &#x201c;Overflow&#x201d; reading. The 4-point probe was then placed back into contact with the sample, and the reading was again 0.22 &#x3a9;/sq. Next, the sample was left for 20 to 30 minutes, after which the sheet resistance measured via the 4-point probe had returned to 157 &#x3a9;/sq. This indicates a temporal dependence of the sheet resistance. Raman spectral analysis of the sample revealed no changes from prior to the test. The Raman spectrum is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>106</b></figref>. The D<sub>u </sub>peak position of 1326 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>indicates an x-sp<sup>x </sup>network with diamondlike seams crosslinking the layers.</p><p id="p-0697" num="0699">Performing a number of tests like this on different macroforms, we found that the sheet resistance consistently decreased according to the natural logarithm of the pressure. However, we expect that the sheet resistance's dependency was actually on the pump-down time, which was unmeasured. During pump-down of the vacuum chamber, any diffusion constraints on the outgassing of the porous macroform would be expected to create a temporal dependence of the sheet resistance. This temporal dependence was verified other in experiments by pausing the pump-down and observing that sheet resistance continued to fall even with constant or increasing vessel pressure. This is strong evidence that, for a mesoporous pyrolytic carbon or anthracitic network, the room-temperature ability to form a Bose-Einstein condensate is determined by the pressure inside the particles' pores&#x2014;i.e. the collision frequency of gas molecules with surfaces inside the macroform.</p><p id="p-0698" num="0700">When growing pyrolytic carbons on an MgO template- and especially when growing on a macroscopic template, as we did in Study H&#x2014;the differential contractions of the perimorphic carbon and endomorphic MgO phases during cooling can lead to mechanical stresses and either nanoscopic or microscopic fracturing of the sp<sup>x </sup>network. Indeed, it is likely that fine fractures from cooling of perimorphic composites synthesized at high temperatures may be what facilitates endomorphic extraction for template-directed CVD processes in general. Performing a second deposition procedure appears to mend any fractures originating from the first cooling. Damaged sites in the sp<sup>x </sup>network with sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states become the nuclei for new FRC growth and are healed via sp<sup>2 </sup>and sp<sup>3 </sup>re-grafting of these regions, or &#x201c;mending.&#x201d; Other possible ways to reduce the present of fractures from cooling is to grow a thicker perimorphic phase and to cool the macroscopic perimorphic composite slowly and uniformly.</p><p id="p-0699" num="0701">Utilizing this &#x201c;mending&#x201d; technique, other types of pyrolytic carbon particles-most notably carbon black particles, glassy carbons derived from organic precursors, anthracite, coal, activated carbon, or some combination thereof-could similarly be grafted to one another to create sp<sup>x </sup>macroforms. These disordered seeds act as nuclei for FRC growth, which leads to the ring-disordered lattice formation, tectonic encounters and associated grafting structures that have been demonstrated throughout the present disclosure. This mending technique should eliminate sp<sup>2 </sup>edge states and ring-connect the individual pyrolytic carbon particles or networks, causing them to coalesce. Mending these particles or networks at reduced pressure with no inert carrier gases may minimize any trapped gas left behind in sealed-off pores.</p><p id="p-0700" num="0702">Having established the importance of evacuating any internal gases, and the ability of an internally evacuated sample to form a Bose-Einstein condensate at ambient temperature and pressure, a barrier phase may be applied to the outside of the evacuated macroform in order to prevent reentry of gas molecules. Utilizing an approach like this, ambient superconducting articles of arbitrary macroscopic length, such as filaments, may be fabricated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>107</b></figref> demonstrates the basic approach to producing such an article, which can be divided into three stages. First, a porous article (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>107</b></figref> represents a filament-type article) is generated via a pyrolysis procedure. Next, any gas present within the porous article is outgassed. Lastly, while still in the evacuated state, the article can be sealed via application of an impermeable barrier phase. The barrier phase may be applied via deposition, spray-coating, or some other conventional method. The evacuated and sealed article can then be utilized at ambient external pressure and temperature. This capability is demonstrated in Study H by the persistent superconducting state of the temporarily evacuated article even after opening the vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0701" num="0703">Study H corroborated the observations in Study G, wherein particle-scale, ambient superconductivity was achieved. However, in Study H we were able to measure directly the decline in resistance with reducing pressure, directly corroborating the Meissner Effect and flux-pinning observed in the pyrolytic carbons of Study G. Moreover, Study H showed that at room temperature, it is possible for a porous, ambient superconductor to remain superconducting at ambient temperature and pressure conditions, so long as its pores are evacuated. We strongly suspect that the measured resistance of 0.004 &#x3a9;/sq and then subsequently 0.22 &#x3a9;/sq may not have actually been attributable to the sample as produced but may have instead been related to massive heating of the probe tips, thereby heating the contact region of the sample above its critical temperature. Other signs of heating caused by the probe tips were observed, including melting of the plastic housing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>108</b></figref>, with observed melted areas near the probe tips circled) next to the tips. This heating might have resulted from the increasing current being supplied by the Sourcemeter as the sheet resistance of the sample fell. Joule heating in the probe tips under vacuum appears to have led to extreme heating precisely at the point of resistance measurement.</p><p id="p-0702" num="0704">Further improvements to the material should be readily achieved via techniques known to those skilled in the art. For example, doping the material to increase the charge carrier density should be readily achievable. Using an organic precursor, such as a polymeric binder, to bind the individual graphenic networks to one another, followed by pyrolyzing the binder and &#x201c;mending&#x201d; the networks may improve the ring-connectedness of macroforms. Importantly, the fabrication of infinite, sheet-like or filament-like ambient superconducting articles using roll-to-roll techniques should be possible via the basic approach of evacuated and then sealing the articles with a barrier phase, as we have described.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">XVII. Other Anthracitic Networks</heading><p id="p-0703" num="0705">In the '760 application we demonstrated the formation of perimorphic frameworks comprising graphenic structures such as hexagonal BN and BC<sub>x</sub>N. HR-TEM analysis of these networks reveals that they comprise anthracitic networks that are cohered via crosslinking dislocations, including Y-dislocations, screw-dislocations, and mixed dislocations. These materials, which are formed in a way analogous to the FRC growth of carbon, undergo the same mechanics of tectonic encounters and grafting, which in turn lead to the same anthracitic networks.</p><p id="p-0704" num="0706"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>109</b>A</figref> is an HR-TEM image of a perimorphic framework comprising BN, which was produced according to a procedure described in the '760 application. The close retention of the templated morphology after extraction of the endomorphic MgO template indicates good structural integrity of the perimorphic wall. At closer magnifications, we are able to observe the individual graphenic layers. Y-dislocations are present, as shown in the HR-TEM image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>109</b>B</figref>. The Y-dislocations are circled and traced. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>109</b>C</figref>, we can observe a screw dislocation, which has been traced. The presence of these sp<sup>x </sup>Y-dislocations and sp<sup>2 </sup>screw dislocations indicates that the BN comprises an anthracitic network in an intermediate state of maturation, where screw dislocations have formed from some of the less stable Y-dislocations. The structural similarities between the BN anthracitic network shown here and the carbon anthracitic networks shown elsewhere in the present disclosure demonstrate the generality of the methods and materials described herein.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00003" nb-file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00003.NB"><img id="EMI-M00003" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00003.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00004" nb-file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00004.NB"><img id="EMI-M00004" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00004.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00005" nb-file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00005.NB"><img id="EMI-M00005" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00005.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00006" nb-file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00006.NB"><img id="EMI-M00006" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230002231A1-20230105-M00006.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-80" num="01-80"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>80</b>.
