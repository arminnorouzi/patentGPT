Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for retrofitting an existing furnace for more flexible heating operation. The invention also relates to such a furnace.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Industrial heating furnaces for heating metal materials, such as steel slabs, are conventionally heated by a fuel, which is combusted together with an oxidant. Normally, a main part of such combustion takes place in a main heating zone. The combustion products may then flow, counter-currently to the heated metal material, downstream in the furnace towards a flue gas exit at a metal material charging opening. The downstream zone through which the combustion products flow is conventionally denoted a &#x201c;dark zone&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hence, the metal material being transported through the furnace, in its upstream direction, is preheated by the hot combustion products in the dark zone on its way from the charging opening to the main heating zone.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For thick materials, it is many times desired to heat the material as early as possible in the furnace, in order for the central parts of the material to be properly heated as soon as possible. The centre of a slab, for instance, needs to be heated to near equilibrium before it can be removed from the furnace for rolling or forging.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This problem has conventionally been solved by adding extra burners in the dark zone, so as to increase heating power there. This increases the flue gas temperature, which may lead to problems in any upstream heat recuperation or regeneration equipment used to harvest thermal energy from the flue gases.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the aim of not heating the flue gases too much, it has been proposed to use so-called oxyfuel burners (that is, burners operated using a high-oxygen oxidant) in the dark zone. However, this is typically a complex and expensive solution.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it is desired to more efficiently be able to heat a metal material in the dark zone, without such a solution being overly complex or expensive.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, it is desirable for such a solution to offer increased flexibility in terms of heating powers in a furnace. The latter is particularly true for existing heating furnaces, that otherwise are very expensive to upgrade for providing a more flexible heating power.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention solves the above described problems.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Hence, the invention relates to a method for heating a furnace with a longitudinal direction and a cross plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, which furnace is arranged with at least one heating zone which is heated using combustion of a fuel with an oxidant, and which furnace is further arranged with a dark zone downstream of said heated zone, to which dark zone no fuel is supplied directly, which method is characterised in that the fuel and oxidant supplied to the heating zone is substoichiometric, in that between 10% and 40% of the total oxidant for achieving stoichiometric or near stoichiometric combustion is supplied directly to the dark zone, in that a flue gas temperature is measured in and/or downstream of the dark zone, and in that the share of the total oxidant supplied to the dark zone is controlled so as not to exceed a predetermined maximum measured such temperature.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for retrofitting an existing furnace for operation according to any one of the preceding claims, which existing furnace has a longitudinal direction and a cross plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, which existing furnace is arranged with at least one heating zone which is heated using combustion of a fuel with an oxidant, and which existing furnace is further arranged with a dark zone downstream of said heated zone, to which dark zone no fuel is supplied directly, which method is characterised in that the method comprises providing a separate oxidant lance arranged to provide oxidant directly to the dark zone; connecting the separate oxidant lance to a source of oxidant; modifying the furnace to supply the fuel and oxidant supplied to the heating zone substoichiometrically to provide between 10% and 40% of the total oxidant for achieving stoichiometric or near stoichiometric combustion by supplying oxidant directly to the dark zone; providing a flue gas temperature sensor arranged to measure the flue gas temperature in and/or downstream of the dark zone; and modifying the furnace to control the share of the total oxidant supplied to the dark zone so as not to exceed a predetermined maximum measured such temperature.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, the invention relates to a heating furnace with a longitudinal direction and a cross plane which is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, which furnace is arranged with at least one heating zone which is heated using combustion of a fuel with an oxidant, and which furnace is further arranged with a dark zone downstream of said heated zone, to which dark zone no fuel is arranged to be supplied directly, which furnace is characterised in that the furnace is arranged to supply fuel and oxidant to the heating zone substoichiometrically, in that the furnace is arranged to supply between 10% and 40% of the total oxidant for achieving stoichiometric or near stoichiometric combustion directly to the dark zone, in that the furnace comprises a flue gas temperature sensor arranged to measure a flue gas temperature in and/or downstream of the dark zone, and in that the furnace is arranged to control the share of the total oxidant supplied to the dark zone so as not to exceed a predetermined maximum measured such temperature.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the following, the invention will be described in detail, with reference to exemplifying embodiments of the invention and to the enclosed drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified side view of a furnace according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a simplified top view of the furnace illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a simplified detail view of an oxidant lance in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method according to the invention for heating a furnace of the type generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;
