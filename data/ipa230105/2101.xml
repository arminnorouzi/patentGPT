By preventing deformation of the corner walls, occurrence of wrinkles on a label, such as a shrink label or a roll label, can be prevented when it is attached to the container.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PTL 1: JP 2004-149126 A</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present inventor has conducted earnest studies and found that it is more effective to provide annular grooves (ribs) formed in annular shapes within the surfaces of the corner walls, in order to increase rigidity of the corner walls. Generally, however, reduced pressure absorption panels are provided in such a square-shaped synthetic resin container, so as to deal with a reduced pressure that occurs when the container is cooled after it is filled with high-temperature contents. In a case in which annular grooves are provided adjacent to reduced pressure absorption panels, the width of protrusions formed in areas located between the reduced pressure absorption panels and the annular grooves narrows. As a result, during molding, resin is less likely to reach parts of a mold surface that correspond to the protrusions, thus sometimes resulting in poor formability (that causes sink marks or the like). Improvement can be made in this respect.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be helpful to provide a synthetic resin container with improved formability while preventing deformation of corner walls.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A synthetic resin container according to the present disclosure includes a mouth that serves as a dispensing opening for contents, a body that is continuous with the mouth via a shoulder, and a bottom that closes a lower end of the body, wherein</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">the body includes a pair of main walls arranged so as to face each other with a gap therebetween, a pair of side walls arranged so as to face each other with a gap therebetween, and corner walls that couple respective ends in a circumferential direction of the main walls and the side walls, and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">each of the corner walls is provided with U-shaped ribs that are formed in a substantially U-shape within a surface of the corner wall and that are concave toward an inner side in a thickness direction of the corner wall.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment of the present synthetic resin container configured as above, each of the U-shaped ribs includes a longitudinal groove extending substantially in a vertical direction, and horizontal grooves extending substantially in a horizontal direction from both ends in the vertical direction of the longitudinal groove.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another preferred embodiment of the present synthetic resin container configured as above, the side walls have a narrower width in the circumferential direction than the main walls, and the U-shaped ribs are formed so as to open toward the side walls.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present disclosure, a synthetic resin container with improved formability can be provided while preventing deformation of corner walls.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the accompanying drawings:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front view of a synthetic resin container according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the synthetic resin container according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of the synthetic resin container according to the embodiment of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a bottom view of the synthetic resin container according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in more detail by way of example with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A synthetic resin container <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure stores, for example, beverages, such as fruit juice or tea, and seasonings, such as soy sauce, vinegar, or other sauces, as contents, and it is adapted for hot filling in which the contents are heated to a predetermined temperature before being filled into the container in a high-temperature state.
