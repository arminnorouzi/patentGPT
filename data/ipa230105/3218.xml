id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present embodiment relates to a pump.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A pump serves to discharge the amount of flow at a constant pressure. The oil circulated by the pump can be used to operate a hydraulic system using hydraulic pressure, or for a cooling or lubricating effect.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A mechanical oil pump (MOP) is an oil pump that operates using the power of a machine such as an engine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, research on hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles has been actively conducted for the purpose of improving fuel efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, the demand for an electric oil pump (EOP) operated by a motor instead of a mechanical oil pump (MOP) operated by the power of a machine such as an engine is increasing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The EOP has a pump-integrated structure in which the housing of the pump and the housing of the motor are integrated. Such a pump-integrated structure has advantages of reduced volume and light weight, but may cause damage to the pump when assembling the motor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The EOP may typically include a motor region and a pump region. The motor region includes a stator, a rotor, and a rotation shaft. The pump region includes an inner rotor coupled to one end of the rotation shaft to receive rotational force from the rotation shaft, and an outer rotor accommodating the inner rotor.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the EOP having the above structure, there is a problem in that the motor part and the pump part in a single pump exist independently, thereby increasing the number of parts. In addition, there is a problem in that the overall size of the product increases as the length increases in the axial direction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Subject</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been proposed to improve the above problems, and it is to provide a pump capable of reducing the manufacturing cost owing to the reduction in the number of parts, and enabling the miniaturization thereof.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As an embodiment, a pump comprises: a housing including a body and a first partition wall which separates first and second areas; a stator disposed in the housing; a circuit board disposed in the first area; a pump gear disposed in the second area; and magnets disposed on the pump gear, wherein the second area includes a second space defined by the first partition wall and the body, and wherein the stator is inserted into the body.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first area includes a first space, wherein the first area and the second space may not be connected by the first partition wall.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The stator includes a core, an insulator coupled to the core, and a coil wound on the insulator, wherein at least a portion of the insulator may be exposed to the outside of the body.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The stator includes a core, an insulator coupled to the core, and a coil wound on the insulator, wherein the stator is molded inside the body and may not be exposed to the outside of the body.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">At least a portion of the body may be disposed between the stator and the pump gear.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The magnet may be disposed on an outer peripheral surface of the pump gear to correspond to the coil.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The housing includes a terminal, wherein the terminal may be connected to the coil and the circuit board.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The first partition wall includes a first protrusion being protruded in a direction facing the pump gear, wherein the pump gear may include a first groove in which the first protrusion is disposed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A first cover disposed above the first area and a second cover disposed below the second area are included, wherein a first opening and a second opening having a predetermined shape are formed on one surface of the second cover, wherein a third opening connected to the first opening and a fourth opening connected to the second opening are formed on the other surface of the second cover, and wherein a third groove corresponding to the shape of the first opening and a fourth groove corresponding to the shape of the second opening may be included on one surface of the first partition wall.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The pump gear may include an external gear and an internal gear disposed inside the external gear.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the present invention, since the rotation shaft for transmitting the rotational force of the motor region to the pump region in the pump according to the conventional structure becomes unnecessary, there is an advantage in that the number of parts is reduced, thereby lowering the manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, in the conventional structure in which the motor region and the pump region are partitioned in up and down directions, since the length in up and down directions is formed to be short by removing the rotation shaft, there is an advantage in that the product can be miniaturized.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, since the space in which the fluid is accommodated with other regions is divided through a partition wall, there is an advantage in that the leaking of the fluid to other regions can be prevented. In particular, there is an advantage that the stator can be protected from fluid by embedding the stator inside the housing.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, there is an advantage in that noise can be reduced by disposing the external and internal gears, which are the main causes of noise, in the innermost space of the housing.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of

The second partition wall <b>181</b> may be disposed between the external gear <b>140</b> and the stator <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The external gear <b>140</b> may include a core <b>141</b> and a magnet <b>144</b> being mounted on the core <b>141</b>. The magnet <b>144</b> may be disposed on an outer peripheral surface of the core <b>141</b> to correspond to the coil <b>126</b>. The external gear <b>140</b> may be a surface permanent magnet (SPM) type in which the magnet <b>144</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the core <b>141</b>. To this end, a groove in which the magnet <b>144</b> is mounted may be formed in an outer peripheral surface of the core <b>141</b>. The groove may be provided in plurality, and may be disposed to be spaced apart from each other in a circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Accordingly, when a current is applied to the coil <b>126</b> of the stator <b>120</b>, the external gear <b>140</b> may be rotated by electromagnetic interaction between the stator <b>120</b> and the external gear <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the center of the external gear <b>140</b>, a first hole <b>142</b> in which the internal gear <b>130</b> is disposed may be formed. A plurality of ridges being protruded inward from the inner peripheral surface and valleys disposed between the plurality of ridges may be formed on an inner peripheral surface of the first hole <b>142</b>. That is, a first gear in which a plurality of peaks and valleys are alternately disposed may be formed on an inner peripheral surface of the first hole <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The internal gear <b>130</b> may be disposed inside the external gear <b>140</b>.

A second gear in which a plurality of ridges <b>136</b> and a plurality of valleys <b>133</b> are alternately disposed may be formed on an outer peripheral surface of the internal gear <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In other words, in the internal gear <b>130</b>, the second lobe <b>136</b> having N number of gear teeth may be disposed along the circumferential direction outward in the radial direction with respect to the rotation center. The external gear <b>140</b> may be provided with N+1 number of the first lobes <b>149</b> inward in the radial direction. The first lobe <b>149</b> may be disposed to be caught by the second lobe <b>136</b>. When the external gear <b>140</b> is rotated, the internal gear <b>130</b> may be rotated by the first lobe <b>149</b> and the second lobe <b>136</b>. According to the rotation of the internal gear <b>130</b>, the fluid may be introduced into the second space <b>180</b> or the fluid in the second space <b>180</b> may be discharged to the outside. In summary, by the eccentricity of the external gear <b>140</b> and the internal gear <b>130</b>, a volume capable of transporting the fluid fuel is generated between the external gear <b>140</b> and the internal gear <b>130</b> so that the portion with the increased volume sucks the surrounding fluid due to pressure drop, and the portion with the reduced volume discharges the fluid due to the increase in pressure.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Meanwhile, on the upper surface of the second space <b>180</b>, that is, the lower surface of the first partition wall <b>170</b>, a guide <b>186</b> being protruded downward may be formed. The guide <b>186</b> may be formed in a ring shape so that an inner peripheral surface thereof may face an outer peripheral surface of the external gear <b>140</b>. The cross-sectional shape of the inner peripheral surface of the guide <b>186</b> may be formed to correspond to the cross-sectional shape of the outer peripheral surface of the external gear <b>140</b>. Accordingly, the external gear <b>140</b> may be rotated by being guided by an inner peripheral surface of the external gear <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Unlike this, on an upper portion of the external gear <b>140</b>, a guide portion (not shown) may be formed to be stepped more upward than other regions, and disposed inside the guide <b>186</b>. In this case, the guide part may have a smaller cross-sectional area than other regions of the external gear <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The height of the guide <b>186</b> being protruded from the lower surface of the first partition wall <b>170</b> may be formed to be smaller than one half of the height of the second space <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">On the upper surface of the second space <b>180</b> and the lower surface of the first partition wall <b>170</b>, a first protrusion <b>184</b> being protruded downward in a direction toward the pump gear <b>150</b> may be formed. In addition, a first groove <b>132</b> may be formed in the pump <b>150</b> so that the first protrusion <b>184</b> is coupled thereto. More specifically, the first groove <b>132</b> may be formed in the center of the internal gear <b>130</b> to penetrate through the lower surface from the upper surface. The first protrusion <b>184</b> may be coupled to the first groove <b>132</b>. That is, the first protrusion <b>184</b> may form a rotation center of the internal gear <b>130</b>. Accordingly, the first protrusion <b>184</b> supports the rotation of the internal gear <b>130</b> inside the second space <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The height of the first protrusion <b>184</b> being protruded from the lower surface of the first partition wall <b>170</b> may be formed to be smaller than one half of the height of the second space <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">A third groove <b>188</b> and a fourth groove <b>189</b> may be formed on a lower surface of the first partition wall <b>170</b>.

The third groove <b>188</b> may be in the shape being overlapped with the first opening <b>212</b> or the third opening <b>232</b> in up and down directions. The fourth groove <b>189</b> may be in the shape being overlapped with the second opening <b>214</b> or the fourth opening <b>234</b>. That is, the cross-sectional shape of the third groove <b>188</b> corresponds to the cross-sectional shape of the first opening <b>212</b> or the third opening <b>232</b>, and the cross-sectional shape of the fourth groove <b>189</b> may be formed to correspond to the cross-sectional shape of the second opening <b>214</b> or the fourth opening <b>234</b>. Accordingly, the hydraulic pressure balance of the fluid in the second space <b>180</b> can be maintained.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The first protrusion <b>184</b> may be disposed between the third groove <b>188</b> and the fourth groove <b>189</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to the structure as described above, since the rotation shaft for transmitting the rotational force of the motor region to the pump region in the pump according to the conventional structure becomes unnecessary, there is an advantage in that the number of parts is reduced, and due to this, there is an advantage in that the manufacturing cost can be lowered.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In addition, in the conventional structure in which the motor region and the pump region are partitioned in up and down directions, since the length in up and down directions is formed to be short by removing the rotation shaft, there is an advantage in that the product can be miniaturized.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition, since the space in which the fluid is accommodated with other regions is divided through a partition wall, there is an advantage in that the leaking of the fluid to other regions can be prevented.

The second outer peripheral surface <b>144</b><i>a </i>may be disposed between two adjacent unit magnets among the plurality of unit magnets.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Meanwhile, the accommodating groove <b>1010</b> may include a bottom surface <b>1011</b> facing the inner surface <b>1001</b> and an inner peripheral surface facing the side surface <b>1003</b>.

A second inclined surface may be formed on the first inner peripheral surface <b>1005</b> to correspond to the first inclined surface of the side surface <b>1003</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In other words, the accommodating groove <b>1010</b> may include a bottom surface <b>1011</b> and side surfaces <b>1005</b> and <b>1006</b> connected to the bottom surface <b>1011</b>. In this case, the side surfaces <b>1005</b> and <b>1006</b> may include a first region <b>1005</b> inclined at a first angle and a second region <b>1006</b> inclined at a second angle.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Here, the first region <b>1005</b> may be in contact with a side surface of the magnet <b>1002</b>. And, the second region <b>1006</b> may not be in contact with a side surface of the magnet <b>1002</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In addition, a third inclined surface may be formed on the second peripheral surface <b>1006</b> so that the distance from the side surface of the magnet <b>144</b> increases as it travels toward the outside. Accordingly, the second peripheral surface <b>1006</b> may be spaced apart from the side surface of the magnet <b>144</b> as described above. The third inclined surface may be inclined with respect to the second inclined surface. The third inclined surface and the second inclined surface may have an obtuse angle.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Meanwhile, the size of the inner surface of the magnet <b>144</b> facing the accommodating groove <b>1010</b> may be smaller than the size of the first outer peripheral surface <b>1002</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Unlike this, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the second inclined surface <b>1052</b> may have an acute angle with the third inclined surface <b>1054</b>. In this case, the side surface <b>1056</b> of the core <b>144</b> may be formed to be smaller, so that the friction force with the peripheral surface of the second space <b>180</b> may be further reduced. In summary, the side surface of the magnet <b>144</b> may form an acute angle with the inner surface of the magnet <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Therefore, according to the above-described structure, by forming a first inclined surface on a side surface of the magnet <b>144</b> and the first peripheral surface, the separation of the magnet <b>144</b> from the accommodating groove <b>1010</b> can be prevented. In addition, since the outer cross-sectional area of the core <b>141</b> can be formed to be relatively small due to the structure of the first inclined surface of the second peripheral surface <b>1006</b>, there is an advantage that can reduce friction caused by the rotation of the external gear <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, an adhesive accommodating groove <b>1012</b> being recessed more inward than other regions may be formed on a bottom surface of the accommodating groove <b>1010</b>.
