As far as conventional gaming computers are concerned, there are usually products of power supplies featuring a single function on the market, and users may purchase power supplies only in the consideration of specification for the computers. However, the specification of gaming computers has becoming higher and more diverse. Therefore, in order to meet the requirement of changing modules to various types, power supplies can be changeable modules for esports gamers to replace according to their demands.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the increase of specification requirement of PC power supplies, power supplies with diverse performances has become another goal to various brands. However, conventional power supplies have the following drawbacks: 1. They are usually a single set power supplies; 2. The modules can only be installed with the existence of fastening casing and guiding components; and 3. The power supplies do not provide additional functionalities, such as increasing voltage function, liquid cooling function and uninterruptible power function. Therefore, it is required to improve the power supplies for satisfying various applications of the esports gamers.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, this disclosure provides a modular power supply which is capable of providing various additional functions as required by changing a module or unit thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One embodiment of the disclosure provides a modular power supply including a power supply unit and an expansion unit.
