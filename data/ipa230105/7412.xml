The pair of hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> are resting inside the housing of the wireless charger <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A microphone of the wireless charger <b>190</b> can be configured to receive a wireless communication, including data, in the audio frequency range from an audio frequency speaker built into a hearing assistance device. The hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is configured to amplify sound to a user's ear. A wireless charging circuit of the wireless charger <b>190</b> can be configured to act as a wireless data transmitter in an ultrasonic frequency range, via a charging coil, to the hearing assistance device. The wireless charging circuit of the wireless charger <b>190</b>, such as the Eargo 3.0 Charger&#x2122;, for a hearing assistance device <b>100</b> (hearing aid, ear bud, etc., such as the Eargo 3.0 Hearing Instrument&#x2122;) is used for multiple purposes including i) generating and sending wireless charging signals in an ultrasonic frequency band to hearing assistant devices as well as ii) a transmitter for wireless communications in a same ultrasonic frequency range as the wireless charging signals.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an example wireless charging circuit of the wireless charger configured to generate and send a wireless charging signal in an ultrasonic frequency band, to be the wireless source of power, to charge rechargeable batteries of the hearing assistance device as well as ii) a transmitter for wireless communications in the same ultrasonic frequency range as the wireless charging signal. The hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> and the wireless charger <b>190</b> integrate multiple uses into the charging circuit from the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the audio circuit and speaker from the hearing assistance device. By adding software and firmware and a few components, this design integrates multiple additional uses into components in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> and the wireless charger <b>190</b> to provide additional functionality between these two devices. One additional use is a communication exchange system between the wireless charger <b>190</b> and hearing assistance device <b>100</b> using two or more different sound frequency bands. For example, the wireless charger <b>190</b> can be used to provide communication to the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> in a wireless ultrasonic frequency band and then the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> can provide feedback and other information in the audio frequency through beeps and other sounds to the microphone port of the wireless charger <b>190</b>. A second use is the components in the wireless charger <b>190</b> are used as the wireless source of power to charge the batteries of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> using a same ultrasound frequency. A third use is the components in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is to amplify and clarify sound in the audio frequency range that a user is hearing in their ear. A fourth additional use is the memory, firmware, and software components in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> collect data in each hearing assistance device <b>100</b> and then send this data wirelessly over to the wireless charger <b>190</b>. A fourth additional use is the housing that contains the wireless charger <b>190</b> circuitry (e.g., the charging coil, etc.) can also be used to store each hearing assistance device. The wireless charger <b>190</b> acts as a portable storage container for the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is configured to use the audio frequency speaker built into the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> as its wireless transmitter to communicate with the wireless charger <b>190</b> so that the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> does not need to have a Wi-Fi circuit and antenna. Thus, the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is configured to have dimensions which allows the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to fit and be implemented as at least one of i) an in-the-ear-canal hearing aid and ii) an ear bud; rather than, a behind-the-ear hearing aid. Note, the multiple uses of components within the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> keeps the size of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> small, whilst allowing the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to be rechargeable and do communications.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Typically, a user will use one or more hearing assistance devices <b>100</b> and insert the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> into their ear canal. The hearing assistance device, reuses its wireless charging circuit connected to the rechargeable batteries as a receiver for wireless communications and its audio amplifier as a transmitter for wireless communications with the wireless charger <b>190</b>, which achieves a smaller form factor/size. Thus, the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> as a hearing aid can fit inside a greater amount of human ear canals in the human population. Thus, separate charging and separate communication circuits could be used but the form factor size of the device would need to be bigger to fit these extra components.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Also, reusing the same components i) decreases the amount of things that can break, ii) decreases costs to manufacture these devices, iii) improves/shortens manufacturing time, as well as iv) increases reliability by, for example, removing the vulnerable exterior electrical contact found on previous hearing assistance devices <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, the design uses wireless charging as well as wireless communications, including sending commands, firmware updates, receiving data and feedback from the hearing assistance device, etc. between the wireless charger <b>190</b> and the hearing assistance device. Thus, no need exists to have an electrical contact on an exterior of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), which would be exposed to be attacked by the corrosive environment (sweat, etc.) in the ear canal. The wireless communications keeps wax from interfering with the communications if there was an external data contact. Thus, the device actually gets better communications and more reliable communication of information via wireless communications instead of communications of firmware updates via an external contact.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Note, an example hearing assistance device <b>100</b> can have dimensions which allow the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to fit and be implemented as an in-the-ear-canal hearing aid and/or an ear bud.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an example wireless charging circuit of the wireless charger configured to cooperate with an audio circuit of the hearing assistance device to communicate and exchange data with the wireless charger with two different frequency bands.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The Wireless Charger</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The wireless charging circuit of the wireless charger <b>190</b> can generate and send the wireless data in the ultrasonic frequency range, including sending firmware updates, as well as, have a microphone to receive data from the speaker built into the hearing assistance device, which eliminates a need to have an external electrical contact on an exterior of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to transfer the data or the firmware updates. The wireless charger <b>190</b> is equipped with a microprocessor, such as an STM32L4R5 microprocessor, which is connected to an oscillator and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) by an I2C bus to control the frequency and amplitude of the charging signal. The charging signal, via amplitude modulation, can be used as a carrier wave for the wireless data transmissions in the ultrasonic frequency range. The wireless charger <b>190</b> is configured to transfer energy to the hearing instrument/assistance device over a 6 to 13 MHz contactless charging link. The microprocessor in the wireless charger <b>190</b> connects to an oscillator, which is the same oscillator that the wireless charger <b>190</b> uses to transfer power. The wireless carrier frequency can be, for example, <b>13</b> megahertz. The oscillator connects to a class D amplifier that the wireless charger <b>190</b> uses to drive the charging coil to be the wireless source of power as well as a carrier wave for wireless data transmission to the hearing assistance device. The oscillator connects to the class D amplifier to drive the charging coil to just a constant <b>13</b> megahertz to transfer power. The data in the communication signal can be added/modulated onto the carrier frequency wave to convey the information wirelessly. The wireless data transmitted can be modulated, as an amplitude modulation signal, across the charging signal wave. The wireless communications have a modulator-demodulator module in the input signal path of the wireless charging circuit in the hearing assistance device; and likewise, a modulator-demodulator module exists in the wireless charger <b>190</b>. Alternatively, data in the communication signal can be added by simply having the signal turned on and off to convey the information wirelessly.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Again, the communications signal can be modulated, as an amplitude modulation signal, across the charge signal wave. Thus, when the charger wants to transmit a start bit, a logical one, or a logical zero, the modulator can turn signals on or shut off. The class D amplifier can have one side high and the opposite side will be low. During charging, this arrangement will normally switch at <b>13</b> megahertz but for communication, the wireless charger <b>190</b> can just stop switching.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The Eargo Charger Comm (ECC) module is configured to enable bidirectional communication between the wireless charger <b>190</b> and a hearing instrument/assistance device (HI) over a contactless charging system.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Before communications a wireless data transmission occurs, the modulator-demodulator module can use a unique starting pattern before transmission of the wireless data to help the reliability of the wireless transmission to eliminate environmental noise in the same frequency band, which could be errantly interrupted as a data being intentionally transferred and/or a command to perform a corresponding operation in the hearing assistance device. Thus, a modulator in the wireless charger <b>190</b> is configured to use a unique starting pattern before a wireless transmission of the data communications occurs to prevent environmental noise in the ultrasonic frequency range from being interpreted as the wireless data. The ECC Init Ack Delay parameter defines the time from receiving the initialization command, or signal, to when the device acknowledges the start of an ECC session. The purpose for this delay is to separate in time the normal audio output of a hearing assistance device <b>100</b> from the acknowledgment. This helps the demodulator to detect the start of the acknowledgment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Note, in the packet protocol we have a preamble/unique starting pattern such as <b>1010</b> pretend bits before transmission of the data. If that preamble/unique starting pattern is not detected the signal processing can stop right there because although this signal is within the correct frequency band it's not addressed with the preamble; and thus, not a valid communications signal to be sent to the microprocessor later downstream.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The charger modulates the charging signal and data communications signal to the hearing instrument at 28.8 K Baud. Thus, the transmit line of a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) from the charger microprocessor (e.g., STM32L4R5 microprocessor) modulates the charging signal to create an inverted amplitude shift keyed (ASK) signal which represents the UART communication.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The UART in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> and/or in the wireless charger <b>190</b> can be a physical circuit in a microcontroller. The UART's main purpose can be to transmit and receive data, such as serial data. The universal receiver transmitter is configured to start interpreting what is the message/meaning/intelligence in the communicated information signal that is being sent across the charge signal. The UART also can be configured to support communications in the audio frequency band.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The Hearing Assistance Device</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The audio amplifier circuit in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is used for multiple purposes including i) as a transmitter for wireless communications to a wireless charger <b>190</b> in the audio frequency range through the audio amplifier circuit as well as ii) an audio amplifier circuit for the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to transmit sound to a user's ear. The design integrates multiple purposes/uses into 1) the charging circuit of the wireless charger <b>190</b> (charging power source and the transmitter for the wireless communications) as well as 2) the audio amplifier of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to amplify sound for the user's ear and act as a transmitter of wireless communications to the microphone of the wireless charger <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the hearing assistance device, during wireless communications, the modulator-demodulator is in the input signal path of the wireless charging circuit. Thus, the input of the charging chip (e.g., LTC4126 charging chip) in the wireless charging circuit located in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is also tied to an analog demodulation circuit which reconstructs the UART signal and inputs it to the UART RX pin on the signal processor (e.g., Ezairo <b>7120</b> signal processor) within the hearing instrument/assistance device. The analog demodulation circuit has a diode rectifier. Note, the modulation can be the process of influencing data information on the carrier in the wireless charger <b>190</b>, while demodulation in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> can be the recovery of the original information from a carrier wave at the distant end. In this example, amplitude modulation is being used. Thus, the circuit sends the received signal down to the demodulator, where the circuit has a diode rectifier inside, that extracts the communicated information signal off of the charging signals acting as the carrier wave carrying both the charging and the communications. The diode aids to detect the communicated information signal, and then the circuit supplies that communication signal over to the UART, which starts interpreting what is the message/meaning/intelligence in the communicated information signal that is being sent across the charge signal. The firmware is set up in the UART so that there is no significantly different processing that the design has to do to determine logical ones and zeros as this arrangement does this decoding automatically. Thus, the information used for communications including commands can be determined from the received charge frequency signal by routing the design in this manner.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, the analog demodulation circuit on amplitude modulation from the wireless charger <b>190</b> has a diode rectifier in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> that extracts the communicated information signal off of the charging signals acting as the carrier wave. The demodulator UART in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> receives and decodes these communications and commands that were, for example, amplitude modulated on the charge signal and then sends the feedback and/or response back over the audio COM signal to the microphone of the wireless charger <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note, the UART in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> can be a physical circuit in a microcontroller. The UART transmits and receives data, such as serial data. The UART can be configured to support communications in the audio frequency band, such as sub-bass (40 Hz) to near ultrasonic (18,000 Hz) as well as ultrasonic frequencies above human hearing 20,000 hertz up to megahertz and those frequencies typically used for wireless charging. The asynchronous serial communication can be a data format and transmission speeds that sends data bits one by one, from the least significant to the most significant, framed by start and stop bits so that precise timing is handled by the communication channel. The transmit Baud Rate parameter sets the transmit UART baud rate through the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> audio output. The parameter is limited to standard UART baud rates in software. The receive Baud Rate parameter sets the receive UART baud rate through the charging signal. The parameter is limited to standard UART baud rates in software.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Again, the wireless charger <b>190</b> can send communications and/or commands from the wireless charger <b>190</b> to the hearing aid, and can update its firmware. The wireless charger <b>190</b> can send for example, mostly parameter writes, parameter reads, data logging, an initiate so data logging is instigate data logging write, a command to read, whatever the prom data, etc. For example, the wireless charger <b>190</b> communications can request battery status from the hearing instrument. The hearing assistance device <b>100</b> receives and decodes these communications and commands that were amplitude modulated on the charge signal and then responds and sends the feedback and/or response back over the audio COM signal to the microphone of the wireless charger <b>190</b>. For example, the hearing instrument communicates in the audio frequency band through its speaker information such as feedback information that was collected in the hearing aid on user interaction and other recorded metrics. Alternatively, the Charger Comm (ECC) module in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> can merely respond to the commands by taking an action, such as the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> entering a specific operating mode to go to sleep, eliminating squeal feedback, etc.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The wireless charger <b>190</b> provides a reliable way to actually change all of the firmware in, for example, the digital signal processor of the Charger Comm (ECC) module in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> whenever we want. For example, the wireless charger <b>190</b> can transmit a command and data to install new firmware on the carrier wave 1) during charging, after the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is in operation, 2) while the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is in operation and installed in a user's ear, 3) while the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is in operation and being stored in a housing of the wireless charger <b>190</b>, and 4) any combination of these. Using the higher frequency, ultrasonic frequency, of the charging circuit significantly increases the data rate at which the information can be communicated to the hearing assistance device. Note, this design also again gives an easy and reliable way to actually grab the data logs from the memories of the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> whenever we want 1) during charging, after the hearing aid is in operation, 2) while in the hearing aid is installed in a user's ear, after the hearing aid is in operation, etc.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, the return wireless communications signal is sent from the speaker audio output of the hearing instrument/assistance device and received by a microphone within the wireless charger <b>190</b>. The ECC module outputs data on the UART TX transmit line and loops it back to the signal processor (e.g., Ezairo <b>7120</b> signal processor). An edge triggered interrupt inverted amplitude shift keyed signal modulates an audio tone out of the hearing instrument/assistance device by enabling and disabling the audio output of the signal processor (0=on; 1=off). This audio signal is received by the charger microphone and passed to the charger microcontroller (e.g., STM32L4R5 microcontroller) over an I2S bus. The digitized signal is demodulated to reconstruct the data sent by the hearing instrument/assistance device. Note, the I2S (Inter-IC Sound) bus, can be an electrical serial bus interface standard used for connecting digital audio devices together. The I2S bus can be used to communicate audio data between these devices. Note, the data in the audio frequency range sent through the speaker to the charger can be formatted with two size bytes, I2C payload, and a two byte CRC at the end.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, the power supply of the charge circuit in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> is tied to the output of the UART. The charging chip (e.g., LTC4126 charging chip) is in charge of controlling the charging of the battery. During charging of the batteries in the hearing assistance devices <b>100</b>, the signal from the charger is accepted by the charging chip for charging the Lithium Ion battery in the hearing instrument/assistance device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Firmware Overview</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">There can be a set of commands on the signal processor in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> to interpret all of those commands being sent to the wireless transmission. The signal processor in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> using Open Framework FW relies on an I2C bus for bidirectional communication with the device. These I2C commands are processed in the I2C control module. The Open Framework FW automatically keeps track of the memory locations of the parameters for all modules through the I2C control module; and thus, ensures other memory locations are not corrupted attempting parameter changes. This configuration allows the connecting software to only have to keep track of the module numbers and the parameter offsets within each module rather than the memory locations of each parameter.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The hearing assistance device <b>100</b> can use the UART bus to communicate rather than the I2C bus because of the contactless nature of the device. The Charger Comm (ECC) module was developed to interface with the I2C control module using the UART bus. The ECC is designed to wrap the two byte UART size and a two byte cyclic redundancy check (CRC) around the I2C payload which is normally sent to the I2C control module over the I2C bus minus the I2C address byte. Each I2C payload is sent with a command byte (CMD), and RX data if the command requires it.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The UART size is set to the number of bytes received after the UART size bytes. For example, UART size will equal [e.g., 0&#xd7;00 0&#xd7;03] if there is only a CMD byte necessary (e.g., 1 byte for CMD+2 bytes for CRC).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The ECC EEPROM Write command is designed to update firmware on the signal processor in the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> as efficiently as possible by having the capability to write an entire page in one command. The command requires a 3 byte starting address (&#x201c;Address&#x201d;), a payload size (&#x201c;Size&#x201d;), and the payload to be written to EEPROM (&#x201c;Payload&#x201d;). The on-board EEPROM in the signal processor can be, for example, 2 Mb. The maximum payload size of the ECC EEPROM Write command can be 256 bytes which matches the page size of the on-board EEPROM of the signal processor.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, if the programmer attempted the following write to EEPROM the following steps may occur.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first step in the process is to write to the non-volatile memory (NVM) of the signal processor on the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> by sending an enable command to the onboard EEPROM. The ECC EEPROM Open command is implemented as a separate command so it does not have to be sent before every write attempt. This reduces the time it takes to update firmware on the hearing assistance device <b>100</b> by leaving the write enabled on the EEPROM for an entire firmware update rather than opening it every write cycle.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, in an embodiment, the cyclic redundancy check can have a seed value. The checker divides the whole packet by a seed number and the remainder is this CRC. The cyclic redundancy check can be a CRC-CCITT with a OxFFFF seed value. This CRC checker is also built into the signal processor. The two byte CRC is calculated across the UART size bytes, the CMD byte and the RX data. The entire packet (UART size, I2C Payload, two byte CRC) is run through the CRC calculation upon reception. The CRC could be applied across merely the unique starting pattern as well. In an embodiment, any non-zero result indicates at least one bit is in error in the packet.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an example of a UART decoder in the hearing assistance device to receive and process the wireless data from the wireless charger. The hearing assistance device <b>100</b> can receive and process the wireless signal from the wireless charger <b>190</b>. The signal can come into the microphone from the audio channel at, for example, 48 Kilo samples per second (ksps). The example device uses a biquad bandpass filter (e.g., 2 biquad BPF). The device uses the band pass filter to set the range of what frequency range of signal the system wants to get through and filter out erroneous signals from the comms signal. The bandpass filter filters out audible noise to isolate the comms channel. Note, the biquad filter block can independently filter each channel of the input signal with the specified biquadratic infinite impulse response filter. The example biquad filter block can specify the filter coefficients. The biquad filter helps to isolate and slice off the power charging signal from the communication signal received from the wireless charger <b>190</b> so that the example UART can get the logical ones and zeros from the demodulated information off the carrier wave.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The example biquad filter block can use a signal with, for example, 15.5 or 18 kHz to isolate to that channel. The example device passes the signal from the bandpass filter to an absolute value block (e.g., x[n]<sup>2</sup>). The signal from the wireless charger <b>190</b> was transmitted with amplitude modulation for the bytes of information onto the transmitted signal with both the positive and negative swings on the wave. The circuitry then applies a squared so that both sides of the wireless transmitted signal can be decoded and understood in order to improve the value of the bit detection in the content payload. The squared function applied can ensure that the wavelength signal being received is at least a threshold amount above the noise floor to ensure that the current audio signal being processed is not a spurious audio signal generated by the environment. So the example device can use both the positive and negative swings on the wave to figure out information by taking the peak to peak value. Whether the information from the amplitude modulation is a logical one or a logical zero with the absolute value, the device can determine what that information is on both swings of the wave. Note, the example device could also use a half wave to just knock out all negative, but in this particular case, the example device does use a full wave envelope. Using both the positive and negative swings of the transmitted signal results in being much more power efficient and longer battery life.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, the device uses the bandpass filter and obtains the filtered amplitude modulation signal. The example device uses a decimate block (e.g., Decimate by 2). Thus, the microphone data comes in at 48 k samples that were narrowly band pass filtered and now this block decimates the signal to 24 K samples a second. This function can be performed by an internal Cortex 3 m processor. Now, the example device can apply the low pass filter (e.g., biquad LPF) to reconstruct the baseband.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The example design can use a biquad low pass filter, apply a Gaussian filtered wave and detect those edges, to determine a limiter. The limiter (e.g., Limiter) helps determine the threshold that's the design's limit threshold and reconstruct the waveform. Next, the example device uses a DMA Controller (e.g., DMA). The DMA Controller can be a hardware device that allows I/O devices to directly access memory with less participation from the processor. The example device uses a DMA to feed the signal back into the universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART). In the microprocessor then the system gets an interrupt that says hey a byte has been detected. In one example, all the timing of the decoding and all of the ones and zeros determination is actually done by the Cortex m3 processor.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Note, the example design doesn't have to use clock cycles to try to get the logical ones and logical zero bytes out. Thus, the example design doesn't have to have some kind of clock to figure out how to decode.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of an example of the hearing assistance device to communicate data to the wireless charger in the audio frequency band through its speaker information, such as feedback information that was collected by and/or in the hearing assistance device on user interaction and other recorded metrics.
