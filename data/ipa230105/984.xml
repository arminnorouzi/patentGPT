With sight, it is possible to map the area around us as soon as the radiation produced, refracted, scattered, or reflected by any object can reach our eyes. The eyes are optic chambers with lensing capability that focus (i.e., compress) and represent the field of view on a highly specialized tissue, the retina, in the back of the eye. The retina is a multi-layered, cellular structure that can transform focused fields of view into a transmittable signal and deliver it to the lateral geniculate nucleus, where the optic nerve makes synapsis. From there, nerve fibers (i.e., axons) irradiate to the visual cortices areas where visual data is processed to produce appropriate responses. In the retina, the cells responsible for primary light sensitivity are the photoreceptors. The photoreceptors are the cells that transduce light into synaptic signals and ultimately into action potentials propagated by the optic nerve to those areas in the brain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). The retina is mapped in the visual cortex so that the focused field of view that stimulates the retina is represented in the visual cortex.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Blindness is the inability to see. Part of the causes of blindness in humans is due to malfunction or degeneration of the photoreceptors. Once photoreceptors cannot transduce light into cell signals (synaptic signals and/or action potentials), blindness occurs. Some well characterized human diseases lead to permanent blindness by photoreceptor degeneration. For example, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a primarily metabolic disease that causes photoreceptor loss in the fovea, a region in the retina that produces accurate vision. Age-related macular degeneration is more prevalent in individuals 65 years of age and older, and therefore it is a significant concern because of population aging. Retinitis pigmentosa is a progressive, genetic disease that also causes photoreceptor degeneration with an overall prevalence of 1 in every 4,000 globally.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Once the photoreceptors have degenerated, light sensitivity cannot be recovered by any currently approved treatment. However, experimental techniques under development shed light on the problem. These experimental techniques aim to generate photoreceptors surrogates based on other cells in the retina. The often-targeted cells are the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which give rise to the axons that form the optic nerve. The premise is that by photo stimulating RGCs directly, the optic nerve would propagate the generated signals (action potentials) to the regions in the brain, ultimately to the visual cortex, and some sight would be able to be perceived. One of those techniques employs an intraocular implanted circuit chip containing electronics to transduce light into electrical signals to be directly delivered to the RGCs by some spiky structures that connect to these cells. However, the chip implantation requires major eye surgery and is susceptible to rejection or retinal damage following the procedure, representing a barrier to broadly employing this technique in humans. Another promising technique that enables photosensitivity to RGCs uses bioengineered light-sensitive proteins (i.e., channelrhodopsins) that make RGCs work as photoreceptors. The technique takes advantage of the well-known optogenetics technique based on viral infection of the host cells (i.e., RGCs), aiming to deliver a gene encoding channelrhodopsin. Theoretically, a promoter match would enable the expression of the coded protein only by a specific cell type (i.e., RGCs). This technique, however, suffers from likely immune rejection and the necessity of genetic manipulation of cells in the human eye. Therefore, developing new techniques and methods to bypass degenerated photoreceptors and restore sight is needed in a helpful extension.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an objective of the present invention to provide methods and compositions that allow for non-genetic methods for the treatment of vision loss caused by photoreceptor degeneration, as specified in the independent claims. Embodiments of the invention are given in the dependent claims. Embodiments of the present invention can be freely combined with each other if they are not mutually exclusive.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some aspects, the present invention is directed to the use of gold nanoparticles (or other light-to-heat transducer materials) to enable vision in the visually impaired. Retinal neurons can be directly stimulated with light to produce action potentials by gold nanoparticles conjugated to high-avidity ligands for various cellular targets. Once bound to a neuron, these particles transduce millisecond pulses of light into heat, which changes membrane capacitance, depolarizing the cell and eliciting action potentials. Compared to non-functionalized nanoparticles, ligand-conjugated nanoparticles highly resist convective washout and enable photothermal stimulation with lower delivered energy resulting in lower temperature increases over time. This technology, along with a camera and decoder, can aid the visually impaired by stimulating cells to send the appropriate messages to the visual cortex.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the present invention features a method of treating vision loss caused by photoreceptor degeneration and/or a method of establishing photosensitivity in retina cells in a subject in need thereof. The method may comprise introducing a light-to-heat transducer material (e.g., a gold nanoparticle) comprising an anchoring molecule to an eye of the patient and pulsing a light source into the eye of the patient.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other embodiments, the method for treating vision loss caused by photoreceptor degeneration and/or a method of establishing photosensitivity in retina cells in a subject in need thereof may comprise introducing gold nanoparticles comprising an anchoring molecule to an eye of the patient and pulsing a light source into the eye of the patient.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One of the unique and inventive technical features of the present invention is the use of a light-to-heat transducer material (e.g., gold nanoparticles) along with a light pulsing source. Without wishing to limit the invention to any theory or mechanism, it is believed that the technical feature of the present invention advantageously provides for a non-genetic method for treating vision loss caused by photoreceptor degeneration. Additionally, the flexibility of gold nanoparticles, spherical or cylindrical, to be used as light absorbers contrasts with other methods to provide light sensitivity to cells. Furthermore, gold nanoparticles are readily available by synthesis from research labs. Notably, gold nanoparticles are also fully biocompatible and have been approved for human usage by the FDA. None of the presently known prior references or work has the unique, inventive technical feature of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, the prior references teach away from the present invention. For example, optogenetics that uses algae channelrhodopsins performs poorly with red-shifted light wavelengths. Additionally, these studies targeting the retinal ganglion cells use a viral vector containing the genetic code for a channelrhodopsin (an ion channel gated by light) to genetically modify the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the inventive technical features of the present invention contributed to a surprising result. For example, light pulses as short as 100 microseconds can produce activation in cortical neurons. These very short pulses allow for a high frequency pulsed light stimulation (e.g., 20 Hz) and yet a very short duty cycle (e.g., 0.2%). In other words, even at a 20 Hz light stimulation that can enable natural movement vision 99.8% of the time (49.9 milliseconds), the retina will not be receiving light, which is advantageous for heat dissipation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the present invention features a method for optocapacitance (i.e., a non-genetic technique) to re-enable photosensitivity on the degenerated or damaged retina. Optocapacitance is a recently discovered phenomenon whereby a brief pulse of heat changes the membrane temperature by less than 2 degrees Celsius, which changes the membrane capacitance at the proportion of 1 C/1% increase in membrane capacitance. Quickly increased capacitance changes the membrane potential (depolarization). The present invention harnesses this knowledge to be used in the eye to activate light cells that are not naturally photosensitive, therefore re-enabling photosensitivity to retinas after photoreceptor degeneration or damage.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A crucial variation of this technique is the possibility of expanding the visible spectrum to include near-infrared wavelengths. Gold nanoparticles or other light-to-heat transducer materials described herein can readily absorb radiation in the range of 1,000 nm and transduce the light energy into heat in a helpful manner for the optocapacitive effect described herein. The present invention is not limited to vision restoration and may also be used to improve normal vision as well.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additionally, no continuous light is needed for the methods described herein to work and produce suprathreshold depolarizations in the RGCs membranes. A hundred microseconds laser pulse is enough to generate the visual cortex's neurons to be activated. The laser power for this case is around 700 mW, which gives a total energy of 70 microJoules. This energy is way smaller than lasers used in ophthalmology during eye procedures. Nevertheless, this level of energy may change when fine-tuning the method in humans.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Any feature or combination of features described herein are included within the scope of the present invention provided that the features included in any such combination are not mutually inconsistent as will be apparent from the context, this specification, and the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. Additional advantages and aspects of the present invention are apparent in the following detailed description and claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S)</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a consideration of the following detailed description presented in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show gold-nanoparticles-assisted optocapacitance (GNPAO) to re-enable photosensitivity in photoreceptor degenerated retinas. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a schematic of normal retina phototransduction, indicating the primary retina cells involved in the process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows photoreceptors-degenerated retina, as in cases of AMD and RP diseases, indicating impaired phototransduction at the photoreceptors layer.

Inset: 1) Light stimulus, 2) heat emission, 3) depolarization by a capacitive current, and 4) propagation of RGC's action potentials through the optic nerve to the brain. Visual cortex (in the brain) activity is directly recorded electrically as visual evoked potentials (VEPs) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>7</b>C, and <b>7</b>D</figref>). A stereotyped behavior (light avoidance) in response to activation of neurons mainly in the visual cortex will be detected by light avoidance behavior tests (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the four groups of animals that were compared: wild-type C57BI/6J mice served as controls and did not receive any injection of GNPs. TKO mice were split into three groups: 1) those that did not receive any injections and those that received an intravitreal injection of GNPs to the left eye and were tested at 2) 24 hours post-injection or 3) 48 hours post-injection.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows representative visual evoked potentials (VEPs) elicited by a 0.1 ms 520 nm laser stimulus. The wild-type C57 mouse exhibits a typical VEP waveform, exhibiting distinct P1, N1, and P2 components. In the case of a TKO mouse that has not received any injection of GNPs, no VEP is discernible. None of the untreated TKO elicited a VEP in any of them. In stark contrast, in a TKO mouse that has received GNPs, at either 24 h or 48 h post-injection, there are robust VEPs that resemble those recorded in WT animals. Quantification of VEP amplitude (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, top right) shows that the magnitude of VEPs in mice 24 hours after injection of GNPs are comparable to those recorded in C57 mice and in some animals may even be enhanced. These VEPs seem to be relatively stable, as they are still robust at 48 hours post-injection. Interestingly, the kinetics of VEPs recorded in TKO mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, bottom right) appear to be slightly delayed compared to those recorded in C57 mice.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows representative traces obtained in each group. In C57 mice, a large waveform consisting of the typical A- and B-wave is clearly visible, which suggests photoreceptor and bipolar cell activation. Also, present along the rising edge of the B-wave is oscillatory potentials, reflecting the activity of inhibitory interneuron populations of the retina. In stark contrast, no ERG waveform was detectable in traces from TKO mice, regardless of whether GNPs had been injected.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an in-house VEP recording system for anesthetized mice. A laser diode (520 nm or 808 nm) is used as a source for light stimulations. These laser diodes will be transistor-transistor logic (TTL)-triggered by the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog (AD/DA) converter of the system. Differential signals collected from the top of the visual cortex (active electrode) relative to the reference electrode placed rostral to the bregma reference point in the mice's skull will be filtered and amplified by an AC amplifier (AC AMP), then digitized and recorded in a hard drive of a personal computer. For body temperature control, the mice will be placed on a temperature-controlled surface (Heating pad, gray surface under the represented mice).

In other embodiments, the gold nanoparticles comprise both spherical gold nanoparticles and cylindrical gold nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the gold nanoparticle comprises a spherical gold nanoparticle, a cylindrical gold nanoparticle, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the light-to-heat transducer material is a silicon-based material (e.g., an amorphous silicon). In some embodiments, the light-to-heat transducer material is carbon. In other embodiments, the light-to-heat transducer material is a carbon nanotube. In further embodiments, the light-to-heat transducer material is graphite. In some embodiments, the light-to-heat transducer material is graphene.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the cell signal is a synaptic signal. In other embodiments, the cell signal is an action potential.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Since the biological milieu of living tissues has high water concentration and water is an excellent heat absorber, the gold nanoparticles must be placed at a very close distance from cell membranes to minimize the distance required for heat diffusion from the gold nanoparticle to the cell membrane where the heat will cause a temperature increase.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Therefore, in some embodiments, the light-to-heat transducer material comprises an anchoring molecule. As used herein, an &#x201c;anchoring molecule&#x201d; refers to a molecule that attaches the light-to-heat transducer material (e.g., a gold nanoparticle) to a molecule in the membrane of the target cell. In some embodiments, the anchoring molecule is a primary antibody. In some embodiments, the primary antibody is against a membrane protein expressed by a target cell. In some embodiments, the target cell is retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In other embodiments, the target cell is a bipolar cell (e.g., bipolar cells in the retina). In other embodiments, the anchoring molecule is cholesterol. Without wishing to limit the present invention, it is believed that when cholesterol is attached to a light-to-heat transducer material (e.g., a gold nanoparticle), the light-to-heat transducer material comprising an anchoring molecule (i.e., cholesterol) will enter the membrane and keep the light-to-heat transducer material (e.g., a gold nanoparticle) close to the membrane for light stimulation.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the anchoring molecule is attached to the light-to-heat transducer material via a linker. In some embodiments, the linker is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker. In other embodiments, the linker is a polyethylene glycol polymer linker. In some embodiments, the link is polyethylene glycol 2000 (PEG 2000). Without wishing to limit the present invention to any theory or mechanism it is believed the PEG is an inert piece of a molecule that bridges the light-to-heat transducer material (e.g., the gold nanoparticle) to the anchoring molecule. In some embodiments, the linker may comprise a peptide linker. In other embodiments, the linker may comprise an inert molecule.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the optocapacitance (i.e., the methods described herein) is an effect crucially dependent on the distance between the heat source (e.g., the gold nanoparticles) and the membranes of the target cells. The heat generated by the gold nanoparticles must diffuse through the aqueous extracellular space to reach the membrane and change its temperature. The speed of change in membrane temperature increases as the distance decreases. Therefore, in some embodiments, an effective anchoring molecule greatly boosts the optocapacitive effect since it keeps the gold nanoparticles attached to the target cell (e.g., the retinal ganglion cells). Additionally, in some embodiments, anchoring molecules also ensure cell specificity. In some embodiments, anchoring molecules must be attached to the gold nanoparticle core through a polyethylene glycol polymer linker to avoid steric issues close to the membrane. In some embodiments, the linker places the gold nanoparticle at around 13 nanometers from the anchoring molecule to limit the distance between the gold nanoparticles and the cell membrane when the cell labeling procedure is complete.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In preferred embodiments, the linker places the light-to-heat transducer material (e.g., the gold nanoparticle) about 13 nanometers away from the anchoring molecule.

In some embodiments, the linker places the light-to-heat transducer material (e.g., the gold nanoparticle) about 21 nanometers, or about 22 nanometers, or about 23 nanometers, or about 24 nanometers, or about 25 nanometers, or about 26 nanometers, or about 27 nanometers, or about 28 nanometers, or about 29 nanometers, or about 30 nanometers away from the anchoring molecule. In some embodiments, the linker places the light-to-heat transducer material (e.g., the gold nanoparticle) about 25 nanometers, or about 30 nanometers, or about 35 nanometers, or bout 40 nanometers, or about 45 nanometers, or about 50 nanometers, or about 55 nanometers, or about 60 nanometers away from the anchoring molecule. In other embodiments, the linker may place the light-to-heat transducer material greater than 60 nanometers from the anchoring molecule.

Briefly, the methods described herein comprise the delivery of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to the intravitreal space of an affected individual's eyes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), and the subsequent association of these GNPs to the membranes of retinal ganglion cells, the centrally-projecting neurons responsible for conveying light information to the brain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). By the rapid heating of these GNPs with an appropriate wavelength and duration of concentrated laser light, ganglion cell depolarization can be achieved with tight spatial and temporal control. A line of triple knockout (TKO) mice were utilized for the experiments presented herein. These mice lack three core genes that play integral roles in the three main phototransduction pathways of the retina, effectively rendering them completely blind except under very specific dim-light conditions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> outlines the 4 groups of animals that were compared: wild-type C57BI/6J mice served as controls and did not receive any injection of GNPs. TKO mice were split into three groups: 1) those that did not receive any injections, and those that received an intravitreal injection of GNPs to the left eye and were tested at 2) 24 hours post-injection, or (3) 48 hours post injection. In order for GNPs to effectively depolarize neurons when stimulated with light, they must be concentrated in sufficient numbers very close to the plasma membrane, at distances on the order of nanometers. If GNPs are too few or are too far away, not sufficient heat will hit the membrane in an effective fashion to quickly increase membrane temperature and to cause its depolarization and therefore neuronal activation. To achieve this close association and to prolong the duration that GNPs are maintained in tissue it is necessary to conjugate GNPs to some sort of binding agent. For the experiments presented herein, GNPs that were attached to molecules of cholesterol, which served to anchor them to the lipid bilayers of retinal neurons were used. Testing of visual sensitivity comprised the recording of visually-evoked potentials (VEPs), the presence of which signifies central activation of the visual pathway. In some cases, electroretinograms (ERGs), which reflect the activation of retinal interneurons, were also recorded. All of these recordings were performed under light-adapted conditions, which are known to suppress any residual photosensitivity in TKO mice.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> representative VEPs elicited by a 0.1 ms 520 nm laser stimulus are presented. The wild-type C57 mouse exhibits a typical VEP waveform, exhibiting distinct P1, N1, and P2 components. In the case of a TKO mouse that has not received any injection of GNPs, no VEP is discernible. Six of these untreated TKO mice were recorded and all of the TKO mice failed to elicit a VEP in any of them. In stark contrast, in a TKO mouse that has received GNPs, at either 24 h or 48 h post injection, there are robust VEPs that resemble those recorded in WT animals. Quantification of VEP amplitude (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, top right) shows that the magnitude of VEPs in mice 24 hours after injection of GNPs are comparable to those recorded in C57 mice, and in some animals may even be enhanced. These VEPs seem to be relatively stable, as they are still robust at 48 hours post-injection. Interestingly, the kinetics of VEPs recorded in TKO mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, bottom right) appear to be slightly delayed compared to those recorded in C57 mice. It is unclear whether this is attributable to the unique mechanism of optocapacitive depolarization of ganglion cells or is simply the result of altered visual development in TKO mice. Regardless, the restoration of VEPs to TKO mice signifies the activation of the visual cortex in these animals from light-induced activation of retinal afferents. This suggests that these animals likely possess some form of light-adapted visual perception after treatment with GNPs.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">To further characterize the retinal origin of these VEPs, ERGs were recorded in C57, uninjected TKO, and injected TKO mice. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows representative traces obtained in each group. In C57 mice, a large waveform consisting of the typical A- and B-wave is clearly visible, which suggests photoreceptor and bipolar cell activation. Also, present along the rising edge of the B-wave are oscillatory potentials, reflecting the activity of inhibitory interneuron populations of the retina. In stark contrast to this, no ERG waveform was detectable in traces from TKO mice, regardless of whether GNPs had been injected. This provides good evidence that the VEPs recorded in these animals are the result of specific interactions between the GNPs and ganglion cells and suggests that intravitreal injection of GNPs likely provides the means for restoring visual sensitivity to ganglion cells without the potential complication of concurrent activity of upstream retinal processing.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0070">The following embodiments are intended to be illustrative only and not to be limiting in any way.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Embodiment 1: A method for treating vision loss caused by photoreceptor degeneration in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising: (a) introducing a light-to-heat transducer material comprising an anchoring molecule to an eye of the subject;
