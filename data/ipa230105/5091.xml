id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Embodiments of a system and method for interactive barcode communication are described. In one embodiment, a mobile device presents a barcode to an information or transaction receptacle associated with the point of entry device. One embodiment provides for a method of transmitting data from an unconnected point of access device using an interactive barcode communication system on a mobile device, where the method comprises accessing a set of data on a point of access device, wherein the point of access device is unconnected from a data network with access to a central system database; dividing the set of data into multiple sections; incorporating the multiple sections into scan images for display during per-user transactions at the point of access device; and displaying the point of access data along with per-user transaction data during an interactive barcode communication transaction.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="104.22mm"

In one embodiment, the central database records the station information where the transaction occurred, as shown at block <b>701</b>. At block <b>703</b>, the station identification information is analyzed by the ventral database to search for patterns in station usage to be applied to advertising. At block <b>705</b>, is a pattern in station usage emerges (that is, home station, work station, etc.), central system <b>102</b> transmits to mobile device <b>104</b> targeted advertisements related to retail locations in proximity to those stations. In another embodiment, advertisement may be based on the location of the station and presenting marketing information or advertisements that pertain to the location, if a pattern is not found. At block <b>707</b>, mobile device <b>104</b> receives the transmitted advertisement and displays it on to the screen. In one embodiment, the advertisement is linkable to a website or other electronic resource (that is, a user may click or touch the advertisement to be forwarded to another electronic resource or server). In another embodiment, the user is presented discount coupons related to businesses in the vicinity of the user's current location. In yet another embodiment, such advertisements may be associated with user surveys, and optionally presenting the user an incentive to complete the surveys. In general, any advertisement strategy can be applied to generate an additional revenue stream, in lieu to the ones described herein.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In one embodiment, as shown at block <b>709</b>, the advertisement notification logic is supplemented with an algorithm to analyze the patterns of stations used and time of use for a user to determine if and when certain notices should be sent to the user, such as a notice of insufficient balance for next predicted use. As shown at block <b>711</b>, the device app can display a notice based on an account balance (e.g., current/predicted), pattern of station usage, next expected usage, etc. For example, if a use's account balance indicates an insufficient balance to complete the day's predicted usage, or to complete the immediate next predicted use, a notice can be displayed to the user. In one embodiment, other notifications can be displayed to the user based on pattern of use, such as delays at stations used by the user.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Code-Time Data Generation</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As described above, in one embodiment, central system <b>102</b> transmits multiple encryption codes along with time period information (code-time data), instructing mobile device <b>104</b> to use a certain encryption code during a specified time period.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary table <b>800</b> of code-time data generated by the encryption code generator <b>106</b>. In addition to having this information at the turnstile device, mobile device <b>104</b> can use the code-time data to generate the unique barcodes, responsive to which point of entry device can permit access across a path. Such a process can be used to prevent misuse of the barcodes at point of entry devices <b>108</b> by providing additional flexibility to manipulate the validity of a particular barcode only during a certain period of time. In one embodiment, each unique barcode based on the code-time data is valid for a single use (by embedding a date along with the time data). In another embodiment, the code-time data is reusable during certain hours, based on the time of use.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in one embodiment, data table <b>800</b> comprises multiple account numbers (e.g., <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, etc.) assigned different unique encryption codes using which unique barcodes are generated by mobile device <b>104</b>. Further table <b>800</b> shows numerous time/date-stamps during which each of the assigned encryption code is expected to be used by mobile device <b>104</b> to successfully gain access across point of entry device <b>108</b>. For example, on Jun. 1, 2014, between 9:00 am and 9:45 am, fora user with account number <b>101</b>, point of entry device <b>108</b> can expect the unique barcode to be generated using encryption code 10305. Similarly, during 12:00 pm and 12:45 pm, point of entry device <b>108</b> can expect mobile device <b>104</b> of account holder <b>101</b> to use encryption code 13500 to generate the unique bar code.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">During the above specified times, when the unique barcode is scanned, the data store of point of entry device <b>108</b> verifies that the correct encryption code is used in the data value of the unique barcode. If the correct barcode is used, in one embodiment, the standard acceptance code is generated and displayed by point of entry device, as discussed above. Similarly, if the correct barcode is not used, a standard rejection barcode is displayed by point of entry device <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, different (random) timestamps are associated with different account numbers (that is, not all account numbers would be expected to generate a new barcode at a given time to date stamp). For example, as shown account number <b>102</b> expects a new encryption code (thus, new unique barcode) to be used between 9:05 am and 10:00 am on Jun. 1, 2014. As can be noted, this time stamp is different (although overlapping) than the one used for account number <b>101</b>. Such randomness increases the security in issuing new random and unique barcodes and assists in preventing fraud or misuse of the system.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">General Interaction of a Mobile Device and Information Receptacle</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates the interaction between a mobile device and a transaction or information receptacle of the interactive barcode communication system, in one embodiment.

The smartphone <b>904</b> displays a first barcode, which is scanned or captured by information receptacle <b>908</b>, which is associated with a point of entry device <b>108</b>. The first barcode can comprise any information that may be required to identify the mobile device and/or account holder (subscriber ID, account number, etc.). Once information receptacle <b>908</b> processes the information from the first barcode, information receptacle <b>908</b> displays a second barcode. The second barcode is captured by mobile device <b>904</b> using a barcode scanning mechanism. Information from the second barcode is processed by mobile device <b>904</b>. The second barcode can comprise an acceptance code, a rejection code, along with other pertinent information like a timestamp. In one embodiment, the second information also comprises a unique turnstile device ID. In yet another embodiment, the second information further includes a unique station ID.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">After the second information is processed, optionally, mobile device <b>904</b> displays a third barcode. In one embodiment, the third barcode represents a confirmation code or message using which the information receptacle performs a certain action required to complete a transaction (e.g., instructing a system to permit the user across a turnstile). In one embodiment, the third barcode is displayed only if the second barcode information comprised a signal indicating successful processing of the information first barcode (e.g., an acceptance code). The third barcode is scanned by information receptacle <b>908</b>, and after processing, the information receptacle can implement steps that are required after a successful completion of a transaction or occurrence, like permitting access across a turnstile device (based on the turnstile device ID previously received by mobile device <b>904</b> from the second barcode).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The techniques described herein are not limited to traditional barcodes or barcode readers, and can be used with various image-scanning devices, including camera devices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment in which the interactive communication system is implemented using an image code (e.g., QR code, data matrix, digital watermark, etc.) scanned using a camera of a mobile device <b>104</b>, such as smartphone <b>1104</b>. Smartphone device <b>1004</b> displays a first image code, which is scanned by the information receptacle <b>1008</b> adapted to scan image codes. In one embodiment, information receptacle <b>1008</b> is also configured to display image codes. Once information receptacle <b>1008</b> processes the information displayed in the first image code, information receptacle <b>1008</b> displays a second image code that is captured by the smartphone <b>1004</b>. The device processes the information from the second image code and displays a third image code that is captured by the information receptacle. Based on the information transmitted, information receptacle can be instructed to perform certain actions, based on the information communicated by smartphone device <b>1004</b> to information receptacle <b>1008</b>. In this disclosure, any use of a barcode may be substituted with an image code. Additionally, smartphone <b>904</b> and <b>1004</b> are examples of a mobile device <b>104</b>, and other mobile devices with a display and a barcode or image scanning device may be used.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The scanning and display distance for the barcode or image scanning techniques can vary.

The session key (SK<b>1</b>) is to identify which mobile device with which the point of entry intends to interact, as multiple mobile devices may be present and attempting to communicate with the information receptacle <b>1008</b>. Therefore only the correct mobile device will proceed with Scan <b>3</b>, for example, to deduct a transit fee from an account balance associated with the mobile device (e.g., when the point of entry is for a turnstile for a mass transit system). In one embodiment, during Scan <b>2</b>, the information receptacle <b>1008</b> displays a second unique session key (SK<b>2</b>). The second unique session key (SK<b>2</b>), in one embodiment, is the primary security element used during the transaction, and the mobile device repeats SK<b>2</b> during Scan <b>3</b> to be given access.

In one embodiment the remote device is a turnstile receptacle that conducts transactions with individual mobile devices and grants or denies entry based on certain factors and processes previously discussed herein. This process may be used to synchronize the data set of transactions performed by the turnstile since a previous update to the central system, or the data set of transactions performed within a specific time window (e.g., all transactions within a pre-determined period of time).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0151">Embodiments of the Interactive Barcode Communication system described herein include the capability of passing large amounts of data from a turnstile receptacle to the mobile device with which the turnstile is transacting.

In addition to the session key and turnstile identification, part of all of the data for previous transactions conducted by a turnstile can be divided and transmitted to the central system via the mobile devices used for of subsequent transactions. Using such process the turnstile data can be more quickly reconciled with the central system than scenarios in which the turnstile receptacle is provided a periodic network data connection, or in which the turnstile data is manually downloaded for upload to the central system.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> is a block diagram of a further embodiment of an interactive barcode communication system <b>3200</b>.

In one embodiment the data from the information receptacle may be divided into a large number of segments (e.g., significantly larger than the 4 segments illustrated), such that the amount of data transmitted by any one of the individual devices is beneath a specified threshold. By maintaining the amount of data to be transmitted beneath a threshold, the additional data communication overhead imposed on any one mobile device can be kept to a minimum to avoid disruption to other communication tasks on the device and to avoid negatively impacting any wireless data transmission quotas that may be present on any of the mobile devices <b>3504</b>A-D.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">Data Image Variation Matrix</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">A further embodiment provides for a method to enable placement of visual data elements within an image code in a way that can be overlapped to create multiple points of transmission on the screen of a device.
