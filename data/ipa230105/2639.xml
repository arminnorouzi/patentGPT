In addition, CMP using a polishing composition containing abrasive grains having high hardness has a problem in which surface defects called dishing in which a conductor metal part is scraped into a dish shape are likely to occur on the polished surface on which a conductor metal and an insulating film coexist.

Composition for Chemical Mechanical Polishing</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0033">A composition for chemical mechanical polishing according to one embodiment of the present invention contains (A) abrasive grains containing titanium oxide (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;component (A)&#x201d;), and (B) a liquid medium (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;component (B)&#x201d;), and the absolute value of the zeta potential of the component (A) in the composition for chemical mechanical polishing is 8 mV or higher. Hereinafter, respective components contained in the composition for chemical mechanical polishing according to the present embodiment will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0034">1.1. (A) Abrasive Grains Containing Titanium Oxide</p><p id="p-0043" num="0035">A composition for chemical mechanical polishing according to the present embodiment contains (A) abrasive grains containing titanium oxide. The component (A) is not particularly limited as long as it is abrasive grains which contain titanium oxide and in which the absolute value of the zeta potential in the composition for chemical mechanical polishing is 8 mV or higher. Regarding titanium oxide contained in the component (A), any of a rutile type, an anatase type, an amorphous type, and a mixture thereof can be used.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0036">The absolute value of the zeta potential of the component (A) in the composition for chemical mechanical polishing is 8 mV or higher, preferably 9 mV or higher, and more preferably 10 mV or higher. The absolute value of the zeta potential of the component (A) in the composition for chemical mechanical polishing is preferably 40 mV or lower. When the absolute value of the zeta potential of the component (A) in the composition for chemical mechanical polishing is within the above range, the dispersibility of abrasive grains in the composition for chemical mechanical polishing is improved due to an electrostatic repulsion force between abrasive grains. As a result, high-speed polishing can be performed while reducing the occurrence of polishing scratches and dishing.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0037">The average particle size of the component (A) is preferably 10 nm or more and 300 nm or less, and more preferably 20 nm or more and 200 nm or less. When the average particle size of the component (A) is within the above range, a sufficient polishing rate can be obtained and in some cases, a composition for chemical mechanical polishing having excellent stability that does not cause precipitation or separation of particles can be obtained. Here, a specific surface area is measured by a BET method using, for example, a flow type specific surface area automatic measuring device (&#x201c;micrometrics FlowSorb II 2300&#x201d; commercially available from Shimadzu Corporation), and the average particle size of the component (A) can be calculated from the measured value.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0038">The component (A) is abrasive grains containing titanium oxide as a main component, but other components may be contained. Examples of other components include an aluminum compound and a silicon compound. When the component (A) further contains an aluminum compound or a silicon compound, since the surface hardness of the component (A) can be reduced, it is possible to further reduce the occurrence of polishing scratches and dishing on the polished surface in some cases while polishing a semiconductor substrate including a tungsten film or a silicon nitride film at a high speed.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0039">Examples of aluminum compounds include aluminum hydroxide, aluminum oxide (alumina), aluminum chloride, aluminum nitride, aluminum acetate, aluminum phosphate, aluminum sulfate, sodium aluminate, and potassium aluminate. On the other hand, examples of silicon compounds include silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, silicate, silicone, and silicon resins.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0040">The component (A) is preferably abrasive grains of which at least a portion of the surface is modified with a functional group. In a pH range of 1 or more and 6 or less, compared to abrasive grains of which the surface is not modified with a functional group, in abrasive grains of which at least a portion of the surface is modified with a functional group, the absolute value of the zeta potential is larger, and an electrostatic repulsion force between abrasive grains increases. As a result, the dispersibility of abrasive grains in the composition for chemical mechanical polishing is improved, and thus high-speed polishing can be performed while reducing the occurrence of polishing scratches and dishing.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0041">In addition, titanium oxide particles easily react with water, oxygen, nitrogen and the like and tend to deteriorate over time. However, when the component (A) is abrasive grains of which at least a portion of the surface is modified with a functional group, the functional group can reduce the reactivity with respect to water, oxygen, nitrogen, and the like on the surface of the abrasive grains, and minimize deterioration.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0042">Hereinafter, specific aspects of the component (A) will be described.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0043">1.1.1. First Aspect</p><p id="p-0052" num="0044">As a first aspect of the component (A), abrasive grains having a functional group represented by the following General Formula (1) and containing titanium oxide are exemplified.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>M<sup>+</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0054" num="0000">(M<sup>+</sup> represents a monovalent cation).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0045">In Formula (1), examples of monovalent cations represented by M<sup>+</sup> include H<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, but the present invention is not limited thereto. That is, in other words, the functional group represented by General Formula (1) may be &#x201c;at least one functional group selected from the group consisting of a sulfo group and salts thereof.&#x201d; Here, &#x201c;a salt of a sulfo group&#x201d; is a functional group in which a hydrogen ion contained in a sulfo group (&#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>H) is replaced with a monovalent cation such as Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. The component (A) according to the first aspect is abrasive grains having a surface to which the functional group represented by General Formula (1) is fixed via a covalent bond and containing titanium oxide, and does not include a component having a surface to which a compound having the functional group represented by General Formula (1) is physically or ionically adsorbed.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0046">The component (A) according to the first aspect can be manufactured, for example, by applying the method described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2010-269985. Specifically, when titanium oxide and a mercapto group-containing silane coupling agent are sufficiently stirred in an acidic medium, the mercapto group-containing silane coupling agent is covalently bonded to the surface of the abrasive grains containing titanium oxide. Here, examples of mercapto group-containing silane coupling agents include 3-mercaptopropylmethyldimethoxysilane and 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane. Next, an appropriate amount of hydrogen peroxide is additionally added and left for a sufficient time, and thus it is possible to obtain abrasive grains having the functional group represented by General Formula (1) and containing titanium oxide.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0047">The zeta potential of the component (A) according to the first aspect is a negative potential in the composition for chemical mechanical polishing, and the negative potential is preferably &#x2212;10 mV or lower, and more preferably &#x2212;20 mV or lower. When the zeta potential of the component (A) according to the first aspect is within the above range, an electrostatic repulsion force between abrasive grains can effectively prevent particles from aggregating and it is possible to selectively polish a substrate that has a positive charge during chemical mechanical polishing in some cases. Here, examples of zeta potential measuring devices include &#x201c;ELSZ-1&#x201d; (commercially available from Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd.) and &#x201c;Zetasizer nano zs&#x201d; (commercially available from Malvern). The zeta potential of the component (A) according to the first aspect can be adjusted by appropriately increasing or decreasing an amount of the above mercapto group-containing silane coupling agent or the like added.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0048">When the composition for chemical mechanical polishing according to the present embodiment contains the component (A) according to the first aspect, the lower limit value of the content of the component (A) according to the first aspect with respect to a total mass of 100 mass % of the composition for chemical mechanical polishing is preferably 0.1 mass %, and more preferably 0.5 mass %.
