First, some imaging procedures last for a non-trivial period of time, and movement during a portion of the procedure may negatively impact image quality. Specifically, patient motion may cause anatomical distortions or artifacts, which can be exaggerated during longer exposure times. Second, it is desirable to minimize a patient's total exposure to radiation during a procedure and, thus, subsequent imaging to obtain proper image quality is not ideal. Third, due to regulations in many jurisdictions, subsequent imaging used solely to correct image quality may be counted against a practitioner or organization, and frequent re-imaging may result in revocation of a license and/or accreditation. Fourth, poor quality images due to excess movement may require a patient to make subsequent visits to an imaging center, placing additional burden on the patient and the healthcare system itself, including the imaging center and payer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some novel embodiments described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview, and it is not intended to identify key/critical elements or to delineate the scope thereof. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Techniques for detecting and/or otherwise notifying a patient of detected motion and modifying the imaging protocol during breast imaging are described. As described above, preventing movement breast tissue, is important when performing radiation-based imaging of a patient for a variety of reasons including improving image quality, improving patient experience, reducing exposure and avoiding repeat imaging. For at least these reasons, there is a need for improved techniques, which may be automated or semi-automated, for detection of movement during an imaging procedure, for corrective actions during and after the procedure when movement has been detected, and for minimizing the amount of radiation exposure to patients in a workflow efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An imaging system as described herein may include an imaging detector to capture an image of human tissue, such as breast tissue, and a compression paddle situated apart from the imaging detector to compress the human tissue between the compression paddle and the imaging detector. One or more sensors may be included, in one embodiment a force sensor may generate a force signal indicating a measure of force applied to the human tissue. A movement detection circuit may filter a movement signal from the force signal indicating a measure of movement of the compressed human tissue. A movement analysis module may determine that the movement signal is beyond a movement threshold. An image correction module may perform a corrective action based upon the determination that the movement signal is beyond a movement threshold. Other embodiments are described and claimed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The force sensor described herein is typical to most modern mammography systems where breast compression force is incorporated. The force sensor helps to prevent excessive compression of the patient's breast which can cause pain and other undesirable effects. The embodiments as described and claimed relate to the output of the force sensor, representative of a force level, which may be filtered or converted by one or more circuits or modules described herein into a value that indicates movement. This movement signal, when compared to other measurements over time, may indicate movement of the patient undergoing an imaging procedure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition or in the alternative, other sensors may be used. For example, one or more ultrasound sensors, optical and/or infrared sensors may be used. In some examples, the sensors may be located either in a grid on the compression paddle. In other examples, the sensors may be located on the periphery of the paddle. The sensors may capture spatial data information from the compression of the breast. The special information may be used to create motion maps and/or contact maps. The motion map information can be used to create a correction map. The correction map information may be used as input to the image correction algorithm which corrects the tomosynthesis images. In the examples where a contact map is created based on the spatial information, the contact map can be used to create compression contours, which can be used as an input to the compression adequacy analysis and recommend a corrective action.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some software based techniques for detecting motion during an imaging procedure have been previously described. For example, one method of detecting patient motion includes detecting from a series of images displacement of an edge line such as the skin line of the breast, an implant edge, or some other internal edge. This skin line detection process is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,498,180, titled System and Method For Detecting Patient Motion During Tomosynthesis Scans, which is incorporated by reference herein (hereafter the '180 Patent).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, unlike software based and image artifact based motion detection, detection of motion based on hardware sensors gives an objective measure of patient motion to add to the assessment of motion. The independent, hardware based, detection using the information from one or more sensors allows for greater accuracy. In addition, because the mammography system already includes the force sensor, this method of patient motion is more cost effective than the alternative image based detection when force sensor detection is used. In addition, different types of motion may be detected and different compensation actions may be taken. For example, if motion with regular movement interval is detected, such as breathing or heartbeat, image capture may be synchronized with the motion.

An imaging system may include an imaging detector to capture an image of human tissue, such as breast tissue or other soft tissue, and a compression paddle situated apart from the imaging detector to compress the human tissue between the compression paddle and the imaging detector. In one embodiment, a force sensor may generate a force signal indicating a measure of force applied to the human tissue. A movement detection circuit may filter a movement signal from the force signal indicating a measure of movement of the compressed human tissue. A movement analysis module may determine that the movement signal is beyond a movement threshold. An image correction module to perform a corrective action based upon the determination that the movement signal is beyond a movement threshold. In another embodiment, other types of sensors may be used which may be disposed in a grid or around the periphery of the compression paddle.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, corrective actions may include actions to correct an image, generate an image while minimizing motion artifacts, generate an audio or visual indication that motion has been detected, and/or other actions described below in response to detection of motion during a procedure. By way of example and not limitation, corrective actions may include the determination and display of a movement score on a display device, display of an alert on a display device indicating that a movement threshold has been exceeded, triggering a visual indicator of the imaging system, terminating or modifying an imaging sequence or imaging protocol or image acquisition, delaying capture of the image of human tissue until the movement threshold is no longer exceeded, and/or synchronizing an image capture with repetitive movement. A movement score for all images taken by a particular technologist may be combined to create a positioning score for the technologist. The movement scores may be compared to other technologists in a facility or in other facilities. The technologist score may be compared to a threshold to determine compliance. A facility score may be compared to other facilities and compared to a threshold score to determine compliance. A report may be generated showing positioning scores for the technologist, the facility and compliance over time. A retrospective and prospective approach will allow the facility to identify the root-cause for why the positioning, noise, artifacts, compression etc. at the physician level could occur. A particular technician can be identified with this approach to understand his/her behavior to improve their ability to take their image. Other embodiments are described and claimed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With general reference to notations and nomenclature used herein, the detailed descriptions which follow may be presented in terms of program procedures executed on a computer or network of computers.

In some embodiments, the movement analysis module <b>28</b> may be present separate from force sensor <b>208</b>, and may be within, the optional force sensor incorporated into the imaging detector <b>214</b>, compression paddle <b>206</b> or within another portion of imaging system <b>200</b>, as illustrated. If a movement threshold has been exceeded, movement analysis module may communicate that determination to image correction module <b>220</b>, which may be configured to take corrective action, as described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an imaging system <b>200</b> according to an embodiment. Elements within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be similar to like-numbered elements from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The key difference between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is the illustration of movement of breast <b>310</b>. As illustrated, breast <b>310</b> may be moved while between compression paddle <b>306</b> and a surface of detector <b>314</b>. This movement may affect a force measurement <b>312</b> made by force sensor <b>308</b>. While a generally up and down movement is illustrated within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it can be appreciated that a variety of movements may be made by breast <b>310</b>. Movement may be due to a variety of factors, such as relating to cardiac or respiratory movements, sneezing, or voluntarily or involuntarily moving one or more portions of the body that affect the movement of breast <b>310</b>. As described below, movement of breast <b>310</b> may be of any number of types, and may be temporally evaluated by one or more modules of imaging system <b>300</b>. Evaluation of movement type and movement timing using techniques described herein may provide increased image quality and patient experience while reducing patient exposure to radiation.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As discussed above, patient motion during a breast imaging procedure can adversely affect imaging quality and therefore the diagnostic value of the resultant images. Detecting and/or measuring motion and correction, however, is difficult due at least in part to the fact that the breast is a non-rigid object. Accordingly, motion patterns of the breast during the imaging procedure may be complex in both time and space. For instance, some portions of the breast may move differently from other portions. As a result, image quality may change for different regions of a breast image. For a modality such as tomosynthesis, the motion or movement may occur between acquiring projections and/or during exposure of one or more of the projections.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Proper compression and positioning of the breast during the imaging procedure also affects image quality. Inadequate compression of the breast may increase the likelihood of unwanted results. For example, inadequate compression may increase the likelihood of motion, which reduces image quality. As another example, inadequate compression may increase the likelihood of overlapping tissue which may make it more difficult to detect cancerous lesions in a resultant image. Thus, there is a need to more accurately detect motion and compression in space and time, which can prove to be useful input data to help correct and enhance image quality during breast imaging procedures.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> illustrates another embodiment of an imaging system <b>400</b> where one or more sensors, in combination or alternatively to the force sensor <b>208</b>, are used. Elements within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> may be similar to like-numbered elements from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Imaging system <b>1400</b> illustrates exemplary components most relevant to the techniques described herein and may include other components not depicted with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. The imaging system <b>1400</b> includes a compression paddle <b>1406</b> and a detector <b>1414</b> disposed a distance away from and parallel to the compression paddle. A breast is compressed between the compression paddle <b>1406</b> and the detector <b>1414</b>. While referred to herein as the detector <b>1414</b>, the detector <b>1414</b> may be considered the housing surrounding the detector, such as a breast platform. Accordingly, in some examples, discussion of the detector <b>1414</b> may be synonymous with discussion of the breast platform or the structure housing or surrounding the actual electronics that detect x-ray beams passing through the breast.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">One or more sensors <b>1408</b> are disposed on or within the compression paddle <b>1406</b> and the detector <b>1414</b>. The one or more sensors <b>1408</b> may comprise or communicate with a sensor module which may detect motion of the breast and may also be used to detect or analyze compression and positioning of the breast. In one example, the sensors <b>1408</b> may include one or more photo sensors, infrared sensors and/or ultrasound or ultrasonic sensors. The motion detected by the sensors <b>1408</b> may be based on reflected sonic signals and/or reflected light signals depending on the types of sensors <b>1408</b> implemented. For example, the photo sensors may include cameras to capture optical images of the breast when it is in a compressed and/or uncompressed state. Similarly, the infrared sensors may be utilized to produce a three-dimensional image or depth map of the breast that may be used to determine the three-dimensional location of exterior of the breast at different points in time. The ultrasound or ultrasonic sensors may also be used to detect the three-dimensional location of the exterior of the breast. In some examples, the ultrasound or ultrasonic sensors may also be utilized to image the interior of the breast. With the interior of the breast imaged, landmarks within the breast may be identified and the locations of those landmarks may be tracked in three-dimensional space at different points in time.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the sensors <b>1408</b> may be placed in a grid pattern on or within the compression paddle <b>1406</b> and the detector <b>1414</b>. In other examples, the sensors <b>1408</b> may be disposed around the periphery of the compression paddle <b>1406</b> and the detector <b>1414</b>. The location and pattern of the sensors may be based on the types of sensor and the physical properties of the compression paddle <b>1406</b> and/or the detector <b>1414</b>. For example, if the compression paddle <b>1406</b> is optically opaque, the photo sensors may be placed in a position where they have a line of sight to the exterior of the breast that is not blocked by the compression paddle <b>1406</b>. Similarly, for some ultrasound or ultrasonic sensors, an air gap between the sensor and the breast may be undesirable. As such, the ultrasonic sensors may be placed in location where there is no air gap between the ultrasonic sensor and the breast. Other solid surfaces, such as a portion of the compression paddle <b>1406</b> and/or detector <b>1414</b> may still be located between the ultrasonic sensor and the compressed breast.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">By disposing multiple sensors in a pattern, a more detailed understanding of motion of the breast may be obtained. It is appreciated that movement of the breast may not be uniform. For example, some areas of the breast may move more than others. Use of multiple sensors allows the imaging system <b>1400</b> to create a motion map that may be capable of visually showing the location of movement throughout the surface of the breast. In other examples, the motion map may not be a visual representation but rather a set of data indicating the locations of the breast that moved as well as the magnitude and direction of the breast movement at each location. For instance, the motion map may be a set of motion vectors for different positions in three-dimensional space. By having a more complete understanding of the location of motion of the breast, the imaging system can determine whether the motion may have had a negative effect on the image obtained. In addition, having additional sensors allows the imaging system to obtain other information such as the amount of contact with the breast, as further discussed below, to determine breast positioning and compression information.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The sensors <b>1408</b> that may be incorporated into the imaging detector <b>1414</b> and/or the compression paddle <b>1406</b> may include an analog filter, gain circuits for signal conditioning, and/or an analog-to-digital converter for signal capture. The output of sensors <b>1408</b> may be electrical signals representative of motion and/or spatial data representative of location of the breast, which may be filtered or converted by one or more circuits or modules described herein into a plurality of spatial information or data <b>1416</b>. The spatial information may be combined to create a motion map <b>1418</b><i>a. </i>The motion map <b>1418</b><i>a </i>takes spatial information from each of the sensors <b>1408</b> to create a relative representation of motion. The motion map <b>1408</b><i>a </i>may describe some areas of the breast that include more motion than others. The motion map <b>1408</b><i>a </i>may be a visual representation of the spatial information having some colors (e.g. red) represent higher amount of motion and other colors represent moderate (e.g. yellow) or low (e.g. green) amount of motion. The relative representation of motion may be determined based on spatial information comparison to a threshold or a look up table representing various levels of motion. In other examples, the motion map <b>1418</b><i>a </i>may not include a visual representation but rather a set of data indicating the locations of the breast that moved as well as the magnitude and direction of the breast movement at each location. For instance, the motion map <b>1418</b><i>a </i>may be a set of motion vectors for different positions in three-dimensional space.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, the motion map <b>1408</b><i>a </i>may be created for each of the tomosynthesis projections or slices created. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> shows two tomosynthesis projections. One projection has a larger degree of motion and another projection showing smaller degree of motion. It is appreciated that any number of motion maps <b>1408</b><i>a </i>may be created based on the number of projections. As an example, spatial data representative of the breast may be captured by the sensors <b>1408</b> during different times during the imaging procedure. For instance, the spatial data may be captured at substantially the same time as when a projection is captured. The spatial data may also be captured by the sensors <b>1408</b> continuously or substantially continuously. Accordingly, a change in position or location of the breast (or a portion thereof) between the capture of the projections may be determined. Such a change in position or location may be indicative of motion of the breast (or a portion thereof). Based on the magnitude of the motion, particular projections may be discarded when generating a tomosynthesis reconstruction of the breast. In other examples, the projections may be corrected prior to or during generation of the tomosynthesis reconstruction of the breast.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The information or data from the motion map <b>1418</b><i>a </i>may be provided as input into an image correction module or algorithm <b>1420</b><i>a. </i>In some examples, the motion map <b>1418</b><i>a </i>may be utilized to generate a correction map. That correction map may effectively be an inverse of the motion map <b>1418</b><i>a. </i>For instance, the correction map may indicate how pixels in the image should be adjusted based on the detected motion. The image correction module or algorithm <b>1420</b><i>a </i>may be similar to the image correction modules <b>116</b> and <b>220</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b></figref>, and <b>3</b>, and may perform the functions and correction as further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. The image correction algorithm <b>1420</b><i>a </i>may then output corrected images <b>1420</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The spatial information <b>1416</b> may also be used to create a contact map <b>1418</b><i>b. </i>An example of a contact map <b>1418</b><i>b </i>is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>. It is appreciated by inventors that the entirety of the breast <b>1410</b> is not in contact with the compression paddle <b>1406</b> and the detector <b>1414</b> when the breast is compressed. For example, when the breast is compressed between the paddle <b>1406</b> and the detector <b>1414</b>, a portion of breast near the periphery of the breast is not in contact with either the paddle <b>1406</b> or the detector <b>1414</b>. There may be a line <b>1432</b>, referred to as the &#x201c;uncompressed tissue line&#x201d; or the &#x201c;paddle contact line&#x201d; in an image, which defines a contour of contact points of breast with paddle/detector. The contact map <b>1418</b><i>b </i>may also display the breast profile or skin line <b>1430</b> of the image of the breast. The location of uncompressed tissue line <b>1432</b> with respect to breast profile or skin line <b>1430</b> may also be used to give a metric of the adequacy of the compression and/or positioning of the compressed breast. For example, the larger the area of uncompressed tissue, the less adequate the compression. It is further appreciated by the inventors that a less than adequate level of compression may result in poor image quality.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The contact map <b>1418</b><i>b </i>shows or indicates the level of contact with the breast. The contact map <b>1418</b><i>b </i>can be used to determine or define a roll-off region <b>1434</b>, which is the region where the breast is uncompressed. The roll-off region <b>1434</b> may be the area between the uncompressed tissue line <b>1432</b> and the skin line <b>1430</b> of the breast. The size of the roll-off region <b>1434</b> may be represented by the area between the uncompressed tissue line <b>1432</b> and the skin line <b>1430</b>. The size of the roll-off region <b>1434</b> may also be represented by a distance between the uncompressed tissue line <b>1432</b> and the skin line <b>1430</b>. The distance may be the maximum, minimum, and/or average distance between the uncompressed tissue line <b>1432</b> and the skin line <b>1430</b>. The location of the uncompressed tissue line <b>1342</b> and the size of the roll off region <b>1434</b> may also be useful in special image processing techniques in uncompressed versus compressed breast areas. The location of uncompressed tissue line <b>1432</b> with respect to breast profile <b>1430</b> may also be used to give an idea of how adequate the compression is, which may also be used in determining the adequacy of positioning of the breast.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Additional positioning information of the breast may also be determined from the data produced by the sensors <b>1408</b>. For example, in a mediolateral oblique (MLO) compression, the sensors may be used to determine whether the pectoral muscle is properly positioned such that it will be imaged during the imaging procedure. The spatial data produced by the sensors <b>1408</b> may also be used to assess the alignment of the nipple, such as by determining the posterior nipple line (PNL). Other positioning criteria may also be determined from the spatial data produced by the sensors <b>1408</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, the information from the contact map <b>1418</b><i>b </i>and/or the other positioning information may be input in a compression adequacy analysis module or algorithm <b>1420</b><i>b. </i>The compression adequacy analysis module <b>1420</b><i>b </i>may be similar to the image correction modules <b>116</b> and <b>220</b>, with the difference of that a threshold of compression is used, rather than a motion threshold, to compare the current compression contours to the threshold of compression contours. The compression adequacy analysis module <b>1420</b><i>b </i>may perform at least some of the functions and corrections as further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>15</b>A</figref>-C. As an example, the compression adequacy analysis may include comparing the area for the roll-off region to a threshold for the area of the roll-off region. For example, if current compression contours are below a threshold for the compression contours, image capture may be delayed until contours are above the threshold, or image capture may be cancelled if the delay exceeds a threshold. In at least one example, one or more alerts or alarms as discussed above may be generated to notify the technologist that compression is inadequate and the patient may need to be repositioned. Accordingly, determinations regarding whether compression and/or positioning of the breast are proper may be made prior to the patient being exposed to a dose of x-ray radiation.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Included herein is a set of flow charts representative of exemplary methodologies for performing novel aspects of the disclosed architecture. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the one or more methodologies shown herein, for example, in the form of a flow chart or flow diagram, are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance therewith, occur in a different order and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all acts illustrated in a methodology may be required for a novel implementation.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-C</figref> illustrate a logic flow <b>1500</b> according to an embodiment. The logic flow <b>1500</b> may be representative of some the operations executed by one or more embodiments described herein, such as imaging system <b>100</b>, for example. At operation <b>1502</b>, a first set of spatial data of the breast is generated at a first time point based on data captured by the sensors that may be incorporated into at least one of the breast compression paddle and/or the imaging detector. At operation <b>1504</b>, a second set of spatial data of the breast is generated at a second time point based on data captured by the sensors. The spatial data of the breast at each time point may be representative of the location of the breast at the respective time point. The spatial data may be three-dimensional data about the exterior and/or interior of the breast. The time points may also coincide with the acquisitions of projections in tomosynthesis imaging procedure as well as time points prior to any x-ray exposures during the imaging procedure. For example, the first time point may be after compression but prior to the first exposure. The second time point may coincide with the first projection. While only two time points are depicted in logic flow <b>1500</b>, it should be appreciated that additional spatial data may be captured or generated at additional time points. For example, spatial data may be generated at a third time point coinciding with the capture of a second projection. The spatial data may also be continuously or substantially continuously generated and captured during the imaging procedure.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">At operation <b>1506</b>, motion data may be generated based on the first set of spatial data and the second set of spatial data. For example, by comparing the first spatial data to the second spatial data, a difference in location of the breast or portions of the breast may be determined. That change in location corresponds to motion. The generated motion data may indicate an amount of motion that occurred for the breast or a portion of the breast. Generating motion data may also include generating a motion map at operation <b>1508</b>. The motion map, for example, may be a visual representation of the spatial information having some colors represent higher amount of motion and other colors represent moderate or low amount of motion. At operation <b>1510</b>, a correction map may be generated from or based on the motion map. That correction map may effectively be an inverse of the motion map. For instance, the correction map may indicate how pixels in the image should be adjusted based on the detected motion.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The motion data generated in operation <b>1506</b> may also be utilized for motion correction or tomosynthesis reconstruction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>. At operation <b>1518</b>, the motion data may be provided as an input into a motion correction algorithm. For example, the motion map and/or the correction map may be provided to the motion correction algorithm. The motion correction algorithm then corrects at least one medical image based on the input of the motion data to generate one or more corrected medical images in operation <b>1520</b>. For example, if the second spatial data is generated for a time point that coincides with the capture of a medical image, the motion data may be used to correct that medical image. Accordingly, the image correction algorithm may correct a medical image acquired at substantially the second time point. Using a tomosynthesis procedure as an example, the first spatial data and a first projection may be captured at the first time point and the second spatial data and a second projection may be captured at the second time point. The motion data may then be used to correct the second projection prior to the projections being used to generate a tomosynthesis reconstruction at operation <b>1528</b>. While only two projections are discussed in the example, it should be understood that such corrections may be applied to any of number of projections captured during a tomosynthesis imaging procedure.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The motion data for each of the projections or medical images may also be compared to a predetermined motion threshold at operation <b>1522</b>. For example, an amount of motion that occurred between a first projection and a second projection may be compared to a motion threshold. If the amount of motion that occurred between the projections is greater than a threshold, the projection or medical image may be discarded at operation <b>1526</b>. For example, the second projection may be discarded if the amount of motion that occurred between the first and second projection is greater than the predetermined motion threshold. The thresholds described herein may be dynamic or predetermined. For example, the thresholds may be dynamically determined by an imaging system during the image capture process based, at least in part, on a detected image quality assessment taken in near real-time. In other embodiments, a movement threshold may be predetermined and stored within an imaging system. The predetermined thresholds discussed herein may be a setting or a value that is stored or accessed by the medical imaging system or a portion thereof. For instance, the predetermined thresholds may be set by a medical professional, be provided with the imaging system, or accessed from a remote source. The thresholds may be based on values, percentages, ratios, or other types of thresholds.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">If, however, the motion amount is not greater than the predetermined threshold, the projection or image is retained at operation <b>1524</b>. The images or projections that are retained may then be used to generate a tomosynthesis reconstruction in operation <b>1528</b>. In some examples, images that are discarded in operation <b>1526</b> may be regenerated through a synthesis or interpolation of other acquired projections. Those synthesized projections may then be used in generating the tomosynthesis reconstruction in operation <b>1528</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, the spatial data captured in operation <b>1502</b> and/or operation <b>1504</b> may also be utilized to generate compression and position data in operation <b>1512</b>. For example, the first spatial data captured in operation <b>1502</b> may be captured when the breast is compressed but prior to an x-ray exposure having occurred. Compression and/or position data may be generated for the breast that corresponds to that time of compression at operation <b>1512</b>. Generating compression data may include generating a contact map for the compressed breast in operation <b>1514</b>. Generation of the contract map may also include determining or generating values representative of the roll-off region. For example, a value for the area of the roll-off region or a distance representative of the roll-off region may be determined. The value for the roll-off region may be at least one of an area of the roll-off region, a maximum distance between the uncompressed breast line and the skin line, a minimum distance between the uncompressed breast line and the skin line, or a ratio between the area of the roll-off region and an area of the breast in contact with the at least one of the breast compression paddle or the imaging detector, among other possible values. Generating position information may include generating positional values for the breast at operation <b>1516</b>. The positional values may include values for positioning metrics, such as a value for the posterior nipple line (PNL) or another value relating to the position of the pectoral muscle. Values for other positioning metrics may also be generated from the spatial data.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>C</figref>, at operation <b>1530</b>, the compression and/or position data generated in operations <b>1512</b>-<b>1516</b> may be compared to one or more threshold values. For example, with respect to compression, a value for the roll-off region of the breast may be compared to a predetermined threshold for that value. As an example relating to positioning data, a value for the PNL may be compared to a predetermined threshold value for the PNL. If the compression values and/or the positioning values do not exceed the thresholds (or are otherwise within a tolerance threshold), then imaging continues and the medical images, such as mammography or tomography images are acquired at operation <b>1532</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">If the compression values and/or the positioning values do exceed the thresholds (or are outside of the tolerance thresholds), then a notification or alert may be generated in operation <b>1534</b>. The notification may be a visual notification, such as a notification displayed on a screen or indicated by illumination of a light. The notification may also be an audible notification played through a speaker or other sound-making device. The notification may indicate that the compression is inadequate or improper and/or that the breast in improperly positioned. The notification may further indicate a reason as to why the compression was inadequate, such as too large of a roll-off area, and/or why the breast was improperly positioned, such as an improper PNL value. In addition, the notification may provide guidance to the medical professional or technician as to how the breast should be repositioned. At operation <b>1536</b>, the breast may be repositioned or recompressed. Once the breast is repositioned or recompressed, the imaging procedure continues and medical images are acquired at operation <b>1532</b>. In some examples, upon repositioning and/or recompressing the breast at operation <b>1536</b>, method <b>1500</b> flows back to the start where spatial data is recaptured at operation <b>1502</b>.

The determination, in some embodiments, may include an indication that movement has been detected, a movement value, a timestamp, a frame identifier, or other information that may be necessary for an image correction module to take appropriate corrective measures based upon the detected movement.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">At <b>504</b>, the image correction module may determine a type of movement based upon one or more received movement determinations. For example, a movement may be categorized as a regular movement when it is repetitive and generally within a regular time interval. This type of movement may indicate a patient is breathing, or moving in a regular fashion. In another example, movement may be categorized as irregular. A single irregular movement may indicate a patient has shifted positions, or sneezed, for example. In yet another example, movement may be categorized as continuously irregular. A determination of movement type may be based, in part, on a movement value and/or timestamp, for example. In at least one example, a determination of the movement may be that the movement is localized to one or more tomosynthesis slices.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">At <b>506</b>, when a regular movement that is repetitive and generally within a regular time interval is detected, the image correction module may configure the image capture to the synchronized with the regular movement. In this manner, image capture may he performed during a time period in which movement is not detected, and skipped during a time period in which movement is detected. The synchronized image sequence may be generated at <b>512</b>, and may include only images in which movement has not been detected, or detected movement is below a threshold amount.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">At <b>508</b>, when irregular movement is detected, the image correction module may delay image capture for a period of time, allowing the movement to stop so an image is not negatively impacted. As described herein, some embodiments may flag image captured images taken during a movement, and those images may be removed from an imaging sequence used to generate an image.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">At <b>510</b>, if a termination of movement is localized to one or more tomosynthesis slices. The slices may be removed or cancelled from the tomosynthesis stack that are associated with movement above a threshold.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">At <b>514</b>, if irregular movements continue during the delay period, the delay may be extended until movement stops. However, since in some cases the patient may be exposed to x-ray radiation during the delay, a time period threshold may be set for which the image capture may be canceled if the delay lasts beyond the threshold. Thus, an image may be generated at <b>512</b> if the delay is within the time threshold, and the image capture may be canceled at <b>516</b> if the delay period extends beyond the time threshold. In this manner, an imaging system may be able to compensate for some movement, and generate higher quality images by delaying capture until movement is no longer detected, while at the same time canceling an image and limiting patient radiation exposure when a satisfactory image cannot be obtained due to excessive irregular movement.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">During image generation at <b>512</b>, certain embodiments may correlate images with detected movement and flag images in which movement was detected. In this manner, images flagged with movement may be removed from a resulting imaging sequence, thus, improving overall image quality despite detecting motion within the imaging procedure. In some cases, many images may be flagged as occurring during movement and the entire imaging sequence may need to be canceled. Based upon a particular procedure, for example, a threshold may be set such that an image correction module may determine whether the process of deleting images may result in a usable image sequence, or if the imaging sequence needs to be canceled due to excessive movement during the imaging procedure.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a logic flow <b>600</b> according to an embodiment. The logic flow <b>600</b> may be representative of some or all of the operations executed by one or more embodiments described herein, such as imaging systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, and/or <b>300</b>, for example. At <b>602</b>, a force sensor may generate a force signal indicating a measure of force applied to human tissue being compressed between a compression paddle and an imaging detector to capture an image of the human tissue. As set forth above, a force sensor may include a strain gauge, piezoelectric sensor, load cell, or other sensor capable of measuring the force applied to human tissue compressed between a compression paddle and an opposite detector plane. In some embodiments, a force sensor may include an analog filter, gain circuits for signal conditioning, and/or an analog-to-digital converter for signal capture. The output of a force sensor may be an electrical signal representative of a force level, which may be filtered or converted by one or more circuits or modules described herein into a value that indicates movement. This movement signal, when compared to other measurements over time, may indicate movement of the patient undergoing an imaging procedure.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">At <b>604</b>, a movement detection circuit may filter the received force signal and isolate a movement signal from therein. The movement signal may indicate a level of force, and in some cases may indicate that a patient has moved during image capture in a manner that is detrimental to the quality of a resulting image. As set forth above, the movement detection circuit may be configured to receive an electronic force signal from a force sensor and filter a movement signal from the received force signal. In some embodiments, the received force signal may include a low frequency compression force signal (e.g., 0 (DC) to &#x3c;5 Hz), winch may be tapped and processed in parallel using the movement detection circuit. Further, the movement detection circuit may include one or more components to process the force signal, including a DC signal block, such as a blocking capacitor to remove the DC and low frequency components of the force signal, leaving a higher frequency (AC) component, referred to herein as a movement signal. One or more analog circuits may filter and apply gain to the higher frequency (AC) signal components to improve signal-to-noise ratio, if needed. The resulting movement signal may include motion artifacts from the original force signal.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">At <b>606</b>, a movement analysis module may determine whether a detected movement is beyond a movement threshold. The movement analysis module may include one or more analog circuits, such as a tuned differentiator, to detect movement of human tissue compressed within an imaging system using a received movement signal from the movement detection circuit. In some embodiments, the movement analysis module may include hardware and/or software modules configured to accept the movement signal from the movement detection circuit, and detect tissue movement caused by the patient. An exemplary logic flow illustrating movement detection by a movement analysis module is set forth within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. By way of example and not limitation, movement may be caused by respiratory activity, cardiac activity, or muscular movements (voluntary or involuntary) by the patient. A movement analysis module may be configured with a movement threshold value, beyond which, movement of the patient is detected and communicated to an image correction module at <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">At <b>608</b>, when movement is beyond a threshold, an image correction module may perform a corrective action, which may include one or more of a variety of actions that improve image quality and reduce patient exposure to radiation. An image correction module may be configured to receive a determination from movement analysis module that movement has been detected. The determination may include data indicating a movement time and movement level in some embodiments, and the determination may be used to determine a corrective action to be taken, some of which are described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>. Techniques described herein strive to improve image quality, even in situations where movement is detected, reduce patient radiation exposure when possible, and reduce the time required for patients to undergo imaging procedures. While exemplary corrective actions are described herein, other corrective action may be taken consistent with these goals, in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrated a generated image <b>700</b> according to an embodiment. Generated image <b>700</b> may be generated by one or more imaging systems described herein, for example, imaging systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, and/or <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, corrective actions may include visual indications within a graphical user interface of a display during or after an imaging procedure, using an indicator of an imaging system, and/or using a graphical indication on a generated image itself. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an alert <b>702</b>, which may be displayed on a display of an imaging system, indicating to a practitioner or patient that movement was detected during the imaging procedure. Such an indication may alert those viewing the image that quality issues may be fixed by reducing motion in subsequent imaging procedures.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> illustrates a generated image <b>800</b> according to an embodiment. Generated image <b>700</b> may be generated by one or more imaging systems described herein, for example, imaging systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, and/or <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, corrective actions may include visual indications within a graphical user interface of a display during or after an imaging procedure, using an indicator of an imaging system, and/or using a graphical indication on a generated image itself. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> illustrates an alert <b>802</b> indicating a motion score, which may indicate a score on a relative scale of motion detected during an imaging procedure. In an example, a minimum and maximum level of movement may be stored within a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of an imaging system. Once movement has been detected, an image correction module may perform a calculation of the detected movement and determine a score based upon the stored minimum and maximum values, in this manner, a practitioner or patient may be provided with an indication of how much movement was detected, and may take steps to improve image quality in subsequent imaging procedures. In another example, the score may be pass/fail score, with pass meaning that the motion is below the threshold and no corrective action is needed, and fail meaning that corrective action is needed. Other scoring methodologies are contemplated. In one embodiment, the positioning information from many images can be aggregated into analytics and supplied to the facility and other entities for the purposes of training, education, analytics and compliance.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows the positioning information collected and analyzed according to one embodiment. Each image may be associated with a radiology technologist or technologist who took the image (e.g. a technologist identification number) and associated with a patient positioning score for that image as described above. The information may be stored in the imaging system <b>100</b>. The information may then be transmitted to a centralized computer system <b>1000</b>, such as the system <b>1000</b> described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The centralized computer system <b>1000</b> may part of a cloud-computing system. The scores, the technologist IDs, and other information collected from the imaging system <b>100</b> may be aggregated over time. The scores for a particular technologist or a particular facility may be analyzed, for example, by the centralized system <b>1000</b>, to determine if one or more corrective actions are needed. In one example, a particular technologist's average score is compared to average scores of others or other technologists in that particular facility, or in other facilities. In another example, a particular facility's average score may be compared to the average score of other facilities. If the centralized system determined that the technologist's or facility's scores are below a particular threshold, the technologist or members of the facility may be recommended for patient positioning education or quality control improvements. In one example, a look-up table or algorithm determines whether corrective action is needed and what type of action to recommend based in part on the score.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Additional examples of use of the positioning information may include compliance with Federal Regulations, such as the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) and the Enhancing Quality Using the Inspection Program or EQUIP initiative. The MQSA requires that the images taken at a facility must comply with certain quality standards. Poor positioning is a factor in most deficiencies and failures of clinical images to meet quality standards. EQUIP requires regular review of images, corrective procedures when clinical images are of poor quality, including a mechanism for providing ongoing feedback to technologists or other designated personnel, and oversight of quality control records. The analytics described above can be used to generate reports of compliance with federal regulations. For example, the report may be automatically generated on a periodic basis that includes information such as the score information for that facility, the number of times corrective procedures were taken, the number of times that corrective measures such as education and quality control measures were recommended and were taken. Such reports can be stored and provided if needed to federal regulators to ensure compliance. Complying with EQUIP, however, requires only annual self-reporting from facilities, which has generally resulted in only a yearly review of imaging quality by facilities. Such a lag in reporting may cause downward trends to go unnoticed and potentially poor imaging procedures to occur. In addition, the metrics may be stored in various formats across a plurality of devices and imaging systems, making it even more difficult for the metrics to be monitored. The present technology resolves these problems among others by being able to continuously aggregate quality metrics across a plurality of facilities and provide access and additional insights to those quality metrics in substantially real time as the quality metrics are aggregated. The quality metrics may also be provided to the central computing system in a standardized format via the web application to help ensure that the same types of metrics are properly aggregated and correlated together. Further, due in part to the real time tracking of metrics, warnings and trainings may be provided based on downward trends in image quality before poor imaging procedures may be implemented by technicians of a facility. Such warnings and trainings may provide for an overall improved imaging process for facilities and lead to better detection of abnormalities such as cancers.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> illustrates a logic flow <b>814</b> according to an embodiment. The logic flow <b>814</b> may be representative of some or all of the operations executed by one or more embodiments described herein, such as systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, and/or <b>1000</b>, for example. In step <b>804</b> information, including one or more scores, is received from one or more technologists at a first facility. Positioning information, including one or more scores, is received from one or more technologists at a second facility. In step <b>806</b>, the information may be analyzed and a report is generated. The report may be provided to the facility for which is it associated. In step <b>810</b>, the information may be compared. In one example, the scores may be compared within the facility, for instance, to score the technologists relative to each other. In another example, the scores may be compared to scores at other facilities. In step <b>812</b>, the scores may be compared to a threshold to determine if the particular technologist is above or below the threshold. If above, the technologist is adequately performing positioning patient positioning. If below the threshold, the technologist may require corrective action, for example, education or quality control (QC) corrective actions. In addition, the scores for all the technologists in a particular facility may be compared to a threshold. If the scores for the facility are above the threshold, a report is generated of compliance to federal regulations. If the scores for the facility are below the threshold, QC for the facility are recommended. The thresholds may be those types of predetermined threshold discussed herein. A report is generated with non-compliance and recommendations for QC.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> illustrates a logic flow or method <b>816</b> for processing medical images at a medical facility. The method <b>816</b> may be performed by a facility, such as Facility A or B depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. At operation <b>818</b>, medical images of a patient are acquired. For example, the medical images may be acquired by one or more imaging systems <b>100</b> located at the particular facility. The medical images that are acquired may include additional identification information stored with the image, such the identity of the technician that performed the imaging procedure and the identity of the facility that performed the procedure. Such additional identification information may be stored as metadata for the respective medical image, in the header of the medical image, or otherwise stored with the respective medical image such that the additional information is associated with the respective medical image. The identification information may include the name of the patient, an additional patient identifier, the date of examination, the view and laterality of the image, the facility name or identifier and location (e.g., city, state, and zip code of the facility), a technologist identification, a cassette/screen identification, and a mammography unit identification (if there is more than one unit in the facility).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">At operation <b>820</b>, a random sampling of the acquired medical images is taken. The random sampling of images helps reduce potential bias in facilities or technicians selecting images that they believe to be of better quality to artificially inflate their scores or metrics. The random sampling of images may be of images may be for all medical images acquired or of medical images that were actually reviewed by radiologists or other medical professionals. The random sampling may be performed automatically through an interface or software provided by the central computing system to the facility, such as through a web application provided by the central computing system. Random sampling can also be done in real-time (through an algorithm) picking every 3 or 4 or 5 patients, based on the prior volumes/seasonality calculations.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">At operation <b>822</b>, quality metrics are then generated from and/or for the randomly sampled images. The metrics may be automatically generated through patient positioning and/or motion detection algorithms, such as the ones discussed herein and in International Publication No. WO2018/170265, titled &#x201c;Techniques For Patient Positioning Quality Assurance Prior to Mammographic Image Acquisition,&#x201d; which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The metrics may also be generated by an interpreting physician (IP). For instance, the interpreting physician may review the medical images that have been randomly selected and provide metrics for those medical images. The metrics from the IP may be input into a web application, interface, or other software provided by the central computing system. The metrics that are provided may include positioning metrics, compression metrics, exposure level metrics, contrast metrics, sharpness metrics, noise metrics, and/or artifact metrics, among other metrics. Each metric may also include additional sub-metrics or scores. For example, the positioning metrics may also include sub-metrics such as nipple location, nipple angle, pectoral muscle coverage, inframammary fold visibility, pectoral-nipple line distance, and symmetry between image views. The positioning metrics generally relate to whether sufficient breast tissue is imaged to ensure that cancers or anomalies are not likely to be missed because of inadequate positioning. The compression metrics generally relate to whether compression has been applied in a manner that minimizes the potential obscuring effect of overlying breast tissue and motion artifacts. The exposure level metrics generally relate to whether the exposure level was adequate to visualize breast structures and whether the images were underexposed or overexposed. The contrast metrics generally relate to where the image contrast permitted differentiation of subtle tissue density differences. The sharpness metrics generally relate to whether the margins of normal breast structures were distinct and not blurred. The noise metrics generally relate to whether noise in the image obscured breast structures or suggested the appearance of structures not actually present. The artifacts metrics generally relate to whether artifacts due to lint, processing, scratches, and other factors external to the breast obscured breast structures or suggest the appearance of structures not actually present. The quality metrics may further include metrics or scores based on motion or movement that occurred during imaging the patient. Such motion or movement metrics may be generated using the sensors and techniques discussed herein. The metrics generated at operation <b>822</b> may be stored with the medical image(s) for which the metrics were generated.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">At operation <b>824</b> a lead interpreting physician (LIP) may generate additional metrics for the medical images for which the metrics were generated in operation <b>822</b>. The LIP may generate metrics for all of those images or a subset of those images. The subset of the images may be a randomized subset of images. The LIP may in some cases modify or confirm the metrics generated in operation <b>822</b>. In other examples, the LIP may generate additional metrics for the medical images. Any metrics generated by the LIP may also be stored with the medical images. At operation <b>826</b>, the metrics for medical images are sent from the facility to the central computing system. The medical images may also be sent with the metrics in some examples. In other examples the metrics and at least a portion of the identification information may be sent as correlated to one another, such as in the same report or otherwise linked in an exported database.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>E and <b>8</b>F</figref> depict a logic flow or method <b>828</b> for processing medical image metrics at a central computing system. For example, the method <b>828</b> may be performed by the central computing system to aggregate and process quality metrics from a plurality of facilities. At operation <b>830</b>, a first set of quality metrics for a plurality of medical images are received from a first imaging facility, such as Facility A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. The quality metrics received may also include the identification information for the medical images for which the received quality metrics correspond. In some examples, the medical images themselves may also be received. At operation <b>832</b>, a second set of quality metrics for a plurality of medical images are received from a second imaging facility, such as Facility B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. The quality metrics received may also include the identification information for the medical images for which the received quality metrics correspond. In some examples, the medical images themselves may also be received. While not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>, method <b>828</b> may also include receiving additional quality metrics from additional facilities. In addition, the quality metrics received from the first facility and the second facility may be ongoing. For example, the first facility and the second facility may send quality metrics at regular intervals, such as monthly or quarterly. When the quality metrics are received by the central computing system, the central computing system may continue to store the metrics to track trends from different facilities. In some examples, the metrics are received through a web application provided to the facilities by the central computing system. For instance, the IP and LIP may directly enter the metrics into the web application, which causes the receipt of the metrics by the central computing system. The identification information may also be provided in the web application and/or the web application or the central computing system may extract the identification information from the medical images</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">At operation <b>834</b>, the first set of quality metrics are compared to the second set of quality metrics. For example, once the first and second sets of quality metrics are received, the central computing system may cause the two sets of metrics to be compared to one another. In other examples where additional metrics are received from additional facilities, those metrics may also be compared to one another. In some examples, individual metrics from the first set may be compared to the corresponding individual metric of the other set. For instance, positioning metrics for the first facility may be compared to positioning metrics of the second facility. At operation <b>836</b>, based on the comparison of the first set of quality metrics to the second set of quality metrics, a benchmark is set for at least one metric in the first set of quality metrics and the second set of quality metrics. The benchmark may be standard or point of reference against which the quality metrics may be assessed. For example, based on the comparison of the aggregated quality metrics from the plurality of facilities, the average patient positioning score may be determined. That average patient positioning score may then be used as a benchmark for an individual facility to determine how it is performing as compared to that benchmark. Benchmarks other than average scores may also be determined including benchmarks based on different statistical analyses such as percentiles. Benchmarks may also be set by government entities, such as the FDA. The benchmarks may also be based on the type of facility. For example, benchmarks may be created for facilities that are similarly situated based on factors such as location, number of technicians, number of medical images acquired, number of imaging systems on site, number of interpreting physicians, or other characteristics of the facilities. Accordingly, facilities may be able to compare their own quality metrics against benchmarks that are derived from the like facilities.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">At operation <b>838</b>, a dashboard may be provided by the central computing system one or more of the facilities from which quality metrics are received. The dashboard may be provided to the facility through the web application. Facility data for a facility or a particular technologist may be generated based on the generated benchmark in operation <b>836</b> and the first set of quality metrics and/or the second set of quality metrics. The facility data may include the quality metrics from one or more facilities compared to the benchmark(s) generated in operation <b>836</b>. The facility data may be presented in the dashboard. For instance, the facility data and/or quality metrics for the facility accessing the dashboard may be viewed through the dashboard. For example, an LIP or other member of the facility may access the dashboard to see how the facility's quality metrics compare to the benchmark quality metrics and/or the quality metrics of other facilities. The quality metrics may be searched or refined as well through the dashboard. The LIP may refine the quality metrics based on a period of time or for a certain technician or technicians. For instance, if the LIP wanted to see how a particular technician performed over a certain month, the LIP could refine the results in the dashboard to see such information. Reports regarding the quality metrics of the facility may also be generated through the dashboard. The dashboard may also be used to track how the facility's quality metrics compare to federal regulations and provide warnings if the metrics are below federal regulations for any time period. Reports may also be generated that indicate how the quality metrics of the facility compare to federal regulations or guidelines. In addition, a dashboard may also be provided to a government agency or review board to show how an individual facility is performing or to show how a group of facilities is performing. The dashboard also provides useful insights into the quality metrics that were previously unavailable. As the metrics are received by the central computing system, the dashboard representation for the facility may be updated almost immediately. Accordingly, the imaging quality of a facility is able to be tracked over time and in a real time or live manner that has never been available before.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The dashboard or the reports may also provide additional insights beyond the metrics that are reported. For instance, based on the aggregation of the quality metrics, a large enough sample of metrics across different facilities may allow for correlations between different types of quality metrics and the identifying data. Such correlations and insights may be generated through machine learning techniques. Unsupervised machine learning techniques may be particularly useful in identifying correlations and insights that may have been previously unknown. Clustering-based, association-based, and anomaly-based unsupervised learning algorithms, among others, may all be used for the data. Clustering algorithms are generally directed to problems where the goal is to discover inherent clusters or grouping of data, and association algorithms are generally directed to problems where the goal is to discover rules that describe large portions of data. Anomaly detection algorithms generally are directed to discovering unusual or outlier metrics within the set of quality metrics. As an example, the aggregated metrics and identification data may be provided as an input to the unsupervised machine learning algorithms to output previously unknown structures, patterns, and associations within the aggregated metrics and identification data.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">At operation <b>840</b>, a training recommendation for a facility or a particular technologist may be generated based on the generated benchmark in operation <b>836</b>. The training recommendation may be generated by the central computing system. For example, based on a comparison of the first set of quality metrics to the generated benchmark, it may be determined that the first set of quality metrics (or a subset thereof) are falling short of the benchmark. Based on that determination, a training recommendation may be provided. As an example, the positioning metrics for a particular technician may be below a benchmark or a federal regulation or guideline. A training for that technician regarding positioning may then be generated by operation <b>840</b>. The training may also be tailored to the specific positioning metrics that are problematic for the specific technician. The trainings may be generated from training sets available from different training organizations or custom trainings provided by the company hosting or operating the central computing system. For instance, the trainings may be a set of videos for the technician to watch to better understand how to properly position the patient. The video trainings may also include interactive elements that further improve the interaction of the technician during the training. Such interactive trainings may also include an assessment following or during the training that assesses how well the technician is understanding the information provided by the training. The generated training may also include recommendations for programs that are available based on the particular problematic metrics.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">At operation <b>842</b>, the training generated in operation <b>840</b> is sent to the facility. For example, when the training has been generated for a technician at the first facility, the generated training is sent to the first facility. The training may be sent to the first facility by the central computing system via the web application or other form of communication. The training may be in the form as a series of videos that are accessible via the web application by the technician. Similarly, interactive trainings may also be provided via the web application. During the interactive trainings, an assessment score may be stored that indicates how well the technician performed during the training. That assessment score may be stored and associated with that technician for the particular training that was generated at operation <b>840</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">At operation <b>844</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref>), a subsequent set of quality metrics for a plurality of medical images is received. For example, the central computing system may receive, from the first imaging facility, a subsequent set of quality metrics for a plurality of medical images that were acquired after the medical images for which metrics were receiving in operation <b>830</b>. Subsequent sets of quality metrics may also be received from additional facilities as well. As discussed above, the quality metrics may be continuously received from the facilities as the quality metrics are generated. In some examples, the subsequent set of quality metrics may be received from a facility that has received and/or completed the training sent in operation <b>842</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">At operation <b>846</b>, the subsequent set of quality metrics are compared to quality metrics previously received by one or more of the imaging facilities. For example, when the subsequent quality metrics are received from the first imaging facility, those subsequent quality metrics are compared to the first set of quality metrics received in operation <b>830</b>. At operation <b>848</b>, based on the comparison of the subsequent quality metrics to the prior quality metrics, such as the first set of quality metrics, an effectiveness rating for a training is generated. The effectiveness rating may be generated for the training that was generated in operation <b>840</b> and sent to the facility in operation <b>842</b>. The effectiveness rating indicates how effective the training was that was provided to the facility and/or the technician.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">As an example, the training is provided to the first facility after the first set of quality metrics are received and the subsequent set of quality metrics are received after the training has been completed. Due to the training being completed, the expectation is that the quality metrics for the facility will have improved. A comparison between the subsequent set of quality metrics and the first set of quality metrics can either confirm or refute that expectation. For instance, if the training was for patient positioning, the patient positioning metrics from the first set of quality metrics are compared to the patient positioning metrics from the subsequent set of quality metrics. If the subsequent positioning metric improved, a positive effectiveness rating is generated for the training to indicate that the training is effective. If the subsequent positioning metric remained the same, a neutral effectiveness rating is generated for the training to indicate that the training is ineffective. If the subsequent positioning metric worsened, a negative effectiveness rating is generated for the training to indicate that the training is counterproductive. The effectiveness rating may then be used as feedback to the central computing system in generating future trainings. For example, trainings that have received a negative effectiveness rating may no longer be generated and sent to facilities, whereas trainings that have received a positive effectiveness rating may be more heavily weighted in generating future trainings.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In some examples, generating the effectiveness rating of the training may account for the assessment scores of the technicians that received the training. As discussed above, during the interactive trainings, an assessment score may be stored that indicates how well the technician performed during the training. If the assessment score is low for the training and the subsequent quality metric did not improve, the training itself may not be ineffective. Rather, the low-scoring technician may need additional more in-depth training and assistance. In such examples where the assessment score is low, a lower weight may be assigned to the effectiveness rating of the training.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">At operation <b>850</b>, a trend is determined for at least one quality metric based on the comparison of the subsequent set of metrics and the prior set of quality metrics performed in operation <b>846</b>. In some examples, the determination of the trend may be performed as part of operation <b>848</b>. For instance, as discussed above, particular metrics may be compared to one another to determine whether the metric has improved or worsened over time. That trend and the rate of the trend is determined in operation <b>850</b>. The rate of the trend may be based on the total change in the particular metric over a designated period of time, such as days, weeks, months, quarters, or years.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">At operation <b>852</b>, a warning or notification may be generated based on the trend determined in operation <b>850</b>. The generation of the warning may be based on the rate of the trend as well. For instance, if the trend is negative and the rate of the trend is above a predetermined threshold, a warning may be generated and send to the facility that has the rapidly worsening metric. Such a warning may prevent poor imaging procedures before they occur because the facility can implement corrections upon receiving the warning. The warning may also be based on a negative trend and a metric that is approaching a benchmark and/or federal guideline or regulation. For example, where a quality metric is within a predetermined threshold of a benchmark and/or federal guideline or regulation and the trend is negative, a warning may be generated and provided to the facility. By providing such a warning, the facility is able to implement corrections before falling below the benchmark or being out of compliance with the issued guideline or regulation.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an article of manufacture according to an embodiment.
