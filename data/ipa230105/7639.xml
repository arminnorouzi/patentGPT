These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include one or more base stations or one or more network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The described techniques relate to improved methods, systems, devices, and apparatuses that support resource sharing during communication pause. Generally, the described techniques provide for a user equipment (UE) with multiple subscriber identity modules (SIMs) to allocate shared time-frequency resources based on pausing a communication session. For example, a UE may initiate a voice call on a subscription for a first SIM (e.g., SIM1) with another device during a communication session. In some cases, the UE may use one or more resources, such as time-frequency resources, to transmit data packets to the other device that overlap with resources for a second SIM (e.g., SIM2). In some examples, the UE may determine to pause the communication session with the other device on the subscription for SIM1 and may transmit a pause indication to the other device. In some other examples, the other device may determine to pause the communication session with the UE and may transmit a pause indication to the UE. If the communication session is paused, the UE may reduce a priority for one or more time-frequency resources SIM1 shares with SIM2. The UE may communicate on the subscription for SIM2 for a duration or until receiving a resume message from the other device (e.g., according to a discontinuous reception (DRX) cycle or until the UE determines to resume the call).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A method for wireless communications is described.

As such, for some connections such as voice calls or other connects that satisfy a quality of service (QoS) threshold, the time-frequency resources allocated for the connection may not be released during the connection. For example, the UE may establish a voice call (e.g., voice over long term evolution (VoLTE) or voice over new radio (VoNR)) with the other device. In some examples, the UE may operate according to one or more subscriptions. That is, the UE may be a dual-sim dual-standby (DSDS) device with two subscriptions that may use the same time-frequency resources. In some cases, the UE may pause the packet-based communication for a first of the subscriptions, or the other device may pause the packet-based communication for the first subscription, such as placing the voice call on hold. However, the first subscription may not release the time-frequency resources used for the packet-based communication while paused. Thus, a second subscription may be unable to use the time-frequency resources even though they are not being used for communication on the first subscription.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described herein, a UE may establish multiple connections for packet-based communication with another device, such as a base station, another UE, or the like. For example, the UE may establish two connections for different subscriber identity modules (SIMS) if the UE is a multiple SIM (MSIM) device, such as a DSDS device. In such examples, the two SIMS of the UE may be configured to communicate on partially or fully overlapping frequency resources or radio frequency bands. As such, the UE may be able to communicate using one SIM at a time. In some cases, the UE may pause the communication of data packets with the other device on one of the SIMS, such as putting a voice call on hold. The UE may receive an indication to pause the communication from the other device (e.g., if the other device puts the call on hold) or may send an indication to pause the communication to the other device (e.g., if the UE puts the call on hold). In some examples, once the UE pauses the communication for the first SIM, the UE may release one or more shared time-frequency resources. For example, an internet protocol multimedia service (IMS) at the UE may send an indication to the lower layers at the UE to reduce the priority of the time-frequency resource for the first SIM, such that the second SIM may use the resource for communication. In some examples, if the UE receives the indication to pause the communication, the UE may release the resources during an off duration of a discontinuous reception (DRX) cycle and may use the resources to monitor for messages indicating for the UE to resume communications on the first SIM during an on duration of the DRX cycle. In some other examples, if the UE sends the indication to pause the communication, the UE may release the resources after sending the message.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of wireless communications systems.

The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; may refer to a set of radio frequency spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting the communication links <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier used for a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of a radio frequency spectrum band (e.g., a bandwidth part (BWP)) that is operated according to one or more physical layer channels for a given radio access technology (e.g., LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR). Each physical layer channel may carry acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals, system information), control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier, user data, or other signaling. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> using carrier aggregation or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink component carriers and one or more uplink component carriers according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and time division duplexing (TDD) component carriers.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some examples (e.g., in a carrier aggregation configuration), a carrier may also have acquisition signaling or control signaling that coordinates operations for other carriers. A carrier may be associated with a frequency channel (e.g., an evolved universal mobile telecommunication system terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) absolute radio frequency channel number (EARFCN)) and may be positioned according to a channel raster for discovery by the UEs <b>115</b>. A carrier may be operated in a standalone mode where initial acquisition and connection may be conducted by the UEs <b>115</b> via the carrier, or the carrier may be operated in a non-standalone mode where a connection is anchored using a different carrier (e.g., of the same or a different radio access technology).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The communication links <b>125</b> shown in the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include uplink transmissions from a UE <b>115</b> to a base station <b>105</b>, or downlink transmissions from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>. Carriers may carry downlink or uplink communications (e.g., in an FDD mode) or may be configured to carry downlink and uplink communications (e.g., in a TDD mode).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A carrier may be associated with a particular bandwidth of the radio frequency spectrum, and in some examples the carrier bandwidth may be referred to as a &#x201c;system bandwidth&#x201d; of the carrier or the wireless communications system <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier bandwidth may be one of a number of determined bandwidths for carriers of a particular radio access technology (e.g., 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 80 megahertz (MHz)). Devices of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> (e.g., the base stations <b>105</b>, the UEs <b>115</b>, or both) may have hardware configurations that support communications over a particular carrier bandwidth or may be configurable to support communications over one of a set of carrier bandwidths. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include base stations <b>105</b> or UEs <b>115</b> that support simultaneous communications via carriers associated with multiple carrier bandwidths. In some examples, each served UE <b>115</b> may be configured for operating over portions (e.g., a sub-band, a BWP) or all of a carrier bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple subcarriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM)). In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element may consist of one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each resource element may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme, the coding rate of the modulation scheme, or both). Thus, the more resource elements that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. A wireless communications resource may refer to a combination of a radio frequency spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers or beams), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate or data integrity for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">One or more numerologies for a carrier may be supported, where a numerology may include a subcarrier spacing (&#x394;f) and a cyclic prefix. A carrier may be divided into one or more BWPs having the same or different numerologies. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple BWPs. In some examples, a single BWP for a carrier may be active at a given time and communications for the UE <b>115</b> may be restricted to one or more active BWPs.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The time intervals for the base stations <b>105</b> or the UEs <b>115</b> may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>=1/(&#x394;f<sub>max</sub>&#xb7;N<sub>f</sub>) seconds, where &#x394;f<sub>max </sub>may represent the maximum supported subcarrier spacing, and N<sub>f </sub>may represent the maximum supported discrete Fourier transform (DFT) size. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a specified duration (e.g., 10 milliseconds (ms)). Each radio frame may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) (e.g., ranging from 0 to 1023).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Each frame may include multiple consecutively numbered subframes or slots, and each subframe or slot may have the same duration. In some examples, a frame may be divided (e.g., in the time domain) into subframes, and each subframe may be further divided into a number of slots. Alternatively, each frame may include a variable number of slots, and the number of slots may depend on subcarrier spacing. Each slot may include a number of symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). In some wireless communications systems <b>100</b>, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain one or more (e.g., N<sub>f</sub>) sampling periods. The duration of a symbol period may depend on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A subframe, a slot, a mini-slot, or a symbol may be the smallest scheduling unit (e.g., in the time domain) of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In some examples, the TTI duration (e.g., the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable. Additionally or alternatively, the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs)).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using one or more of time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. A control region (e.g., a control resource set (CORESET)) for a physical control channel may be defined by a number of symbol periods and may extend across the system bandwidth or a subset of the system bandwidth of the carrier. One or more control regions (e.g., CORESETs) may be configured for a set of the UEs <b>115</b>. For example, one or more of the UEs <b>115</b> may monitor or search control regions for control information according to one or more search space sets, and each search space set may include one or multiple control channel candidates in one or more aggregation levels arranged in a cascaded manner. An aggregation level for a control channel candidate may refer to a number of control channel resources (e.g., control channel elements (CCEs)) associated with encoded information for a control information format having a given payload size. Search space sets may include common search space sets configured for sending control information to multiple UEs <b>115</b> and UE-specific search space sets for sending control information to a specific UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Each base station <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage via one or more cells, for example a macro cell, a small cell, a hot spot, or other types of cells, or any combination thereof. The term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may refer to a logical communication entity used for communication with a base station <b>105</b> (e.g., over a carrier) and may be associated with an identifier for distinguishing neighboring cells (e.g., a physical cell identifier (PCID), a virtual cell identifier (VCID), or others). In some examples, a cell may also refer to a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> or a portion of a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> (e.g., a sector) over which the logical communication entity operates. Such cells may range from smaller areas (e.g., a structure, a subset of structure) to larger areas depending on various factors such as the capabilities of the base station <b>105</b>. For example, a cell may be or include a building, a subset of a building, or exterior spaces between or overlapping with geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A macro cell generally covers a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by the UEs <b>115</b> with service subscriptions with the network provider supporting the macro cell. A small cell may be associated with a lower-powered base station <b>105</b>, as compared with a macro cell, and a small cell may operate in the same or different (e.g., licensed, unlicensed) frequency bands as macro cells. Small cells may provide unrestricted access to the UEs <b>115</b> with service subscriptions with the network provider or may provide restricted access to the UEs <b>115</b> having an association with the small cell (e.g., the UEs <b>115</b> in a closed subscriber group (CSG), the UEs <b>115</b> associated with users in a home or office).

For synchronous operation, the base stations <b>105</b> may have similar frame timings, and transmissions from different base stations <b>105</b> may be approximately aligned in time. For asynchronous operation, the base stations <b>105</b> may have different frame timings, and transmissions from different base stations <b>105</b> may, in some examples, not be aligned in time. The techniques described herein may be used for either synchronous or asynchronous operations.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Some UEs <b>115</b>, such as MTC or IoT devices, may be low cost or low complexity devices and may provide for automated communication between machines (e.g., via Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication). M2M communication or MTC may refer to data communication technologies that allow devices to communicate with one another or a base station <b>105</b> without human intervention. In some examples, M2M communication or MTC may include communications from devices that integrate sensors or meters to measure or capture information and relay such information to a central server or application program that makes use of the information or presents the information to humans interacting with the application program. Some UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to collect information or enable automated behavior of machines or other devices. Examples of applications for MTC devices include smart metering, inventory monitoring, water level monitoring, equipment monitoring, healthcare monitoring, wildlife monitoring, weather and geological event monitoring, fleet management and tracking, remote security sensing, physical access control, and transaction-based business charging.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured to employ operating modes that reduce power consumption, such as half-duplex communications (e.g., a mode that supports one-way communication via transmission or reception, but not transmission and reception simultaneously). In some examples, half-duplex communications may be performed at a reduced peak rate. Other power conservation techniques for the UEs <b>115</b> include entering a power saving deep sleep mode when not engaging in active communications, operating over a limited bandwidth (e.g., according to narrowband communications), or a combination of these techniques. For example, some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured for operation using a narrowband protocol type that is associated with a defined portion or range (e.g., set of subcarriers or resource blocks (RBs)) within a carrier, within a guard-band of a carrier, or outside of a carrier.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable communications or low-latency communications, or various combinations thereof.

The UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support ultra-reliable, low-latency, or critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions). Ultra-reliable communications may include private communication or group communication and may be supported by one or more mission critical services such as mission critical push-to-talk (MCPTT), mission critical video (MCVideo), or mission critical data (MCData). Support for mission critical functions may include prioritization of services, and mission critical services may be used for public safety or general commercial applications. The terms ultra-reliable, low-latency, mission critical, and ultra-reliable low-latency may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> over a device-to-device (D2D) communication link <b>135</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P2P) or D2D protocol).

In some examples, groups of the UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> facilitates the scheduling of resources for D2D communications.

Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band because the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. The UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features, but the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to the UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. The transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter ranges (e.g., less than 100 kilometers) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in a super high frequency (SHF) region using frequency bands from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, also known as the centimeter band, or in an extremely high frequency (EHF) region of the spectrum (e.g., from 30 GHz to 300 GHz), also known as the millimeter band. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support millimeter wave (mmW) communications between the UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b>, and EHF antennas of the respective devices may be smaller and more closely spaced than UHF antennas. In some examples, this may facilitate use of antenna arrays within a device. The propagation of EHF transmissions, however, may be subject to even greater atmospheric attenuation and shorter range than SHF or UHF transmissions. The techniques disclosed herein may be employed across transmissions that use one or more different frequency regions, and designated use of bands across these frequency regions may differ by country or regulating body.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. When operating in unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands, devices such as the base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may employ carrier sensing for collision detection and avoidance. In some examples, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a carrier aggregation configuration in conjunction with component carriers operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, P2P transmissions, or D2D transmissions, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. The antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays or antenna panels, which may support MIMO operations or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some examples, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations.

Such techniques may be referred to as spatial multiplexing. The multiple signals may, for example, be transmitted by the transmitting device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Likewise, the multiple signals may be received by the receiving device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Each of the multiple signals may be referred to as a separate spatial stream and may carry bits associated with the same data stream (e.g., the same codeword) or different data streams (e.g., different codewords). Different spatial layers may be associated with different antenna ports used for channel measurement and reporting. MIMO techniques include single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO), where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to the same receiving device, and multiple-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam, a receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that some signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying amplitude offsets, phase offsets, or both to signals carried via the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may use beam sweeping techniques as part of beam forming operations. For example, a base station <b>105</b> may use multiple antennas or antenna arrays (e.g., antenna panels) to conduct beamforming operations for directional communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Some signals (e.g., synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals) may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> multiple times in different directions. For example, the base station <b>105</b> may transmit a signal according to different beamforming weight sets associated with different directions of transmission. Transmissions in different beam directions may be used to identify (e.g., by a transmitting device, such as a base station <b>105</b>, or by a receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>) a beam direction for later transmission or reception by the base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Some signals, such as data signals associated with a particular receiving device, may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> in a single beam direction (e.g., a direction associated with the receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>). In some examples, the beam direction associated with transmissions along a single beam direction may be determined based on a signal that was transmitted in one or more beam directions. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may receive one or more of the signals transmitted by the base station <b>105</b> in different directions and may report to the base station <b>105</b> an indication of the signal that the UE <b>115</b> received with a highest signal quality or an otherwise acceptable signal quality.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some examples, transmissions by a device (e.g., by a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) may be performed using multiple beam directions, and the device may use a combination of digital precoding or radio frequency beamforming to generate a combined beam for transmission (e.g., from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>). The UE <b>115</b> may report feedback that indicates precoding weights for one or more beam directions, and the feedback may correspond to a configured number of beams across a system bandwidth or one or more sub-bands. The base station <b>105</b> may transmit a reference signal (e.g., a cell-specific reference signal (CRS), a channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS)), which may be precoded or unprecoded. The UE <b>115</b> may provide feedback for beam selection, which may be a precoding matrix indicator (PMI) or codebook-based feedback (e.g., a multi-panel type codebook, a linear combination type codebook, a port selection type codebook). Although these techniques are described with reference to signals transmitted in one or more directions by a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b> may employ similar techniques for transmitting signals multiple times in different directions (e.g., for identifying a beam direction for subsequent transmission or reception by the UE <b>115</b>) or for transmitting a signal in a single direction (e.g., for transmitting data to a receiving device).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">A receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>) may try multiple receive configurations (e.g., directional listening) when receiving various signals from the base station <b>105</b>, such as synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals. For example, a receiving device may try multiple receive directions by receiving via different antenna subarrays, by processing received signals according to different antenna subarrays, by receiving according to different receive beamforming weight sets (e.g., different directional listening weight sets) applied to signals received at multiple antenna elements of an antenna array, or by processing received signals according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at multiple antenna elements of an antenna array, any of which may be referred to as &#x201c;listening&#x201d; according to different receive configurations or receive directions. In some examples, a receiving device may use a single receive configuration to receive along a single beam direction (e.g., when receiving a data signal). The single receive configuration may be aligned in a beam direction determined based on listening according to different receive configuration directions (e.g., a beam direction determined to have a highest signal strength, highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or otherwise acceptable signal quality based on listening according to multiple beam directions).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a packet-based network that operates according to a layered protocol stack. In the user plane, communications at the bearer or Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer may be IP-based. A Radio Link Control (RLC) layer may perform packet segmentation and reassembly to communicate over logical channels. A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer may perform priority handling and multiplexing of logical channels into transport channels. The MAC layer may also use error detection techniques, error correction techniques, or both to support retransmissions at the MAC layer to improve link efficiency. In the control plane, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol layer may provide establishment, configuration, and maintenance of an RRC connection between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b> or a core network <b>130</b> supporting radio bearers for user plane data. At the physical layer, transport channels may be mapped to physical channels.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b> may support retransmissions of data to increase the likelihood that data is received successfully. Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback is one technique for increasing the likelihood that data is received correctly over a communication link <b>125</b>. HARQ may include a combination of error detection (e.g., using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)), forward error correction (FEC), and retransmission (e.g., automatic repeat request (ARQ)). HARQ may improve throughput at the MAC layer in poor radio conditions (e.g., low signal-to-noise conditions). In some examples, a device may support same-slot HARQ feedback, where the device may provide HARQ feedback in a specific slot for data received in a previous symbol in the slot. In other cases, the device may provide HARQ feedback in a subsequent slot, or according to some other time interval.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more SIMS, which may provide for the UE <b>115</b> to operate according to multiple subscriptions. For example, the UE <b>115</b> may be an MSIM device or a DSDS device and may operate on multiple carrier frequencies. In some cases, the UE <b>115</b> may establish wireless connections for packet-based communications using subscriptions for multiple SIMs. The multiple subscriptions or SIMS may be configured to communicate over a same or partially overlapping set of frequency resources (e.g., radio frequency bands, subchannels, or the like) for communications over the wireless connections. In some cases, the UE <b>115</b> may be restricted from performing activities, such as communication of data or control signaling, on the subscription for a SIM until the packet-based communication session on a subscription for another SIM ends (e.g., even when a packet-based communication session is paused on the subscription for the SIM). In such cases, the frequency resources for a first SIM or subscription by be held or not releasable for a duration of a connection (e.g., a voice call) even if data is not actively being transmitted or received for periods of time during the connection, which may reduce the performance of the UE <b>115</b> due to time-frequency resource allocation inefficiencies.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> with multiple SIMS may allocate shared time-frequency resources based on pausing a communication session. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may initiate a voice call on a subscription for a first SIM (e.g., SIM1) with another device during a communication session. In some cases, the UE may use one or more resources, such as time-frequency resources, to transmit data packets to the other device that overlap with resources for a second SIM (e.g., SIM2). In some examples, the UE <b>115</b> may determine to pause the communication session with the other device on the subscription for SIM1 and may transmit a pause indication to the other device.

For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may be an MSIM device or a DSDS device and may operate on multiple carrier frequencies. An MSIM device may include design features to accommodate multiple SIM cards, which may support one or more SIMs with distinct wireless subscriptions. The MSIM device may include design features to accommodate a variety of SIM designs, such as virtual SIMS (e.g., an embedded SIM (eSIM)). An MSIM device may have the ability to place individual SIMs in standby or active modes. For example, an MSIM device may be a dual SIM single standby (DSSS) device, a dual SIM dual active (DSDA) device or a DSDS device. A DSDS device may be a hybrid implementation of two MSIM technologies including aspects of DSSS technology and aspects of DSDA technology. A DSDS device may incorporate design features such that the device may activate two SIMS using a radio transceiver. In some cases, a DSDS device may switch a SIM from active mode to standby mode if another SIM is engaged in communications. Additionally or alternatively, a DSDS device may switch a SIM from active mode to standby mode if a communication session using a subscription for another SIM is paused.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some cases, the UE <b>115</b>-<i>a</i>, which may be DSDS device, may establish wireless connections for packet-based communications using subscriptions for multiple SIMS. The subscriptions may share a set of radio frequency resources (e.g., radio frequency bands, radio frequency carriers, radio frequency subchannels, etc.) for communications over the wireless connections. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may establish a wireless connection on a subscription for SIM1 with UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>using communication link <b>205</b>-<i>a </i>and communication link <b>205</b>-<i>b</i>. In some examples, the packet-based communications may involve the UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>exchanging data packets <b>210</b> (e.g., during a voice call) with another device, such as another UE <b>115</b>, on a subscription for a first SIM of the multiple SIMS during a communication session. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may establish the voice call on the subscription for SIM1 with UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>and may transmit one or more data packets <b>210</b>-<i>a </i>to UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>via communication link <b>205</b>-<i>a</i>.

In some examples, the UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may hold one or more time-frequency resources on the subscription for the first SIM during the communication session (e.g., a voice call with another device) and may not release the resources until the communication session ends. In some cases, while the communication session on the subscription is active, there may not be activity (e.g., monitoring, data transmission or reception, etc.) running on another subscription, such as a subscription for a second SIM of the multiple SIMs.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some examples, one or more UEs <b>115</b>, such as UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>and UE <b>115</b>-<i>b</i>, may communicate data packets <b>210</b> according to a QoS for each wireless connection. That is, the data packet communication may satisfy a QoS threshold, which may be configured at the UEs <b>115</b> by a base station <b>105</b>, may be predetermined, or may be otherwise configured. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may initiate a voice call (e.g., VoLTE or VoNR), a video call, V2V or V2X communication (e.g., if UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>is a vehicle), or the like that satisfies the QoS threshold with UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>using one of two or more subscriptions. In some other examples, UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>may initiate the communications with UE <b>115</b>-<i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some examples, the UE <b>115</b> may implement an IMS module to manage communications on each subscription for multiple SIMS. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may implement an IMS module to manage communications with UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>for SIM1 and communications with UE <b>115</b>-<i>c </i>for SIM2. The IMS module may manage and deliver multimedia services to the UE <b>115</b>, including voice call services over a packet-switched network. In some examples, the IMS module may adjust a priority for one or more time-frequency resources for communications on subscriptions for the SIMS. That is, the IMS module may increase or decrease a priority, such as a Transmission Resource Management (TRM) priority, for one or more resources the UE <b>115</b> may use to transmit data packets <b>210</b> to another device. For example, to initiate a communication session with another device using a subscription for SIM1 (e.g., to initiate or receive initiation of a voice call, such as a VoLTE call), the IMS module may increase the TRM priority of one or more resources for SIM1. In some cases, the TRM priority may relate to the management of transmission resources in various networking modes, such as a mobility management mode (MMode), connected management (CM) mode, or the like. The IMS module may send an indication of the updated priority for the resources to one or more lower layers, which may be managed by an RRC module. For example, the RRC module may manage signaling for a NAS layer, may perform mobility management operations, or the like based on the priority of the resources for SIM1. In some cases, once the IMS module initiates the communication session, the IMS module may hold the radio frequency resources with a relatively high priority until the communications session ends.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some cases, a UE <b>115</b> may pause a packet-based communication session on the subscription for SIM1, which may involve transmitting an indication to another UE <b>115</b> to pause the transmission of data packets <b>210</b>, which is described in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In some other cases, the UE <b>115</b> may determine to pause transmission of data packets <b>210</b> based on the other UE <b>115</b> pausing the packet-based communication session. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may receive a pause indication <b>215</b> from UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>to pause the packet-based communication session on the subscription for SIM1. In some cases, UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>may transmit a pause indication <b>215</b> to UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>to pause transmission of data packets <b>210</b> after data packets <b>210</b>-<i>a </i>have been received. In some examples, if UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>sends a pause indication <b>215</b> to UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>to pause communications on the subscription for SIM1, a user of UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may initiate or receive communications on a subscription for SIM2 (e.g., a voice call). If communications on the subscription for SIM2 are established successfully, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may release the wireless connection on the subscription for SIM1 (e.g., subsequent to establishing the communications on the subscription for SIM2).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some cases, the UE <b>115</b> may not release time-frequency resources on a subscription for a first SIM that are shared with the subscription for a second SIM while a data packet exchange (e.g., a voice call) on the subscription for the first SIM is paused, which may prevent the UE <b>115</b> from using the resources for activity on the subscription for the second SIM. For example, in a DSDS scenario, if a subscription for SIM1 holds one or more radio frequency resources for a voice call, such as a VoLTE call, then the UE <b>115</b> may not perform activity on another subscription (e.g., a subscription for SIM2), such as a data communication, measurements, cell searches, or the like. Additionally or alternatively, the subscription for SIM2 may trigger an out of service (OOS) or radio link failure (RLF) after a duration of inactivity (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or any other duration). For example, if a voice call is initiated on one subscription, and the voice call is placed on hold for a duration (e.g., more than 5 seconds), an OOS or RLF may be triggered on a second subscription. In some cases, if the UE <b>115</b> may not perform activities, such receiving paging messages, on the subscription for SIM2 until the packet-based communication session on the subscription for SIM1 ends (e.g., even when a packet-based communication session is paused on the subscription for SIM1), the performance of the UE <b>115</b> may be reduced due to time-frequency resource allocation inefficiencies.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some cases, to improve resource allocation, a UE <b>115</b> with multiple SIMs may allocate shared time-frequency resources based on pausing a communication session.

In some cases (e.g., in a DSDS scenario), an IMS module at UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may determine a communication state, such as a pause state or a resume state. For example, the IMS module may receive the pause indication <b>215</b> for a voice call with UE <b>115</b>-<i>b</i>, which may indicate the voice call is put on hold on a subscription for SIM1.

In some cases, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may determine to pause communications on first subscription for a SIM, such as a subscription for SIM1, with UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>and may perform a resource release <b>305</b> to use shared resources to communicate with a wireless device (e.g., UE <b>115</b>-<i>f</i>) on a second subscription for another SIM, such as a subscription for SIM2.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some cases, as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more SIMs, which may provide for the UE <b>115</b> to operate according to multiple subscriptions. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may be an MSIM device or a DSDS device that may establish wireless connections for packet-based communications using subscriptions for multiple SIMS, such as SIM1 and SIM2. The subscriptions may share a set of time-frequency resources or radio frequency resources for communications over the wireless connections. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may establish a wireless connection on a subscription for SIM1 with UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>using communication link <b>205</b>-<i>c </i>and communication link <b>205</b>-<i>d</i>. The wireless connection on the subscription for SIM1 may share time frequency resources with a wireless connection on a subscription for SIM2 between UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>and UE <b>115</b>-<i>f </i>(e.g., on communication link <b>205</b>-<i>e</i>). In some examples, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>and UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>may exchange data packets <b>210</b> on the subscription for SIM1 during a communication session. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may establish the voice call on the subscription for SIM1 with UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>and may transmit one or more data packets <b>210</b>-<i>f </i>to UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>via communication link <b>205</b>-<i>c</i>. Similarly, UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>may establish the voice call on the subscription for SIM1 with UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>and may transmit one or more data packets <b>210</b>-<i>g </i>to UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>via communication link <b>205</b>-<i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may pause a packet-based communication session on the subscription for SIM1, which may involve transmitting an indication to another UE <b>115</b> to pause transmission of data packets <b>210</b>. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may determine to pause a communication session on the subscription for SIM1 (e.g., a user may decide to place a voice call on hold). UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may transmit a pause indication <b>310</b> from UE <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>to pause the packet-based communication session on the subscription for SIM1. In some cases, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may transmit a pause indication <b>310</b> to UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>to pause transmission of data packets <b>210</b> after data packets <b>210</b>-<i>f </i>have been received. UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may wait for a duration <b>315</b> before determining to resume the communication on the subscription for SIM1. In some cases, the UE <b>115</b> may not release time-frequency resources on a subscription for a first SIM that are shared with the subscription for a second SIM while a data packet exchange (e.g., a voice call) on the subscription for the first SIM is paused, which may prevent the UE <b>115</b> from using the resources for activity on the subscription for the second SIM.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some examples, if UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>sends a pause indication <b>215</b> to UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>to pause communications on the subscription for SIM1, a user of UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may initiate or receive communications on a subscription for SIM2 (e.g., a voice call). If communications on the subscription for SIM2 are established successfully, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may wait for a duration and then locally release the wireless connection on the subscription for SIM1 (e.g., UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may place a call on SIM1 on hold for a limited time after which UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may release one or more resources used for the call locally).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some cases, to improve resource allocation, a UE <b>115</b> with multiple SIMs may allocate shared time-frequency resources based on pausing a communication session. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may initiate a voice call with UE <b>115</b>-<i>e</i>, or UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>may initiate a voice call with UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>during a communication session. The voice call may be on a subscription, such as an operator, for SIM1. UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may transmit data packets <b>210</b>-<i>f </i>to UE <b>115</b>-<i>e</i>, and UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>may transmit data packets <b>210</b>-<i>g </i>to UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>during an initial data exchange in the communication session. In some cases, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may use one or more resources, such as time-frequency resources or radio frequency resources, to transmit data packets <b>210</b>-<i>d </i>that overlap with resources for SIM2 (e.g., if UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>is a DSDS device).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some examples, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may determine to pause the communication session with UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>on the subscription for SIM1. For example, a user operating UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may place a voice call, such as a VoLTE or VoNR call, on hold. UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may transmit a pause indication <b>310</b> to UE <b>115</b>-<i>e</i>, which may indicate to UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>that the communication session is paused. In some other examples, UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>may otherwise determine the communication session is paused (e.g., based on a timer expiring, not receiving a response from UE <b>115</b>-<i>d</i>, a feedback message, or by any other means). In some cases (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), an IMS module at UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may determine a communication state, such as a pause state or a resume state. For example, the IMS module may determine a user has paused communication for a voice call with UE <b>115</b>-<i>e</i>, which may indicate the voice call is put on hold on a subscription for SIM1. Thus, the IMS module may know a communication state, or call state, for the communication session is set to a value of HOLD.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Once the communication session is paused, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may transmit the pause indication <b>310</b> to UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>and may perform a resource release <b>305</b>. During the resource release <b>305</b>, the IMS module may reduce the priority of the resources on the subscription for SIM1. In some examples, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may use the released resources to communicate with another wireless device, such as UE <b>115</b>-<i>f</i>, on a subscription for SIM2 during a duration <b>315</b> that the communication is paused. UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may transmit or receive data packets <b>210</b>-<i>h </i>from UE <b>115</b>-<i>f </i>on the subscription for SIM2 after pausing the communication with UE <b>115</b>-<i>e</i>. For example, if UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>places a voice call with UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>on the subscription for SIM1 on hold and performs the resource release <b>305</b>, then UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may use the time-frequency resources for another voice call, or some other communication activity, on the subscription for SIM2 after the resource release <b>305</b>. The subscription for SIM2 may use the resources (e.g., an radio frequency chain of resource) until UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>resumes the voice call with UE <b>115</b>-<i>e </i>(e.g., a user decides to resume the call).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some examples, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may continue to use the resources to monitor for signaling from base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>via communication link <b>125</b>-<i>b</i>. For example, base station <b>105</b>-<i>b </i>may configure UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>with a DRX cycle, which may have an on duration and an off duration as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may monitor for configuration messages, such as a DRX reconfiguration, scheduling information, or the like during the on-duration of a DRX cycle using the resources provided the priority of the communications on the subscription for SIM2 is relatively low (e.g., below a threshold priority value).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some cases, once UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>resumes the call, after a duration <b>315</b>, the IMS module may update the communication state (e.g., to an UNHOLD value). The IMS module may increase the priority of the released resources to continue the communication session on the subscription for SIM1 (e.g., to continue a voice call). For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may transmit data packets <b>210</b>-<i>e </i>once the communication is resumed on the subscription for SIM1. In some examples, by performing the resource release <b>305</b>, UE <b>115</b>-<i>d </i>may improve device performance by improving resource allocation (e.g., using time-frequency resources that may otherwise be idle when the communication is paused).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of a process flow <b>400</b> that supports resource sharing during communication pause in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.
