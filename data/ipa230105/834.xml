polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF), are a distinct family of hematopoietic disorders caused by somatic mutations acquired by a multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell resulting in abnormalities in hematologic disturbances in red cell, white cell, and platelet production as well as splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. The MPNs share common mutations which constitutively alter the normal physiologic signals responsible for hematopoiesis. MPN may present clinically as a benign clonal myeloproliferation but the initiating abnormal stem/progenitor cell is susceptible to new mutations and epigenetic alterations that allow for the rapid evolution to bone marrow failure with myelofibrosis or transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many MPN patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Confounding a definitive diagnosis and prognosis, ET, PV and PMF can masquerade as one another. Common presenting manifestations include fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, fever, dyspnea, and abdominal discomfort due to sometimes massive splenomegaly. The three MPN disorders overlap phenotypically and even share similarities with other myeloid neoplasms. A specific point mutation in JAK2 (JAK2<sup>V617F</sup>) as well as mutations in calreticulin (CALR) and the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) are found in 90% of MPN patients. Although the distribution of these mutations is not equal among PV, ET and primary MF PMF), they do not diagnostically define the specific MPN or the prognosis nor are they mutually exclusive. Healthy individuals may carry one of these mutations without developing an MPN, indeed some of these mutations can be carried as germline mutations giving rise to hereditary forms of MPNs. ET, PV and PMF are nevertheless regarded as separate clinical entities each based on a distinct epidemiology, natural history and molecule profile. PV is the most common MPN and would appear to be the phenotypic manifestation mutations in JAK2. PV is the only MPN characterized by erythrocytosis defined as a hematocrit &#x2265;60% and hemoglobin &#x2265;20 gm/dL. ET is characterized by a sustained platelet count of &#x3e;450,000/&#x3bc;L and occurs predominantly in women. MF, primary or secondary myelofibrosis but sometimes called myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, or primary myelosclerosis, is a chronic inflammatory process in which excess collagen is deposited in bone marrow impairing hematopoiesis in association with marrow fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The major complications arise from cytopenias secondary to bone marrow failure, extramedullary hematopoiesis, principally in the spleen and liver, and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia. To patients, splenomegaly is the most distressing complication of primary myelofibrosis, leading to mechanical discomfort, inanition, splenic infarction, portal and pulmonary hypertension and blood cell sequestration. Both ET and PV are complicated by thrombosis. ET and PV can progress to MF as well as to AML.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many other somatic mutations found in MPN are also present in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and de novo AML; these include mutations in DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2, ASXLI, EZH2, TP53, NF1, NRAS, KRAS, SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and RUNX1. This shared mutational spectrum contributes to the phenotypic overlap of these disorders as well as influences their natural history including evolution to bone marrow failure or AML.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is no treatment specific for primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera. Current treatments do not alter the natural history of disease significantly and are thus aimed principally at improving symptoms. Anemia associated with an erythropoietin (EPO) level &#x3c;100 mU/ml may respond to recombinant EPO therapy but is associated with an increase in hepatosplenomegaly. Prednisone may be effective for patients with evidence of active inflammation or autoimmune disease. Hyperuricemia is managed with allopurinol. The nonselective JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is approved for intermediate 1 and 2 and high risk MF patients and high-risk PV patients. Ruxolitinib is effective in alleviating constitutional symptoms and reducing spleen size or volume by 35% in approximately 50% of patients. Ruxolitinib prolonged survival and lowered the JAK<sup>V617F </sup>allele burden in high-risk patients with primary MF (PMF). Anemia is exacerbated by ruxolitinib in some patients but thrombocytopenia, even if severe, may be improved. Ruxolitinib is effective only while the drug is administered; symptoms will recur when the drug is stopped. Fibrosis in the marrow is not affected and ruxolitinib has no impact on the mutation burden. Thalidomide at doses of 50 to 100 mg/day in combination with prednisone is effective in improving anemia and thrombocytopenia in approximately 60% of primary myelofibrosis patients and reducing spleen size in approximately 20%. Interferon-&#x3b1; at low-doses to reduce splenomegaly can be effective in the early course of the illness but can cause cytopenias. Pegylated interferon can produce molecular remissions in PV and reverse myelofibrosis in PMF in a minority of patients. Hydroxycarbamide has a low incidence of acute toxicity but causes marrow suppression and is leukemogenic. Low-dose alkylating agents can reduce organomegaly, reverse marrow fibrosis, and improve blood counts but only occasionally has durable effects; alkylating agents can cause severe bone marrow suppression and are leukemogenic. The only potentially curative treatment is allogeneic bone marrow transplantation indicated for patients younger than 65 years of age with intermediate-2 or high DIPSS score who have a matched donor. Five-year survival from stem cell transplant averages is approximately 50%.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Epigenetic modifications of DNA such as methylation of cytosine or post-translational modifications of histones such as methylation and acetylation influence gene expression by altering chromatin structure. Changes in gene expression patterns have the potential to alter the phenotype of a given cell. Mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 are associated with changes in the normal methylation patterns of cytosine in DNA while mutations in JAK2, EZH2 and ASXLI alter the methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation state of histones: both of these classes of changes alter the patterns of normal gene expression programs. Mutations in genes coding for proteins influencing the epigenetic state of the cells suggest that targeting the enzymatic function of such proteins may selectively eliminate malignant stem/progenitor clones and/or restoring their normal phenotype.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, also known as KDM1A) is an enzyme that removes mono- and dimethyl groups from histone (H) H3 at critical lysines (K), K4 and K9 (Shi et al., 2004). Methylation of histone H3K4 and H3K9 is a post-translational modification associated with changes in rates of gene. By virtue of altering the local state of chromatin, LSD1 is an epigenetic regulator of gene expression. The lysine (K) sites on histone H3 and the degree of methylation on those sites (1, 2 or 3 methyl groups) are associated with specific functions, e.g., enhancers and super-enhancers are characterized by H3K4me1 marks, whereas H3K4me2 is more often found in the proximal promoters and enhancers of actively transcribed genes.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">LSD1 is localized to three general regions of the genome: enhancers and super-enhancers, proximal promoters, and internal regions of transcription units through the agencies of proteins that bind DNA directly, generally TFs. Many TFs, both activators such as V-Myb Avian Myeloblastosis Viral Oncogene Homolog (MYB) and steroid hormone receptors, as well as repressors such as growth factor independence 1 transcription repressor (GFI1), recruit LSD1 to specific genomic locations. LSD1 is part of a larger protein complex, containing, e.g., Co-RE 1 silencing transcription factor (CoREST) or nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD), which dictate the cell-specific chromatin remodeling. These complexes may also include DNMT1 and histone deacetylases 1, 2 and 3 (HDAC1, 2, and 3) activities, all of which contribute to maintaining or modifying the epigenetic state at that genomic site. Thus, an important property of LSD1 beyond its own enzymatic activity is its function as a scaffold for other epigenetic enzymes that are co-recruited to genomic sites. Among the many histone demethylases, LSD1 uniquely employs flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to oxidatively remove one or two methyl groups in the process producing H2O2 and formaldehyde. As such, FAD is an essential co-factor for LSD1 activity. The other 33 histone lysine demethylases, the Jumonji types, employ an iron-dependent mechanism to remove methyl groups from histone lysines.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">LSD1 is an essential gene; loss of LSD1 activity leads to early embryonic lethality. The protein is also needed for regulating the balance between self-renewal and proliferation. A conditional in vivo LSD1 knockdown (KD) using a doxycycline-inducible short hairpin LSD1 (shLSD1) established LSD1 as a central regulator of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitor cells. LSD1 KD resulted in profound but reversible thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia; monocyte numbers were increased. LSD1 KD for 27 days led to an increase in circulating multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and HSCs with a concomitant down-regulation of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) without affecting the size of the dormant HSC pool. Impaired self-renewal was observed in long term HSCs 12 weeks following LSD1 excision using an inducible Cre system (Mx1Cre mice&#xd7;Lsd1fl/fl mice), consistent with LSD1 inhibition driving differentiation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">LSD1 plays a key role in regulating the progression from pluripotency to terminal differentiation. LSD1 is recruited to &#x201c;high confidence&#x201d; promoters and super-enhancers of genes essential for normal development by the &#x201c;master&#x201d; transcription factors octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2), Nanog and the co-activator Mediator. Though not essential for maintenance of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) state, as part of the NuRD complex, LSD1 &#x201c;decommissions&#x201d; enhancers of genes directing the pluripotency program allowing ESC differentiation. LSD1 is essential for the complete shutdown of the ESC gene expression program as cells transition to more differentiated cell states. The role LSD1 plays in the ESC is phenomenologically similar to the essential role LSD1 plays during myeloid hematopoiesis, in which enhancers active in HSCs generating a stem-cell gene expression signature are also &#x201c;decommissioned&#x201d;, allowing commitment of progenitors to specific myeloid lineages. Enhancers essential for terminal differentiation in lineage-specific progenitor cells are poised for activation by H3K4me1 marks while promoters are characterized by progressive methylation of H3K4 culminating in H3K4me3. Enhancer H3K27 acetylation locks in transcriptional activation and lineage commitment. Consistent with the need for stable H3K4 methylation during differentiation, LSD1 expression decreases dramatically as myeloid differentiation proceeds to terminal cell states. The LSD1 enzyme sits at the apex of myeloid hematopoiesis. LSD1 prevents myeloid differentiation in stem and myeloid progenitor cells but is down-regulated as cells commit to specific myeloid lineages (erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic). The inhibition of LSD1 in acute myeloid leukemia cells causes a loss of stem cell potential (clonogenicity) and a concomitant induction of differentiation to a more mature monocytic immunophenotype. In mouse models of myeloproliferative neoplasm, treatment with LSD1 inhibitors reduces the mutant progenitor cell population consistent with the role LSD1 plays in sustaining the self-renewal phenotype.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As a key factor in regulating myeloid maturation, LSD1 is suitable as a target for a variety of myeloproliferative neoplasms. There are three major myeloproliferative neoplasms that may be treated with an LSD1 inhibitor: polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis (or myelofibrosis secondary to PV and ET); other MPNs are disclosed below and may also be treated by the methods disclosed herein. Other MPNs include All begin as clonal disorders as a consequence of somatic mutations occurring in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The clinical overlap among these related diseases is mirrored by their shared genetic spectrum of somatic mutations including mutations in JAK2, DNMT3A, MPL, CALR, and ASXL1. In mouse models of myelofibrosis (Jak2<sup>6V17F </sup>and Mpl<sup>W515L</sup>), inhibition of LSD1 causes a significant improvement in five parameters of disease: reduction in platelets, reduction in splenomegaly, reduction in red cell count, resolution of marrow fibrosis and reduction in mutant cell burden.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Among BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, primary myelofibrosis and post-PV/ET myelofibrosis (PPV-MF and PET-MF) are associated with the highest degree of morbidity and mortality, including progressive bone marrow (BM) fibrosis and resultant BM failure. Although the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib is now approved for the treatment of MF-associated splenomegaly and systemic symptoms, JAK inhibitor therapy does not reduce the population of JAK2-mutant cells in MPN patients. The limited ability of JAK inhibition to induce clinically meaningful molecular responses in MPN patients underscores the need for the development of more effective therapies for these JAK kinase/STAT-dependent malignancies.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Recent studies have shown that the lysine-specific histone demethylase, LSD1 (KDM1A), participates in the balance in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells between proliferation and differentiation in vivo by influencing state-specific gene expression patterns. In physiologic hematopoiesis, LSD1 is essential for normal myeloid differentiation affecting the erythroid, megakaryocytic and granulocytic lineages but not the monocytic/dendritic lineage. Small molecule inhibitors of LSD1 have shown promising results in preclinical models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and solid cancers and have recently entered clinical trials in AML. However, the role and requirement for LSD1 in the pathogenesis of MPNs and the therapeutic targeting of LSD1 in MPN is an area of current investigation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">WO 2012/107498 discloses the use of certain LSD1 inhibitors to treat the Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative disorders essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis, and polycythemia vera. US 2016/0257662 and US 2016/0237043 disclose compounds that inhibit LSD1. US 2019/0070172 discloses the utility of these compounds and others in the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms including ET, MF, and PV.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">There remains, however, a need for potent LSD1 inhibitors with demonstrated ability to treat myelofibrosis and other myeloproliferative neoplasms, and attendant symptoms, and achieve specific, clinically relevant endpoints in the treatment of myelofibrosis and other myeloproliferative neoplasms, while avoiding serious side effects such as severe thrombocytopenia.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the change in spleen volume of patients treated with LSD1 inhibitor Compound 1, from day 0 to day 84 of treatment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the change in MPN-10 scores of patients treated with LSD1 inhibitor Compound 1, from day 0 to day 84 of treatment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> compares treatment with LSD1 inhibitor Compound 1 to the Best Available Treatment (BAT), in terms of changes in spleen volume response (SVR) and total symptom score (TSS), from day 0 to day 84 of treatment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the change in inflammatory cytokine S100A9 at week 12 in the course of treatment with LSD1 inhibitor Compound 1</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the change in inflammatory cytokine RANTES at week 12 in the course of treatment with LSD1 inhibitor Compound 1</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the change in inflammatory cytokine IL-8 at week 12 in the course of treatment with LSD1 inhibitor Compound 1</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the change in circulating growth factor VEGF at week 12 in the course of treatment with LSD1 inhibitor Compound 1</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the change in circulating growth factor PDGF-BB at week 12 in the course of treatment with LSD1 inhibitor Compound 1.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic representation of a therapeutic theory of LSD1 inhibition by Compound 1.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the percent of F-cells in six patients treated with LSD1 inhibitor Compound 1.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows absolute change in (a) MPN SAF TSS and (b) spleen volume from (i) Day 0 to (ii) 12 weeks.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows the progress of treatment for a representative patient.

These centers are designated by the symbols &#x201c;R&#x201d; or &#x201c;S,&#x201d; depending on the configuration of substituents around the chiral carbon atom. It should be understood that the invention encompasses all stereochemical isomeric forms, including diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms, as well as d-isomers and 1-isomers, and mixtures thereof. Individual stereoisomers of compounds can be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials which contain chiral centers or by preparation of mixtures of enantiomeric products followed by separation such as conversion to a mixture of diastereomers followed by separation or recrystallization, chromatographic techniques, direct separation of enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns, or any other appropriate method known in the art. Starting compounds of particular stereochemistry are either commercially available or can be made and resolved by techniques known in the art. Additionally, the compounds disclosed herein may exist as geometric isomers. The present invention includes all cis, trans, syn, anti, entgegen (E), and zusammen (Z) isomers as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. Additionally, compounds may exist as tautomers; all tautomeric isomers are provided by this invention. Additionally, the compounds disclosed herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0103">The term &#x201c;disease&#x201d; as used herein is intended to be generally synonymous, and is used interchangeably with, the terms &#x201c;disorder&#x201d; and &#x201c;condition&#x201d; (as in medical condition), in that all reflect an abnormal condition of the human or animal body or of one of its parts that impairs normal functioning, is typically manifested by distinguishing signs and symptoms, and causes the human or animal to have a reduced duration or quality of life.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0104">The term &#x201c;combination therapy&#x201d; means the administration of two or more therapeutic agents to treat a therapeutic condition or disorder described in the present disclosure. Such administration encompasses co-administration of these therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single capsule having a fixed ratio of active ingredients or in multiple, separate capsules for each active ingredient. In addition, such administration also encompasses use of each type of therapeutic agent in a sequential manner. In either case, the treatment regimen will provide beneficial effects of the drug combination in treating the conditions or disorders described herein.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0105">The term &#x201c;therapeutically acceptable&#x201d; refers to those compounds (or salts, prodrugs, tautomers, zwitterionic forms, etc.) which are suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, and allergic response, are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and are effective for their intended use.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0106">As used herein, reference to &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; of a patient is intended to include prophylaxis. The term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; means all mammals including humans. Examples of patients include humans, cows, dogs, cats, goats, sheep, pigs, and rabbits. Preferably, the patient is a human.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0107">The term &#x201c;prodrug&#x201d; refers to a compound that is made more active in vivo. Certain compounds disclosed herein may also exist as prodrugs, as described in <i>Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism: Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Enzymology </i>(Testa, Bernard and Mayer, Joachim M. Wiley-VHCA, Zurich, Switzerland 2003). Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are structurally modified forms of the compound that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compound. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compound by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to a compound when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the compound, or parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. A wide variety of prodrug derivatives are known in the art, such as those that rely on hydrolytic cleavage or oxidative activation of the prodrug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound which is administered as an ester (the &#x201c;prodrug&#x201d;), but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity. Additional examples include peptidyl derivatives of a compound.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0108">The compounds disclosed herein can exist as therapeutically acceptable salts. The present invention includes compounds listed above in the form of salts, including acid addition salts. Suitable salts include those formed with both organic and inorganic acids. Such acid addition salts will normally be pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be of utility in the preparation and purification of the compound in question. Basic addition salts may also be formed and be pharmaceutically acceptable. For a more complete discussion of the preparation and selection of salts, refer to <i>Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use </i>(Stahl, P. Heinrich. Wiley-VCHA, Zurich, Switzerland, 2002).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0109">The term &#x201c;therapeutically acceptable salt,&#x201d; as used herein, represents salts or zwitterionic forms of the compounds disclosed herein which are water or oil-soluble or dispersible and therapeutically acceptable as defined herein. The salts can be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or separately by reacting the appropriate compound in the form of the free base with a suitable acid. Representative acid addition salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, L-ascorbate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate (besylate), bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, digluconate, formate, fumarate, gentisate, glutarate, glycerophosphate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (isethionate), lactate, maleate, malonate, DL-mandelate, mesitylenesulfonate, methanesulfonate, naphthylenesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylproprionate, phosphonate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, pyroglutamate, succinate, sulfonate, tartrate, L-tartrate, trichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, para-toluenesulfonate (p-tosylate), and undecanoate.

A compound may be a polymorph, solvate, or hydrate of a salt or of the free base or acid.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0113">The term &#x201c;myeloproliferative neoplasm&#x201d; (MPN) refers to blood cancers that occur when the body makes too many white or red blood cells, or platelets as a consequence of somatic mutations that activate the hormone signaling pathways that control the production of these types of blood cells. They are &#x201c;clonal diseases of hematopoietic stem cells&#x201d; given that the neoplastic cells arise from a single mutant clone arising from bone marrow cells (Campregher et al. Rev Bras Hermatol Hemoter. 2012; 34(2):150-5). MPNs include polycythemia vera (PV), myelofibrosis including primary myelofibrosis (PMF, including, in certain embodiments, both the prefibrotic/early stage and the overt fibrotic stage) and post-PV/ET myelofibrosis (PPV-MF and PET-MF), essential thrombocythemia (ET), chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL-NOS), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), as well as other unclassifiable MPNs.

Accordingly, provided herein are pharmaceutical formulations which comprise one or more of certain compounds disclosed herein, or one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, prodrugs, amides, or solvates thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be &#x201c;acceptable&#x201d; in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Any of the well-known techniques, carriers, and excipients may be used as suitable and as understood in the art; e.g., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be manufactured in any manner known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or compression processes.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0116">The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarticular, intraadiposal, intraarterial, intracranial, intralesional, intranasal, intraocular, intrapericardial, intraperitoneal, intrapleural, intraprostatical, intrarectal, intrathecal, intratracheal, intratumoral, intraumbilical, intravaginal, intravesicular, intravitreal, and intramedullary), intraperitoneal, rectal, topical (including, without limitation, dermal, buccal, sublingual, vaginal, rectal, nasal, otic, and ocular), local, mucosal, sublingual, subcutaneous, transmucosal, transdermal, transbuccal, transdermal, and vaginal; liposomal, in cremes, in lipid compositions, via a catheter, via a lavage, via continuous infusion, via infusion, via inhalation, via injection, via local delivery, via localized perfusion, bathing target cells directly, or any combination thereof. Administration although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Typically, these methods include the step of bringing into association a compound disclosed herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide, prodrug or solvate thereof (&#x201c;active ingredient&#x201d;) with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0117">Formulations of the compounds disclosed herein suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as hard or soft capsules, wafers, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a syrup, elixir, solution, or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion, a water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or a compound dispersed in a liposome. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0118">Pharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally include tablets, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Tablets may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with binders, inert diluents, or lubricating, surface active or dispersing agents. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated to provide delayed, slowed, or controlled release or absorption of the active ingredient therein. Compositions may further comprise an agent that enhances solubility or dispersability. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0119">Depending on the route of administration, the compounds, or granules or particles thereof, may be coated in a material to protect the compounds from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compounds.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0120">The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion, either to the body or to the site of a disease or wound. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in powder form or in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or sterile pyrogen-free water, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0121">Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. To administer the therapeutic compound by other than parenteral administration, it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with a material to prevent its inactivation (for example, via liposomal formulation).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0122">It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations described above may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example, those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0123">Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as herein below recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient. In certain embodiments, a formulation disclosed herein is administered once a day. However, the formulations may also be formulated for administration at any frequency of administration, including once a week, once every 5 days, once every 3 days, once every 2 days, once a day, twice or more a day, etc. Such dosing frequency is also maintained for a varying duration of time depending on the therapeutic regimen. The duration of a particular therapeutic regimen may vary from one-time dosing to a regimen that extends for months or years. Dose and dosing regimen are discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0124">The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Similarly, the precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. The specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diets, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the precise disorder being treated, and the severity of the indication or condition being treated. In addition, the route of administration may vary depending on the condition and its severity.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0125">In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one of the compounds described herein (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or prodrug thereof) in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein is inflammation, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-inflammatory agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Alternatively, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may only have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). There is even the possibility that two compounds, one of the compounds described herein and a second compound may together achieve the desired therapeutic effect that neither alone could achieve. Alternatively, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. By way of example only, in a treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia or sickle cell anemia involving administration of one of the compounds described herein, increased therapeutic benefit may result by also providing the patient with another therapeutic agent for sickle cell anemia or for acute myelogenous leukemia. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the two agents may have synergistic therapeutic effects in a patient.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0126">Effective combination therapy may be achieved with a single composition or pharmacological formulation that includes both agents, or with two distinct compositions or formulations, at the same time, wherein one composition includes a compound of the present disclosure, and the other includes the second agent(s). Alternatively, the therapy may precede or follow the other agent treatment by intervals ranging from minutes to months. Administration of the compounds of the present disclosure to a patient will follow general protocols for the administration of pharmaceuticals, taking into account the toxicity, if any, of the drug. It is expected that the treatment cycles would be repeated as necessary.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0127">Specific, non-limiting examples of possible combination therapies include use of compounds disclosed herein with the following agents and classes of agents: agents that inhibit DNA methyltransferases such as decitabine or 5&#x2032;-aza-cytadine; agents that inhibit the activity of histone deacetylases, histone de-sumoylases, histone de-ubiquitinases, or histone phosphatases such as hydroxyurea; antisense RNAs that might inhibit the expression of other components of the protein complex bound at the DR site in the gamma globin promoter; agents that inhibit the action of Klf1 or the expression of KLF1; agents that inhibit the action of Bcl11a or the expression of BCL11A; and agents that inhibit cell cycle progression such as hydroxyurea, ara-C or daunorubicin; agents that induce differentiation in leukemic cells such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA); and JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib (Jakafi/Jakavi), fedratinib (Inrebic), cerdulatinib (PRT062070), gandotinib (LY-2784544), lestaurtinib (CEP-701), momelotinib (GS-0387, CYT-387), and pacritinib (SB1518).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0128">Thus, in another aspect, the present invention provides methods for treating diseases or disorders in a human or animal subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to said subject an amount of a compound disclosed herein effective to reduce or prevent said disorder in the subject in combination with at least one additional agent for the treatment of said disorder that is known in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Compounds</heading><p id="p-0118" num="0129">Examples of LSD1-inhibiting compounds which may be used in the methods disclosed herein include the compounds below.

The MPN-SAF is a validated clinical assessment form for the most common symptoms of myeloproliferative neoplasms, in which patients self-reports their score, on a scale of 1-10, of various common symptoms, where 1 is the most favorable or the symptom is absent, and 10 is the least favorable or the symptom is the worst imaginable. See, e.g., Scherber R et al., The Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF): International Prospective Validation and Reliability Trial in 402 patients,&#x201d; Blood 118(2):401-08 (2014). Either the full or abbreviated forms may be administered to the patient. In the abbreviated version, a &#x201c;total symptom score&#x201d; (TSS) may be calculated from the ten most clinically relevant symptoms from the 17-item MPN-SAF: worst fatigue, concentration, early satiety, inactivity, night sweats, itching, bone pain, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and fever. The MPN-SAF TSS thus has a possible range of 0 to 100. Quality of life scores are defined as &#x201c;clinically deficient&#x201d; when they rate as at least 4 of 10; &#x201c;moderate&#x201d; if symptoms are rated as &#x2265;4 of 10 or &#x2264;6 of 10; and &#x201c;severe&#x201d; if symptoms are rated as &#x2265;7 of 10. For patients who complete at least six of these 10 items on the BFI and MPN-SAF, the MPN TSS is computed as the average of the observed items multiplied by 10 to achieve a 0-to-100 scale. See, e.g., Emanuel R M et al., &#x201c;Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) symptom assessment form total symptom score: prospective international assessment of an abbreviated symptom burden scoring system among patients with MPNs,&#x201d; J Clin Oncol 30(33):4098-103 (2012).</p><p id="p-0186" num="0217">In certain embodiments, the total symptom score (MPN-SAF:TSS) is reduced by at least 50%.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0218">In certain embodiments, said patient-reported survey is the Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MF-SAF).

Patients demonstrating clinical benefit could resume treatment for additional 12 week cycles. With transition to a Phase 2b study, changes supported by the earlier pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and safety assessments were implemented, including: an increased starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d with larger titration increments; a 168-day (24 week) duration of treatment, with continuous dosing via removal of the washout period; elimination of PK and drug concentration sampling; and, a reduced visit schedule.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0240">This study was conducted at multiple sites. Up to 50 patients, eighteen years of age or older, with high-risk myelofibrosis were treated. The primary objectives included safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK; Phase 1/2A only) and spleen volume reduction (SVR). Exploratory endpoints included improvement in constitutional symptoms demonstrated by reduction in total symptoms scores (TSS) derived from the MPN-SAF in Phase 1/2A and using the MPN-SAF TSS instrument in Phase 2B, cytokines, and bone marrow (BM) fibrosis. Key inclusion criteria included: high- or intermediate-2 risk myelofibrosis; per the Investigator's judgment have failed (refractory or resistant to, inadequately controlled by or intolerant of), or are not a candidate for, available approved therapy including ruxolitinib; platelet count &#x2265;100K/&#x3bc;L; and, circulating blasts &#x2264;10%.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0241">Dosing was tailored using platelet count as a biomarker for the effect of bomedemstat activity on megakaryocyte function and activity. The megakaryocytes, the cell in bone marrow and elsewhere that make platelets, are central to the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia. In both conditions, somatic mutations in bone marrow stem cells result in mature megakaryocytes that produce excess platelets and biologically active proteins that alter the bone marrow niche as well as spill into the circulation resulting in symptoms characteristic of these conditions such as itching and fatigue.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0242">One strategy to reduce the excess products of megakaryocytes is to target megakaryocyte maturation and function. The effectiveness of a treatment targeting the megakaryocyte may be quantified by measuring the products of megakaryocytes, e.g., platelets in circulation or inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in plasma or serum.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0243">Dosing of such a treatment can be made more precise by titrating the dose to lower the platelet count to a specific range.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0244">In the Phase 1/2a portion of the study, patients started at the presumed sub-therapeutic dose of 0.25 mg/kg/d. Dose-adjustments were made weekly (the lifespan of a human platelet) with dose-titration, either upward or downward, contingent on platelet values at the time of evaluation. Upward titrations were made in increments of 0.125 or 0.0625 mg/kg/d as shown below. Downward titrations were made in decrements of 50% of the current dose. The calculated effective dose was anticipated to be &#x2dc;1 mg/kg QD though this did not represent an upper limit; the dose needed to achieve the optimal therapeutic effect was expected to vary among patients and possibly change over time.

A dose-response curve was subsequently generated that provided a titration algorithm to adjust dose to achieve a target platelet count of between 50,000-75,000 platelets per microliter (k/uL), devised with a view to minimizing the probability of severe thrombocytopenia. Excluding both the highest and lowest doses (total daily doses of 4 mg and 100 mg), the mean total daily dose of Compound 1 needed to achieve a platelet count in the target range was 78.3 mg (S.D. 13.8, range 53-90 mg) or the equivalent of approximately 0.7 to 1.2 mg/kg/d. Accordingly, to enable patients to reach more quickly the optimal dose while still maintaining an adequate safety margin, a new Compound 1 starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg QD was selected for all patients entering the Phase 2B portion of the study.

Bone marrow biopsies and imaging studies of the abdomen were conducted prior to treatment and during the washout period after 12 weeks of dosing. Grading of myelofibrosis was performed centrally using the 2016 revised World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasia (Arber et al., 2016); image reading was also performed centrally. The Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) was self-administered at Baseline and weekly from Day 0 through the End of Study (EoS) Visit.

In the patients deemed evaluable for this preliminary analysis (N=14, those who completed the 85-day cycle and had imaging studies obtained within the first 2 weeks of washout available), Compound 1 had a profound effect on myelofibrosis symptoms. Spleen volumes generally decreased in the patients evaluated so far, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. At week 12, 7 (50%) had a decrease in spleen volume; at week 24, 6 (75%) had a decrease in spleen volume, 1 (12.5%) of these by 35%.

At week 12, 11 (79%) had reduction in symptom score, 3 of these (21%) by &#x2265;50%; at week 24, 8 (89%) had a decrease in symptom score, 4 (44%) of these by &#x2265;50%.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0250">When compared with Best Available Treatment (BAT), e.g., as in the PERSIST-2 clinical trial (see, e.g., clinical trial no.

Of 18 patients enrolled in Phase 1b/2a, 3 presented at day 0 with Hb&#x3e;10 g/dL and 15 had grade 2 or 3 anemia, with Hb&#x3c;10 g/dL. Of the 3 with Hb&#x3e;10 g/dL, 1 improved (defined as an increase of Hb&#x3e;1 g/dL), 2 worsened (a decrease of Hb&#x3e;1 g/dL) at day 84 in the course of treatment with Compound 1. Of the 15 patients with Hb&#x3c;10 g/dL, 9 were transfusion-dependent, and 6 transfusion-independent. Of the 9 transfusion-dependent patients, at day 84, 1 became transfusion-independent and had improved Hb of &#x3e;1 g/dL, 8 had maintained stable transfusion frequency, and one had increased transfusion frequency. Of the 6 transfusion-independent patients, 1 improved, 3 remained stable, and 2 worsened (1 became transfusion dependent; 1 experienced Hb drop by &#x3e;1 g/dL. At the same time, Compound 1 reduced the percent of F-cells, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> (in which patients are arbitrarily numbered and do not necessarily correspond to patient numbering in previous figures). Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is an established serological indicator of cancer, and fetal hemopoiesis, which does not occur in the spleen of healthy adults, has been observed in the spleen in myeloproliferative neoplasms.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0253">Changes in bone marrow fibrosis grade were also observed. Of the 13 patients to date with reported bone marrow biopsies (Day 0 to Day 84 or EoT), 2 (15%) had improvements of &#x2265;1 grade, 8 (62%) had a stable fibrosis score, and 3 (23%) progressed by 1 Grade.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0254">With respect to symptom scores, improvements were generally dose-dependent and rapid, e.g., scores of fatigue improved in 8 of the first 16 patients within 14 days. These changes were observed at what represented the lowest two doses for all but one of these 16 patients. Similar to what has been reported in studies of JAK inhibitors in patients with MF, there was no correlation between improvements in symptomatology and changes in spleen volume. The reductions in spleen volumes were compromised in several ways. Patients were deliberately treated with an initial dose that was expected to be sub-optimal and most did not achieve a platelet count in the target range until halfway into the 85 day cycle. Further, all patients had follow-up imaging studies during the washout period&#x2014;it became readily apparent by physical exam that spleen volumes increased. In the Phase 2b portion of the study, the washout period has been eliminated and the dosing regimen has been improved to more rapidly achieve the target platelet count and to maintain the patient in that range safely for longer.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0255">Treatment with Compound 1 reduced platelet counts in all patients. The change in platelet production was tightly associated with exposures to Compound 1&#x2014;platelet counts could be titrated with reasonable precision. The kinetics of these changes were congruent with the known life span of a human platelet&#x2014;7 days. With the cessation of treatment, platelet counts rebounded robustly indicating the reversibility of the anti-thrombopoietic effect of Compound 1 once drug has cleared. As with rat and dog, granulocyte production appeared less sensitive to LSD1 inhibition; peripheral granulocyte counts were lower on treatment, lymphocytes counts were unchanged and monocyte counts were generally modestly elevated. These observations are consistent with what was observed in both the non-clinical studies and in the other clinical studies.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0256">Safety. Throughout the course of the study, there were no deaths or dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Four SAEs attributed to Compound 1 (all Grade 3), including painful splenomegaly, headache, nausea and vomiting, and heart failure. There were 139 AEs of all grades attributed to Compound 1. The most common AEs across the 31 subjects from both of the above studies were thrombocytopenia (11 subjects, 35%), anemia (3 subjects, 10%) and nausea (1, 3%). The most common grade 3/4 AEs attributed to Compound 1 were Anemia (6 subjects, 19%) and neutropenia (3 subjects, 10%).</p><p id="p-0215" num="0257">The foregoing demonstrates that in a heterogeneous population of patients with MF with limited therapeutic options, Compound 1 was well tolerated, appeared safe and was effective in reducing spleen volumes and substantially improving symptom scores in a majority of patients.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 2: Phase 2B Clinical Trials in Myelofibrosis</heading><p id="p-0216" num="0258">A multi-center, open label, dose-range finding study to assess the safety, optimally effective dosing rules, steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Compound 1 orally once daily in patients with myelofibrosis was conducted in a Phase 1/2a study.<ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0259">Primary objectives were to evaluate, in MF patients the effect of Compound 1 on: Safety and tolerability</li>        <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0260">Pharmacokinetics (Phase 1/2a only)</li>        <li id="ul0016-0003" num="0261">Reduction in spleen volume</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0217" num="0262">Exploratory Objectives (some or all may be analyzed) included evaluating, in MF patients treated with Compound 1:<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0263">The adequacy of the treatment regimen in producing a pharmacodynamic effect</li>        <li id="ul0018-0002" num="0264">Hematologic response (Hematologic parameters, all of which may be assessed during treatment or after drug has been discontinued for a specified interval, may comprise: complete blood count (CBC) including platelets, red and white blood cell (RBC and WBC) and circulating blast cell counts; cellular composition of the bone marrow (% blasts); and, the induction of fetal hemoglobin)</li>        <li id="ul0018-0003" num="0265">Improvement in constitutional symptoms assessed using the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF)</li>        <li id="ul0018-0004" num="0266">Reduction in bone marrow fibrosis score</li>        <li id="ul0018-0005" num="0267">Relationship between dose and plasma trough concentrations over time (Phase 1/2a only)</li>        <li id="ul0018-0006" num="0268">The impact of therapy on disease burden as measured by malignant-cell specific nucleic markers (DNA or RNA; nucleic markers include RNA and/or DNA mutations detected by sequencing or other nucleic assay methods)</li>        <li id="ul0018-0007" num="0269">The effect of treatment on cytokine profiles (cytokine quantification)</li>        <li id="ul0018-0008" num="0270">The relationship between genetic aberrations in malignant cells and pharmacodynamic response</li>        <li id="ul0018-0009" num="0271">And to correlate conventional clinical responses with exploratory assessments of response</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0218" num="0272">Compound 1 was supplied as capsules in multiple strengths.

Considerations for a safe and therapeutic starting dose included chronic toxicology studies, in conjunction with the clinical experience of the patients who have received Compound 1 to date in prior studies. In association with this therapeutic goal, and PK modeling, a starting dose (Ds) of 0.25 mg/kg/d was selected for the Phase 1/2A portion of this study. All patients, however, required multiple up-titrations of Compound 1 from this starting dose to render platelets in the target platelet count range, suggesting the Ds should be higher. A dose-response curve was subsequently generated that provided a titration algorithm to adjust dose to achieve a target platelet count of between 50,000-75,000 platelets per microliter (k/uL), devised with a view to minimizing the probability of severe thrombocytopenia. Excluding both the highest and lowest doses, the mean total daily dose of Compound 1 needed to achieve a platelet count in the target range was 78.3 mg (S.D. 13.8, range 53-90 mg) or the equivalent of approximately 0.7 to 1.2 mg/kg/d. Accordingly, to enable patients to more quickly reach the optimum dose while still maintaining an adequate safety margin, a new Compound 1 starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg QD was selected for all patients entering the Phase 2b portion of the study.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0274">This study design used the alternative model-based approach appropriate for a targeted, non-cytotoxic drug such as Compound 1 in which there is no observed monotonic relationship between exposure and toxicity (Le Tourneau, et al., 2009). Specifically, this study employed the dose-toxicity model developed in rat and dog relating the plasma concentration of drug 24 hours after last dose (C<sub>min</sub>) at steady state needed to inhibit platelet production.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0275">As there is no evidence in non-clinical studies of acute toxicity with Compound 1, even at extremely high doses (human equivalent dose (HED) &#x2dc;20-40 mg/kg), it was believed that two sentinel patients would be sufficient to establish the acute safety of the starting dose. Thus, two sentinel patients were dosed sequentially at the original Ds of 0.25 mg/kg/d for 7 days and monitored twice-weekly before any additional patients were treated. Since this study was not investigating the effect of a cytotoxic agent, enrolling patients on a rolling basis post-establishing safety via dosing of the sentinel patients was deemed appropriate. Patients were enrolled and treated on a rolling basis.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0276">To ensure patient safety, a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) performed monthly reviews of safety parameters and pharmacodynamic markers to draw conclusions around the safety and pharmacodynamic effect of Compound 1. The DSMC also reviewed patient dose titrations and recommended dose adjustments, and assessed the necessity of the Day 3 visit. The DSMC convened within 4 days post-completion of 7 days of treatment for each of the sentinel patients and determined it was safe for:</p><p id="p-0223" num="0000">1. Each sentinel patient to continue dosing (note: dosing was not interrupted pending this review), and<br/>2. Additional patients to begin treatment with Compound 1.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Study Conduct</heading><p id="p-0224" num="0277">This study initiated as a Phase 1/2a study assessing the safety of the starting dose, an 85 day duration of treatment, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of Compound 1, with transition to a Phase 2b study incorporating changes supported by the earlier pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and safety assessments. This study consisted of two treatment periods: the Initial Treatment Period (ITP), followed by the Additional Treatment Period (ATP). Patients commenced enrolment in the Phase 2b portion of the study, in which the ITP has been extended such that patients were treated daily for 169 days. The ATP, also extended, offered treatment to qualifying patients for an additional 169 days.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0278">Initial Treatment Period. During the ITP, patients initially returned for study assessments twice weekly for the first week (ITP Days 0, 3 and 7); post-dosing of 3 patients at the new Ds, the DSMC convened to assess the necessity of the Day 3 visit. Patients returned weekly for the next 7 weeks (ITP Days 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 and 56), at least bi-weekly for 8 weeks (ITP Days 70, 84, 98 and 112) and then monthly for 8 weeks (ITP Days 140 and 168). It was anticipated that by Week 8 (Day 56) patients will have achieved a stable dose, with weekly titrations no longer necessary. For the exceptional patient whose dose had not stabilized, weekly visits continued at the PI's discretion (note: bi-weekly visits may also continue post Day 112). On Days 84 and 168, patients underwent abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computerized tomography (CT) if the patient was not a candidate for MRI. On Day 168, bone marrow sampling was also required. Prior to or at the Day 168 visit, but ideally at the Day 140 visit for logistical purposes, a &#x2018;qualification&#x2019; assessment was made to determine whether the patient is deriving clinical benefit (defined as not meeting progressive disease criteria and safely tolerating Compound 1; this definition applies throughout document and will not be repeated with each reference to clinical benefit). Such patients qualified for entry into the ATP, a transition which was anticipated to occur without interruption in dosing. Patients not deriving clinical benefit, or who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or clinical improvement (CI) and subsequently relapse the equivalent of treatment failures, discontinued Compound 1 and undergo End of Treatment (EoT), pre-End of Study (pre-EoS) and End of Study (EoS) visits.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0279">Additional Treatment Period. In the ATP, treatment was expected to continue for an additional 169 days in those patients deriving clinical benefit, as determined by the Principal Investigator. Qualifying patients returned for study assessments monthly (ATP Days 0, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140 and 168). It was anticipated that patients continuing in the ATP will have already achieved a stable dose, with frequent titrations no longer necessary. For the exceptional patient whose dose had not stabilized, bi-weekly visits continued at the PI's discretion. On Day 168, patients underwent the same procedures and assessments as in the ITP, including MRI or CT (if the patient was not a candidate for MRI), and bone marrow sampling. Prior to or at the Day 168 visit, but ideally at the Day 140 visit for logistical purposes, a &#x2018;qualification&#x2019; assessment was made to determine whether the patient is continuing to derive clinical benefit. Such patients thereby qualified for re-entry into the ATP, which is iterative; patients continued to receive Compound 1 for as long as they continued to qualify.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0280">Certain patients enrolled in prior clinical trials with Compound 1 would complete their current Treatment Phase, in accordance with that protocol, prior to initiating the extended ATP disclosed herein. Such patients did not undergo any washout period between Treatment Periods, but the assessments prescribed during washout were still performed with MRI (or CT) and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy required at the Day 84 visit. For these patients, the &#x2018;qualification&#x2019; assessment occurred at the study visit immediately preceding the Day 84 visit.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0281">The assessments that were prescribed during the washout were still done despite the elimination of the washout. All patients underwent follow-up period visits, including an EoT visit within approximately 2 days of last dose, a pre-EOS visit approximately 14 days post last dose, and an EoS visit approximately 28 days post last dose. Patients that did not enter the ATP, or discontinue early, entered the follow-up period beginning with an EoT visit within approximately 2 days of the decision to end treatment.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0282">Patients were followed closely throughout the study for both Adverse Events (AEs) and signs of toxicity by frequent monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms and by peripheral blood and urine analyses. Pharmacodynamic effects were closely monitored by frequent hematology assessments of peripheral blood, and requisite bone marrow aspirates and biopsies. Throughout dosing, transfusions were administered if needed in accordance with standard institutional guidelines.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Dosing</heading><p id="p-0230" num="0283">Through the use of dose titration, all patients were dosed to the estimated dose of Compound 1 needed in humans that provides sufficient exposure to inhibit normal hematopoiesis safely for a portion of the 24-hour dosing cycle (designated the Dpi).</p><p id="p-0231" num="0284">Initial Treatment Period (ITP). Treatment began on Day 0 at the Ds of 0.5 mg/kg QD for all patients entering the Phase 2b portion of the study. Dose-adjustments could be made at each clinic visit (with the exception of Day 3), with dose-titration, either upward or downward, contingent on the comparison of hematology values from the prior visit, as dictated by the rules below. The Dpi was anticipated to be &#x2264;1.2 mg/kg QD; however, this was not the upper limit for titration purposes as the dose needed to achieve a therapeutic effect will vary among patients and may change over time. The platelet titration target expected to be associated with a clinically significant therapeutic effect was a platelet count of &#x2265;50,000 to &#x2264;75,000/&#x3bc;L (50-75&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>/L).

Important: ANC &#x2265;0.5&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>/L (500/&#x3bc;L) and Hgb &#x3e;8 g/dL (80 g/L) were needed for up-titration. For ANC or Hgb values below these thresholds, the current dose was maintained or adjusted depending on the platelet count per Table 4 below.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00005" num="00005"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="133pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Platelet (Plt Assessment)</entry><entry>Titration and Re-challenge Rules</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Plt Count</entry><entry>% Plt</entry><entry/><entry>Titration</entry><entry>Re-challenge</entry></row><row><entry>(&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>/L)</entry><entry>Reduction</entry><entry>Titration?*</entry><entry>Rule*</entry><entry>Rule&#xa5;</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>&#x2265;90</entry><entry>&#x3c;50% from</entry><entry>Up-titrate</entry><entry>Add 0.2</entry><entry>N/A</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>previous</entry><entry/><entry>mg/kg/d</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>visit&#xa7;</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2265;90</entry><entry>&#x2265;50% from</entry><entry>Up-titrate</entry><entry>Add 0.1</entry><entry>N/A</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>previous</entry><entry/><entry>mg/kg/d</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>visit&#xa7;</entry></row><row><entry>40-89</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>Maintain</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>N/A</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>current dose</entry></row><row><entry>25-39</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>Down-titrate</entry><entry>Decrease</entry><entry>N/A</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>current mg/kg</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>dose by 25%&#x3a6;</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2009;&#x3c;25</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>HOLD</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>At 50% of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>DOSE</entry><entry/><entry>previous</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>dose when</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>platelets</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>return</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>to &#x3e;50**</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00010">*The DSMC may recommend up- or down-titrations that are not in concordance with the above.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00011">**Re-challenge at 50% of the previous mg/kg dose.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00012">&#xa5;Upon re-challenge, all of the above rules reapply.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00013">&#xa7;Note if a platelet count increases since the previous visit the &#x201c;&#x3c;&#x201d; rule should be followed.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="left" id="FOO-00014">&#x3d5;Administer 75% of the previous mg/kg dose, which reflects a 25% dose reduction.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0234" num="0286">Dose reductions could be made at any time in consultation with the Medical Monitor, should an AE requiring a dose reduction occur.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0287">Additional Treatment Period (ATP): Qualifying patients would &#x2018;re-start&#x2019; Compound 1 on ATP Day 0, with dose titration continuing as per the Titration Rules table above; there was no interruption in dosing (i.e., Day 168=Day 0 of new ATP).
