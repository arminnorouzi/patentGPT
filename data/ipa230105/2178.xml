In such a sheet feeding apparatus, if the feed roller is in contact with the sheet for a long time, the oil contained in a rubber material forming an outer circumferential portion of the roller may ooze out onto the sheet, which may cause image defects in the subsequent printing operation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2018-24513 discloses a document feeding apparatus including a pickup roller that sends out paper while a motor rotates in a normal direction and the pickup roller is separated from the paper while the motor rotates in a reverse direction. According to a sheet feeding apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2010-64805, when a sheet feed cassette is attached to an apparatus body, a motor rotates in a normal direction to have a sheet bundle placed on a lift plate contact a pickup roller, and when the sheet feeding operation is ended, the motor rotates in a reverse direction to separate the sheet bundle from the pickup roller.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the configurations disclosed in the above documents, it was necessary to rotate the motor in the reverse direction with sufficient drive amount to separate the pickup roller from the paper. However, various drawbacks occur as the time for driving the motor in the reverse direction extends, such as the elongation of period of generation of operation noise or reduction of life of the motor.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a sheet feeding apparatus and an image forming apparatus that can

reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic drawing illustrating an image forming apparatus <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment. The image forming apparatus <b>1</b> is a laser beam printer adopting an electrophotographic system that forms monochromatic toner images. The image forming apparatus <b>1</b> includes a sheet feeder <b>2</b> for feeding sheets serving as recording materials, and an image forming unit <b>5</b> that forms images on sheets. Recording materials can be plain paper, thick paper, plastic films, cloth, sheet materials subjected to surface treatment such as coated paper, special-shaped sheet material such as envelopes and index paper, and various other sheets having different sizes and materials.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The image forming unit <b>5</b> includes a processing cartridge P, a laser scanner <b>52</b> and a transfer roller <b>53</b>. When an image forming command is entered to the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>, the image forming unit <b>5</b> starts an image forming operation by an electrophotographic process. That is, a photosensitive drum <b>51</b> provided in the processing cartridge P starts to rotate, and a charging unit charges a surface of the drum uniformly. The laser scanner <b>52</b> irradiates the photosensitive drum <b>51</b> with a laser beam and exposes the photosensitive drum <b>51</b> based on image information entered to the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>, to draw an electrostatic latent image on the drum surface. The latent image is developed using developer supplied from a developer container to form a toner image on the photosensitive drum <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In parallel with this process, a sheet S is fed from the sheet feeder <b>2</b>. The sheet feeder <b>2</b> includes a feed roller <b>211</b> that feeds the sheet S supported on a lift plate <b>31</b> of a cassette <b>3</b> that can be drawn out of a casing of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>. The sheet S fed by the sheet feeder <b>2</b> is conveyed via a conveyance roller pair <b>4</b> to a transfer portion which is a nip portion between the photosensitive drum <b>51</b> and the transfer roller <b>53</b>. In the transfer portion, a bias voltage having an opposite polarity as normal charge polarity of toner is applied to the transfer roller <b>53</b>, by which the toner image borne on the photosensitive drum <b>51</b> is transferred to the sheet S.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A fixing unit <b>6</b> forms a fixing nip by a heating unit <b>61</b>, which is composed of a fixing film and a ceramic heater serving as a heating element arranged on an inner circumferential side of the fixing film, and a pressure roller <b>62</b> in pressure contact with the heating unit <b>61</b>. While the sheet S passes through the fixing nip, the toner image on the sheet is heated and pressed, by which toner is melted and fixed to have the unfixed image permanently fixed to the sheet S. The sheet S having passed through the fixing unit <b>6</b> is discharged via a sheet discharge path <b>7</b> to an exterior of the device by a sheet discharge roller pair <b>8</b> and stacked on a sheet discharge tray <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present embodiment uses the image forming unit <b>5</b> serving as a direct transfer-type electrophotographic unit as the image forming unit for forming images on sheets. However, an intermediate transfer-type electrophotographic unit for transferring a toner image formed on a photosensitive member via an intermediate transfer body such as an intermediate transfer belt to a sheet can also be used as the image forming unit. Further, an inkjet-type image forming unit for forming an image on a sheet by discharging ink through nozzles can also be used as the image forming unit, for example.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Sheet Feeder</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A detailed configuration of the sheet feeder <b>2</b> serving as a sheet feeding apparatus according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the sheet feeder <b>2</b> viewed in a width direction, that is, a direction orthogonal to a feeding direction, of the sheet fed by the sheet feeder <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sheet feeder <b>2</b> includes a feeding frame <b>22</b>, a feed roller unit <b>21</b> and a separation roller <b>24</b>. The feeding frame <b>22</b> is fixed to a frame member of the image forming apparatus and constitutes a frame member of the sheet feeding apparatus according to the present embodiment. The feed roller unit <b>21</b> and the separation roller <b>24</b> are supported on the feeding frame <b>22</b>. The cassette <b>3</b> is a sheet storage portion of the present embodiment for storing sheets and can be opened and closed with respect to a body of the image forming apparatus, in other words, can be moved with respect to the feeding frame <b>22</b>, wherein opening and closing of the cassette is configured to be detected by a cassette open/close sensor <b>74</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The feed roller unit <b>21</b> is a unit including the feed roller <b>211</b>, a conveyance roller <b>212</b>, a roller holder <b>213</b> and an idler gear <b>214</b>. The feed roller <b>211</b> and the conveyance roller <b>212</b> are held rotatably by the roller holder <b>213</b> serving as a retaining member. The roller holder <b>213</b> is capable of swinging about a rotational axis of the conveyance roller <b>212</b>. A pressurization mechanism such as a spring member is connected to roller holder <b>213</b> to urge the feed roller <b>211</b> downward so as to apply pressurization force to the feed roller <b>211</b> against the sheet.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The feed roller <b>211</b> serving as a feeding member is driven by a sheet feed motor serving as a driving source described later to rotate in a counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and feeds the sheet supported on the lift plate <b>31</b> serving as a sheet supporting portion toward the feeding direction, corresponding to the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The conveyance roller <b>212</b> is also driven by the sheet feed motor which serves as a common driving source, to rotate in the counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and further convey the sheet downstream in the feeding direction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The separation roller <b>24</b> serving as a separation member is a roller member connected via a torque limiter to a shaft fixed to the feeding frame <b>22</b>. The separation roller <b>24</b> contacts the conveyance roller <b>212</b> and forms a separation nip therewith, separating the sheet passing through the separation nip by frictional force. That is, if only one sheet sent out by the feed roller <b>211</b> passes through the separation nip, the torque limiter slips so that the separation roller <b>24</b> corotates with the conveyance roller <b>212</b> via the sheet. Meanwhile, if multiple sheets enter the separation nip, the separation roller <b>24</b> stops rotating so that the sheets are slid against one another, and only the uppermost sheet in contact with the conveyance roller <b>212</b> is conveyed. Such a separation roller <b>24</b> is an example of a separation member, and other members, such as a retard roller to which driving force in an opposite direction to the sheet feeding direction, i.e., counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, is entered from a sheet feed motor, or a pad-shaped friction member in contact with the conveyance roller <b>212</b>, can be used.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A feed position sensor <b>215</b>, whose detection signal changes according to whether an upper surface of the sheet (i.e., upper surface of the uppermost sheet) placed on the lift plate <b>31</b> is at an appropriate height for feeding sheets by the feed roller <b>211</b>, is provided on the sheet feeder <b>2</b>. The appropriate height is hereinafter referred to as feeding position. The feed position sensor <b>215</b> is a detection member for detecting the position of the roller holder <b>213</b>, and in the present embodiment, a photo-interrupter to be shielded of light by a detection portion <b>213</b><i>a</i>, serving as a light shielding portion, provided on the roller holder <b>213</b> is used. If the detection portion <b>213</b><i>a </i>is positioned on an optical axis of the feed position sensor <b>215</b>, it is determined that the upper surface of the sheet supported on the lift plate <b>31</b> is positioned at the feeding position, and if not, it is determined that the upper surface of the sheet is positioned either above or below the feeding position.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described, in a case where the sheet feeder <b>2</b> starts a sheet feeding operation, the feed roller <b>211</b> lowers from an upper position positioned above the feeding position and moves temporarily to a lower position positioned below the feeding position.

The roller lifting lever <b>25</b> is a swing member that is coupled to the feed roller unit <b>21</b> and that swings in linkage with the feed roller unit <b>21</b>.

A torque limiter is assembled to the roller lifting gear <b>36</b>, for example, as a mechanism for absorbing such difference of drive amount by shutting off drive transmission to the roller lifting lever <b>25</b> in the roller lifting portion <b>30</b>B. Further, stoppers <b>49</b><i>a </i>and <b>49</b><i>b </i>for regulating range of movement of the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is fixed to the feeding frame <b>22</b> in the roller lifting portion <b>30</b>B. The shape of the stopper <b>49</b><i>a </i>is not necessarily the illustrated shape, i.e., block shape, and for example, a hole capable of receiving a protruded shape formed on the roller lifting link <b>37</b> can be provided on a metal plate constituting the feeding frame as the stopper.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a case where the lift motor <b>35</b> rotates in the normal direction, when the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is lowered to a position in contact with the stopper <b>49</b><i>a</i>, the torque limiter slips so that the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is not lowered further. The position of the roller lifting link <b>37</b> in this state corresponds to the lower limit of the lifting and lowering range of the feed roller <b>211</b>. The lift motor <b>35</b> continues to rotate in the normal direction in a state where the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is in contact with the stopper <b>49</b><i>a</i>, by which the lift plate <b>31</b> is continued to be lifted.

The position of the roller lifting link <b>37</b> in this state corresponds to the upper limit of the lifting and lowering range of the feed roller <b>211</b>. The lift motor <b>35</b> continues to rotate in the reverse direction in a state where the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is in contact with the stopper <b>49</b><i>b</i>, by which the lift plate <b>31</b> is continued to be lowered. In other words, the torque value of the torque limiter of the roller lifting gear <b>36</b> is set to a value high enough to swing the roller lifting lever <b>25</b> together with the roller holder <b>213</b> but low enough so that the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is stopped by the stoppers <b>49</b><i>a </i>and <b>49</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">An example has been illustrated of a case where a torque limiter is positioned between the lift motor <b>35</b> and the roller lifting link <b>37</b>, but instead, a one-way gear may be arranged between the lift motor <b>35</b> and the roller lifting link <b>37</b>. In that case, in a state where the lift motor <b>35</b> is stopped, the one-way gear is designed to be locked when the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is lowered and rotates idly when the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is lifted. In this case, if the lift motor <b>35</b> rotates in the reverse direction, the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is lifted in a state where the one-way gear is locked, and the feed roller <b>211</b> is thereby lifted.

When the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is lowered to the lower limit position, the lowering of the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is stopped and the one-way gear rotates idly. As described, in lifting the feed roller <b>211</b>, the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is moved in a movement direction, i.e., upward in the present embodiment, for lifting the feed roller <b>211</b> by drive transmission via the one-way gear in the locked state, so that the feed roller <b>211</b> can be lifted more reliably.

The ROM <b>72</b> and the RAM <b>73</b> are examples of a non-transitory storage medium storing control programs for controlling the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> according to a specific method.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The CPU <b>71</b> operates the sheet feeder <b>2</b> by activating the lift motor <b>35</b>, a sheet feed motor <b>40</b> and an electromagnetic clutch <b>41</b> while recognizing the current status of the sheet feeder <b>2</b> based on the feed position sensor <b>215</b> and the cassette open/close sensor <b>74</b>. The electromagnetic clutch <b>41</b> is a clutch that is provided between the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> and the feed roller <b>211</b> and the conveyance roller <b>212</b> that constitute the feed roller unit <b>21</b>. The electromagnetic clutch <b>41</b> couples and cancels, i.e., engages and disengages the drive transmission to the feed roller <b>211</b> and the conveyance roller <b>212</b> based on ON/OFF of power supply.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The sheet feed motor <b>40</b> according to the present embodiment also serves as a driving source of the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that serves as a conveyance member to convey the sheet at a position downstream of the feed roller unit <b>21</b>. Therefore, the CPU <b>71</b> is capable of controlling the feeding of a succeeding sheet using the feed roller unit <b>21</b> while continuing conveyance operation of a preceding sheet using the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b> by controlling ON and OFF of power to the electromagnetic clutch <b>41</b> in a state where the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> is rotating.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Now, a control method of the sheet feeder <b>2</b> will be described with reference to a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. Various steps of the present flowchart will be carried out by the CPU <b>71</b> of the control unit <b>70</b> executing programs. In the following description, whether the conveyance target sheet has passed a predetermined position on the conveyance path is determined based on the result of detection of a sheet by a sensor arranged on the conveyance path or based on the rotation amount of the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> from the time these sensors have detected the sheet.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Processing of the flowchart is started in a standby state in which the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> is standing by for entry of a print job. In a case where the print job is entered by having image data transmitted from an external computer to the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> (S<b>1</b>: Yes), the CPU <b>71</b> starts the feed-roller contact operation by rotating a lift motor S<b>2</b> in a normal direction (S<b>2</b>). By the lift motor <b>35</b> rotating in the normal direction, the feed roller <b>211</b> starts to be lowered from the upper position and the lift plate <b>31</b> starts to be lifted from a standby position. The standby position refers to a position where the lift plate <b>31</b> has been lowered by the feed-roller separating operation when a previous job has ended. In S<b>2</b>, after the lift motor <b>35</b> has started to rotate in the normal direction, the feed roller <b>211</b> passes the feeding position temporarily before reaching the lower position, and the feed position sensor <b>215</b> detects the detection portion <b>213</b><i>a</i>, but at that point of time, the feed-roller contact operation has not been completed. Therefore, the CPU <b>71</b> stands by for a predetermined time from the start of rotation of the lift motor <b>35</b> in the normal direction, and the rotation of the lift motor <b>35</b> in the normal direction is continued regardless of the detection result of the feed position sensor <b>215</b> (S<b>3</b>).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">After the feed roller <b>211</b> reaches the lower position, the upper surface of the sheet supported on the lift plate <b>31</b> being lifted comes into contact with the feed roller <b>211</b> and the feed roller unit <b>21</b> is lifted up against the urging force of the pressurizing spring <b>39</b>. Then, when the detection portion <b>213</b><i>a </i>is detected again by the feed position sensor <b>215</b> (S<b>4</b>: Yes), the CPU <b>71</b> determines that the feed-roller contact operation has been completed and stops the lift motor <b>35</b> (S<b>5</b>). Thereby, the sheet feeder <b>2</b> becomes the feed-roller contact state. The processes of S<b>1</b> to S<b>5</b> described above will also be executed in a case where the CPU <b>71</b> detects via the cassette open/close sensor <b>74</b> that the cassette <b>3</b> in an opened state has been closed.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Now, the contents of control of the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> and control of the lift motor <b>35</b> being executed in parallel will be described.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Control of Sheet Feed Motor</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In a case where a preparation operation in the image forming unit <b>5</b> is completed, a feed start command is generated and the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> is started (S<b>6</b>). After the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> has been started, power is supplied to the electromagnetic clutch <b>41</b> and the clutch <b>41</b> is engaged, by which the driving force of the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> is transmitted to the feed roller <b>211</b> and the conveyance roller <b>212</b> (S<b>7</b>). By the feed roller <b>211</b> rotating in the feed-roller contact state, the uppermost sheet on the lift plate <b>31</b> is sent out from the cassette <b>3</b> and sheets are fed one at a time in a separated state by the conveyance roller <b>212</b> and the separation roller <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Before a trailing edge, that is upstream end in the feeding direction, of the sheet being fed passes a contact position with the feed roller <b>211</b>, power to the electromagnetic clutch <b>41</b> is shut off and the clutch <b>41</b> will be in a disengaged state (S<b>8</b>). Thereby, the drive of the feed roller unit <b>21</b> is stopped, so that the occurrence of a conveyance failure in which the feed roller <b>211</b> feeds a succeeding sheet of the sheet being conveyed to cause multiple feeding can be prevented. Further, at the point of time of disengagement of the electromagnetic clutch <b>41</b>, the leading edge, that is, downstream end in the feeding direction, of the sheet has already reached the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b> positioned downstream, so that conveyance is continued by the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b> even after disengagement. The sheet being conveyed by the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b> passes through the transfer portion and the fixing unit, by which an image is formed to the sheet, before the sheet is discharged by the sheet discharge roller pair.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">If the number of printed sheets has not yet reached the number of sheets designated in the print job (S<b>9</b>: Yes), processes of S<b>7</b> and S<b>8</b> are repeatedly executed to perform image forming to succeeding sheets. In this case, engaging timing of the electromagnetic clutch <b>41</b> is controlled so that the leading edge of the succeeding sheet follows the trailing edge of the preceding sheet at a fixed distance, so-called sheet-to-sheet interval. As described, according to the present embodiment, the electromagnetic clutch <b>41</b> is turned on and off repeatedly in a state where the feed-roller contact state is maintained to feed the sheets one at a time. The present configuration is effective in setting a short sheet-to-sheet interval and improving productivity of the image forming apparatus compared to a configuration where the feed roller <b>211</b> is lifted and lowered by a cam structure each time a sheet is fed, or compared to a configuration where the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> is turned on and off each time a sheet is fed. This is because the response time of the electromagnetic clutch is normally shorter than the time required to lift and lower the feed roller <b>211</b> mechanically or the time required to start and stop the sheet feed motor <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the number of printed sheets has become equal to the number of sheets designated by the print job (S<b>9</b>: No), a process to stop the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> is performed. In this case, the driving of the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> is continued until the trailing edge of the final sheet has passed through the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b>, and after the sheet has passed through the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b>, the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> is stopped (S<b>10</b>).</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Control of Lift Motor</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Meanwhile, during feeding of sheets, the CPU <b>71</b> maintains the feed-roller contact state, and after the leading edge of the final sheet has reached the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b> (S<b>11</b>: Yes), the CPU <b>71</b> rotates the lift motor <b>35</b> in the reverse direction and starts the feed-roller separating operation (S<b>12</b>). The lift motor <b>35</b> is stopped after a predetermined time has elapsed from starting of the rotation in the reverse direction (S<b>13</b>). The predetermined time refers to a time for moving the feed roller <b>211</b> to the upper position and moving the lift plate <b>31</b> to a position, i.e., standby position, so that the uppermost sheet is positioned lower than the lower position of the feed roller <b>211</b>. Therefore, the above-described feed-roller contact operation (S<b>2</b> to S<b>5</b>) is ready for re-execution by rotating the lift motor <b>35</b> in the normal direction at a point of time where the lift motor <b>35</b> stops after a predetermined time has elapsed. By the lift motor <b>35</b> being stopped and the sheet feed motor being stopped at S<b>10</b>, the sheet feeder <b>2</b> returns to a standby state where a succeeding job entry can be received.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In a case where the print job requires images to be formed to a plurality of sheets, during a period of time where feeding of sheets is continuously executed (S<b>11</b>: No), the CPU <b>71</b> performs control to maintain the height of the uppermost sheet on the lift motor <b>35</b> to the feeding position. That is, when the number of sheets on the lift plate <b>31</b> is reduced by feeding sheets and the detection signal of the feed position sensor <b>215</b> has turned from on to off, an operation is repeatedly performed to rotate the lift motor <b>35</b> for a predetermined amount in the normal direction to lift the lift plate <b>31</b> up. Thereby, even if the remaining amount of sheets is reduced, the height of the uppermost sheet is maintained at the feeding position, and pressurizing force of the feed roller <b>211</b> to the sheet is maintained within an appropriate range.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Now, according to the present embodiment, the control of the lift motor <b>35</b>, that is, control of the contact and separation of the feed roller, which serves as a driving source for lifting and lowering the feed roller <b>211</b> and lifting and lowering the lift plate <b>31</b>, is performed independently from the control, i.e., conveyance control, of the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> serving as a driving source for feeding sheets. Therefore, in a state where the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> is still rotating for conveyance of the final sheet as a process for completing the print job, the lift motor <b>35</b> can rotate in the reverse direction to start the operation of separating the feed roller <b>211</b> from the sheet. In other words, it is possible to start the feed-roller separating operation during execution of conveyance control of the sheet.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Specifically, at a point of time where the leading edge of the final sheet has reached the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b> (S<b>11</b>: Yes), the trailing edge of the final sheet is still positioned upstream of the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b>, so that the driving of the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b> by the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> is continued. In the present embodiment, the lift motor <b>35</b> rotates in the reverse direction in this state to start the feed-roller separating operation. At this time, because the final sheet is already nipped by the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b>, the conveyance of the final sheet is continued reliably even if the feed roller <b>211</b> is separated from the final sheet by the lift motor <b>35</b> rotating in the reverse direction.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Thereby, at least a portion of a period of execution of the feed-roller separating operation overlaps with a period during which the final sheet is conveyed by the conveyance roller pair <b>4</b> and conveyance mechanisms arranged downstream thereof, such as the transfer portion, the fixing unit and the sheet discharge roller pair. That is, at least a portion of the period during which driving noise of the lift motor <b>35</b> is generated for separating the feed roller <b>211</b> from the sheet falls within the period during which operation noise of conveying the sheet in the image forming apparatus is generated, so that the period during which the image forming apparatus generates noise can be shortened.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, if the contents of jobs are the same, the required time from the entry of a job to the returning of the sheet feeder <b>2</b> to the standby state is shortened compared to a configuration where the feed roller <b>211</b> is lifted to the upper position by rotating the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> in the reverse direction after the final sheet has been fed. In addition, according to the present embodiment, since the present embodiment does not adopt a configuration to lift and lower the feed roller <b>211</b> by rotating the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> in the reverse direction, drive of the sheet feed motor <b>40</b> rotating in the reverse direction can be used for other control purposes.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Modified Example</heading><p id="p-0088" num="0087">According further to the present embodiment, a configuration is adopted where the feed roller unit <b>21</b> is detachably attached to the feeding frame <b>22</b>, but a configuration can also be adopted where the feed roller unit <b>21</b> is not attached in a detachable manner. For example, a configuration can be adopted where the roller holder <b>213</b> is formed integrally with the roller lifting lever <b>25</b>, in which the feed roller <b>211</b> and the conveyance roller <b>212</b> can be independently detachably attached to the integrated structure.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Next, a second embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> to <b>12</b></figref>.

That is, the roller lifting portion <b>30</b>B is composed of the roller lifting gear <b>36</b>, the roller lifting link <b>37</b>, the roller-coupled lever <b>26</b> and the link-coupled lever <b>27</b>. The configuration of the roller lifting gear <b>36</b> and the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is similar to the first embodiment, wherein the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is moved by sliding motion upward and downward by the driving force being transmitted via the roller lifting gear <b>36</b> when the lift motor <b>35</b> rotates in the normal and reverse directions.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">However, unlike the first embodiment, the roller lifting link <b>37</b> is designed to slide upward when the lift motor <b>35</b> rotates in the normal direction and to slide downward when the lift motor <b>35</b> rotates in the reverse direction.
