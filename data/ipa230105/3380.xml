Typically, this process is carried out at high reactor temperatures in the range of 1200&#xb0; C.-1500&#xb0; C. and pressures of up to 100 bar. Known solution describes a process and related reactor for reacting a hydrocarbon-containing feedstock with an oxidizer stream inside the reactor. The streams are injected into the reactor by means of a burner. Different devices to inject and mix the different streams (i.e. oxidizer, hydrocarbon containing feedstock and sometimes a moderator) are disclosed in the known solutions. As moderator, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) or steam is frequently applied which is fed separately into the reactor by a separate channel inside the burner or is admixed upstream of the burner to one or several streams, As an oxidizer, air, oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen (:&#x3e;95 mol %) is typically applied. A hydrocarbon containing feed stream is a stream containing hydrocarbons like methane or higher hydrocarbons or other molecules containing hydrogen and carbon (e.g. alcohols such as methanol, ethanol). This can also be a stream coming from a primary reformer upstream containing besides carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), CO<sub>2</sub>, and water (H<sub>2</sub>O), also hydrocarbons like methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, or higher hydrocarbons like benzene, toluene, xylenes. The mixing of the hydrocarbon containing feedstock and the oxidizer is typically carried out inside a reactor in close vicinity of the injecting nozzles. An intense mixing of the hydrocarbon containing feedstock with the oxidizer is preferred in order to obtain a high degree of conversion of the hydrocarbon containing feedstock into the synthesis gas by minimizing the consumption of the oxidizer. Another known solution describes a coaxial burner in which the different streams are co-annularly guided through a burner with different channels and mix outside. Mixing is achieved by the different exit velocities of the streams. In another known solution, besides pure co-axial injection of the different streams, also one or more streams can be inclined towards the center axis of the burner reactor alignment at the level of the nozzle exit. Other known solutions describe burners with fixed swirling devices utilizing blades. Known solution also describes a spiral like swirling chamber for the hydrocarbon containing feedstock and the stream is injected tangentially into this swirling chamber.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fixed swirling devices by blades have the disadvantage that the swirl cannot be changed during operation. Therefore, the flame length and shape is a result of the geometric design of the burner and reactor, of the volumetric flow rates of the streams at operation condition and of the chemical composition of the streams. Similar observations are valid for non-swirled jet flames. Flame length and shape can be calculated by state-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Additionally, scientific papers provide the general dependencies for flame lengths, e.g. according to A. Schumaker et al., Proc. Comb. Inst. 32 (2009) 1655-1662, the stoichiometric flame length of non-swirled co-axial jet burners is a function of the central injection diameter, the momentum ratio between the oxidizer and the hydrocarbon containing feedstock and the molar stoichiometric mixture fraction. Recently, A. Degeneve et at (Proc. Comb. Inst. 2018, 37 (4), 4563-4570, ISSN 1540-7489) has reported, that this dependency can be expanded to configurations using swirled co-axial jets by introducing the geometrical swirl number as an additional factor. With the need for an increased plant flexibility (not only by means of turn-down ratio but also concerning changing the obtained synthesis gas composition by means of different H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratios), e.g, varying amounts of CO<sub>2</sub>, can be admixed to the hydrocarbon containing feedstock stream upfront of the burner. This changes at least the momentum ratio of the different flows at the burner nozzles and consequently results in a different flame length and position inside the reactor. In extreme cases, this can lead to burner or refractory damages.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Besides the disadvantage of the fixed geometry, swirl blades are responsible of an additional pressure drop. Especially, for low pressure hydrocarbon containing feedstock streams originating e.g. from a blast furnace or a primary reformer (e.g., fixed bed or bubbling fluidized bed for biomass or waste reforming) that are typically operated at a slight overpressure of 50-3000 millibar (mbar), the additional pressure drop due to the swirl blades is important. Additionally, changes in feedstocks stream composition of the primary reformed gas are frequently observed, that may change flame properties within the subsequent Partial Oxidation (PDX) unit that cannot be mitigated by a fixed burner design with static blades.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need to address the aforementioned technical drawbacks in existing technologies to regulate a length of a flame inside a reactor during partial oxidation of the feedstock stream.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure seeks to provide an efficient method and apparatus for regulating a length of a flame for partial oxidation of hydrocarbon feed inside a reactor.
