It is not easy to connect and disconnect a plurality of optical connectors, which are led from the outside, to and from a corresponding one of a plurality of adapters in a limited and narrow space or to properly wire optical cables, which are led from the outside, inside the case. Therefore, it is desirable to secure a work space.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, in order to handle a large volume of information, it is desirable that the termination unit includes a large number of adapters to be connected to the optical connectors. However, there is a limit to the number of adapters that can be arranged in a limited space. For example, Patent Literatures PTL 1 to PTL 4 disclose termination units each including an adapter panel in which a plurality of optical connectors are arranged and which moves relative to a case. Since the adapter panel moves relative to the case, a work space is secured, but the number of optical connectors that can be mounted in the panel is limited.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, when an optical cable is introduced into the termination unit from the outside, it is difficult to properly guide and wire the optical cable into a limited space. Patent Literature PTL <b>5</b> discloses a termination unit including a fixing member that is slidably and rotatably attached to one side surface of the termination unit and fixes a multi-core cable. Since the fixing member is slidably and rotatably movable with respect to the termination unit, a user can move the optical cable fixed to the fixing member to a predetermined position as necessary, but more flexibility is desired in the position and movable range of the fixing member with respect to the case of the termination unit.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An object of the present disclosure is to provide an optical cable termination unit that facilitates connection and disconnection of optical connectors and wiring of optical cables.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0000">Description of Embodiments of the present Disclosure</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">First, the contents of embodiments of the present disclosure will be listed and described.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">(1) A optical cable termination unit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes a case, a first adapter panel that is disposed in the case and includes a plurality of first adapters each configured so that a corresponding one of a plurality of optical connectors is connectable thereto and disconnectable therefrom and a first surface on which the plurality of first adapters are arranged, and a second adapter panel that is disposed in the case and includes a plurality of second adapters each configured so that a corresponding one of a plurality of optical connectors is connectable thereto and disconnectable therefrom and a second surface on which the plurality of second adapters are arranged. In the optical cable termination unit, the first surface and the second surface are separated from each other. The first adapter panel is configured to be movable relative to the second adapter panel so that the first surface and the second surface are capable of becoming parallel to each other.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">Since the termination unit according to the present disclosure includes a plurality of adapter panels such as the first adapter panel and the second adapter panel, the termination unit can include a large number of adapters connectable to the optical connectors. Since the first surface of the first adapter panel and the second surface of the second adapter panel are separated from each other and arranged in parallel with each other, the first adapter panel and the second adapter panel can be effectively arranged in a limited space of the termination unit. Further, the first adapter panel is configured to be movable relative to the second adapter panel. Therefore, when connecting and disconnecting the optical connectors to and from the second adapters, a user can keep the first adapter panel away from the second adapter panel to secure a work space. Therefore, the optical connectors can be easily connected and disconnected.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">(2) The first adapter panel may be supported by the case via a first shaft. The first adapter panel may be configured to rotate relative to the second adapter panel around the first shaft. According to the present disclosure, the first adapter panel is configured to rotate relative to the second adapter panel around the first shaft. Therefore, when connecting and disconnecting the optical connectors to and from second adapters, a user can secure a space between the first adapter panel and the second adapter panel by rotating the first adapter panel. Therefore, the optical connectors can be easily connected and disconnected.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">(3) The termination unit may include a support body that is disposed in the case and configured to slide with respect to the case. At least one of the first adapter panel or the second adapter panel may be supported by the support body. According to the present disclosure, since at least one of the first adapter panel or the second adapter panel is supported by the support body, a user can easily expose or house the first adapter panel or the second adapter panel from or in the case by sliding the support body with respect to the case. Therefore, the optical connectors can be easily connected and disconnected.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">(4) The first adapter panel may include a third adapter panel including some of the plurality of first adapters, and a fourth adapter panel including the others of the plurality of first adapters. The third adapter panel may be supported by the case via a third shaft disposed at one end of the first adapter panel. The third adapter panel may be configured to rotate relative to the fourth adapter panel around the third shaft. The fourth adapter panel may be supported by the case via a fourth shaft disposed at the other end of the first adapter panel. The fourth adapter panel may be configured to rotate relative to the third adapter panel around the fourth shaft.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">According to the present disclosure, the third adapter panel and the fourth adapter panel are configured to rotate relative to each other. Therefore, a user can rotate only the third adapter panel without rotating the fourth adapter panel, for example, to secure a space between the third adapter panel and the second adapter panel. In this case, as compared with a case where the entire first adapter panel including the third adapter panel and the fourth adapter panel is rotated, a work space is secured with a minimum necessary operation, which improves work efficiency.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">(5) The second adapter panel may be supported by the case via a second shaft. The second adapter panel may be configured to rotate relative to the first adapter panel around the second shaft. According to the present disclosure, since not only the first adapter panel but also the second adapter panel is configured to rotate, flexibility of securing the work space is increased.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">(6) A plurality of cables with first connectors may be each connected to a corresponding one of the plurality of first adapters. A plurality of cables with second connectors may be each connected to a corresponding one of the plurality of second adapters. According to the present disclosure, the cables with the first connectors are each connected to a corresponding one of the first adapters. The cables with the second connectors are each connected to a corresponding one of second adapters. This allows a user to facilitate connecting the optical connectors.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">(7) Each of the cables with the first connectors may include an optical fiber or an optical fiber ribbon. Each of the cables with the second connectors may include an optical fiber or an optical fiber ribbon. A cable portion of the plurality of cables with the first connectors may be covered by a protective member. A cable portion of the plurality of cables with the second connectors may be covered by a protective member. According to the present disclosure, each of the cables with the first connectors includes an optical fiber or an optical fiber ribbon, and each of the cables with the second connectors includes an optical fiber or an optical fiber ribbon. Therefore, the termination unit according to the present disclosure can be connected to various optical fibers. In addition, since the cable portion of the cables with the first connectors and the cable portion of the cables with the second connectors are covered by the protective member, damage to both of the cable portions can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">(8) Each of the cables with the first connectors may include an optical fiber having an outside diameter from 200 &#x3bc;m to 250 &#x3bc;m. Each of the cables with the second connectors may include an optical fiber having an outside diameter of 200 &#x3bc;m to 250 &#x3bc;m. The first adapter panel and the second adapter panel of the termination unit according to the present disclosure can be connected to an optical fiber having an outside diameter of 200 &#x3bc;m to 250 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">(9) An optical cable termination unit according to another embodiment of the present disclosure includes a case having an opening, and a cable introducing portion that is configured to guide an optical cable from an outside to the opening of the case. The cable introducing portion is supported by an outer surface of the case via a shaft and is configured to rotate around the shaft between a first position in which the cable introducing portion faces the opening and a second position in which the cable introducing portion is further separated from the opening than in the first position.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">According to the present disclosure, the cable introducing portion is configured to rotate around the shaft between the first position and the second position. Therefore, when a user introduces the optical cable into the termination unit, a space between the case and the cable introducing portion can be expanded as a work space by rotating the cable introducing portion. This allows a user to facilitate wiring the optical cable.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">(10) The outer surface may include a first side surface and a second side surface that form the case. The first side surface and the second side surface may face each other and may intersect a surface including the opening. The cable introducing portion may be configured to be supported by both of the first side surface and the second side surface via the shaft. The cable introducing portion may be attached to the first side surface (for example, left side surface) of the case or may be attached to the second side surface (for example, right side surface) of the case, in accordance with a housing portion of an optical wiring rack to be mounted. According to the present disclosure, since the cable introducing portion is configured to be supported by both of the first side surface and the second side surface, flexibility of disposed position of the cable introducing portion with respect to the case is increased.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">(11) The termination unit may include a bracket that is attached to the outer surface of the case and includes the shaft. The cable introducing portion may be attached to the bracket. Depending on the sizes and shapes of the case and the cable introducing portion in the termination unit, attachment of the cable introducing portion to the case of the termination unit may be restricted. However, according to the present disclosure, the cable introducing portion is attached to the case of the termination unit via the bracket. Therefore, by changing the size and shape of the bracket, the cable introducing portion can be attached to the case without changing the configurations of the cable introducing portion and the case of the termination unit. Therefore, flexibility of disposed position of the cable introducing portion is increased.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">(12) The bracket may be slidably attached to the outer surface of the case. According to the present disclosure, since the bracket is slidably attached to the outer surface of the case, a user can move the cable introducing portion attached to the bracket relative to the case. Therefore, a space between the case and the cable introducing portion can be expanded as a work space, and working efficiency is improved.

In a state in which the second adapter panel <b>4</b> is rotated forward so as to be away from the fifth adapter panel <b>9</b>, the second adapter surface <b>42</b> and the fifth adapter surface <b>92</b> are separated from each other, and a direction of the second adapter surface <b>42</b> and a direction of the fifth adapter surface <b>92</b> can intersect each other.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">In the termination unit <b>1</b>E of this embodiment, the first adapter panel <b>3</b> and the second adapter panel <b>4</b> are also rotated. Therefore, a work space between the second adapter panel <b>4</b> and fifth adapter panel <b>9</b> is secured. In this embodiment, a user can connect and disconnect each of optical connectors to and from a corresponding one of the first adapters <b>31</b> of the first adapter panel <b>3</b> from the left side, and connect and disconnect each of optical connectors to and from a corresponding one of the second adapters <b>41</b> of the second adapter panel <b>4</b> from the right side. Further, the user can connect and disconnect each of optical connectors to and from a corresponding one of the fifth adapters <b>91</b> of the fifth adapter panel <b>9</b>, passing around the left end of the second adapter panel <b>4</b> from the right side of the case <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">As described above, the termination unit <b>1</b>E of this embodiment includes the first adapter panel <b>3</b>, the second adapter panel <b>4</b>, and the fifth adapter panel <b>9</b>. In other words, since the termination unit <b>1</b>E includes more adapters connectable to optical connectors, the termination unit <b>1</b>E can handle a larger volume of information.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">The Cable introducing portion <b>5</b> of the termination unit <b>1</b> may be configured to be movable. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> are plan views illustrating the inside of a termination unit <b>1</b>F. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a plan view of the termination unit <b>1</b>F when a cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F of the termination unit <b>1</b>F is in a first position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a plan view of the termination unit <b>1</b>F when the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F of the termination unit <b>1</b>F is in a second position.

The bracket <b>29</b> is attached to the outer surface <b>22</b> of the case <b>2</b>F and has a shaft X. In other words, the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is supported by the outer surface <b>22</b> of the case <b>2</b>F via the shaft X and the bracket <b>29</b>. The Cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F in this embodiment is supported by the left side surface <b>25</b> of the case <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">The Cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F in this embodiment is configured to rotate around the shaft X between the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) in which the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F faces the opening <b>28</b>L and the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) in which the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is further separated from the opening <b>28</b>L than in the first position. Here, the &#x201c;facing&#x201d; state includes not only a state in which the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F and the opening <b>28</b>L face each other head-on, but also a state in which only a part of the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F faces the opening <b>28</b>L, and a state in which the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F obliquely faces the opening <b>28</b>L. Further, the second position is not necessarily limited to a position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) in which the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is rotated by <b>90</b> degrees from the first position. When the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is rotated by some angle around the shaft X from the first position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the position can be the second position.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">The bracket <b>29</b> is slidably attached to the outer surface <b>22</b> of the case <b>2</b>F. Specifically, the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F attached to the bracket <b>29</b> is configured to move toward and away from the case <b>2</b>F.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">The optical cable <b>51</b> is guided from the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F and is housed in the case <b>2</b>F. The optical cable <b>51</b> has an extra length that allows the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F to rotate and the bracket <b>29</b> to slide.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">Next, a method of using the termination unit <b>1</b>F will be described. It may be preferred that the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is disposed at a position close to the opening <b>28</b>L of the case <b>2</b>F. For example, when the termination unit <b>1</b>F is housed in an optical wiring rack, it is preferable that the entire the termination unit <b>1</b>F including the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is small. In such a case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a user rotates the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F around the shaft X to a first position in which the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F faces the opening <b>28</b>L, and houses the termination unit <b>1</b>F in the optical wiring rack.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">On the other hand, it may be preferred that the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is disposed at a position far from the opening <b>28</b>L of the case <b>2</b>F. For example, when the optical cable <b>51</b> is guided from the outside to the splice tray <b>6</b> of the case <b>2</b>F, it is preferable to expand a work space between the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F and the opening <b>28</b>L of the case <b>2</b>F. In such a case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a user rotates the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F around the shaft X to the second position in which the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is further separated from the opening <b>28</b>L than in the first position, thereby securing a work space.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">As described above, the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F of the present embodiment is configured to rotate around the shaft X between the first position and the second position. Therefore, a user can expand a space between the case <b>2</b>F and the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F as a work space by rotating the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F between the first position and the second position as necessary. Therefore, wiring of optical cables is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">The termination unit <b>1</b>F in this embodiment includes the bracket <b>29</b>, and the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is attached to the bracket <b>29</b>. Therefore, by changing the size and shape of the bracket <b>29</b>, the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F can be attached to the case <b>2</b>F without changing the configurations of the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F and the case <b>2</b>F in termination unit <b>1</b>F. Therefore, flexibility of disposing the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is increased.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">The bracket <b>29</b> is slidably attached to the outer surface <b>22</b> of the case <b>2</b>F. By moving the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F attached to the bracket <b>29</b> relative to the case <b>2</b>F, a user can further expand the space between the case <b>2</b>F and the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F as a work space. Therefore, working efficiency is improved.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">The termination unit <b>1</b>F may not include the bracket <b>29</b>. In this case, the shaft X is a part of the outer surface <b>22</b> of the case <b>2</b> and is disposed in a part of the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F. Without the bracket <b>29</b>, the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F can be rotated between the first position and the second position by disposing the shaft X in the termination unit <b>1</b>F.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">The bracket <b>29</b> may be fixed to the outer surface <b>22</b> of the case <b>2</b>F. Even when the bracket <b>29</b> is fixed to the case <b>2</b>F, by rotating the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F between the first position and the second position, the space between the case <b>2</b>F and the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is secured as a work space.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">The cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F in this embodiment is configured to be supported by either of the left side surface <b>25</b> and the right side surface <b>26</b> of the case <b>2</b>F. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a state in which the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is supported by the left side surface <b>25</b> of the case <b>2</b>F and guides an optical cable from the outside to the opening <b>28</b>L of the case <b>2</b>F. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a state in which the cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F is supported by the right side surface <b>26</b> of the case <b>2</b>F and guides an optical cable from the outside to the opening <b>28</b>R of the case <b>2</b>F.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">The cable introducing portion <b>5</b>F may be attached to the left side surface <b>25</b> of the case <b>2</b>F or may be attached to the right side surface <b>26</b> of the case <b>2</b>F, in accordance with a housing portion of an optical wiring rack to be mounted.
