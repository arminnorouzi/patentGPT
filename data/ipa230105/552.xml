However, the application of enough thermal energy to damage the chromophore can also be damaging to the surrounding dermis and the overlying epidermis, thus leading to epidermis and dermis damage as well as pain to the subject. This problem also applies to targets, such as sebaceous glands, where a chromophore such as sebum is used to heat the target to a high enough temperature to cause damage to the target.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Previous approaches to prevent epidermis and dermis damage, as well as subject pain include:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">1. Pre-cooling the epidermis, then applying the photo-thermal treatment; and</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Pre-cool the epidermis, also pre-condition (i.e., preheat) the epidermis and dermis in a preheating protocol, then apply photo-thermal treatment in a distinct treatment protocol. In certain instances, the preheating protocol and the treatment protocol are performed by the same laser, although the two protocols involve different laser settings and application protocols, thus leading to further complexity in the treatment protocol and equipment.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the embodiments described herein, there is disclosed a method for determining a suitable set of parameters for operating a light source within a photo-thermal targeted treatment system for targeting a chromophore embedded in a medium. The method includes, prior to administering a treatment protocol to a first subject, 1) administering at least one laser pulse at a preset power level to a first treatment location, where the preset power level is below a known damage threshold. The method also includes 2) measuring a skin surface temperature at the first treatment location, following administration of the at least one laser pulse. The method further includes 3) estimating a relationship between the parameters for operating the light source and the skin surface temperature at the first treatment location, and 4) defining a safe operating range for the parameters for operating the light source in order to avoid thermal damage to the medium at the first treatment location while still effectively targeting the chromophore in administering the treatment protocol.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, steps 1) through 4) are repeated at a second treatment location on the first subject prior to administering the treatment protocol at the second treatment location. In another embodiment, steps 1) through 4) are repeated at the first treatment location on a second subject prior to administering the treatment protocol on the second subject. In still another embodiment, the method further includes 5) storing in a memory of the photo-thermal targeted treatment system the safe operating range for the parameters for operating the light source for the first subject at the first treatment location, and 6) when administering the treatment protocol on the first subject at a later time, taking into consideration the parameters so stored in the memory.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a photo-thermal targeted treatment system for targeting a chromophore embedded in a medium is disclosed. The system includes a light source configured for providing laser pulses over a range of power levels when operated using a set of parameters, the range of power levels including a known damage threshold for the chromophore and a treatment location. The system also includes a temperature measurement apparatus for measuring a skin surface temperature at the treatment location, and a controller for controlling the light source and the temperature measurement apparatus. The controller is configured for estimating a relationship between the parameters of the light source and the skin surface temperature at the treatment location, defining a safe operating range for the set of parameters of the light source in order to avoid thermal damage to the medium at the treatment location while still effectively targeting the chromophore in administering the treatment protocol, and setting the light source to administer the laser pulses within the safe operating range.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another embodiment, a method for adjusting a suitable set of parameters for operating a light source within a photo-thermal targeted treatment system for targeting a chromophore embedded in a medium during administration of a treatment protocol to a first subject at a first treatment location is disclosed. The method includes: 1) measuring the skin surface temperature at the first treatment location at least once; 2) predicting skin temperature as the treatment protocol is administered to the first subject at the first treatment location; and 3) adjusting at least one of the parameters for operating the light source such that a future measurement of the skin surface temperature at the first treatment location will not exceed a specified value. Predicting skin temperature considers at least one of a heat transfer model and a series of experimental results.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary photothermal targeting treatment system, in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary scanner arrangement for use with the photothermal targeting treatment system, in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic of an exemplary set of light pulses suitable for use as the integrated pre-conditioning/photo-treatment protocol, in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the measured temperature at the skin surface as a function of time as the treatment photo pulses are applied thereto, in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process for analyzing the measured skin surface temperature, predicting the temperature of the skin when subsequent laser pulses and/or additional cooling are applied, then modifying the treatment protocol accordingly.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the measured skin surface temperature for various applied laser pulse powers at similar treatment areas for two different individuals.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process for a closed-loop control of the laser system parameters based on real-time skin surface temperature measurements, in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the measured skin surface temperature resulting from the application of four pulses to a treatment area that are used as data for predicting the subject's skin temperature rise with subsequent pulse application, as well as the resulting curve fit and actual temperature measurements, in accordance with an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown.

The system can be used, for example, for photo-thermal ablation of sebaceous glands in a targeted fashion, where sebum is the chromophore embedded within the sebaceous gland, while sparing the epidermis and dermis surrounding the target sebaceous glands.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a photo-thermal targeted treatment system <b>100</b> includes a cooling unit <b>110</b> and a photo-treatment unit <b>120</b>. Cooling unit <b>110</b> provides a cooling mechanism for a cooling effect, such as by contact or by direct air cooling, to treatment area, namely the outer skin layer area overlying the target sebaceous gland. Cooling unit <b>110</b> is connected with a controller <b>122</b> within photo-treatment unit <b>120</b>. It is noted that, while controller <b>122</b> is shown to be contained within photo-treatment unit <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it is possible for the controller to be located outside of both cooling unit <b>110</b> and photo treatment unit <b>122</b>, or even within cooling unit <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Controller <b>122</b> further controls other components within photo-treatment unit <b>120</b>, such as a laser <b>124</b>, a display <b>126</b>, a temperature monitoring unit, a foot switch <b>130</b>, a door interlock <b>132</b>, and an emergency on/off switch. Laser <b>124</b> provides the laser power for the photo-treatment protocol, and controller <b>122</b> regulates the specific settings for the laser, such as the output power and pulse time settings. Laser <b>124</b> can be a single laser or a combination of two or more lasers. If there more than one laser is used, the laser outputs are combined optically to function as one more powerful laser. Display <b>126</b> can include information such as the operating conditions of cooling unit <b>110</b>, laser <b>124</b>, and other system status. Temperature monitoring unit <b>128</b> is used to monitor the temperature of the skin surface in the treatment area, for example, and the measured skin surface temperature at the treatment area is used by controller <b>122</b> to adjust the photo-treatment protocol. Controller <b>122</b> also interfaces with footswitch <b>130</b> for remotely turning on or off laser <b>124</b> and/or cooling unit <b>110</b>. Additionally, door interlock <b>132</b> can be used as an additional safety measure such that, when the door to the treatment room is ajar, door interlock <b>132</b> detects the condition and instructs controller <b>122</b> to not allow photo-treatment unit <b>120</b>, or at least laser <b>124</b>, to operate. Furthermore, emergency on/off switch <b>134</b> can be provided to quickly shut down photo-thermal targeted treatment system <b>100</b> in case of an emergency. In another modification, additional photodiodes or other sensors can be added to to monitor the power level of the energy emitted from laser <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, photo-thermal targeted treatment system <b>100</b> further includes a scanner <b>160</b>, which is the portion of the device handheld by the user in applying the treatment protocol to the subject. Scanner can be formed, for example, in a gun-like or stick-like shape for ease of handling by the user. Scanner <b>160</b> is connected with cooling unit <b>110</b> via a cooling connection <b>162</b>, such that the cooling protocol can be applied using scanner <b>160</b>. Additionally, the output from laser <b>124</b> is connected with scanner <b>160</b> via an optical fiber delivery <b>164</b>, such that the photo-treatment protocol can be applied using scanner <b>160</b>. Scanner <b>160</b> is connected via a temperature connection <b>166</b> to temperature monitoring unit <b>128</b>, so as to feedback the skin temperature at the treatment area, for example, to controller <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows further details of scanner <b>160</b>, in accordance with an embodiment. Cooling connection <b>162</b> is connected with a cooling delivery unit <b>202</b>, which is configured to deliver the cooling mechanism (e.g., a cold air stream) to the treatment area. Optical fiber delivery <b>164</b>, from laser <b>124</b>, is connected with a laser energy delivery unit <b>204</b>, which includes optical components for delivering light energy for the photo-thermal treatment protocol to the treatment area. Finally, temperature connection <b>166</b> is connected with a temperature sensor <b>206</b>, which measures the temperature at the treatment area for feedback to controller <b>122</b>. Additionally, scanner <b>160</b> includes an on/off switch <b>210</b> (such as a trigger switch to turn on/off laser <b>124</b>) and, optionally, a status indicator <b>212</b>, which indicates the operational status of scanner <b>160</b>, such as if the laser is being operated. While scanner <b>160</b> is schematically shown as a box in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the actual shape is configured for ease of use. For example, scanner <b>160</b> can be shaped as a nozzle with a handle, a handgun shape, or another suitable shape for ease of aiming and control by the user.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an exemplary usage scenario, the full treatment area overlying the sebaceous glands to be treated is cooled. The cooling protocol can include, for example, the application of a cold airstream across the treatment area for a prescribed time period, such as 10 seconds. Following pre-cooling, the cooling mechanism (e.g., cold airstream or contact-cooling) remains active and a photo-treatment protocol is applied to the treatment area. In one embodiment, pulses of a square, &#x201c;flat-top&#x201d; beam is used in combination with a scanner apparatus to sequentially apply a laser pulse to the treatment area. For example, the photo-treatment protocol can include the application of a set number of light pulses onto each segment of the treatment area, with the segments being sequentially illuminated by the laser pulses. In another embodiment, the segments are illuminated in a random order.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An example of a set of pulses suitable for a conditioning/photo-treatment protocol is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment. A sequence <b>300</b> includes light pulses <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, and <b>334</b> that are applied at the treatment area. In one embodiment, all of the seven light pulses are of equal power, and are separated by a uniform pulse separation (represented by a double-headed arrow <b>342</b>), and have the same pulse duration (represented by a gap <b>344</b>). In an example, pulse duration <b>344</b> is 150 milliseconds, and the pulse separation is 2 seconds. The 2 second pulse separation is intended, for example, to allow the epidermis and dermis in the block to cool down so as to prevent damage thereto. During the pulse separation time period, the laser can be scanned over to a different segment within the treatment area so as to increase the laser use efficiency. It is noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is not drawn to scale.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the measured skin surface temperature as light pulses, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, are applied to the treatment area, in accordance with an embodiment. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the treatment area had been pre-cooled by direct air cooling for 7 seconds, then light pulses from a 1720 nm wavelength laser at 22 watts power and 150 milliseconds in duration were applied with a period of 2 seconds, while the cooling remains on. In this particular example, the direct-air cooling used for the cooling and during the treatment, delivers a high speed column of air, cooled to &#x2212;22&#xb0; C., resulting in a heat transfer coefficient between the skin and the air of approximately 350 W/m{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}2 K. The beam size is 4.9 mm square, in an embodiment. The exact beam size can be adjusted, using for example collimation optics, depending on the size of the treatment area, power profile of the laser, the location of the treatment area of the body, and other factors.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The resulting changes in skin surface temperature are shown in a graph <b>400</b>, where a peak <b>422</b> corresponds to the application light pulse <b>322</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and similarly for peaks <b>424</b>, <b>426</b>, <b>428</b>, and <b>430</b>. In example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the average power per spot is 22 W*0.15 s/2 s=1.65 W. The same average power per spot can be achieved, for instance, by pulsing at 33 watts for 100 ms with a pulse separation of 2 s, or by pulsing at 25.1 W for 125 ms with a pulse separation of 1.9 s. Furthermore, the average laser power per area should be in balance with the heat extraction achieved by the cooling system.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The requirements for successful photo-thermal targeted treatment of specific chromophores with minimum subject discomfort include: 1) Epidermis sparing, namely making sure that the peak temperature value at the skin surface is less than around 55&#xb0; C.; 2) Dermis sparing, namely avoiding overheating the dermis by balancing the peak and average power of the treatment pulses with the heat extraction of the cooling system; and 3) Selective heating of the chromophore, and the target containing the chromophore, such as a peak temperature greater than 55&#xb0; C. for sebaceous gland treatments. It is noted that the peak temperature value of 55&#xb0; C. is highly dependent on the specific treatment protocol, and is adjustable to other temperatures to stay within a safe operating range to avoid damaging the surrounding dermis and epidermis.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is known in the literature that tissue parameters, such as the thickness of the epidermis and dermis, vary among individuals, according to factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity, as well as between different skin locations on the body. For example, the forehead has different tissue properties than the back, even for the same individual, thus necessitating different treatment parameter settings for the different treatment locations. Consideration of such variations in tissue properties in determining the specific treatment protocol is significant for laser-based treatment of acne. Additionally, there may be variations in, for instance, the exact laser power, spot size, and cooling capacity between specific laser systems due to manufacturing variability and operating conditions. In fact, manufacturing variations from system to system can result in fluence variation of 15% or more among different laser treatment systems. Furthermore, the individual technique used by the user delivering the treatment, can also affect the treatment, e.g., by different pressures applied to the skin surface which in turn affects, for instance, blood perfusion at the treatment site.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In laser treatment of acne, the operating thermal range is generally bound on the upper end at the epidermis and dermis damage threshold temperature, and at the lower end by the temperature required to bring the sebaceous gland to its damage threshold temperature. While there is currently not a good way to directly measure the temperature of the sebaceous gland being targeted by the treatment protocol, the skin surface temperature can be an indicator of the sebaceous gland temperature. A correlation model providing the correspondence between sebaceous gland temperature and skin surface temperature can then be used to tailor the actual treatment protocol using skin surface temperature measurements for effectively targeting sebaceous gland damage while staying below the damage threshold for the epidermis. The correlation model can be developed using, for example, an analytical heat transfer model, or by using clinical data (e.g., via biopsies) correlating skin surface temperature to sebaceous gland damage given the application of a specific treatment protocol.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Based on clinical data, the operating temperature range for acne treatment expressed in terminal skin surface temperature, using for example the treatment protocol illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, is approx. 45&#xb0; C. to 55&#xb0; C. At skin surface temperatures below 45&#xb0; C., it has been determined that there is no damage to the sebaceous gland. When the skin surface temperature is between 45&#xb0; C. and 55&#xb0; C., there are varying degrees of sebaceous gland damage, with no epidermal damage. Above 55&#xb0; C., there is epidermal damage in addition to damage to the sebaceous gland.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, clinical data also indicates that terminal skin surface temperature has a strong dependence on tissue parameters at the specific treatment area for a particular individual. While existing treatment protocols have been based on a &#x201c;one treatment fits all&#x201d; type of an approach, an innovative analysis protocol can be incorporated into the treatment method so as to directly determine individually tailored treatment parameters extrapolating from measurements of terminal skin temperature at lower laser powers and/or the skin surface temperature reached during an initial part of a treatment and/or the terminal skin surface temperatures reached during previous treatments, to avoid epidermis damage while efficaciously causing sebaceous gland damage. In this way, the treatment protocol can be customized for a specific treatment area for a particular individual, and also mitigates treatment variations that can be caused by variations in the laser power output of a specific machine, as well as variations in treatment conditions, such as ambient humidity and temperature. Therefore, it would be desirable to optimize the treatment protocol for different subjects and even different tissue locations for the same subject so as to not cause unwanted tissue damage, while still effectively treating the target tissue component (e.g., the sebaceous gland).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For instance, by directly measuring the skin surface temperature during the first four pulses of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the maximal epidermal surface temperature after application of subsequent pulses can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy. This prediction can be used for real time modification of the specific treatment protocol for a particular area of the skin, such as reducing the number of pulses applied, adjusting the pulse widths, or modifying the laser power, for the subsequent pulses. If the laser system incorporates a cooling system that can react quickly enough, the cooling is also adjustable as part of the real time modification of the treatment system parameters. This customization process greatly enhances subject comfort and safety during the treatment procedure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">This analysis protocol can be performed by incorporating temperature measurements using, for example, a commercial, off-the-shelf, low-cost cameras that can be built into the scanner (e.g., see temperature sensor <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) that is held by the medical professional to apply the treatment to the subject, or by using a separate, commercial off-the-shelf single or multi-pixel thermal measurement device. The prediction process can be performed on a highly localized level, thus adjusting the treatment protocol on the fly or prior to the treatment commencement, even adjusting the protocol for each individual spot in a treatment matrix. In this way, the treatment protocol can be specified to provide the necessary treatment laser power while staying below the epidermis and dermis damage threshold temperature.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process for the analysis protocol, in accordance with an embodiment. The analysis protocol assumes that the maximum epidermis temperature and the damage threshold temperature for the target (e.g., the sebaceous gland) are known. Additionally, a correlation model between the skin surface temperature and the target (e.g., the sebaceous gland) has been established using computational analysis, such as finite element modeling of the heat transfer for instance, or by clinical experiments using biopsies. Thus, knowledge of the target value for the terminal skin surface temperature is assumed for the analysis protocol. As an example, for the treatment protocol earlier described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, it is known that the target peak skin surface temperature is 51&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an analysis protocol <b>500</b> begins by applying a low power laser pulse to a treatment area in a step <b>512</b>. The laser power should be set at values that are below the damage threshold for epidermis damage. The skin surface temperature at the treatment area is then measured in a step <b>514</b>. The temperature measurement can be performed, for example, using a low speed infrared camera or similar apparatus. Then a determination is made in a decision <b>516</b> whether enough data has been collected to fit the collected data into the pre-established correlation model. If the answer to decision <b>516</b> is no, then the process returns to step <b>512</b>, at which a laser pulse at a different, low power setting is applied to the treatment area to gather additional correlation data between applied laser power and epidermis temperature.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the answer to decision <b>516</b> is yes, then analysis protocol <b>500</b> proceeds to fit the measured skin surface temperature data to the established correlation model in a step <b>518</b>. Next, the appropriate laser parameters for the specific treatment area for the particular individual are determined in a step <b>520</b>. Finally, in a step <b>522</b>, the exact treatment protocol to be used for the specific treatment area for the particular individual is modified according to the appropriate laser parameters found in step <b>520</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, optionally, analysis protocol <b>500</b> can be continued during the actual treatment protocol. In an exemplary embodiment, following the setting of the laser parameters in step <b>522</b>, a treatment protocol with the appropriate laser parameters is initiated in a step <b>530</b>. Then, in a step <b>532</b>, the process continues to measure the skin surface temperature at the treatment area. The measured skin surface temperatures are used to update the correlation model calculations in a step <b>534</b>, and the laser parameters for the treatment protocol are updated based on the updated calculations in a step <b>536</b>. Then a decision <b>538</b> is made to determine whether the treatment protocol (i.e., the number of laser pulses to be applied to the treatment area) is complete. If the answer to decision <b>538</b> is NO, then the analysis protocol returns to step <b>532</b> to continue measuring the skin surface temperature. If the answer to decision <b>538</b> is YES, then the treatment protocol is terminated in a step <b>540</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In other words, until the treatment protocol is complete, analysis protocol <b>500</b> can implement optional steps <b>530</b> through <b>540</b> to continue adjusting the laser parameters even during the actual treatment protocol. In fact, if other relevant data regarding the subject, such as laser settings from prior treatments in the same treatment area for the same subject, exist, they can also be fed into the model calculations for further refinement of the laser parameters.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an example of the analysis protocol and subsequent treatment protocol are shown, in accordance with an embodiment. A graph <b>600</b> shows the relationship between laser power and peak skin surface temperature during application of a series of laser pulses on two different subjects, identified as &#x201c;C Carlton&#x201d; and &#x201c;S Carlton.&#x201d; Large dots <b>612</b>, <b>614</b>, and <b>616</b> show the initial three low power laser pulses applied to subject &#x201c;C Carlton,&#x201d; after which the analysis protocol described above is used to predict peak skin surface temperature as measured by an IR camera, thus defining a safe operating range as indicated by a dashed horizontal line <b>618</b> and a dashed vertical line <b>620</b>. Dots <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>, and <b>626</b> show data take at slightly higher laser power settings on same subject &#x201c;C Carlton.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in order to determine the applicability of the same dosimetry determination process on a different subject, the same power laser pulses were applied to a second subject &#x201c;S Carlton,&#x201d; starting with a similar starting temperature as shown by a dot <b>630</b>. On the second subject &#x201c;S Carlton,&#x201d; a treatment protocol of increasing laser power was immediately applied, without the dosimetry protocol at lower temperatures, as shown by dots <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, and <b>636</b>. While the actual measured epidermis temperature for second subject &#x201c;S Carlton&#x201d; differed from those of first subject &#x201c;C Carlton,&#x201d; graph <b>600</b> indicates that the safe operating range, indicated by dashed lines <b>618</b> and <b>620</b>, would have been also applicable for second subject &#x201c;S Carlton&#x201d; as well. In this way, the analysis protocol described above takes into consideration these individual differences in tailoring the treatment protocol for a specific treatment area on a particular individual. The efficacy of the analysis protocol has been verified with in vivo data.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The analysis protocol can be performed in advance of the actual treatment session, for example, as the subject is being checked in at an appointment or in a pre-treatment session. As low powers are used, the analysis protocol can be performed without the need for local anesthesia, with virtually no epidermal or dermal damage occurring during the application of the analysis protocol. For instance, in preparation for treatment, a trained operator can quickly pre-measure the various treatment locations and, with one scan per skin location, develop an individualized treatment protocol.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Once a relationship between laser power and the resulting skin surface temperature has been established for a particular subject, and/or a particular skin location, and/or a particular laser device, this relationship, indicated by the slope of the line connecting dots <b>612</b>, <b>614</b>, <b>616</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>624</b>, and <b>626</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, can be used to continuously adjust future treatments. Furthermore, as the treatment schedule proceeds, all of the treatment data can be added to the basis for establishing the skin surface versus power correlation. In this way, the correlation is continually updated and refined, even after the treatment protocol is initiated. For instance, based on the known relationship between laser power and resulting skin surface temperature reached at a particular treatment location, a suggestion for adjusting the laser parameters, such as the laser power can be given to the dermatologist for manual adjustment, or the device can automatically adjust e.g. the laser power, for the next treatment location.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The concept of the analysis protocol described above can be extended to real-time adjustment of the treatment protocol using a closed-loop control process. The surface temperature of the skin can be measured using, for example, an infrared (IR) camera or other temperature measurement mechanisms. By fitting the measured temperature to a mathematical model of the skin tissue, for instance, the measured skin surface temperature can be correlated to the temperature of the target component, such as the sebaceous gland, which cannot be directly measured.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">That is, in accordance with another embodiment, a system whereby temperature measurements of a skin surface during initial parts of a treatment for a specific location are used to predict future temperatures of the skin surface at this specific location. The future temperatures, so predicted, are used to adjust a thermal energy delivered by a laser, or lasers, by adjusting one or more parameters, such as laser power, pulse width, number of pulses, and others that affect the thermal energy delivered by the laser, or by adjusting one or more parameters of a cooling system, such as air flow, such that the future temperature of the skin surface for the specific location, and thereby the temperature of the underlying regions and components of the tissue, which cannot be readily measured in a direct manner, reaches a desired value or does not exceed a specified value.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other words, the dosimetry (e.g., the settings of the light treatment including, for example, power settings for the laser light source) administered to the subject) can be adjusted in real-time by using a predictive control process. For instance, by directly measuring the skin temperature during pulses <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, and <b>326</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a predicted maximal epidermal surface temperature after application of subsequent pulses can be calculated with a high degree of accuracy. This prediction is accomplished by fitting a mathematical function to the measured epidermal surface temperatures following the application, for example, of three or four treatment pulses. The suitable mathematical function is in turn selected based on knowledge of the pulsing scheme used in the treatment protocol. For example, for the treatment protocol shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a single exponential function can provide an accurate model of the skin surface temperature following subsequent treatment pulse applications. This prediction can then be used in modifying the specific treatment protocol for a particular area of the skin in real time. For instance, the user can modify one or more of the number of additional pulses applied, as well as pulse width and laser power of subsequent pulses. Additionally, if the photo-treatment system includes a sufficiently responsive cooling unit, the cooling applied to the treatment area is also adjustable as a part of the real time modification of treatment system parameters. This customization process greatly enhances patient comfort and safety during the treatment procedure.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The analysis for use in the predictive control process can be performed using a temperature measurement device, for example, a commercial, off-the-shelf, low-cost camera incorporated into the scanner (e.g., temperature sensor <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) or by using a separate thermal measuring device, such as a single- or multi-pixel thermal imager. By controlling the size of the target treatment area and specifically measuring the skin surface temperature at the target treatment area, the prediction process can be performed on a highly localized level, thus enabling the medical professional administering the treatment protocol to make adjustments prior to the start of the treatment protocol, in real time during the treatment, or even for each individual spot in a treatment matrix. In this way, the treatment protocol can be administered in a highly customizable way to provide the necessary treatment laser power while staying below the epidermis and dermis damage threshold temperature.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For instance, the Arhenius damage function yields that target damage is exponentially related to peak temperature; subsequently, the peak temperature of the skin surface is correlated to the peak temperature of the target component. In an example, the temperature rise is approximately 180&#xb0; C./second for irradiation with a 22 W laser over a 5 mm-by-5 mm spot with a 150 ms pulse; in this case, the skin surface measurement should be updated approximately every 2.5 ms, or at 400 Hz, in order for the temperature measurement is to be used as a control input for the treatment protocol. With such a fast temperature measurement method, the laser can be shut off when the measured skin surface temperature reaches a preset threshold value.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Alternatively, a slower temperature measurement device can be used to predict the peak temperature by measuring the temperature rise and fall behavior during the early pulse application in the treatment protocol. The skin surface temperature can be measured during the first few laser pulses applied at the treatment area, and the temperature measurements are used to extrapolate the expected skin surface temperature during subsequent pulse applications such that the energy profile of the subsequent pulses can be adjusted accordingly. For instance, laser parameters such as the laser pulse duration, power, and pulse interval can be adjusted in order to deliver the appropriate amount of energy to the target chromophore while avoiding damage to the surrounding medium.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary process for a closed-loop control of the laser system parameters based on real-time skin surface temperature measurements, in accordance with an embodiment. A process <b>700</b> begins with the initialization of the laser treatment protocol with the laser system set at treatment settings (i.e., therapeutic levels of power, pulse width, etc.). In a step <b>712</b>, a laser pulse is applied to a treatment area in accordance with a treatment protocol. The treatment protocol can involve, for example, the application of pulses of sequentially increasing power, or pulses of substantially identical power settings repeatedly applied to the treatment area. An example treatment protocol involves the repeated application of laser pulses from a 22 W laser with a 5-millimeter by 5-millimeter spot size and 150 ms duration.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, during the application of each laser pulse, the skin surface temperature at the treatment area is measured in a step <b>714</b>. Optionally, the skin surface temperature is measuring during the cooling down periods between the pulses. The measurement can be made, for example, by a 25 Hz refresh rate infrared camera. Faster devices, such as a 400 Hz refresh rate temperature measurement device, can be used for more accurate measurement of the skin surface temperature at and following the application of the laser pulses.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Then a determination is made in a decision <b>716</b> whether enough skin surface temperature data has been gathered for curve-fitting purposes. If the answer to decision <b>716</b> is NO, then the process returns to step <b>712</b> for the application of another laser pulse. If the answer to decision <b>716</b> is YES, then the measured skin surface temperature data are fitted to a predictive model in a step <b>718</b>. Curve-fits of the maximum and, optionally, minimum skin surface temperatures are generated during step <b>718</b>. The predictive model can be generated, for instance, by compiling a large number of temperature measurements corresponding to the application of laser pulses to test subjects in clinical settings, or by analytical modeling of the tissue.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Based on the curve-fits generated in step <b>718</b>, a determination is made in a step <b>720</b> for the appropriate laser parameters for the specific treatment area on the individual being treated. For example, if the curve-fits predict the skin surface temperature will rise above a predetermined threshold temperature, such as 45&#xb0; C., then the laser parameters are adjusted to reduce the laser power. In this case, the skin surface temperature measurements can indicate that the specific treatment area on the subject is particularly sensitive to laser pulse energy absorption. Alternatively, if the curve-fits predict the desired temperature, such as 55&#xb0; C. for target chromophore damage, will not be reached with the current laser pulse power settings, then the laser parameters can be adjusted to provide the necessary treatment power. Such a situation can occur if the epidermis and dermis characteristics are such that the specific treatment area does not readily absorb the laser pulse energy.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary predictive closed-loop control process based on measured skin surface temperature resulting, in accordance with an embodiment.

The air cooling is applied to the treatment area throughout the laser pulse application in the present example.
