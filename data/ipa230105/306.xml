The dish baskets of known dishwashers frequently consist of a wire mesh and are generally mounted so as to be able to slide on the side walls of the dishwasher cavity by means of rail systems, so that the dish baskets may be pulled out of the dishwasher cavity of the dishwasher. A drawback of these known dish baskets is that they have a substantially rigid wire construction which permits only limited possibilities of variation when loaded with items to be washed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Dish baskets for dishwashers, in particular household dishwashers, which are divided into storage surfaces with special devices for the arrangement of specific dishes or cutlery are also known. In some dish baskets, the storage surfaces are pivotably fastened so that, if required, the storage surfaces may be moved into a horizontal position in which they may be provided with items to be washed or they may be moved into a vertical position in order to increase the storage space in the dish basket. These known storage areas have the drawback that they provide merely the choice of using or folding up the storage area, without increasing the possibilities of variation in the arrangement of items to be washed in the dish basket or on the storage area.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is also known that cups have depressions in the respective bottom regions thereof, washing liquor generally collecting therein during a washing cycle of a dishwasher, in particular a household dishwasher. In the known manner, this respectively collected washing liquor unfortunately does not completely dry during the drying phase of a dishwasher. In order to counteract this formation of so-called puddles, an oblique adjustable surface is incorporated in the receiving bottom of a dish basket of a dishwasher, but this is only effective with small, in particular shallow, cups and it significantly restricts the available space when loading the dish basket of a dishwasher with large items to be washed, such as for example bowls, tall mugs and glasses and the like. In the case of large mugs and glasses, the steep elevation of the receiving bottom of the dish basket also acts negatively on the stability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The publication EP 2 554 099 A2 discloses a dish support which is able to be positioned in a dish basket of a dishwasher having a bottom. The dish support may be positioned in the dish basket in at least two operating states so that at least one part of the bottom of the dish basket is able to adopt different configurations in each case. To this end, the dish support has an elongated shape and comprises two portions which are connected together along a central connecting line. At least one of the two portions of the dish support comprises a grid structure which comprises small bars for the purpose of a sufficient drainage of the washing liquor. The other portion of the dish support comprises a transverse piece which is arranged at right-angles to the small bars of one of the two portions of the dish support and which comprises coupling means for coupling the dish support to the bottom of the dish basket.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The publication DE 20 2004 021 026 U1 discloses a dishwasher having at least one dishwasher cavity, at least one dish basket and at least one storage element for storing items to be washed, said storage element being able to be coupled to the dish basket and comprising a storage surface. The storage element can be locked on the dish basket and can be pivoted about an axis into different angles of inclination. At least one support element which supports the storage element at a point spaced from the axis at different angles of inclination is provided.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The publication EP 2 245 975 A1 discloses a storage element which is pivotably attached to a bottom wire of a dish basket by means of a plurality of snap connections. The storage element may be pivoted between a folded-up resting position and a folded-down operating position. Moreover, the storage element has a plurality of profiled bars which have depressions and projections for securely holding items to be washed, such as for example glasses. The storage element has on the underside at least one hook element which in the folded-down operating position of the storage element is able to be latched into at least one intermediate connecting wire running perpendicular to the bottom wire. During the course of the latching of the hook element into the intermediate connecting wire, the storage element may be slid at least slightly horizontally in its folded-down operating position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">While already known dish baskets and storage elements have proved advantageous in everyday practical use, there is always the need for improvement. Thus, in particular, it is desirable to avoid as far as possible the described puddling, even in the case of larger items to be washed, to provide more loading flexibility for the consumer, to improve the drying result with an optimal use of space in the dish basket and, in particular, to achieve optimal drying, even of small items to be washed, in particular cups and the like, with at the same time improved use of space for tall items to be washed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The term &#x201c;item to be washed&#x201d; is generally used in the context of this patent application for any type of item to be washed, i.e. both for crockery and for cutlery. Crockery may in turn be an item of cookware, i.e. a vessel or a device which is used for preparing meals, or an item of dinnerware, i.e. a vessel or a device which is used for serving and consuming meals. Cutlery may be a tool which is used for eating food. The cutlery common in European culture today consists of a knife, fork and spoon.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Against this background, it is an object of the present invention to propose an improved dish rack for a dishwasher, in particular a household dishwasher.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This object is achieved by the dish rack according to the invention for a dishwasher, in particular a household dishwasher, having the features as claimed in claim <b>1</b>. Advantageous developments of the present invention are specified in claims <b>2</b> to <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The dish rack for a dishwasher, in particular a household dishwasher, having at least one dishwasher cavity, according to the present invention is movably arranged in the dishwasher cavity and comprises a dish basket and a storage surface for holding items to be washed, which storage surface can be coupled to the dish basket. The storage surface can be locked on the dish basket, and the storage surface can be pivoted about an axis into different angles of inclination and also can be slid along the axis. Moreover, at least one support element is arranged on the underside of the storage surface, which support element supports the storage surface at different angles of inclination at a point spaced from the axis. The support element arranged on the underside of the storage surface has a number of locking steps, which come into engagement with the dish basket, whereby the storage surface is supported at different angles of inclination.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The change to the angle of inclination of the storage surface which can be locked on the dish basket is carried out according to the invention by a combined movement, i.e. by a longitudinal sliding of the storage surface along an axis and preferably a simultaneous rotation of the storage surface about the axis.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The dish rack according to the invention for a dishwasher, in particular a household dishwasher, has the advantage that the angle of inclination of the storage surface in the dish basket may be adjusted in a variable manner. As a result, the storage surface may be adapted according to the height and width of the items to be washed to be arranged thereon. Since the angle of inclination of the storage surface is able to be set according to the respective space requirement of the items to be washed, the items to be washed may be arranged in a particularly space-saving manner in the dish basket, which permits an optimal use of the space of the dish basket. Since the support element supports the storage surface at a point spaced from the pivot axis thereof, a complex mechanism for absorbing relatively large amounts of torque on the pivot axis for locking the storage surface is superfluous. Due to the simple construction of the support element, the production costs of the dish rack of the dishwasher, in particular the household dishwasher, are reduced according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The use of a storage surface which is variable in terms of the angle of inclination thereof promotes a more comfortable, easily accessible and secure storage of the items to be washed in the dish basket with optimal use of the available storage space. As a result, a clear arrangement of the items to be washed in specific positions in the dish basket may also be achieved and a mutual contact of the items to be washed may be prevented, which promotes the cleaning thereof and prevents damage to the items to be washed and the development of noise in the washing mode of the dishwasher, in particular the household dishwasher.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a first embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the locking steps are configured on the support element as supports, which act on the dish basket depending on the angle of inclination and preferably fixedly hold this dish basket by the support surface.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The locking steps, which are configured as supports on the support element, may in each case have a surface which is curved in a concave manner so that in each case they bear securely against the dish basket over a longer distance. The design of the support element with a number of locking steps facilitates the handling of the support mechanism.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a second embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the supports of the locking steps on the support element have an offset ranging from 1 to 10 mm, preferably from 2 to 8 mm, in particular from 3 to 6 mm.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">These described offset regions permit an optimal positioning of the storage surface as a function of the dimensions of the items to be washed which are to be stored. Undesired puddling may also be effectively avoided, even in the case of larger items to be washed, and greater loading flexibility for the consumer is effectively provided. Finally, the drying result may be improved with optimal use of space in the dish basket.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that at least two support elements are arranged so as to be preferably uniformly distributed on the underside of the storage surface.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The provision of at least two support elements ensures an improved stability, on the one hand, and an optimal positional accuracy of the storage surface, on the other hand. A uniform distribution of the at least two support elements brings about a reduced deflection of the storage surface.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the storage surface can be pivoted between a folded-up resting position and at least one folded-down operating position.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The folded-up resting position of the storage surface is preferably a substantially perpendicular position of the storage surface, whereas the at least one folded-down operating position is an oblique position of the storage surface below a selected angle of inclination of the storage surface. The plurality of folded-down operating positions promotes a more comfortable, easily accessible and secure storage of the items to be washed in the dish rack with optimal use of the available storage space. As a result, a clear arrangement of the items to be washed in specific positions in the dish basket may also be achieved and a mutual contact of the items to be washed may be prevented, which promotes the cleaning thereof and prevents damage to the items to be washed and the development of noise in the washing mode of the dishwasher, in particular the household dishwasher.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the preferably planar storage surface consists of a plurality of longitudinal elements and transverse elements, preferably made of plastic or metal.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The plurality of longitudinal elements and transverse elements of the preferably planar storage surface promotes a simple but stable construction of the storage surface. Spray shadows are effectively avoided and improved cleaning and drying performances are achieved without further effort. The longitudinal elements and transverse elements also permit as far as possible an unhindered throughflow of washing liquor through the storage surface.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the support surface is preferably provided in the region of the axis with a stop contour for items to be washed, which is designed in a continuous or spaced-apart manner.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The stop contour for items to be washed brings about an effective securing of the items to be washed against slippage and thus against possible damage thereto. The stop contour for items to be washed brings about an effective action, irrespective of the dimensions of the items to be washed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the stop contour for items to be washed comprises round and/or polygonal stop segments.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The aforementioned shapes of the stop elements are simple and cost-effective to produce and they permit as far as possible an unhindered throughflow of washing liquor through the storage surface.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the storage surface is preferably releasably connected to the dish basket via a clamping connection.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The preferably releasable connection of the storage surface to the dish basket via a clamping connection ensures a secure fixing of the storage surface to the dish rack. If required, for example, the storage surface may also be detached as a whole from the dish basket for the purpose of arranging bulky items to be washed. In this case, the clamping connection may be formed between the storage surface and the dish basket, for example by correspondingly curved, preferably hook-shaped, ends of the storage surface.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the dish basket has a receiving bottom of the dish basket formed from a plurality of spaced-apart longitudinal elements and transverse elements and forming an adjustable surface, wherein the transverse elements are arranged perpendicular to the longitudinal elements and wherein the transverse elements are connected to the longitudinal elements at intersection points.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">This design of the dish basket ensures in the known manner a high degree of stability and a desired dimensional accuracy of the dish basket.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the receiving bottom of the dish basket is configured in the region below the storage surface to be horizontal, approximately horizontal, or slightly inclined.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">This embodiment of the receiving bottom of the dish basket in the region below the storage surface already permits an inclined rack for items to be washed, while avoiding undesired puddling and improving the drying performance.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that a longitudinal element of the dish basket forms the axis for the storage surface and that the storage surface is preferably releasably connected to this longitudinal element of the dish basket via a clamping connection.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The use of an already present longitudinal element of the dish basket ensures a secure fixing of the storage surface to the dish basket. If required, the storage surface may also be detached as a whole from the dish basket, for example for the purpose of arranging bulky items to be washed. In this case, the clamping connection between the storage surface and the dish basket may be formed, for example, by correspondingly curved, preferably hook-shaped, ends of the storage surface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the number of support elements arranged on the underside of the storage surface is equal to the number of transverse elements covered at least in some regions by the storage surface, so that a transverse element is assigned to each support element.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The provision of an equal number of support elements and transverse elements ensures an improved stability, on the one hand, and an optimal positional accuracy of the storage surface, on the other hand. Moreover, such a distribution of the support elements brings about a reduced deflection of the storage surface.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the dish basket has a plurality of separate, preferably adjacently arranged, storage surfaces, in each case at least one support element being assigned thereto.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Such an arrangement of separate storage surfaces permits an independent setting of different angles of inclination of separate storage surfaces and thus an optimal use of the dish basket for loading with the items to be washed. As a result, it is also possible, for example, to use a plurality of storage surfaces in the dish basket adjacent to one another, in order to accommodate a larger quantity of flat items to be washed in the dish basket, for example.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a further embodiment according to the invention, it is provided that the storage surface and the at least one support element are produced in a uniform material, in particular by an injection-molding method.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Such a material uniformity permits a production method which is reliable in terms of process and cost-effective. It is particularly advantageous if the support element is at least partially manufactured from resilient material, in particular from plastic. As a result, the support element may be adjusted in a simple manner into the desired positions.
