Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an endoscope system that stores a plurality of types of still images through an instruction, and a method of operating the endoscope system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the medical field, a diagnosis using an endoscope system, which comprises a light source device, an endoscope, and a processor device, has been widely performed. In the diagnosis using the endoscope system, various types of information regarding a surface structure of an observation target, a mucous membrane surface layer, or the like may be obtained by using an image (hereinafter, referred to as an endoscopic image) obtained by imaging the observation target with the endoscope through image-enhanced observation (IEE, image enhanced endoscopy) in which an illumination light beam or the like is devised.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the diagnosis using IEE, an appropriate diagnosis may be made by acquiring a plurality of types of endoscopic images obtained by a plurality of types of illumination light beams and the like, and comparing in detail or superimposing these endoscopic images. As an endoscope system that uses a plurality of types of images including a normal image obtained through white light observation, an image obtained through IEE, and the like, an endoscope system in which an oxygen saturation observation moving image, a normal observation moving image, and a blood vessel-enhanced observation moving image are juxtaposed and displayed on a display device, and an exposure condition is set and then each observation moving image is stored as a still image in a case where a freeze button is operated while the moving images are displayed, and the like are disclosed (JP2013-188364A, corresponding to US2013/0245411A1).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the related art, a plurality of types of still images having less blur is selected and stored, for example, at a point in time back to the past by a certain period from a point in time when an instruction to store the still image is given by the operation of the freeze button while the moving image is displayed. In a plurality of types of illumination light beams, for example, two types of images are compared: an image using the illumination light beam that is used to enhance superficial blood vessels or the like of the observation target and an image using the illumination light beam that is used to enhance medium-depth blood vessels or the like of the same observation target so that information on the depth direction of the observation target can be obtained, which is effective, for example, in a case where a diagnosis on the extent of a lesion is performed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to store a plurality of types of still images corresponding to a plurality of types of illumination light beams, for example, as in the related art, the illumination light beams are switched and the still image is stored for each illumination light beam, whereby various still images are stored. In a case where an observation target is observed and an image thereof is picked up while the plurality of illumination light beams is repeatedly switched, it is preferable that the switching cycle between the illumination light beams used for observation is as long as possible because of problems, such as photosensitivity. However, in this case, it is necessary to select an image of an illumination light beam that is not used for observation when a still image recording instruction is given, and the longer the switching cycle between the illumination light beams is, the larger the difference in time between the plurality of types of stored images is. Since the larger the difference in time between the plurality of types of stored images is, the higher the probability that the positional deviation between the images may occur significantly is due to the motion of the observation target and the like, there is a concern that still images unsuitable for comparison or superimposition may be stored.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, in order to reduce the difference in time between the plurality of types of stored images, it is conceivable to reduce the switching cycle between the plurality of illumination light beams to shorten the illumination time of each illumination light beam. However, there is a concern that this method may cause problems, such as light flicker or photosensitivity, which is a trade-off with the difference in time between images.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, in JP2013-188364A, in addition to the above, a plurality of illumination light beams is automatically switched in a predetermined order, and moving images corresponding to the respective illumination light beams are simultaneously displayed on a monitor. In this case, a frame rate in a case of one type of illumination light beam is equal to or less than half that of a case where illumination light beams are not switched, and it may be difficult to diagnose, for example, the observation target that may move, through comparison or superimposition between the plurality of types of images.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope system that stores a plurality of types of still images in a state suitable for comparison or superimposition, through a single instruction, and a method of operating the endoscope system.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, there is provided an endoscope system comprising: a plurality of semiconductor light sources that emits light beams having wavelength bands different from each other; a light source processor that performs control to emit each of a plurality of types of illumination light beams of which combinations of light intensity ratios between the plurality of semiconductor light sources are different from each other; and an image processor. The image processor acquires a first image and a second image obtained by imaging an observation target illuminated with a first illumination light beam and a second illumination light beam included in the plurality of types of illumination light beams, respectively, for each frame, performs image storage processing of storing a first image selected from a plurality of the acquired first images and a second image selected from a plurality of the acquired second images, and selects, when a processing start operation for starting the image storage processing is performed, a first image and a second image that satisfy a preset selection condition from the plurality of first images and the plurality of second images acquired in a target period including a time when the processing start operation is performed, for the image storage processing. The light source processor switches, out of the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam, one being emitted to the other to emit the other in the target period.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is preferable that the target period is a period in which the image processor acquires a plurality of the first images which is a preset number and a plurality of the second images which is a preset number.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is preferable that the target period is a period in which the image processor acquires the first image and the second image that satisfy the selection condition.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is preferable that the light source processor alternately switches and emits the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam at a preset cycle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is preferable that the light source processor switches, out of the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam, one which is emitted before the processing start operation to the other to emit the other, through the processing start operation, in a case where the processing start operation is performed after a preset period starting from a time when light emission is switched between the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam. It is preferable that the light source processor switches, out of the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam, one which is emitted after the processing start operation to the other to emit the other, when the target period is passed. It is preferable that the light source processor switches, out of the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam, one which is emitted after the processing start operation to the other to emit the other, when a preset period starting from the time of the processing start operation is passed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is preferable that the light source processor emits, out of the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam, one which is emitted before the processing start operation even after the processing start operation, in a case where the processing start operation is performed in a preset period starting from a time when light emission is switched between the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam. It is preferable that the light source processor switches, out of the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam, one which is emitted at the time of the processing start operation to the other to emit the other, when the preset period starting from the time when the light emission is switched between the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam is passed. It is preferable that the light source processor switches, out of the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam, one which is emitted at the time of the processing start operation to the other to emit the other, when a preset period starting from the time of the processing start operation is passed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is preferable that the image processor sets the selection condition that a first image having least blur out of the plurality of acquired first images or a second image having least blur out of the plurality of acquired second images is selected.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is preferable that the image processor sets the selection condition that a first image and a second image having smallest positional deviation between the first image selected from the plurality of acquired first images and the second image selected from the plurality of acquired second images are selected.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is preferable that the image processor sets the selection condition that a first image and a second image having a smallest difference in brightness between the first image selected from the plurality of acquired first images and the second image selected from the plurality of acquired second images are selected.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is preferable that the image processor sets the selection condition that a first image and a second image having a smallest difference in acquisition time between the first image selected from the plurality of acquired first images and the second image selected from the plurality of acquired second images are selected.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is preferable that a display that displays the first image and/or the second image is further provided and the image processor displays the stored first image and/or the stored second image on the display in the target period.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the present invention, there is provided a method of operating an endoscope system including a plurality of semiconductor light sources that emits light beams having wavelength bands different from each other, a light source processor that performs control to emit each of a plurality of types of illumination light beams of which combinations of light intensity ratios between the plurality of semiconductor light sources are different from each other, and an image processor.

The normal observation mode is a mode for displaying a normal observation image (hereinafter, referred to as a normal image), which is an image with natural color tones obtained by picking up an image of the observation target using white light as an illumination light beam, on the display <b>18</b>. The special observation mode includes a first special observation mode and a second special observation mode. The first special observation mode is a mode for displaying a first special observation image (hereinafter, referred to as a first image) in which surface layer information such as a superficial blood vessel is enhanced, on the display <b>18</b>, and the second special observation mode is a mode for displaying a second special observation image (hereinafter, referred to as a second image) in which deep layer information such as a deep blood vessel is enhanced, on the display <b>18</b>.

The keyboard <b>19</b> functions as a user interface that receives an input operation, such as function settings. An external recording unit (not shown) that records images, image information, or the like may be connected to the processor device <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the light source device <b>14</b> emits illumination light beams with which the observation target is irradiated, and comprises a light source unit <b>20</b> and a light source processor <b>21</b> that controls the light source unit <b>20</b>. The light source unit <b>20</b> is composed of, for example, a semiconductor light source, such as a multi-color light emitting diode (LED), a combination of a laser diode and a phosphor, or a xenon lamp or halogen light source. In addition, the light source unit <b>20</b> includes, for example, an optical filter that is used to adjust the wavelength band of a light beam emitted by the LED or the like. The light source processor <b>21</b> turns on/off each LED or the like or adjusts the drive current and drive voltage of each LED or the like, thereby controlling the amount of the illumination light beam. Further, the light source processor <b>21</b> controls the wavelength band of the illumination light beam by changing the optical filter or the like.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in the present embodiment, the light source unit <b>20</b> has four-color LEDs, that is, a violet light emitting diode (V-LED) <b>20</b><i>a, </i>a blue light emitting diode (B-LED) <b>20</b><i>b, </i>a green light emitting diode (G-LED) <b>20</b><i>c, </i>and a red light emitting diode (R-LED) <b>20</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the V-LED <b>20</b><i>a </i>generates violet light V having a central wavelength of 410&#xb1;10 nm and a wavelength range of 380 to 420 nm. The B-LED <b>20</b><i>b </i>generates blue light B having a central wavelength of 450&#xb1;10 nm and a wavelength range of 420 to 500 nm. The G-LED <b>20</b><i>c </i>generates green light G having a wavelength range of 480 to 600 nm. The R-LED <b>20</b><i>d </i>generates red light R having a central wavelength of 620 to 630 nm and a wavelength range of 600 to 650 nm.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The light source processor <b>21</b> controls the V-LED <b>20</b><i>a, </i>the B-LED <b>20</b><i>b, </i>the G-LED <b>20</b><i>c</i>, and the R-LED <b>20</b><i>d. </i>The light source processor <b>21</b> controls the respective LEDs <b>20</b><i>a </i>to <b>20</b><i>d </i>such that a normal light beam of which the combination of light intensity ratios between violet light V, blue light B, green light G, and red light R is Vc:Bc:Gc:Rc is emitted in the normal observation mode.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The light source processor <b>21</b> controls the respective LEDs <b>20</b><i>a </i>to <b>20</b><i>d </i>such that a first illumination light beam of which the combination of the light intensity ratios between violet light V, blue light B, green light G, and red light R is Vs1:Bs1:Gs1:Rs1 is emitted in a case where the first special observation mode is set. It is preferable that the first illumination light beam enhances superficial blood vessels. For this purpose, it is preferable that the light intensity of violet light V of the first illumination light beam is set to be higher than the light intensity of blue light B. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a ratio of the light intensity Vs1 of violet light V to the light intensity Bs1 of blue light B is set to &#x201c;4:1&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the present specification, the combination of the light intensity ratios includes a case where the ratio of at least one semiconductor light source is zero. Therefore, the combination of the light intensity ratios includes a case where any one or two or more of the semiconductor light sources are not turned on. For example, a case where only one semiconductor light source is turned on and the other three semiconductor light sources are not turned on as in a case where the combination of the light intensity ratios between violet light V, blue light B, green light G, and red light R is 1:0:0:0 is also regarded that the light source unit <b>20</b> has light intensity ratios, and is one of the combinations of the light intensity ratios.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The light source processor <b>21</b> controls the respective LEDs <b>20</b><i>a </i>to <b>20</b><i>d </i>such that a second illumination light beam of which the combination of the light intensity ratios between violet light V, blue light B, green light G, and red light R is Vs2:Bs2:Gs2:Rs2 is emitted in a case where the second special observation mode is set. It is preferable that the second illumination light beam enhances deep blood vessels. For this purpose, it is preferable that the light intensity of blue light B of the second illumination light beam is set to be higher than the light intensity of the violet light V. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a ratio of the light intensity Vs2 of violet light V to the light intensity Bs2 of blue light B is set to &#x201c;1:3&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, in the normal observation mode, the first special observation mode, or the second special observation mode, the combinations of the light intensity ratios between violet light V, blue light B, green light G, and red light R, that is, the types of the illumination light beam, are different from each other. It should be noted that an observation mode using a different type of illumination light beam of which a combination of the light intensity ratios is different from the illumination light beams in these observation modes may be used.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The light source processor <b>21</b> alternately repeats specific types of illumination light beams, for example, a first period in which the first illumination light beam is continuously emitted and a second period in which the second illumination light beam is continuously emitted, in a case where the multi-observation mode is set. The light emission control performed by the light source processor <b>21</b> in the multi-observation mode will be described in detail. The first period in which the first illumination light beam is emitted is followed by the second period in which the second illumination light beam is emitted, and then the first period is repeated, and this cycle is repeated. In the present embodiment, the first period and the second period each correspond to 20 frames.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">&#x201c;Frame&#x201d; means a unit that is used to control an image pickup sensor <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) that picks up the image of the observation target. For example, &#x201c;one frame&#x201d; means a period including at least an exposure period in which the image pickup sensor <b>45</b> is exposed to light beams emitted from the observation target and a read-out period in which image signals are read out. In the present embodiment, various types of periods, such as the first period or the second period, are each defined so as to correspond to the &#x201c;frame&#x201d; that is a unit of image pickup.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The first period that is the light emission period of the first illumination light beam and the second period that is the light emission period of the second illumination light beam can be appropriately changed by a light emission period setting unit <b>22</b> that is connected to the light source processor <b>21</b>. In a case where an operation for changing the light emission period is received by the operation of the keyboard <b>19</b>, the light emission period setting unit <b>22</b> displays a light emission period setting menu shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> on the display <b>18</b>. The first period can be changed, for example, from 2 frames to 60 frames, and the respective light emission periods are assigned onto a slide bar <b>81</b><i>a. </i>The second period can be also changed, for example, from 2 frames to 60 frames, and the respective light emission periods are assigned onto a slide bar <b>81</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a case where the first period is changed, a slider <b>82</b><i>a </i>is positioned at a position on the slide bar <b>81</b><i>a </i>indicating a light emission period to be changed by the operation of the keyboard <b>19</b>, so that the first period is changed. Also in the second period, a slider <b>82</b><i>b </i>is positioned at a position on the slide bar <b>81</b><i>b </i>indicating a light emission period to be changed by the operation of the keyboard <b>19</b>, so that the second period is changed. The slide bar <b>81</b><i>b </i>is also assigned the light emission periods, for example, from 2 frames to 60 frames. In the present embodiment, in the multi-observation mode, the first period is assigned the light emission period for 20 frames through the slide bar <b>81</b><i>a, </i>and the second period is assigned the light emission period for 20 frames through the slide bar <b>81</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, the light source processor <b>21</b> performs control to switch, out of the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam, one being emitted to the other to emit the other in a target period including a time when a processing start operation for starting image storage processing is performed, when the processing start operation is performed. Therefore, illumination light beams are switched once in the target period. For example, in a case where the image storage processing is performed in the first special observation mode, the light source processor <b>21</b> switches the first illumination light beam being emitted to the second illumination light beam during the target period. In the second special observation mode, the light source processor <b>21</b> switches the second illumination light beam being emitted to the first illumination light beam during the target period. Further, in the multi-observation mode, the light source processor <b>21</b> switches the first illumination light beam to the second illumination light beam in a case where the first illumination light beam is being emitted, and switches the second illumination light beam to the first illumination light beam in a case where the second illumination light beam is being emitted. However, in a case where the illumination light beams are periodically switched in the target period as the multi-observation mode, the illumination light beams may not be necessarily further switched. The light source processor <b>21</b> is configured as described above, whereby a plurality of types of still images is stored through a single instruction.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A light beam emitted from each of the LEDs <b>20</b><i>a </i>to <b>20</b><i>d </i>is incident on a light guide <b>41</b> through an optical path coupling unit (not shown) that is composed of a mirror, a lens, or the like. The light guide <b>41</b> is incorporated in the endoscope <b>12</b> and a universal cord (a cord that connects the endoscope <b>12</b> to the light source device <b>14</b> and the processor device <b>16</b>). The light guide <b>41</b> propagates the light beam from the optical path coupling unit to the distal end portion <b>12</b><i>d </i>of the endoscope <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The distal end portion <b>12</b><i>d </i>of the endoscope <b>12</b> is provided with an illumination optical system <b>30</b><i>a </i>and an image pickup optical system <b>30</b><i>b. </i>The illumination optical system <b>30</b><i>a </i>has an illumination lens <b>42</b>, and the observation target is irradiated with the illumination light beam propagated by the light guide <b>41</b>, through the illumination lens <b>42</b>. The image pickup optical system <b>30</b><i>b </i>has an objective lens <b>43</b>, a zoom lens <b>44</b>, and an image pickup sensor <b>45</b>. Various types of light beams, such as light reflected from the observation target, scattered light, and fluorescence, are incident on the image pickup sensor <b>45</b> through the objective lens <b>43</b> and the zoom lens <b>44</b>. With this, the image of the observation target is formed on the image pickup sensor <b>45</b>. The zoom lens <b>44</b> freely moves between the telephoto end and the wide end with the operation of the zoom operation portion <b>12</b><i>h, </i>and magnifies and reduces the observation target of which the image is formed on the image pickup sensor <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The image pickup sensor <b>45</b> is a color image pickup sensor provided with any one of a red (R) color filter, a green (G) color filter, or a blue (B) color filter for each pixel, and picks up the image of the observation target to output image signals of respective RGB colors. A charge coupled device (CCD) image pickup sensor or a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image pickup sensor can be used as the image pickup sensor <b>45</b>. Alternatively, a complementary color image pickup sensor provided with color filters of complementary colors, that is, cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and green (G), may be used instead of the image pickup sensor <b>45</b> provided with color filters of the primary colors. In a case where the complementary color image pickup sensor is used, the image signals of four colors of CMYG are output. Therefore, the same RGB image signals as those of the image pickup sensor <b>45</b> can be obtained by converting the image signals of the four colors of CMYG into the image signals of the three colors of RGB through the complementary color-primary color conversion. Alternatively, a monochrome image pickup sensor that is not provided with color filters may be used instead of the image pickup sensor <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The image pickup sensor <b>45</b> is driven and controlled by an image pickup control unit (not shown). The image pickup control unit is controlled by a central control unit <b>59</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The control performed by the image pickup control unit differs depending on the respective modes. In the normal observation mode, the image pickup control unit controls the image pickup sensor <b>45</b> to pick up the image of the observation target illuminated with the normal light beam. With this, Bc image signals are output from B pixels of the image pickup sensor <b>45</b>, Gc image signals are output from G pixels thereof, and Rc image signals are output from R pixels thereof. In the special observation mode or the multi-observation mode, the image pickup control unit controls the image pickup sensor <b>45</b> to pick up the image of the observation target illuminated with a special light beam. With this, in the first special observation mode, Bs1 image signals are output from the B pixels of the image pickup sensor <b>45</b>, Gs1 image signals are output from the G pixels thereof, and Rs1 image signals are output from the R pixels thereof. Similarly, in the second special observation mode, Bs2 image signals are output from the B pixels of the image pickup sensor <b>45</b>, Gs2 image signals are output from the G pixels thereof, and Rs2 image signals are output from the R pixels thereof.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A correlated double sampling/automatic gain control (CDS/AGC) circuit <b>46</b> performs correlated double sampling (CDS) or automatic gain control (AGC) on the analog image signals obtained from the image pickup sensor <b>45</b>. The image signals that have been passed through the CDS/AGC circuit <b>46</b> are converted into digital image signals by an analog/digital (A/D) converter <b>47</b>.

Further, it is preferable to use a combination of illumination light beams with which the obtained first and second images have the same base color tone. The base color tone is a color tone that is a base in an endoscopic image, and is, for example, a color tone that occupies a large proportion of an area in the endoscopic image. In a case where the base color tone is the same even for different endoscopic images, the overall color tone does not differ significantly when compared, and it is easy to recognize the difference in parts other than the base color tone. In the first image using the first illumination light beam and the second image using the second illumination light beam as described above, examples of obtaining observation images of which the base color tones have natural color tones include performing white balance processing by using a specific gain coefficient through the DSP <b>52</b>.

With this, since the base color tones are the same first base color tone, the color tone of the part having a large proportion of the area in the endoscopic image does not change, and only the different part is enhanced and displayed.

The light intensity ratios Vs4:Bs4:Gs4:Rs4 correspond to the light amount condition of the fourth illumination light beam. It is preferable that the fourth illumination light beam enhances the superficial blood vessels and makes the image bright even in a distant view. For this purpose, it is preferable that the light intensity of blue light B, the light intensity of green light G, and the light intensity of red light R in the fourth illumination light beam are set to be slightly higher than the respective light intensities in the third illumination light beam.

The third illumination light beam is set as an illumination light beam that enhances the superficial blood vessels, and the fourth illumination light beam is set as an illumination light beam that enhances the superficial blood vessels and that makes the image bright even in a distant view, and the third illumination light beam and the fourth illumination light beam are automatically switched at a fixed cycle. With this, since the base color tones are the second base color tone, the color tone of the part having a large proportion of the area in the endoscopic image does not change, and only the different part is enhanced and displayed.

The preset period starting from the time when light emission is switched between the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam is defined as a post-switching period. Although it is not important whether light emission is switched between the first illumination light beam and the second illumination light beam because the user switches between the observation modes or because the light source processor <b>21</b> periodically switches between the illumination light beams in the multi-observation mode, the light source processor <b>21</b> switches and emits illumination light beams through the processing start operation in a case where the processing start operation is performed after the post-switching period starting from the time when light emission is switched between the illumination light beams is passed.
