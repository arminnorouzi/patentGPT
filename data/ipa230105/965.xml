FimH binds to manosylated uroplakin receptors in the uroepithelium whereas FmIH binds to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine O-glycans on epithelial surface proteins in the kidney and inflamed bladder. FimH fimbriae also play a role in colonization of enterotoxigenic <i>E. coli </i>(ETEC) and multidrug-resistant invasive <i>E. coli </i>in the gut through binding to highly mannosylated proteins on the intestinal epithelia.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Full length FimH is composed of two domains: the N-terminal lectin domain and the C-terminal pilin domain, which are connected by a short linker. The lectin domain of FimH contains the carbohydrate recognition domain, which is responsible for binding to the mannosylated uroplakin 1a on the urothelial cell surface. The pilin domain is anchored to the core of the pilus via a donor strand of the subsequent FimG subunit, which is a process termed donor strand complementation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conformation and ligand-binding properties of the lectin domain of FimH are under the allosteric control of the pilin domain of FimH. Under static conditions, the interaction of the two domains of full length FimH stabilizes the lectin domain in the low-affinity to monomannose (for example, K<sub>d</sub>&#x2dc;300 &#x3bc;M) state, which is characterized by a shallow binding pocket. Binding to a mannoside ligand induces a conformational change leading to a medium affinity state, where the lectin and pilin domains remain in close contact. However, upon shear stress, the lectin and pilin domains separate, thereby inducing the high-affinity state (for example, K<sub>d</sub>&#x3c;1.2 &#x3bc;M).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Because of the absence of negative allosteric regulation exerted by the pilin domain, the isolated lectin domain of FimH is locked in the high-affinity state. The isolated, recombinant lectin domain, which is locked in the high-affinity state, exhibits high stability. Locking the adhesin in a low-binding conformation, however, induces the production of adhesion-inhibiting antibodies. Accordingly, there is an interest in stabilizing the lectin domain in the low-affinity state.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is an additional interest in methods to express FimH in high yields sufficient for product development. An impediment for development of compositions that include FimH is the low yield achieved with FimH expressed in its native state in the <i>E. coli </i>periplasm. Typical yields reported at lab-bench scale are 3-5 mg/L for the purified FimCH complex and 4-10 mg/L for FimH(LD), which are below levels considered scalable for the manufacturing of clinical trial material. The in vivo conformation of FimH is different from the conformation attained by a purified recombinant form of the protein. In general, FimH has a native conformation that is at least partly determined by the in vivo interaction of FimH with its periplasmic chaperone protein, called FimC.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Recombinant production of FimH remains challenging. Protein expression and purification is not a routine process.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To meet these and other needs, the present invention relates to compositions and methods of use thereof for producing recombinant adhesin proteins and for eliciting immune responses against <i>E. coli </i>serotypes.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, the invention relates to a recombinant mammalian cell, including a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof.

As exemplified in the present disclosure throughout and in the Examples section, it was discovered that mammalian cell expression of the recombinant polypeptides consistently achieved high yields as compared to expression of the polypeptides in <i>E. coli</i>. In addition, the inventors surprisingly identified mutations and expression constructs to stabilize the recombinant polypeptides and fragments thereof in a desirable conformation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Blocking the primary stages of infection, namely bacterial attachment to host cell receptors and colonization of the mucosal surface, is important to prevent, treat, and/or reduce the likelihood of bacterial infections. Bacterial attachment may involve an interaction between a bacterial surface protein called an adhesin and the host cell receptor. Previous preclinical studies with the FimH adhesin (derived from uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i>) have confirmed that antibodies are elicited against an adhesin. Advances in the identification, characterization, and isolation of adhesins are needed in an effort to prevent infections, from otitis media and dental caries to pneumonia and sepsis.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">To produce adhesin proteins such as FimH and fragments thereof at a commercial scale, there is a need to identify suitable constructs and suitable hosts, such that the polypeptide and fragments thereof may be expressed in sufficient amounts for a sustained period of time and in the preferred conformation. For example, in some embodiments, the preferred conformation of the recombinant polypeptide exhibits a low affinity (for example, K<sub>d</sub>&#x2dc;300 &#x3bc;M) for monomannose. In some embodiments, the preferred conformation exhibits a high affinity (for example, K<sub>d</sub>&#x3c;1.2 &#x3bc;M) for monomannose.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Adhesin proteins derived from <i>E. coli </i>have been recombinantly expressed in <i>E. coli </i>cells. However, the yields have been less than 10 mg/L. Purifying large amounts of pilus-associated adhesin may be challenging when produced in <i>E. coli</i>. Without being bound by theory or mechanism, it has been suggested that the product as expressed in <i>E. coli </i>may exhibit a conformation that is not optimal for eliciting an effective immune response in mammals.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one aspect, the invention includes a recombinant mammalian cell that includes a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide derived from a bacterial adhesin protein or fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another aspect, the invention includes a process for producing the polypeptide or fragment thereof in a mammalian cell, including: (i) culturing the mammalian cell under a suitable condition, thereby expressing said polypeptide or fragment thereof; and (ii) harvesting said polypeptide or fragment thereof from the culture. The process may further include purifying the polypeptide or fragment thereof. Also disclosed herein is a polypeptide or fragment thereof produced by this process.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another aspect, the invention includes a composition including the polypeptide or fragment thereof described herein. The composition may include a polypeptide or fragment thereof that is suitable for in vivo administration. For example, the polypeptide or fragment thereof in such a composition may have a purity of at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99%, by mass. The composition may further comprise an adjuvant.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a further aspect, the invention includes a composition for use in inducing an immune response against <i>E. coli</i>. Use of the composition described herein for inducing an immune response against <i>E. coli </i>and use of the composition described herein in the manufacture of a medicament for inducing an immune response against <i>E. coli</i>, are also disclosed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0000">I.

Such extensions may include one or more tags, which may facilitate detection (e.g. an epitope tag for detection by monoclonal antibodies) and/or purification (e.g. a polyhistidine-tag to allow purification on a nickel-chelating resin) of the polypeptide or fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the tag includes the amino acid sequence selected from any one of SEQ ID NO: 21 and SEQ ID NO: 25. Such affinity-purification tags are known in the art. Examples of affinity-purification tags include, e.g., His tag (hexahistidine, which may, for example, bind to metal ion), maltose-binding protein (MBP), which may, for example, bind to amylose), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), which may, for example, bind to glutathione, FLAG tag, which may, for example, bind to an anti-flag antibody), Strep tag, which may, for example, bind to streptavidin or a derivative thereof). In preferred embodiments, the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof does not include additional amino acid residues, such as N-terminal or C-terminal extensions. In some embodiments, the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof described herein does not include an exogenous tag sequence.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">While specific strains of <i>E. coli </i>may be referenced herein, it should be understood that the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof are not limited to specific strains unless specified.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">In some embodiments, the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>FimH or a fragment thereof includes a phenylalanine residue at the N-terminus of the polypeptide. In some embodiments, the polypeptide derived from FimH or fragment thereof includes a phenylalanine residue within the first 20 residue positions of the N-terminus.

For example, in some embodiments, the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>FimH or a fragment thereof does not include an additional glycine residue at the N-terminus of the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>FimH or a fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">In some embodiments, the phenylalanine residue at position 1 of the wild-type mature <i>E. coli </i>FimH is replaced by an aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid, such as, for example, any one of IIe, Leu and Val residues.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">In some embodiments, a signal peptide may be used for expressing the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof. Signal sequences and expression cassettes for producing proteins are known in the art. In general, leader peptides are 5-30 amino acids long, and are typically present at the N-terminus of a newly synthesized polypeptide. The signal peptide generally contains a long stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that has a tendency to form a single alpha-helix. In addition, many signal peptides begin with a short positively charged stretch of amino acids, which may help to enforce proper topology of the polypeptide during translocation. At the end of the signal peptide there is typically a stretch of amino acids that is recognized and cleaved by signal peptidase. Signal peptidase may cleave either during or after completion of translocation to generate a free signal peptide and a mature protein. In some embodiments, the signal peptide includes the amino acid sequence having at least 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.9%, or 100% identity to any one of SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, and SEQ ID NO: 22.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">In some embodiments, the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof described herein may include a cleavable linker. Such linkers allow for the tag to be separated from the purified complex, for example by the addition of an agent capable of cleaving the linker. Cleavable linkers are known in the art. Such linkers may be cleaved for example, by irradiation of a photolabile bond or acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Another example of a cleavable linker includes a polypeptide linker, which incorporates a protease recognition site and may be cleaved by the addition of a suitable protease enzyme.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">In some embodiments, the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof includes a modification as compared to the corresponding wild-type <i>E. coli </i>FimH polypeptide or fragment. The modification may include a covalent attachment of a molecule to the polypeptide. For example, such modifications may include glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. In some embodiments, the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof may include a modification, such as by chemical modifications using techniques known to those of skill in the art, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc., as compared to a corresponding wild-type <i>E. coli </i>FimH polypeptide or fragment. In another embodiment, the modification may include a covalent attachment of a lipid molecule to the polypeptide. In some embodiments, the polypeptide does not include a covalent attachment of a molecule to the polypeptide as compared to the corresponding wild-type <i>E. coli </i>FimH polypeptide or fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">For example, proteins and polypeptides produced in cell culture may be glycoproteins that contain covalently linked carbohydrate structures including oligosaccharide chains. These oligosaccharide chains are linked to the protein via either N-linkages or O-linkages. The oligosaccharide chains may comprise a significant portion of the mass of the glycoprotein. Generally, N-linked oligosaccharide is added to the amino group on the side chain of an asparagine residue within the target consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X may be any amino acid except proline. In some embodiments, the glycosylation site includes an amino acid sequence selected from any one of the following: asparagine-glycine-threonine (NGT), asparagine-isoleucine-threonine (NIT), asparagine-glycine-serine (NGS), asparagine-serine-threonine (NST), and asparagine-threonine-serine (NTS). The polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof produced in mammalian cells may by glycosylated. The glycosylation may occur at the N-linked glycosylation signal Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr in the sequence of the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof. &#x201c;N-linked glycosylation&#x201d; refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety via GlcNAc to an asparagine residue in a polypeptide chain. The N-linked carbohydrate contains a common Man 1-6(Man1-3)Man&#x3b2;1-4GlcNAc&#x3b2;1-4GlcNAc&#x3b2;-R core structure, where R represents an asparagine residue of the produced polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">In some embodiments, a glycosylation site in the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof is removed by a mutation within the sequence of the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof.

In some embodiments, a compound to decrease or inhibit glycosylation may be added to the cell culture medium. In such embodiments, the polypeptide or protein includes at least one more unglycosylated (i.e., aglycosylated) site, that is, a completely unoccupied glycan site with no carbohydrate moiety attached thereto, or comprises at least one carbohydrate moiety less at the same potential glycosylation site than an otherwise identical polypeptide or protein which is produced by a cell under otherwise identical conditions but in the absence of a glycosylation inhibiting compound.

IRES and 2A peptide provides alternative approaches for co-expression of multiple sequences. IRES is a nucleotide sequence that allows for translation initiation in the middle of a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence as part of the greater process of protein synthesis. Usually, in eukaryotes, translation may be initiated only at the 5&#x2032; end of the mRNA molecule. IRES elements allow expression of multiple genes in one transcript. IRES-based polycistronic vectors, which express multiple proteins from one transcript, mayreduce the escape of non-expressing clones from selection. The 2A peptide allows translation of multiple proteins in a single open reading frame into a polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into individual proteins through a ribosome-skipping mechanism. 2A peptide mayprovide more balanced expression of multiple protein products. Exemplary IRES sequences include, e.g., EV71 IRES, EMCV IRES, HCV IRES. For genomic integration, the integration may be site-specific or random. Site-specific recombination may be achieved by introducing homologous sequence(s) into the nucleic acid constructs described herein. Such homologous sequence substantially matches the endogenous sequence at a specific target site in the host genome. Alternatively, random integration may be used. Sometimes, the expression level of a protein may vary depending upon the integration site.

In one non-limiting embodiment, the culture conditions are shifted by shifting the temperature of the culture.

See, for example, Table 21. Methods of determining the length of saccharides are known in the art. Such methods include nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography, as described in Example 13.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0276">Methods of determining the number of repeat units in the saccharide are also known in the art. For example, the number of repeat units (or &#x201c;n&#x201d; in the Formula) may be calculated by dividing the molecular weight of the polysaccharide (without the molecular weight of the core saccharide or KDO residue) by the molecular weight of the repeat unit (i.e., molecular weight of the structure in the corresponding Formula, shown for example in Table 1, which may be theoretically calculated as the sum of the molecular weight of each monosaccharide within the Formula). The molecular weight of each monosaccharide within the Formula is known in the art. The molecular weight of a repeat unit of Formula O25b, for example, is about 862 Da. The molecular weight of a repeat unit of Formula O1a, for example, is about 845 Da. The molecular weight of a repeat unit of Formula O2, for example, is about 829 Da. The molecular weight of a repeat unit of Formula O6, for example, is about 893 Da. When determining the number of repeat units in a conjugate, the carrier protein molecular weight and the protein:polysaccharide ratio is factored into the calculation. As defined herein, &#x201c;n&#x201d; refers to the number of repeating units (represented in brackets in Table 1) in a polysaccharide molecule. As is known in the art, in biological macromolecules, repeating structures may be interspersed with regions of imperfect repeats, such as, for example, missing branches. In addition, it is known in the art that polysaccharides isolated and purified from natural sources such as bacteria may be heterogenous in size and in branching. In such a case, n may represent an average or median value for n for the molecules in a population.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0277">In one embodiment, the O-polysaccharide has an increase of at least one repeat unit of an O-antigen, as compared to the corresponding wild-type O-polysaccharide.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;glycoconjugate&#x201d; refers to a saccharide covalently linked to a carrier protein. In one embodiment a saccharide is linked directly to a carrier protein. In another embodiment, a saccharide is linked to a protein through a spacer/linker. Conjugates may be prepared by schemes that bind the carrier to the O-antigen at one or at multiple sites along the O-antigen, or by schemes that activate at least one residue of the core oligosaccharide.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0304">In one embodiment, each saccharide is conjugated to the same carrier protein. If the protein carrier is the same for 2 or more saccharides in the composition, the saccharides may be conjugated to the same molecule of the carrier protein (e.g., carrier molecules having 2 or more different saccharides conjugated to it).</p><p id="p-0310" num="0305">In a preferred embodiment, the saccharides are each individually conjugated to different molecules of the protein carrier (each molecule of protein carrier only having one type of saccharide conjugated to it). In said embodiment, the saccharides are said to be individually conjugated to the carrier protein.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0306">The chemical activation of the saccharides and subsequent conjugation to the carrier protein can be achieved by the activation and conjugation methods disclosed herein. After conjugation of the polysaccharide to the carrier protein, the glycoconjugates are purified (enriched with respect to the amount of polysaccharide-protein conjugate) by a variety of techniques. These techniques include concentration/diafiltration operations, precipitation/elution, column chromatography, and depth filtration. After the individual glycoconjugates are purified, they are compounded to formulate the immunogenic composition of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0307">Activation. The present invention further relates to activated polysaccharides produced from any of the embodiments described herein wherein the polysaccharide is activated with a chemical reagent to produce reactive groups for conjugation to a linker or carrier protein. In some embodiments, the saccharide of the invention is activated prior to conjugation to the carrier protein. In some embodiments, the degree of activation does not significantly reduce the molecular weight of the polysaccharide. For example, in some embodiments, the degree of activation does not cleave the polysaccharide backbone. In some embodiments, the degree of activation does not significantly impact the degree of conjugation, as measured by the number of lysine residues modified in the carrier protein, such as, CRM<sub>197 </sub>(as determined by amino acid analysis). For example, in some embodiments, the degree of activation does not significantly increase the number of lysine residues modified (as determined by amino acid analysis) in the carrier protein by 3-fold, as compared to the number of lysine residues modified in the carrier protein of a conjugate with a reference polysaccharide at the same degree of activation. In some embodiments, the degree of activation does not increase the level of unconjugated free saccharide. In some embodiments, the degree of activation does not decrease the optimal saccharide/protein ratio.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0308">In some embodiments, the activated saccharide has a percentage of activation wherein moles of thiol per saccharide repeat unit of the activated saccharide is between 1-100%, such as, for example, between 2-80%, between 2-50%, between 3-30%, and between 4-25%. The degree of activation is at least 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, &#x2265;20%, &#x2265;30%, &#x2265;40%, 50%, &#x2265;60%, &#x2265;70%, &#x2265;80%, or &#x2265;90%, or about 100%. Preferably, the degree of activation is at most 50%, more preferably at most 25%. In one embodiment, the degree of activation is at most 20%.

The activated polysaccharide is then coupled directly or via a spacer (linker) group to an amino group on the carrier protein (preferably CRM<sub>197 </sub>or tetanus toxoid).</p><p id="p-0315" num="0310">For example, the spacer may be cystamine or cysteamine to give a thiolated polysaccharide which could be coupled to the carrier via a thioether linkage obtained after reaction with a maleimide-activated carrier protein (for example using N&#x2014;[Y-maleimidobutyrloxy]succinimide ester (GMBS)) or a haloacetylated carrier protein (for example using iodoacetimide, N-succinimidyl bromoacetate (SBA; SIB), N-succinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)aminobenzoate (SIAB), sulfosuccinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)aminobenzoate (sulfo-SIAB), N-succinimidyl iodoacetate (SIA), or succinimidyl 3-[bromoacetamido]proprionate (SBAP)). In one embodiment, the cyanate ester (optionally made by CDAP chemistry) is coupled with hexane diamine or adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) and the amino-derivatised saccharide is conjugated to the carrier protein (e.g., CRM<sub>197</sub>) using carbodiimide (e.g., EDAC or EDC) chemistry via a carboxyl group on the protein carrier.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0311">Other suitable techniques for conjugation use carbodiimides, hydrazides, active esters, norborane, p-nitrobenzoic acid, N-hydroxysuccinimide, S&#x2014;NHS, EDC, TSTU. Conjugation may involve a carbonyl linker which may be formed by reaction of a free hydroxyl group of the saccharide with CDI followed by reaction with a protein to form a carbamate linkage. This may involve reduction of the anomeric terminus to a primary hydroxyl group, optional protection/deprotection of the primary hydroxyl group, reaction of the primary hydroxyl group with CDI to form a CDI carbamate intermediate and coupling the CDI carbamate intermediate with an amino group on a protein (CDI chemistry).</p><p id="p-0317" num="0312">Molecular weight.

Immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides contain one or more immunostimulatory CpG motifs that are unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides, optionally within certain preferred base contexts. The methylation status of the CpG immunostimulatory motif generally refers to the cytosine residue in the dinucleotide. An immunostimulatory oligonucleotide containing at least one unmethylated CpG dinucleotide is an oligonucleotide which contains a 5&#x2032; unmethylated cytosine linked by a phosphate bond to a 3&#x2032; guanine, and which activates the immune system through binding to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9). In another embodiment the immunostimulatory oligonucleotide may contain one or more methylated CpG dinucleotides, which will activate the immune system through TLR9 but not as strongly as if the CpG motif(s) was/were unmethylated.

Thus, if the delivery vehicle does not somehow &#x201c;escape&#x201d; from the endosome before it becomes a lysosome, it will be degraded and will not perform its function.

Such a nanostructure can then be used to package or encapsulate a cargo molecule with the opposite net charge due to the electrostatic interaction between the nanostructure interior surface and the cargo molecule. In one non-limiting embodiment, surface amino acid residues on the nanostructure-related polypeptides can be mutated primarily to Arginine or Lysine residues in order to endow the interior surface of the self-assembling nanostructure with a net positive charge.

non-limiting example relates to producing a polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof in a HEK cell line. The yields were relatively high, as compared to expression of the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof in an <i>E. coli </i>host cell.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0417">To accomplish the production of FimH variants from mammalian cells, a SignalP prediction algorithm was used to analyze different heterologous signal sequences for secretion of proteins and fragments. The wild type FimH leader sequence was also analyzed. The predictions indicated that the wild type FimH leader sequence may work for secretion of the FimH variants in mammalian cells, however, the secreted variant was predicted to be cleaved at the W20 residue of the full-length wild type FimH (see SEQ ID NO: 1), rather than the F22 residue of the full-length wild type FimH (see SEQ ID NO: 1). A hemagglutinin signal sequence was predicted not to work. The murine IgK signal sequence was predicted to produce an N-terminus of F22 of SEQ ID NO: 1, or F1 residue of the mature protein.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0418">Based on these analyses, DNA was synthesized and recombinantly produced constructs to express the FimH lectin binding domain with the wild-type FimH leader. Constructs were also prepared to express the FimH lectin binding domain with the mlgK signal sequence. Affinity purification tags, such as His tag, were introduced to the C-terminus of the polypeptide derived from <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment thereof to facilitate purification.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0419">The expression plasmid was transfected into HEK host cells, namely EXP1293 mammalian cells.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0420">The polypeptides or fragments thereof derived from <i>E. coli </i>were successfully expressed. For example, the preferred N-terminal processing using the mlgK signal sequence fused to the mature start of FimH at F22 was demonstrated for the pSB01892 FimHdscG construct by MS. The processing is believed correct for the lectin domain construct pSB01878 and the mass spec data supports this.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0421">The preferred N-terminal processing (i.e., processing at F22 of SEQ ID NO: 1) was not shown with the native FimH leader peptide.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0422">pSB01877 and pSB01878 constructs are in pcDNA3.1(+) mammalian expression vectors. The cells were diluted and subsequently used in 20 ml transfections. 1 ug/ml DNA for each construct was used and transfected cells in 125 ml flasks using Expifectamine protocol. After 72 hours, the cell viability was still good so the expression was allowed to continue until 96 hours. Samples were taken at 72 hours and ran 10 ul of each on SDS PAGE gels to check for expression.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0423">After 96 hours, conditioned media was harvested and O.25 ml of Nickel Excel resin was added with batch binding O/N at 4&#xb0; C. with rotation.

These were cloned into a pBudCE4.1 mammalian expression vector (ThermoFisher) and a C-term His tag was added to the FimC. The FimC variant was designed for secretion using the mlgK signal peptide as it resulted in a postive prediction to yield the G37 FimC as the first residue of the mature protein based on SignalP analysis.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0429">More specifically, these constructs were designed to have the FimC fragment under the EF1alpha promoter in the vector pBudCE4.1 and the FimH fragment inserts under the CMV promoter in the same vector. The vector pBudCE4.1 is an expression vector from Thermo Fisher that has 2 promoters for expression in mammalian cells. The FimC fragment insert (pSB01881 insert) was subcloned by digesting with NotI and XhoI and subcloning into the pBudCE4.1 vector at the same sites. These were plated onto 2&#xd7;YT zeocin 50 ug/ml plates. Colonies were inoculated into 2&#xd7;YT with zeocin 50 ug/ml, grew overnight at 37&#xb0; C. and plasmid prepped. These were digested with NotI and XhoI to check for insert and all colonies had insert size of &#x2dc;722 bp.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0430">pSB01881 was digested with HindIII and BamHI and the pSB01879 insert and pSB01880 insert DNA was digested with HindIII and BamHI. These fragments were gel isolated and subcloned into the pSB01881 vector and plated onto 2&#xd7;YTzeo50 ug/ml plates. Colonies from each were inoculated into 2&#xd7;YT zeo50 ug/ml, grown overnight at 37&#xb0; C., plasmid prepped and digested with NotI and XhoI to test for FimC insert and HindIII and BamHI to test for FimH inserts. All clones had expected sized inserts at both cloning sites. The pSB01879-1 and pSB01880-1 clones were subsequently used for expression.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0431">The FimH/FimC complex has been demonstrated to express in EXP1293 cells as well.

Changes at the N-terminal &#x3b1;-amino group, such as by adding an amino acid at the N-terminus ahead of Phe1 of the FimH protein can abolish the hydrogen bond interactions with O2-, O5- and O6-atoms of the O-mannose and introduce steric repulsion with D-mannose, thereby blocking mannose binding. This is confirmed with our experimental observation that adding an extra Gly residue ahead of the Phe1 of SEQ ID NO: 2 leads to no detection of mannose binding.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0447">Following an analysis of the crystal structure of FimH bound to D-mannose, the following were observed: The N-Terminal &#x3b1;-amino group of Phe1 along with sidechains of Asp54 of the FimH according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 2 and Gln133 of the FimH according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 2 provide critical polar recognition motifs for D-mannose, and mutations and changes of these polar interactions lead to no mannose binding.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 7: The Sidechain of Phe1 in FimH does not Interact Directly with D-Mannose but is Rather Buried Inside of FimH, Suggesting that Phe1 can be Replaced by Other Residues, e.g. Aliphatic Hydrophobic Residues (Lie, Leu, or Val)</heading><p id="p-0464" num="0448">Analysis of crystal structures of FimH in complex with D-mannose and its analogs (e.g. PDB ID: 1QUN) shows that the sidechain of Phe1 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 2) does not interact directly with D-mannose but rather stabilizes the binding pocket by stacking its aromatic rings with the sidechains of Val56, Tyr95, GIn133 and Phe144 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 2).</p><p id="p-0465" num="0449">Alternative N-terminal residue instead of Phe may stabilize the FimH protein, accommodate mannose binding, and allow correct signal peptide cleavage. Such residues may be identified by suitable method known in the art, such as by visual inspection of a crystal structure of FimH, or more quantitative selection using computational protein design software, such as BioLuminate&#x2122; [BioLuminate, Schrodinger LLC, New York, 2017], Discovery Studio&#x2122; [<i>Discovery Studio Modeling Environment, Dassault Syst&#xe8;mes</i>, San Diego, 2017], MOE&#x2122; [Molecular Operating Environment, Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, 2017], and Rosetta&#x2122; [Rosetta, University of Washington, Seattle, 2017].

In addition, residue Asn7 is solvent exposed and followed with a Gly residue, making it very prone to deamidation.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0451">Analysis of crystal structures of FimH in complex with D-mannose and its analogs (e.g. PDB ID: 1QUN) indicates that Asn7 is more than 20 A away from the mannose binding site and a mutation at the site should not impact mannose binding. Thus, mutations of Asn7 to other amino acids (e.g. Ser, Asp and Gln) can effectively remove the putative N-glycosylation site and prevent deamidation.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 9<i>: E. coli </i>and <i>S. enterica </i>Strains</heading><p id="p-0468" num="0452">Clinical strains and derivatives are listed in Table 10.

Long O-Antigen Expression Conferred by Heterologous Polymerase Chain Length Regulators</heading><p id="p-0479" num="0460">Initial <i>E. coli </i>strain construction focused on the O25 serotype. Goal was to overexpress heterologous wzzB or fepE genes to see if they confer longer chain length in O25 wzzB knockout strains. First, blood isolates were screened by PCR to identify strains of the O25a and O25b subtype. Next, strains were screened for sensitivity to ampicillin. A single ampicillin-sensitive O25b isolate GAR2401 was identified into which a wzzB deletion was introduced. Similarly, a wzzB deletion was made in O25a strain O25K5H1. For genetic complementation of these mutations, wzzB genes from GAR 2401 and O25K5H1 were subcloned into the high copy PCR-Blunt II cloning vector and introduced into both strains by electroporation. Additional wzzB genes from <i>E. coli </i>K-12 and <i>S. enterica </i>serovar <i>Typhimurium </i>LT2 were similarly cloned and transferred; likewise fepE genes from <i>E. coli </i>O25K5H1, GAR 2401, O25a ETEC NR-5, O157:H7:K- and <i>S. enterica </i>serovar <i>Typhimurium </i>LT2.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0461">Bacteria were grown overnight in LB medium and LPS was extracted with phenol, resolved by SDS PAGE (4-12% acrylamide) and stained. Each well of the gel was loaded with LPS extracted from the same number of bacterial cells (approximately 2 OD<sub>600 </sub>units). Size of LPS was estimated from an internal native <i>E. coli </i>LPS standard and by counting the ladder discernable from a subset of samples showing a broad distribution of chain lengths (differing by one repeat unit). On the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>, LPS profiles of plasmid transformants of O25a O25K5HawzzB are shown; and on the right, analogous profiles of O25b GAR 2401&#x394;wzzB transformants.

Introduction of the O25b wzzB gene from GAR2401 does not, suggesting the WzzB enzyme from this strain is defective. A comparison of <i>E. coli </i>WzzB amino acid sequences suggests that A21 OE and P253S substitutions may be responsible. Significantly, <i>Salmonella </i>LT2 fepE and <i>E. coli </i>fepE from O25a O25K5H1 conferred the ability to express very long (VL) OAg LPS, with the <i>Salmonella </i>LT2 fepE resulting in OAg exceeding in size that conferred by <i>E. coli </i>fepE.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0463">A similar pattern of expression was observed with GAR2401&#x394;wzzB transformants: <i>E. coli O</i>25a or K12 strain wzzB restored ability to produce short LPS. The <i>Salmonella </i>LT2 fepE generated the longest LPS, the <i>E. coli </i>fepE a slightly shorter LPS, while the <i>Salmonella </i>LT2 wzzB yielded an intermediate sized long LPS (L). The ability of other <i>E. coli </i>fepE genes to produce very long LPS was assessed in a separate experiment with transformants of <i>E. coli </i>O25aIwzzB. The fepE genes from GAR2401, an O25a ETEC strain and an O157 <i>Shigella </i>toxin producing strain also conferred the ability to produce very long LPS, but not as long as the LPS generated with the <i>Salmonella </i>LT2 fepE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0483" num="0464">Having established in serotype O25a and O25b strains that <i>Salmonella </i>LT2 fepE generates the longest LPS of the polymerase regulators evaluated, we next sought to determine whether it would also produce very long LPS in other <i>E. coli </i>serotypes.

The results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> confirm that <i>Salmonella </i>fepE can confer the ability to make very long LPS in other prevalent serotypes associated with blood-infections. Results also show that plasmid-based expression of <i>Salmonella </i>fepE appears to override the control of chain length normally exerted by endogenous wzzB in these strains. 1.2. Plasmid-based expression of O-antigens in a common <i>E. coli </i>host strain. From the perspective of bioprocess development, the ability to produce O-antigens of different serotypes in a common <i>E. coli </i>host instead of multiple strains would greatly simplify the manufacturing of individual antigens. To this end, O-antigen gene clusters from different serotypes were amplified by PCR and cloned into a low-copy number plasmid (pBAD33) under control of an arabinose regulated promoter. This plasmid is compatible (can coexist) with the <i>Salmonella </i>LT2 fepE plasmid in <i>E. coli </i>as it harbors a different (p15a) replicon and different selectable marker (chloramphenicol vs kanamycin). In a first experiment, a pBAD33 O25b operon plasmid subclone was cotransfected with the <i>Salmonella </i>LT2 fepE plasmid into GAR2401&#x394;wzzB and transformants grown in the presence or absence of 0.2% arabinose. Results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>B</figref> demonstrated that very long O-antigen LPS was produced in an arabinose-dependent manner.</p><p id="p-0484" num="0465">O-antigen gene clusters cloned from other serotypes were similarly evaluated and the results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. Co-expression of <i>Salmonella </i>LT2 fepE and pBAD33-OAg plasmids resulted in detectable long chain LPS corresponding to O1, O2 (for two out of four clones), O16, O21 and O75 serotypes. For unknown reasons, the pBAD33-O6 plasmid failed to yield detectable LPS in all four isolates tested. Although expression level was variable, results show that expression of long chain O-antigens in a common host is feasible.

In contrast, O25b OAg-specific IgG mean fluorescence intensity values (MFIs) of approximately ten-fold above pre-immune serum levels were observed in PD4 sera from three out of four rabbits vaccinated with O25b OAg-CRM<sub>197</sub>, across a range of serum dilutions (from 1:100 to 1:6400).

Negative control K-12 strain which lacks the ability to express OAg showed only very weak binding of PD3 antibodies, most likely due to the presence of exposed inner core oligosaccharide epitopes on its surface. Introduction of the <i>Salmonella </i>fepE plasmid into the wild-type O25b isolates resulted in significantly enhanced staining, consistent with the higher density of immunogenic epitopes provided by the longer OAg polysaccharide.</p><p id="p-0493" num="0473">Conclusion: The results described show that not only is <i>Salmonella </i>fepE the determinant of very long O-antigen polysaccharides in <i>Salmonella </i>species, but that it also can confer on <i>E. coli </i>strains of different O-antigen serotypes the ability to make very long OAgs. This property can be exploited to produce O-antigen vaccine polysaccharides with improved properties for bioprocess development, by facilitating purification and chemical conjugation to appropriate carrier proteins, and by potentially enhancing immunogenicity through the formation of higher molecular weight complexes.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="1">Example 14: Initial Rabbit Studies Generated First Polyclonal Antibody Reagents and IgG Responses to RAC O25b OAg-CRM<sub>197 </sub></heading><p id="p-0494" num="0474">Long chain O25b polysaccharide-CRM<sub>197 </sub>conjugates were produced using periodate oxidation followed by conjugation using reductive amination chemistry (RAC) (Table 14).

Different serotype of O-antigen repeating units differ in their composition, structure and serological features. The O-antigen used in this invention is attached to the core domain which contains a sugar unit called 2-Keto-3-deoxyoctanoic acid (KDO) at its chain terminus.

The production of each polysaccharide included a batch production fermentation followed by chemical inactivation prior to downstream purification.</p><p id="p-0573" num="0537">Strains and storage. Strains employed for biosynthesis of short chain O-antigen were clinical wild type strains of <i>E. coli</i>. Long chain O-antigen was produced with derivatives of the short chain-producers that had been engineered by the Wanner-Datsenko method to possess a deletion of the native wzzb gene and were complemented by the &#x201c;long-chain&#x201d; extender function fepE from <i>Salmonella</i>. The fepE function was expressed from its native promoter on either a high copy colE1-based &#x201c;topo&#x201d; vector or a low copy derivative of the colE1-based vector pET30a, from which the T7 promoter region had been deleted.</p><p id="p-0574" num="0538">Cell banks were prepared by growing cells in either animal free LB or minimal medium to an OD<sub>600 </sub>of at least 3.0. The broth was then diluted in fresh medium and combined with 80% glycerol to obtain a 20% glycerol final concentration with 2.0 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL.</p><p id="p-0575" num="0539">Media used for seed culture and fermentation. The seed and fermentation medium employed share the following formulation: KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, sodium citrate, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, aspartic acid, glucose, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, FeSO<sub>4</sub>-7H<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, CoCl<sub>2</sub>-6H<sub>2</sub>O, CuCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O, MnCl<sub>2</sub>-4H<sub>2</sub>O, ZnCl<sub>2 </sub>and CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p id="p-0576" num="0540">Seed and fermentation conditions. Seeds were inoculated at 0.1% from a single seed vial. The seed flask was incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 16-18 hours and typically achieved 10-20 ODeoo/mL.</p><p id="p-0577" num="0541">Fermentation was performed in a 10 L stainless steel, steam in place fermentor.</p><p id="p-0578" num="0542">Inoculation of the fermentor was typically 1:1000 from a 10 OD<sub>600 </sub>seed. The batch phase, which is the period during which growth proceeds on the 10 g/L batched glucose, typically lasts 8 hours. Upon glucose exhaustion, there was a sudden rise in dissolved oxygen, at which point glucose was fed to the fermentation. The fermentation typically then proceeds for 16-18 hours with harvest giving &#x3e;120 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL.</p><p id="p-0579" num="0543">Initial evaluation of short/long chain O-antigen production for serotypes O1a, O2, O6 and O25b. Wild type strains for O1a, O2, O6 and O25b were fermented in a supplemented minimal medium in batch mode to an OD<sub>600</sub>=15-20. Upon glucose exhaustion, which results in a sudden decrease in oxygen consumption, a growth limiting glucose feed was applied from a glucose solution for 16-18 hours. Cell densities of 124-145 OD<sub>600 </sub>units/mL were reached. The pH of the harvest broths was subsequently adjusted to about 3.8 and heated to 95&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. The hydrolyzed broth was then cooled to 25&#xb0; C., brought to pH 6.0 and centrifuged to remove solids. The resulting supernatant was then applied to a SEC-HPLC column for quantitation of the O-antigen. Productivities in the range of 2240-4180 mg/L were obtained. The molecular weight of purified short-chain O-antigen from these batches was found to range from 10-15 kDa. It was also noted that SEC chromatography of the 02 and O6 hydrolysates revealed a distinct and separable contaminating polysaccharide that was not evident in the O1a and O25b hydrolysates.</p><p id="p-0580" num="0544">Long chain versions of the O1a, O2, O6 and O25b O-antigens where accessed through fermentation of a wzzb deletion version of each strain which carried a heterologous, complementing fepE gene on a high-copy, kanamycin-selectable topo plasmid. Fermentation was performed as for the short chain, albeit with kanamycin selection. The final cell densities observed at 124-177 ODeoo/mL were associated with O-antigen productivities of 3500-9850 mg/L. The complementation-based synthesis of long chain O-antigen was at least as productive as in the parental short chain strain and in some cases more so. The molecular weights of purified O-antigen polysaccharide were 33-49 kDa or about 3 times the size of the corresponding short chain.</p><p id="p-0581" num="0545">It was noted that the long chain hydrolysates for O2 and O6 showed evidence of a contaminating polysaccharide peak that, in the case of long chain antigen, was observed as a shoulder on the main O-antigen peak; O1 and O25b showed no evidence of production of a contaminating polysaccharide, as was seen earlier with the short chain parent.</p><p id="p-0582" num="0546">Growth rate suppression was found to be associated with the presence of the topo replicon absent the fepE. Additionally, the &#x394;wzzb mutation itself had not adverse effect on growth rate, indicating that the disturbed growth rates were conveyed by the plasmid vector.</p><p id="p-0583" num="0547">Evaluation of strains for production of O11, O13, O16, O21 and O75 O-antigen. Multiple wild-type strains of serotypes O11, O13, O16, O21 and O75 were evaluated for their propensity to produce unwanted polysaccharide in fermentation by SEC-HPLC. Strains for O11, O13, O16, O21 and O75 were selected as absent contaminating polysaccharide, as well as for their ability to produce &#x3e;1000 mg/L O-antigen and for the display of an antibiotic sensitivity profile that allowed Wanner-Datsenko recombineering for introduction of the &#x394;wzzb trait.</p><p id="p-0584" num="0548">Chloramphenicol-selectable versions of topo-fepE and pET-fepE were constructed that allowed for the introduction of fepE into the O11, O13, O16, O21 and O75 &#x394;wzzb strains that in general were found to be kanamycin-resistant. The resulting topo-fepE and pET-fepE bearing strains were fermented with chloramphenicol selection and the supernatant from acid-hydrolyzed broth was evaluated by SEC-HPLC. Both the high (topo) and low copy (pET) fepE constructs directed the synthesis of O-antigen with productivities for each that were equivalent to the parental wild-type. Expression of potentially interfering polysaccharides was not observed. An evaluation of growth rates for wzzb plasmid-bearing strains showed that the O11, O13 and O21 were retarded by the presence of topo-fepE but not by pET-fepE; strains O16 and O75 strains showed acceptable growth rates irrespective of replicon choice.</p><p id="p-0585" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00027" num="00027"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left"

release the O-antigens. A crude suspension of serotype specific <i>E. coli </i>culture in fermentation reactor was directly treated with acetic acid to the final pH of 3.5&#xb1;0.5 and the acidified broth was heated to the temperature of 95&#xb1;5&#xb0; C. for at least one hour. This treatment cleaves the labile linkage between KDR, at the proximal end of the oligosaccharide and the lipid A, thus releasing the O&#x2014;Ag chain. The acidified broth that contains the released O-Ag was cooled to 20&#xb1;1000 before being neutralized to pH 7&#xb1;1.0 using NH<sub>4</sub>OH. The process further included several centrifugation, filtration, and concentration/diafiltration operations steps.</p><p id="p-0587" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00028" num="00028"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="10"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="10" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="10" rowsep="1">TABLE 28</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="10" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Increase</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Purified</entry><entry>Number</entry><entry>in M.W.</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Poly</entry><entry>of</entry><entry>(kDa)</entry><entry/><entry>Purified</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Serotype</entry><entry/><entry>Expected</entry><entry>Titer</entry><entry>M.W.</entry><entry>Repeat</entry><entry>over</entry><entry/><entry>Conjugate</entry><entry>Conjugation</entry></row><row><entry>(core)</entry><entry>Description</entry><entry>Poly size</entry><entry>(g/L)</entry><entry>(kDa)</entry><entry>Units</entry><entry>short</entry><entry>NMR</entry><entry>M.W.

</i>polypeptidesStable CHO Clones Expressing FimH GSD or FimH LD were Generated Using a SSI (Site Specific Integration) Stable Expression System</heading><p id="p-0595" num="0552">The host CHO cell is an engineered cell line from a CHOK1SV GS-KO background (see, for example, United States Patent Application 20200002727, for a description of the CHOK1SV GS-KO host cell line). Briefly a landing pad with green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene surrounded by two FRT sites were targeted into a transcription hot spot in the genome of the host cell. The GFP gene can be exchanged with GS gene and the gene of interest which are also surrounded by FRT sites from the LVEC vector co-expressed with flippase recombinase (FLPe). This system not only has growth and productivity profiles that compare favorably with random integration but also displays genotypic and phenotypic stability to at least 100 generations.</p><p id="p-0596" num="0553">As referred to herein, the term &#x201c;FRT site&#x201d; refers to a nucleotide sequence at which the product of the flippase (FLP) gene of the yeast 2 &#x3bc;m plasmid, FLP recombinase, can catalyze a site-specific recombination. A variety of non-identical FRT sites are known to the art. The sequences of the various FRT sites are similar in that they all contain identical 13-base pair inverted repeats flanking an 8-base pair asymmetric core region in which the recombination occurs. It is the asymmetric core region that is responsible for the directionality of the site and for the variation among the different FRT sites. Illustrative (non-limiting) examples of these include the naturally occurring FRT (F), and several mutant or variant FRT sites such as FRT F1 and FRT F2.</p><p id="p-0597" num="0554">As referred to herein, the term &#x201c;landing pad&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid sequence comprising a first recombination target site chromosomally-integrated into a host cell. In some embodiments, a landing site comprises two or more recombination target sites chromosomally-integrated into a host cell. In some embodiments, the cell comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 landing pads. In some embodiments, the cell comprises 1, 2, or 3 landing pads. In some embodiments, the cell comprises 4 landing pads. In some embodiments, landing pads are integrated at up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 distinct chromosomal loci. In some embodiments, landing pads are integrated at up to 1, 2, or 3 distinct chromosomal loci. In some embodiments, landing pads are integrated at 4 distinct chromosomal loci.</p><p id="p-0598" num="0555">The LVEC expression vector for FimH GSD or FimH LD and the FLPe expression vector were co-transfected into a SSI host cell by electroporation either with BioRad Gene Pulser Xcell or Amaxa 4D-Nucleofector. Then cells were cultured in media without glutamine to select cells that has GS gene integrated at the landing pad site. Usually cells recover in 2-3 weeks. Then single cell cloning were carried out in 96 well plates either by FACS or limiting dilution. Titers from wells with cells were ranked to narrow down to top 48 clones. A second round of fed batch screening in 24 deep-well plates was conducted to narrow down the clones to top 12. A third round of fed batch screening in Ambr15 was executed to narrow down the clones to top 3. Ambr250 experiments were used to identify the best clone. Master cell bank and working cell bank were generated for the top clone after its identification.</p><heading id="h-0057" level="1">Example 34: Cell Line Development and Production Reactor Expression of FimH-DSG WT and FimH<sub>LD </sub>WT Proteins</heading><p id="p-0599" num="0556">The example described herein, describes an exemplary production of both FimH-DSG WT and FimH<sub>LD </sub>WT proteins from stable CHO cell lines, where the coding sequences for each protein has been stably intergraded into the CHO genome.</p><p id="p-0600" num="0557">In a production bioreactor setting, the stable CHO cell lines selected were able to produce the target protein at around 1 gram per liter of culture for FimH-DSG WT, and 250 miligrams per liter of culture for FimH<sub>LD </sub>WT.

The cells were grown at 36.5 deg C., at 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for three-four days.</p><p id="p-0601" num="0558">The production reactor was seeded from the final shake flask, targeting an inoculation cell density of 1&#xd7;10{circumflex over (&#x2003;)} 6 cells/ml. The production reactor was grown at 36.5 deg C. for seven days, using a pH of 7.05 (+/&#x2212;0.15), and targeting a CO<sub>2 </sub>saturation of 5-10%. pH is controlled by sodium/potassium bicarbonate for base control, and CO<sub>2 </sub>sparge for acid control. Dissolved oxygen is controlled at a setpoint of 40% using pure oxygen through the sparge. The temperature was adjusted to 31 deg C. on day seven. The reactor was fed on day 1 using a feed strategy that adds feed in correlation to the viable cell density, this is achieved by using a feed factor of 0.75 in order to ensure feed components do not run out during the run.
