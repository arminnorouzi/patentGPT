In the present application, an automatic and adjustable model is established by establishing a system of document content distribution and referring to the related content data of corresponding distribution; the document-converted payment after the distribution is continuously optimized through training data; and finally, a distribution mechanism mainly based on the content of high quality is achieved. Accordingly, the post-conversion payment is implemented; the spread of knowledge content is widened; and the cost for an author reaching a user is reduced. Additionally, based on the existing paid documents, VIP documents are added for distribution. In the case where a paid document is not displayed, a VIP document is supplemented for display.

That is, in the present application, the target knowledge content is acquired according to the priority of each author of the target knowledge content in terms of the target knowledge content so that the acquired target knowledge content is distributed to the distribution waiting user. In comparison, in the content distribution methods in the related art, the manner of natural distribution is usually adopted without distinguishing different authors of the same knowledge content. The present application adopts the technical means of acquiring the target knowledge content according to the priority of each author of the target knowledge content in terms of the target knowledge content and thus overcomes technical problems of the knowledge content distribution methods in the related art, including no accurate and efficient distribution manner for connecting a user and an author producing knowledge, a relatively simple recommendation strategy, and sole dependence on natural distribution for an author acquiring traffic. Embodiments of the present application provide an accurate and efficient distribution manner for connecting a user and an author producing knowledge to ensure that the user acquires the knowledge content of high quality and high correlation and that the author producing the knowledge makes the high profit. Moreover, the technical solutions in embodiments of the present application are simply and conveniently implemented, easily popularized, and more widely applied.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment Four</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a structure diagram illustrating a knowledge content distribution apparatus according to an embodiment of the present application.
