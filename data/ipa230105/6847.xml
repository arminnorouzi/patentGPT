At this time, the administrator's blocklist may apply first before the user's blocklist which is set up individually on each user terminal. Accordingly, the administrator is able to apply the block settings they enter to all participants at a time as they host the online meeting, and this will help the administrator run and organize the online meeting effectively.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The blocking control part <b>390</b> may block the transmitted and received packets or terminate the internal process, based on whether they are allowed or not, which is determined by the access determination part <b>370</b>. The blocking control part <b>390</b> may terminate execution of a program in a blocklist by monitoring process information, and may block packets with IP addresses in the blocklist by monitoring the source IP addresses of the packets.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In an embodiment, once the packets are blocked or the internal process is terminated, the blocking control part <b>390</b> may send information on the packets or the process to the administrator terminal. The blocking control part <b>390</b> may collect information on a blocking or terminating operation and store it in the database <b>150</b>, and may collect information on a blocking or terminating operation on each user terminal <b>110</b> and send it to the administrator hosting the online meeting. As a result, the administrator is able to check how well the participants as a whole stay focused on the online meeting, as well as each individual user's engagement in the online meeting, based on information collected during the online meeting.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">That is, the online meeting providing apparatus <b>130</b> may provide statistics on the online meeting to the administrator terminal and the user terminals of the general participants.

For an under-aged user, the blocking control part <b>390</b> may assist the parent or the guardian in teaching the child by informing them about the child's inappropriate use of content.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Meanwhile, for an internal process that is allowed only to a limited extent, the blocking control unit <b>390</b> may handle a blocking operation for that internal process in various ways. For example, a disruption factor blocking function may be applied to the internal process, by completely terminating the process or restricting the execution of the process depending on the extent of access the internal process is allowed. Accordingly, the blocking control part <b>390</b> may forcefully terminate a program related to the internal process, or may forcefully minimize, if not terminate, the program or ban a particular function or operation of the program.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Moreover, the blocking control part <b>390</b> may block websites in various ways through packet monitoring. For example, the blocking control part <b>390</b> may restrict or block a user from accessing websites by blocking packets, changing the hosts file, controlling firewalls, and so on, and may use various methods selectively or in parallel.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">When a meeting detection and disruption factor blocking function is running on a first user terminal, the remote control processing part (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) may provide a second user terminal, which is registered in relation to the first user terminal, with a remote control function in regard to the meeting detection and disruption factor blocking function. For example, assuming that a user of the first user terminal is under-aged, the second user terminal may correspond to a terminal used by a parent or guardian of the under-aged user.
