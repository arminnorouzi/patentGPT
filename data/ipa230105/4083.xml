The heating temperature is preferably 50 to 200&#xb0; C. and the heating time is preferably 10 to 180 seconds.

To the organic layer thus recovered, 30 parts of ion-exchanged water was added, and after stirring at 23&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, the organic layer was isolated through separation. This water washing operation was repeated seven times. The organic layer thus obtained was concentrated and then 30 parts of tert-butyl methyl ether was added and, after stirring at 23&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, the supernatant was removed, followed by concentration to obtain 7.18 parts of a salt represented by formula (I-3094).</p><p id="p-1163" num="0962">MASS (ESI (+) Spectrum): M<sup>+</sup> 693.0</p><p id="p-1164" num="0963">MASS (ESI (&#x2212;) Spectrum): M<sup>&#x2212;</sup> 467.1</p><heading id="h-0037" level="2">Synthesis of Resin</heading><p id="p-1165" num="0964">Compounds (monomers) used in synthesis of a resin (A) are shown below.

A resist composition was spin-coated on the silicon wafer in such a manner that the thickness of the composition layer became 0.04 &#x3bc;m. Then, the coated silicon wafer was prebaked on the direct hot plate at the temperature shown in the column &#x201c;PB&#x201d; of Table 2 for 60 seconds to form a composition layer. Using an electron-beam direct-write system (&#x201c;ELS-F125 125 keV&#x201d;, manufactured by ELIONIX INC.), line and space patterns (pitch of 60 nm/line width of 30 nm) were directly written on the composition layer formed on the wafer after development while changing the exposure dose stepwise.</p><p id="p-1204" num="0993">After exposure, post-exposure baking was performed on the hot plate at the temperature shown in the column &#x201c;PEB&#x201d; of Table 2 for 60 seconds. Next, the composition layer on this silicon wafer was developed with butyl acetate (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) as a developer at 23&#xb0; C. for 20 seconds using the dynamic dispensing method to obtain resist patterns.</p><p id="p-1205" num="0994">The thus obtained resist patterns (line and space patterns) were observed by a scanning electron microscope, and effective sensitivity was expressed as the exposure dose at which a ratio of the line width to the space width of the line and space patterns with a pitch of 60 nm became 1:1 after exposure.</p><heading id="h-0049" level="2">&#x3c;Evaluation of Pattern Collapse Margin (PCM)&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-1206" num="0995">The line width of the line pattern becomes smaller when the exposure is performed with lower exposure dose, and thus pattern disappearance is likely to occur. The number indicates minimum line width (nm) of resist patterns without observation of pattern disappearance due to collapse or peeling in the line pattern formed with an exposure dose of effective sensitivity or lower. The results are shown in Table 3.</p><p id="p-1207" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004" num="00004"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0"
