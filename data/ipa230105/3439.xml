The refrigerator according to an embodiment of the present application is approximately a cuboid. The refrigerator comprises one or more storage compartments <b>101</b> for providing a limited storage space and one or more doors <b>200</b> arranged at one or more openings of the one or more storage compartments <b>101</b>. The storage compartment <b>101</b> is in a shape of cabinet <b>100</b> and has an opening. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the one or more storage compartment <b>101</b> include a freezer compartment <b>101</b>A in the lower portion of the refrigerator and a refrigerator compartment <b>101</b>B in the upper portion of the refrigerator. The freezer compartment <b>101</b>A and the refrigerator compartment <b>101</b>B each have one or more independent storage chambers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the freezer compartment <b>101</b>A may be operatively covered by a drawer door <b>200</b>A. The refrigerator compartment <b>101</b>B is partitioned into a left storage space and a right storage space. The refrigerator compartment <b>101</b>B is selectively opened or closed by a door <b>200</b>B pivotally mounted on the refrigerator compartment <b>101</b>B.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of an appearance of a refrigerator according to an exemplary embodiment of the present application. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a display panel is arranged on a door <b>200</b>B for the refrigerator compartment and embedded in the door body. In some embodiments, a surface of the display panel is aligned with an outer surface of the door.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the refrigerator further includes a controller, the controller is connected with the display panel and is used to interact with a server to obtain information and data, draw a user interface, and output display information to the display panel, and the display panel receives a display signal output from the controller and displays corresponding image information, such as a user interface.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the refrigerator according to an embodiment of the present application is provided with at least two storage compartments, such as a freezer compartment, a refrigerator compartment, a variable-temperature compartment and/or a fresh compartment. Each storage compartment may have a plurality of independent storage spaces, such as a drawer-type compartment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, in order to intelligently manage food information, RFID tags are used to identify the foods in the storage compartments. Specifically, identity information of the RFID tag, such as the tag code written into the RFID tag, is pre-obtained, and a correspondence between the identity information of the RFID tag and a specific food is created to associate the RFID tag with that food. After attaching the RFID tag to the food, the food is placed in the refrigerator, and the refrigerator obtains the identity information of the RFID tag by detecting a signal of the RFID tag. When the identity information is obtained, food information corresponding to the RFID tag may be determined by means of the unique correspondence pre-established between the identity information of the RFID tag and the food information. By displaying the food information on the user interface presented on the display panel, a user may know the food in the refrigerator by checking the user interface, and may manage food by operating the user interface.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, an RFID detection module is arranged in each storage compartment, and the RFID detection module is used for transmitting wireless signals in the corresponding storage compartment and receiving signals from one or more RFID tags in the storage compartment to obtain the identity information of the one or more RFID tag.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the RFID detection module may be implemented as an antenna. Antennas arranged in different storage compartments may have different power as long as the power of the antenna in each storage compartment may guarantee that the antenna can identify the food stored in the corresponding compartment. If the antenna is too large, the false identification rate may be increased, and if the antenna is too small, identifying foods in the corresponding compartment may fail. In specific implementations, the power of each antenna may be determined in advance according to a space size of each storage compartment, and the power of each antenna may be set in the refrigerator. The larger the space is, the higher the power is.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the refrigerator may further include an RFID processing module, the RFID processing module is connected with each RFID detection module, and is used to control the RFID detection module to transmit wireless signals and receive the signal of the RFID tag returned from the RFID detection module.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the controller is connected with the RFID detection module, and controls the RFID detection module to identify the signals of the RFID tags in the storage compartments, so as to obtain the identity information of each RFID tag and food information corresponding to each RFID tag. The food information includes identity information used for indicating the kind of the food, and by displaying the food information on the display panel, the user may know what foods are stored in the freezer compartment.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the food information further includes a shelf life of the food. Freshness of the food may be monitored according to the shelf life of the food and a recorded placement time of the food by the user. The freshness of each food is identified on the food management interface to remind the user about whether the food reaches its expiration date, time duration until expiration date, expiration date and so on.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In related art, after placing the food in the storage compartment, the user needs to manually set a placement time of each food by operating a user interface presented on the display panel of the refrigerator, resulting in inconvenient operation steps and poor user experience.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In order to control the food information of the refrigerator more intelligently and improve user experience, the present application provides a refrigerator including a controller. The controller is configured to detect an opening/closing signal associated with a door, when it is detected that all doors are closed, instruct one or more RFID detection modules in connection with the controller to identify one or more RFID tags in all storage compartments to obtain identity information of each of the RFID tags in the refrigerator, and obtain a first set of information; by comparing the first set of information and a second set of information, determine a target tag placed in a first storage compartment; determine a target placement time of the target tag according to a current time; and update a placement time of a first food corresponding to the target tag by using the target placement time. In this way, there is no need to manually set the placement time of each food, which may provide better user experience and guarantee accuracy of the obtained time.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The second set of information is a set of information generated according to identity information of each RFID tag in the storage compartment obtained when all the doors are detected to be closed last time immediately before this time of all doors closing.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A zeroth set of information which is obtained when all the doors are detected to be closed last time and includes all identity information of all RFID tags is taken as an example, and the second set of information is generated according to the zeroth set of information. Specifically, identity information and removal information of an RFID tag corresponding to a food that is removed from the refrigerator last time are added to the zeroth set of information, to obtain the second set of information, and the removal information includes a removed state and a removal time of the RFID tag removed. It may be seen that the second set of information is different from the zeroth set of information in that the second set of information includes the identity information and the removal information of the RFID tag that was placed in the refrigerator and then has been removed from the refrigerator.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first set of information obtained when all the doors are detected to be closed this time is taken as an example, and a third set of information may be generated according to the first set of information. Specifically, by comparing the first set of information with the second set of information, an RFID tag corresponding to a food removed from a storage compartment this time, that is, the RFID tag whose identity information merely exists in the second set of information, is determined, and the identity information and removal information of the RFID tag removed from a storage compartment this time are added to the first set of information, to generate a third set of information, where the removal information of an RFID tag removed from a storage compartment this time includes a marked removed state of the RFID tag and a removal time determined according to the current time.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the refrigerator further includes a detector which is configured to detect an opening/closing signal of each door respectively, record the open/closed state of the door according to the detected opening/closing signal, and send open/closed state information to the controller.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, when detecting a signal for indicating opening of a door or a signal for indicating closing of a door, the detector sends latest open/closed state information to the controller. The controller receives the open/closed state information sent from the detector, and analyzes operation of the door according to the received open/closed state information. When the received open/closed state information shows that current open/closed states of all the doors are closed, all the doors are determined to be closed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the embodiments of the present application, the detector may specifically detect the opening/closing signal of the door by detecting a magnetic-sensing switch and a mechanical switch.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the target tag includes a first target tag, and the first target tag refers to an RFID tag whose identity information merely exists in the first set of information. It may be understood that the user places a food identified by the first target tag in the storage compartment for the first time in this operation. A target placement time corresponding to the first target tag is determined as the current time.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some scenarios, the user may take out a food identified by a certain RFID tag and place the food again in the refrigerator soon. In this case, if the placement time of this food is updated according to a time when the user places the food again in the refrigerator, a wrong placement time may be recorded.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to avoid a situation where a wrong placement time is recorded when the food placed in via this operation is the same food placed again in soon after the user takes the food out. In some other embodiments, the controller determines whether there is a second target tag by comparing the first set of information with the second set of information, and the second target tag refers to an RFID tag whose identity information exists in the first set of information and the second set of information and is marked with a removed state in the second set of information. It should be noted that the second set of information further includes a removal time corresponding to the second target tag.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When a target placement time corresponding to the second target tag is determined according to the current time, firstly, whether a time difference between the current time and the removal time corresponding to the second target tag is greater than the preset threshold is determined. If the time difference between the current time and the removal time corresponding to the second target tag is greater than the preset threshold, the target placement time corresponding to the second target tag is determined as the current time; otherwise, the target placement time corresponding to the second target tag is determined as last placement time. Exemplarily, the preset threshold may be set to <b>2</b> hours.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It may be seen from the above examples that if the user places a certain food again in the refrigerator within a preset time after taking the food out, the corresponding placement time of the food is not updated, such that the wrong placement time may be prevented from being recorded, and accuracy of automatically obtaining the placement time of the food by the refrigerator may be improved.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the correspondence between the RFID tag and the food is pre-established, specifically the correspondence between the identity information of the RFID tag and the food information. The controller identifies the identity information of the RFID tag by the RFID detection module, and then searches for the food information corresponding to the RFID tag from the foregoing correspondence according to the identity information of the RFID tag.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the user may update the correspondence between the RFID tag and the food by, for example, adding new corresponding information or changing food information corresponding to one certain RFID tag. In the case of changing the food information corresponding to one certain RFID tag, the same RFID tag may be used to identify different foods successively, thereby making the RFID tag more flexible.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the correspondence between the RFID tag and the food is also called an association relation. The food information corresponding to the RFID tag is the food information associated with the RFID tag.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some scenarios, after removing one certain RFID tag from the refrigerator, the user changes food information associated with the RFID tag. When the user places the changed RFID tag again in the refrigerator, since the food information corresponding to the RFID tag before and the food information corresponding to the RFID tag after are different, a wrong placement time may be recorded if the corresponding placement time of the RFID tag is not updated.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to avoid a situation where the wrong placement time is recorded due to change of the food information corresponding to the RFID tag. Firstly, when the food information corresponding to the RFID tag is modified, a marker of a re-association state is added to the identity information of the RFID tag to indicate that the food information currently corresponding to the RFID tag is different from the food information previously corresponding to the RFID tag. Secondly, when obtaining the first set of information, the controller obtains the identity information of each RFID tag in the storage compartment. When food information currently corresponding to the identity information is different from food information previously corresponding the identity information, the identity information carries a marker of a re-association state, and the marker of the re-association state is used to indicate that the food information currently associated with the RFID tag is different from the last associated food information, so as to obtain the first set of information. Further, the controller may determine whether the food information currently and last corresponding to each RFID tag are different by determining whether the identity information of each RFID tag is marked with the re-association state. Then, when the first set of information is compared with the second set of information to determine the target tag, all identity information in the first set of information is traversed to determine whether there is one marked with the re-association state, and the RFID tag whose identity information exists in the first set of information and the second set of information and is marked with the re-association state in the first set of information is determined as a third target tag. For the third target tag, the current time is determined as a target placement time of the third tag corresponding to the third target time.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It may be seen from the above examples that when the user places an RFID tag associated with new food information again in the refrigerator, the placement time of the food identified with the RFID tag may be updated according to the current time, such that the wrong placement time may be prevented from being recorded, and the accuracy of automatically obtaining the placement time of the food by the refrigerator may be improved.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the food management interface is displayed/updated according to the target tag and the corresponding target placement time, such that the placement time of the food identified by the target tag on the food management interface is the target placement time corresponding to the target tag.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, on the food management interface, the foods in the refrigerator are presented in the form of food icons, images and texts, etc. In addition, functional controls may be drawn on the user interface, such as a control for identifying an RFID tag and a control for adding food.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the user interface for managing food may include a plurality of food display areas and functional controls, one food display area may correspond to one food category or one storage compartment, and each food display area is used for displaying the food information corresponding to the RFID tag in the refrigerator.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the method may include the following.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0145">Step <b>1301</b>: in response to an instruction for identifying an RFID tag from a user, a tag code of an RFID tag is obtained, where the tag code includes a first code portion.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0146">For example, the user may click the control for RFID tag identification on the interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> to input an instruction to identify the RFID tag. In response to the instruction, an RFID detection module identifies a signal of the RFID tag to obtain a tag code of the RFID tag.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0147">In this embodiment, the tag code includes a first code portion, and the first code portion is a predetermined code or a non-predetermined code, which indicates that preset food information corresponding to the RFID tag is pre-saved in a cloud server and may not be customized by the user.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0148">In some embodiments, the tag code further includes a second code portion, and the second code portion is unique identity information of the RFID tag.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0149">In some embodiments, the tag code of RFID tag includes at least two code segments, namely, a first code segment and a second code segment, which conform to a preset composition rule, where the first code segment is used for writing the first code portion and the second code segment is used for writing the second code portion. Based on this, after the tag code of RFID tag is obtained, the first code segment and/or the second code segment may be intercepted according to the preset composition rule for the tag code to obtain the first code portion and/or the second code portion.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0150">Step <b>1302</b>: whether the first code portion is the predetermined code is determined, if yes, the flow goes to step <b>1303</b>, and otherwise, the flow goes to step <b>1305</b>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0151">Step <b>1303</b>: in response to the first code portion being the predetermined code, a first association interface is displayed, where the first association interface is configured to receive target food information input from the user.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0152">In some embodiments of the present application, the first association interface includes one or more input positions for inputting one or more items of the target food information, and when a click at the input position from the user is detected, the input position is activated to receive text information, i.e., the target food information, input from the user. According to different elements and layouts on the first association interface, the target food information input from the user on the first association interface includes, but is not limited to, a name of the food, a shelf life of the food, etc.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0153">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the exemplary first association interface is displayed, and the first association interface includes an input position for inputting a name of a food and an input position for inputting a shelf life of the food.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0154">Step <b>1304</b>: upon receiving the target food information input from the user, the target food information is associated with the RFID tag.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0155">In some embodiments, associating the target food information with the RFID tag means that the identity information of the RFID tag and the target food information are correspondingly stored in local memory.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0156">Step <b>1305</b>: preset food information of the RFID tag is obtained according to the first code portion in response to the first code portion being not the predetermined code.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0157">During specific implementations, preset food information may be obtained from a cloud server according to the first code portion. Alternatively, preset food information may be obtained from a local preset correspondence table between the first code portion and the food information according to the first code portion. The local preset correspondence table may be pre-downloaded from the cloud server.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0158">Step <b>1306</b>: the preset food information is associated with the RFID tag.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0159">In some embodiments, associating the preset food information with the RFID tag means that the preset food information and the identity information of the RFID tag are correspondingly stored in local memory.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0160">In the above embodiments, whether the food information corresponding to the RFID tag may be customized by the user is determined according to whether the first code portion is a predetermined code. If the first code portion is a predetermined code, it means that the food information corresponding to the RFID tag may be customized by the user. Therefore, the first association interface where the target food information may be input is displayed, and the received target food information corresponds to the RFID tag, thus improving use flexibility of the RFID tag. If the first code portion is not a predetermined code, it means that the food information corresponding to the RFID tag may not be customized by the user, then the corresponding preset food information is obtained according to the first code portion, and the preset food information corresponds to the RFID tag, thus saving operations of the user and improving input efficiency of the food information.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0161">During specific implementations, the present application also provides non-volatile medium, where the non-volatile medium may store programs, and when executed, the programs may include some or all steps in the embodiments of the control method for the refrigerator according to the present application.
