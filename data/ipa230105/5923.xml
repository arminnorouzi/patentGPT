Accordingly, the gap-fill structure BS including the first and second portions BP and TP may be formed.

In other words, the second portion TP may be formed by a selective dielectric-on-dielectric deposition process.

In an embodiment, the second portion TP of the gap-fill structure BS may be formed of or include at least one of silicon oxynitride, silicon carbon nitride, or silicon nitride. Since the second portion TP can be grown without spatial confinement caused by the landing pads LP, the growth process of the second portion TP may be performed in both of lateral and vertical directions, and thus, the second portion TP may be formed to have a semi-circular section and to cover a portion of a top surface of the landing pad LP adjacent thereto.
