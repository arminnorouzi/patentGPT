For water skiing and wakeboarding, the participant holds onto one end of the towline and the other end is attached to the boat. For tubing, the towline is attached to the tube, and the water-sports participant(s) holds onto the tube. A boat may also be used to generate a wake on which a water-sports participant, such as a wake surfer or foiler, may wake surf or foil, generally without holding onto a towline, once they get going. In each of these activities, the water-sports participant is located behind (aft) of the boat.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, the invention relates to a boat including an image processor and/or a controller configured to determine if a water-sports participant has fallen.

used herein, directional terms forward (fore), aft, inboard, and outboard have their commonly understood meaning in the art. Relative to the boat, forward is a direction toward the bow, and aft is a direction toward the stern. Likewise, inboard is a direction toward the center of the boat, and outboard is a direction away from it.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The boat is operated by a driver (or operator) at a control console to move the boat through the water for water sports, such as those discussed above. When the boat is underway (or driven), the driver needs to look forward to operate the boat, keeping it on course and avoiding navigational hazards, such as other vessels or submerged or partially-submerged objects. But maintaining awareness of the boat operator's surroundings requires being aware of what is going on behind the boat as well, particularly when a water-sports participant is behind the boat. When a water-sports participant falls, the driver should stop or slow the boat and then maneuver the boat to pick up the water-sports participant, or otherwise help the water-sports participant restart the water sport. It is desirable to identify when a water-sports participant falls as soon as possible, but with the driver looking forward, there may be a delay before the driver realizes that the water-sports participant has fallen. The embodiments described herein relate to systems and methods that can be used to identify when the water-sports participant has fallen and provide a notification (or other action) to alert the driver so that he or she can take action as quickly as possible.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> show a boat <b>100</b> in accordance with an exemplary preferred embodiment of the invention.

In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the image processor <b>326</b> is incorporated into the controller <b>320</b> either as a separate processor or as the processor <b>322</b>, and in this way the image processor <b>326</b> is communicatively coupled to the controller <b>320</b> as part of the controllers <b>320</b> internal connections. In other embodiments, the image processor <b>326</b> may be a processor that is part of a computing device (with its own memory) separate from the controller <b>320</b>. When the image processor <b>326</b> is separate from the controller <b>320</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> is communicatively coupled to the controller <b>320</b> to carry out the actions discussed below.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The image sensor <b>310</b> is communicatively coupled to the image processor <b>326</b> and, in this embodiment, is communicatively coupled to the controller <b>320</b>. The image sensor <b>310</b> may be communicatively coupled to the controller <b>320</b> using any suitable means. In this embodiment, the image sensor <b>310</b> is coupled to the controller <b>320</b> with a wired connection, but other suitable connections may be used, such as wireless connections. Suitable connections include, for example, an electrical conductor, a low-level serial data connection, such as Recommended Standard (RS) 232 or RS-485, a high-level serial data connection, such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) or the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394, a parallel data connection, such as IEEE 1284 or IEEE 488, and/or a short-range wireless communication channel, such as BLUETOOTH, and/or wireless communication networks using radiofrequency signals, such as WiFi. When a wired connection and protocol is used, each of the image sensor <b>310</b> and the controller <b>320</b> may include a suitable port to support the wired connection. When a wireless protocol is used, each of the image sensor <b>310</b> and the controller <b>320</b> may include a transmitter and/or a receiver. The examples of image sensors <b>310</b> discussed above that are not fixed to the boat <b>100</b> may be wirelessly coupled to the image processor <b>326</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The controller <b>320</b> is also communicatively coupled to at least one display, and in this embodiment, is communicatively coupled to both the center display <b>182</b> and the side display <b>184</b>. The controller <b>320</b> is configured to display on the center display <b>182</b> and the side display <b>184</b> various information that is pertinent to the operator, including the information and alerts discussed further below. Where the display, such as the side display <b>184</b>, is a touch screen and thus functioning as an input device <b>186</b>, the controller <b>320</b> is also configured to receive input from the side display <b>184</b>. The side display <b>184</b> may display a plurality of user-selectable options or icons that may be selected by a user pressing the icon. The terms icon, virtual button, user-selectable element, and button will be used interchangeably herein to describe these and other user-selectable options displayed by the controller <b>320</b> on the side display <b>184</b>. The controller <b>320</b> is operatively coupled to various systems on the boat <b>100</b>. When the user selects a user-selectable element displayed on the side display <b>184</b>, the controller <b>320</b> receives an input from the side display <b>184</b> and then executes a process based on the input from the side display <b>184</b>. In a similar manner, the controller <b>320</b> is also configured to receive input from other input devices <b>186</b>, such as the switch pack <b>188</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the side display <b>184</b> (and center display <b>182</b>) may implement dynamic controls, such as the dynamic controls discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 11,048,469, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Such dynamic controls may be implemented using modes. Each different mode corresponds to a different activity, and each mode includes a plurality of controls corresponding to the activity of the mode. The plurality of controls of each mode is a subset of the major controls of the boat <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, there may be three different modes (a drive mode, a tow mode, and a chill mode), and when a mode is activated, the controller <b>320</b> displays on the side display <b>184</b> the plurality of controls in that mode. Similarly, each mode also includes a plurality of parameters of the boat <b>100</b> (also referred to herein as operational parameters) corresponding to the activity of the mode. These operational parameters are also a subset of the major operational parameters of the boat <b>100</b>. The information displayed on the center display <b>182</b> changes based on the active mode, and the controller <b>320</b> displays on the center display <b>182</b> the plurality of parameters of the boat <b>100</b> corresponding to the activity of the mode. An example of the plurality of controls and plurality of operational parameters for each of the three modes is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 11,048,469.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As noted above, the control system <b>302</b> may include a plurality of modes, with at least one mode corresponding to a water sport and at least one mode corresponding to an activity other than the water sport (a non-water-sport mode). The control system <b>302</b> may also include a plurality of modes with each mode corresponding to a different water sport. In this embodiment, the controller <b>320</b> displays at the top of the side display <b>184</b> a plurality of user-selectable options to change between modes. Two non-water-sport modes, drive and chill, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The drive button <b>191</b> activates the drive mode, and the chill button <b>193</b> activates the chill mode. There are also a plurality of user-selectable options, each corresponding to a different water sport. In this embodiment, the plurality of user-selectable options includes buttons for wake surfing (surf button <b>195</b>), another one of the water sports is wakeboarding (wake button <b>197</b>), and the third water sport is water skiing (ski button <b>199</b>), but the water sports and corresponding user-selectable options may be for any water sport including, for example, tubing.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The controller <b>320</b> is also communicatively and operatively coupled to the propulsion system <b>200</b>, including, for example, in this embodiment, to the throttle <b>214</b> and the engine <b>210</b>. In addition, the controller <b>320</b> is communicatively and operatively coupled to the audio system <b>330</b>. The audio system <b>330</b> of this embodiment includes an audio controller <b>332</b>. The audio controller <b>332</b> may be, for example, a head unit. The audio controller <b>332</b> may be a separate controller, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, but in other embodiments, the audio controller <b>332</b> may be integrated in the controller <b>320</b> of the boat <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The audio system <b>330</b> receives audio signals from an audio source <b>334</b>. The audio source may be any suitable audio source, including, for example, audio received by an AM/FM radio receiver; audio received by a satellite radio receiver; digital media stored on a digital media player, such as a mobile phone or iPod&#xae;; a digital streaming service using a device, such as a mobile phone that is communicatively coupled to a wireless network; and audio stored on a compact disc (CD) and played using a CD player. The audio source <b>334</b> may be integrated into the boat <b>100</b>. For example, an AM/FM radio receiver may be built into the boat <b>100</b> and operated through the side display <b>184</b>. The audio system <b>330</b> may also be configured to allow an external audio source <b>334</b> to be coupled to the audio system <b>330</b> using an audio input interface <b>336</b>. The audio input interface <b>336</b> may include a 3.5 mm audio port, a universal serial bus (USB) port, a high-definition multimedia interface port, an optical interface port, or a short distance wireless receiver/transmitter. The short distance wireless receiver/transmitter may use the Bluetooth&#xae; protocol, for example. The audio signal from the audio input interface <b>336</b> is sent to an amplifier <b>338</b>. The amplifier <b>338</b> is communicatively coupled to each of the speakers <b>170</b>, and amplifies the audio signal for each speaker <b>170</b>. The amplifier <b>338</b> transmits the amplified audio signal to each speaker <b>170</b>, which in turn produces the audio sound.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow chart of the general process used by the rider analysis system <b>300</b> to assist in identifying when the rider is down. The controller <b>320</b> activates the process in step S<b>705</b>. The image sensor <b>310</b> then captures, in step S<b>710</b>, at least one image of the environment aft of the stern <b>108</b> of the boat <b>100</b>. As noted above, the image sensor <b>310</b> is located above the waterline <b>10</b>, and the environment captured in the at least one image includes a water surface aft of the boat <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> are examples of images captured by the image sensor <b>310</b> and show the environment aft of the stern <b>108</b> of the boat <b>100</b>. In the embodiments discussed herein, the image sensor <b>310</b> positioned on the tower <b>160</b> is used, and the image sensor <b>310</b> is a visual image sensor, such as a video camera <b>312</b>. The captured images in the embodiments discussed herein are thus visual images. However, the following discussion is also applicable to other captured images using other image sensors positioned at other portions of the boat. For example, when the image sensor is an infrared image sensor, the rider <b>12</b> may be identified by their heat signature as compared to the background.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As noted above, the image sensor <b>310</b> has a field of view, which is the area captured or imaged by the image sensor. The field of view is preferably sized to provide sufficient resolution for the image processing discussed below. The field of view is preferably set to capture the normal range of the water-sports participant behind the boat <b>100</b> when the water-sports participant is engaged in the water sport. The centerline <b>102</b> of the boat <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> extending aft of the boat <b>100</b>. A wide field of view is preferred to observe a water-sports participant that is a large distance from the centerline <b>102</b> of the boat <b>100</b>. Such a field of view is preferred when the water sport is water skiing and wakeboarding, for example. In such water sports, the water-sports participant may be a large distance from the centerline <b>102</b> and moving quickly from one side to the other, such as a slalom skier that moves between buoys that are more than 38 feet from the centerline <b>102</b> of the boat <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the field of view, for at least water skiing and wakeboarding, preferably is at least 50 feet on either side of the centerline <b>102</b> of the boat <b>100</b>, but smaller widths also may be used. When the water sport is wake surfing, for example, the field of view preferably is at least 15 feet on either side of the centerline <b>102</b> of the boat <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The field of view in terms of the length behind the boat <b>100</b> is preferably set to account for the various water sports being performed. Preferably, the field of view will include the area just aft of the boat <b>100</b> to account for water sports, such as wake surfing, that occur close to the boat. Wake surfing often occurs with the water-sports participant at distances from 3 to 40 feet behind the transom of the boat <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, it may be beneficial for the field of view to include the boat <b>100</b>, in which case the field of view may include at least a portion of the stern <b>108</b> of the boat <b>100</b> and/or the swim platform <b>106</b>. The field of view also preferably accounts for water sports that occur at distances farther from the transom of the boat <b>100</b>. Such water sports include, for example, foiling, which often occurs with the water-sports participant at distances from 20 to 60 feet behind the transom of the boat <b>100</b>; wakeboarding, which often occurs with the water-sports participant at distances from 45 to 80 feet behind the transom of the boat <b>100</b>; water skiing, which often occurs with the water-sports participant at distances from 40 to 75 feet behind the transom of the boat <b>100</b>; and tubing, which often occurs with the water-sports participant(s) at distances from 40 to 80 feet behind the transom of the boat <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As noted above, the field of view preferably includes the area where the person engaged in the water sport (referred to herein as the water-sports participant or rider) is expected to be located for the particular water sport. In some embodiments, the field of view may be dynamic and change based on the water sport being performed. The field of view may be changed based on receiving an input from a user selecting a particular field of view using controls on an input device <b>186</b>, such as user-selectable options displayed on the side display <b>184</b>, for example. The user may select the field of view by providing a specific input to set the field of view, and then the controller <b>320</b> controls the image sensor <b>310</b> to change the field of view. Such user inputs may include, for example, zoom and pan features. In response to such inputs, the controller <b>320</b> controls the zoom function of the image sensor or physically moves the image sensor using an electrical motor, for example. In other embodiments, the field of view may be predetermined based on the water sport. The controller <b>320</b> may have stored in the memory a set location (position and zoom) for the image sensor, and the controller <b>320</b> operates or otherwise moves the image sensor <b>310</b> to set the field of view when a user selects a user input corresponding to the water sport, such as when a particular mode is selected (e.g., selecting one of the surf button <b>195</b>, the wake button <b>197</b>, or the ski button <b>199</b>), for example. Where the boat <b>100</b> is equipped with multiple image sensors <b>310</b>, changing the file of view may include selecting a different image sensor <b>310</b>. For example, when a surf left option is selected, the controller <b>320</b> may select an image sensor on the port side of the boat <b>100</b>, such as one of image sensor <b>310</b><i>c</i>, image sensor <b>310</b><i>e</i>, or image sensor <b>310</b><i>g </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Likewise, when a surf right option is selected, the controller <b>320</b> may select an image sensor on the starboard side of the boat <b>100</b>, such as one of image sensor <b>310</b><i>d</i>, image sensor <b>310</b><i>f</i>, or image sensor <b>310</b><i>h </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Returning to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the image sensor <b>310</b> is configured to send the images captured by the image sensor <b>310</b> to the image processor <b>326</b>, and the image processor <b>326</b> is configured to receive the images from the image sensor. The captured images are sent and received in step S<b>715</b>. Then, in step S<b>720</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> is used to analyze the images captured by the image sensor <b>310</b> to determine whether the water-sports participant has fallen. Such an analysis may be referred to herein as a rider-down analysis. To make such a determination, the image processor <b>326</b> may analyze an image to be analyzed to determine if the water-sports participant has fallen. The image to be analyzed includes the image captured by the image sensor <b>310</b>. In some embodiments, a plurality of image sensors <b>310</b>, for example, image sensor <b>310</b><i>c </i>and image sensor <b>310</b><i>d</i>, is used to create the image to be analyzed. The captured image from image sensor <b>310</b><i>c </i>and the image sensor <b>310</b><i>d </i>may be stitched together by the image processor <b>326</b> using a suitable image stitching process to combine each captured image into one image to be analyzed.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In analyzing the image in step S<b>720</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> executes an object recognition process to determine if the water-sports participant has fallen (in other words, is down) or if the water-sports participant has not fallen (in other words, is up). Any suitable object recognition process may be used. For example, an artificial neural network trained to identify the objects discussed herein may be used as the object recognition process. In another example, a facial recognition image analysis may be performed to identify and distinguish the face of a person from other objects in the image. Herein, this facial recognition is used not to specifically identify a person by individual characteristics of a specific person's face, but to distinguish a human face from other objects. Similar analyses can be conducted to identify other parts of a person's body, such as head, hands, arms, torso, legs, and the like. Such facial or body recognition techniques and algorithms include, for instance, intrinsic face movement, depth mapping algorithms, neural networks, 3D sensing techniques, texture detection, gesture detection, edge detection, and feature detection.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The captured images discussed in the following embodiments are visual images, which, as discussed above, are analyzed using suitable object recognition processes for visual images. Other image sensors <b>210</b> may be used, and suitable object recognition processes for such image sensors <b>210</b> may be used as part of step S<b>720</b> to identify the objects discussed herein. For example, an infrared image sensor may be used, and the rider <b>12</b> may be identified by their heat signature as compared to the background. In some cases, the background will show as a cold environment, and the rider <b>12</b> will show as a hot object. This temperature difference can then be used to identify the location of the rider <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Various suitable methods and approaches may be used to determine if the water-sports participant has fallen based on the object recognition process. Examples of this determination will be described further below. Step S<b>725</b> illustrates a decision point in the process. If the rider is still up (not fallen), the process returns to step S<b>710</b> and the rider analysis system <b>300</b> continues to monitor the water-sports participant. But, if the rider is down (fallen), the process moves to step S<b>730</b>, and the controller <b>320</b> executes a rider-down action. In some embodiments, the image processor <b>326</b> outputs a rider-down output, which is received by the controller <b>320</b>. The controller <b>320</b> thus is configured to execute the rider-down action based upon the rider-down analysis.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">One rider-down analysis (step S<b>720</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) is illustrated using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>. The image processor <b>326</b>, utilizing the object recognition process, analyzes the image to be analyzed for the presence of an object in the image to be analyzed indicative of the water-sports participant. If such an object is present in the image, the image processor determines that the water-sports participant has not fallen, or, in other words, is up. If such an object is not present in the image, the image processor determines that the water-sports participant has fallen, or, in other words, is down.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the object indicative of the water-sports participant is the water-sports participant himself or herself. The image processor <b>326</b> may be configured to identify a person's body and/or portions thereof, and the object indicative of the water-sports participant is at least a portion of a person's body. In the captured image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the rider is identified by the image processor as indicated by reference numeral <b>12</b>, and the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the water-sports participant is up. But, in the captured image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, the rider <b>12</b> is not identified, and the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the water-sports participant is down.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A facial recognition image analysis may be performed to identify and distinguish the face of a person from other objects in the image. In some embodiments, however, identifying the face (or head) of the water-sports participant may lead to errant determinations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> is another example of an image captured by the image sensor <b>310</b> and subjected to the rider-down analysis discussed above. If only the face were identified, the image processor <b>326</b> may identify the rider <b>12</b> in the image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> and thus determine that the water-sports participant is up. In this image, however, the rider has fallen and is floating with his head above the water. Accordingly, in other embodiments, an approach where a substantial portion of a person's body, such as, for example, at least the person's torso, if not also the legs, is used to identify the rider. In such an analysis, the object indicative of the water-sports participant is at least a portion of a person's body, and the portion of the person's body includes a portion of the person's body other than the head (e.g., the person's torso or legs). Using such a process on the image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> would result in the image processor <b>326</b> determining that the water-sports participant has fallen.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flow chart of another rider-down analysis (step S<b>720</b>). This approach can be used to determine that the water-sports participant is down without the need to identify a substantial portion of the person's body. This approach is similar to the approach discussed above but utilizes an analysis region. In this rider-down analysis, the image processor <b>326</b> limits the portion of the captured image in which the object identification is performed. As noted above, the rider is expected to be located a certain distance behind the boat when the rider is up. The image analysis may be performed over a range of distances behind the boat that corresponds to the water sport, and not in other portions of the image. In step S<b>905</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> defines an analysis region in the image to be analyzed. The analysis region includes a portion of the water surface corresponding to a set distance range behind the boat. Ranges corresponding to the water sport, as discussed above, may be used to define the set distance range of the analysis region.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> are examples of images captured by the image sensor <b>310</b> and show the environment aft of the stern <b>108</b> of the boat <b>100</b>. The analysis regions are indicated by reference numeral <b>22</b>, and, as can be seen in these figures, the analysis region is only a portion of the image to be analyzed.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In step S<b>910</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the image processor <b>326</b>, utilizing the object recognition process, analyzes the analysis region <b>22</b> for the presence of an object indicative of the water-sports participant. Step S<b>915</b> illustrates a decision point in the process. If an object indicative of the water-sports participant is present in the analysis region <b>22</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the water-sports participant has not fallen, or, in other words, is up (step S<b>920</b>). If an object indicative of the water-sports participant is not present in the analysis region <b>22</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the water-sports participant has fallen, or, in other words, is down (step S<b>925</b>). As discussed above, the object indicative of the water-sports participant may be the rider <b>12</b>. In the image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, the image processor <b>326</b> identifies that the rider <b>12</b> is in the analysis region <b>22</b> and thus determines that the water-sports participant has not fallen (step S<b>920</b>), but in the image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, the image processor <b>326</b> identifies that the rider <b>12</b> is not in the analysis region <b>22</b> (in this case, identifies the rider <b>12</b> as being outside of the analysis region <b>22</b>) and thus determines that the water-sports participant has fallen (step S<b>925</b>).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the examples above, the object indicative of the water-sports participant is the rider <b>12</b>, but in this analysis and in the other rider-down analyses discussed herein, the object indicative of the water-sports participant may be objects other than the rider. The rider typically is on a piece of water-sports equipment used for the water sport, such as a board, skis, or tube, for example. When water skiing, the rider is on water skis. When wakeboarding or wake surfing, the rider is on a board (e.g., wakeboard or surfboard). When tubing, the rider is on an inflatable tube. In some embodiments, the object indicative of the water-sports participant is a piece of water-sports equipment, and more specifically, a board (e.g., wakeboard or surfboard), ski, or tube. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, for example, the surfboard is identified in the analysis region <b>22</b> by the image processor, as indicated by reference numeral <b>14</b>, and the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the water-sports participant is up. But, in the captured image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, the board <b>14</b> is not identified in the analysis region <b>22</b>, and the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the water-sports participant is down.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The analysis region <b>22</b> may be set based on the water sport. As discussed above, the side display <b>184</b> includes a plurality of user-selectable elements, each corresponding to a different water sport (e.g., the surf button <b>195</b>, the wake button <b>197</b>, and the ski button <b>199</b>). When one of these user-selectable elements is selected, the controller <b>320</b> sets the set distance range of the analysis region based on the selected water sport. The analysis region <b>22</b> may be defined by a minimum distance behind the aft most portion of the boat to a maximum distance behind the aft most portion of the boat. The analysis region <b>22</b> may also be defined to have a width, such as a distance on either side of the centerline <b>102</b>. As noted above, for a water sport, such as wake surfing (a first water sport), that is performed closer to the boat, each of the minimum distance and the maximum distance may be less than the corresponding minimum distance and maximum distance for a second water sport, such as wakeboarding. Likewise, the width (distance from the centerline) of the analysis region <b>22</b> for wake surfing may be less than the width for wakeboarding.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this rider-down analysis shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> to <b>10</b>B</figref>, the analysis region <b>22</b> is used to limit the area in which the object region process is used, thereby limiting false positives. Another approach to minimize false positives is to limit the field of view for the image sensor <b>310</b> based on the water sport, as discussed above, and thus the captured image is limited to the area in which the rider is expected to be located when engaged in the water sport.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a flow chart of another rider-down analysis (step S<b>720</b>). In this embodiment, the image processor <b>326</b> analyzes the image to be analyzed for both the water-sports participant (rider <b>12</b>) and the piece of water-sports equipment, the proximity of the piece of water-sports equipment to a person identified in the image is used to determine if the rider is up or if the rider is down (fallen). In step S<b>1105</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> analyzes the image to be analyzed to identify a person (rider <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref>) in the image to be analyzed. In step S<b>1110</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> analyzes the image to be analyzed to identify a piece of water-sports equipment, such as a tube <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref>, in the image to be analyzed. In step S<b>1115</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> then calculates a distance d (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>) between the person (rider <b>12</b>) and the piece of water-sports equipment (tube <b>16</b>).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref> are examples of images captured by the image sensor <b>310</b> and show the environment aft of the stern <b>108</b> of the boat <b>100</b> as analyzed by the image processor <b>326</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> shows two riders <b>12</b> located on a tube <b>16</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> shows a rider <b>12</b> off of the tube <b>16</b>. Step S<b>1120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a decision point in the process, and the image processor <b>326</b> determines if the calculated distance d between the person (rider <b>12</b>) and the piece of water-sports equipment (tube <b>16</b>) is greater than a threshold distance. If the calculated distance d is within a threshold distance (not greater than the threshold distance), the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the water-sports participant has not fallen (step S<b>1125</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> the distance d is zero or overlapping in this example and thus less than the threshold distance. If the calculated distance d is greater than the threshold distance, the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the water-sports participant has fallen (step S<b>1130</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>. In a case where only the piece of water-sports equipment is identified (tube <b>16</b>), the image processor <b>326</b> may also determine that the water-sports participant has fallen. For example, the distance d may be infinite and thus greater than the threshold distance. This analysis method may be particularly useful where the piece of water-sports equipment is attached to the boat <b>100</b>, such as a tube <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flow chart of another rider-down analysis (step S<b>720</b>), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A to <b>14</b>C</figref> are examples of images captured by the image sensor <b>310</b> and show the environment aft of the stern <b>108</b> of the boat <b>100</b> as analyzed by the image processor <b>326</b> using the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The image sensor <b>310</b> may be configured to capture a plurality of images in a sequence. The image processor <b>326</b> may be configured to perform object identification on the sequence of captured images and make comparisons between images in the sequence. Each of the captured images may be the images to be analyzed to determine if the water-sports participant has fallen. When the rider <b>12</b> has fallen, the boat <b>100</b> will move away from the rider <b>12</b>, and the rider <b>12</b> (or other object indicative of the water-sports participant) will get progressively smaller in the series of captured images. The image analysis performed by the image processor <b>326</b> may include a determination of the size of the identified object, such as the size of the rider <b>12</b>. In step S<b>1305</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> identifies the object indicative of the water-sports participant, such as the rider <b>12</b>, in a first (or reference) image, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, for example. In step S<b>1310</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> calculates the size of the rider <b>12</b> in the first image. The image processor <b>326</b> then analyzes a second image subsequent to the first image. In step S<b>1315</b>, the image processor <b>326</b> identifies the rider <b>12</b> in the second image, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>, for example. The image processor <b>326</b> calculates the size of the rider <b>12</b> in the second image in step S<b>1320</b>, and then compares the size of the rider <b>12</b> in the second image to the size of the rider <b>12</b> in the first image in step S<b>1325</b>. Step S<b>1330</b> is a decision point in the process. If the size of the rider <b>12</b> in the second image has not decreased more than a threshold amount, the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the rider <b>12</b> has not fallen (step S<b>1335</b>), as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, for example, but if the size of the rider <b>12</b> in the second image has decreased more than the threshold amount, the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the rider <b>12</b> has fallen (step S<b>1340</b>), as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>, for example. In this embodiment, a size decrease relative to a first (or reference) image is used to account for various shapes and sizes of riders, but other approaches may be used, including, for example, determining the size of the rider <b>12</b> (or other object indicative of the water-sports participant) and comparing it to a reference size stored in the memory <b>324</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the method discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the distance that the rider <b>12</b> (or other object indicative of the water-sports participant) is behind the boat <b>100</b> is used to determine if the water-sports participant has fallen. The distance of the rider <b>12</b> behind the boat <b>100</b> is calculated from the captured image, but other methods may be used to determine if the rider has exceeded a predetermined distance behind the boat.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a schematic of the boat <b>100</b> with a surfer (water-sports participant) behind the boat <b>100</b>. As noted above, a plurality of image sensors <b>310</b> may be used, and in this embodiment, the image sensors <b>310</b> are image sensors of different types. One image sensor <b>310</b> is a visual image sensor (camera <b>312</b>) that is mounted on the tower <b>160</b> in the manner discussed above, for example, and another is a radar sensor <b>314</b> or a LiDAR sensor <b>316</b> positioned on the transom <b>114</b> in one of the positions discussed above. The radar sensor <b>314</b> or LiDAR sensor <b>316</b> can be used to determine the distance the water-sport participant (rider <b>12</b>) is from the boat <b>100</b>, and when the distance exceeds a certain amount (threshold or predetermined amount) or is not detected, the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the rider has fallen. Image processing of a visual image captured by the camera <b>312</b> may also be used to help eliminate false determinations of a rider being down or up, as the object recognition using the image processor <b>326</b> can be used to identify which objects should be tracked and which distances should be used for the appropriate rider down determination.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The embodiments discussed above have been described with a single water-sports participant being detected and the notification (or other action) made when he or she falls. However, the embodiments and approaches discussed herein may be used for water sports and riders involving multiple water-sports participants. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, for example, is an image captured by an image sensor <b>310</b> located on the port side of the boat <b>100</b> (such as image sensor <b>310</b><i>c</i>, image sensor <b>310</b><i>e</i>, or image sensor <b>310</b><i>g </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). In the image there are two riders <b>12</b> and surfboards <b>14</b>, and the image processor <b>326</b> is configured to detect both riders <b>12</b> and/or surfboards <b>14</b> and determine if one or both of the riders <b>12</b> have fallen. The rider-down output discussed above may be generated when the image processor <b>326</b> determines that one of the two riders <b>12</b> is down. In other embodiments, the image processor may generate the output when it determines that both of the riders <b>12</b> are down. In this example, both of the riders <b>12</b> are wake surfers, surfing in a tandem arrangement, but the systems and methods discussed herein may be configured to detect riders engaged in different water sports simultaneously, such as a wake surfer and a foiler farther behind the wake surfer on the wake. The multiple detected water-sports participants may be detected even when they are not in a tandem arrangement, such as, for example, one surfer on the port side of the boat, and the other on the starboard side of the boat <b>100</b>. In addition, the multiple water-sports participants can be more than two.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the controller <b>320</b> is configured to execute a rider-down action (step S<b>730</b>) once the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the rider has fallen (step S<b>720</b>) and/or the controller <b>320</b> receives the rider-down output. Various suitable rider-down actions may be taken by the controller <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one embodiment, the rider-down action is an alert. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the controller <b>320</b> is communicatively coupled to at least one indicator <b>340</b>. When the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the rider has fallen, the controller <b>320</b> transmits an output to the indicator <b>340</b> to alert the driver or others that the rider has fallen. This output is referred to herein as an indicator output. Any suitable indicator <b>340</b> may be used to issue the alert. For example, the indicator may be one of the displays on the control console <b>180</b>, such as the center display <b>182</b>. Upon receipt of the indicator output from the controller <b>320</b>, the center display <b>182</b> displays the alert to indicate that the rider has fallen. The alert may take any suitable form, including, for example, a symbol, text, and/or coloring of the display. A light <b>342</b> is another suitable indicator <b>340</b>. When the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the rider has fallen, the controller <b>320</b> transmits an output to turn the light <b>342</b> on. Alternatively, the light <b>342</b> may be configured to flash to provide the alert that the rider has fallen. The light <b>342</b> may be located on the control console <b>180</b>, for example. A speaker <b>344</b> is another suitable indicator <b>340</b>. The controller <b>320</b> may be configured to transmit an output that causes the speaker <b>344</b> to issue an audible alert. The speaker <b>344</b> is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as being separate from the audio system <b>330</b>, but one or more of the speakers <b>170</b> of the audio system <b>330</b> may be used as the indicator <b>340</b>. The audible alert may be an alarm indicating that the rider has fallen, speech stating that the rider has fallen, or both.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The indicator <b>340</b> may be a suitable indication that alerts other boaters that the rider has fallen. For example, the indicator may be a flag <b>346</b>, such as a so-called &#x201c;skier-down flag.&#x201d; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref> show an example of an automatic skier-down flag assembly <b>350</b>. The skier-down flag <b>346</b> is a bright red or brilliant orange flag that is at least 12 by 12 inches in size and mounted on a pole <b>352</b> at least 24 inches long. Some states require that a flag be flown when the rider has fallen or is preparing to get up. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows the boat <b>100</b> with the automatic skier-down flag assembly <b>350</b> attached thereto. The skier-down flag <b>346</b> may be attached to the boat <b>100</b> at any suitable location visible to observers outside of the boat <b>100</b> including, for example, on the tower <b>160</b>, such as on one of the port leg <b>162</b> or the starboard leg <b>164</b>, or on the windshield <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">When the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the rider has fallen, the controller <b>320</b> transmits an output to deploy the skier-down flag <b>346</b>. Various suitable mechanisms may be used to deploy the skier-down flag <b>346</b>. The flag, more specifically the pole <b>352</b>, may be movably attached to the boat <b>100</b> and can move between a non-deployed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>) and a deployed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>) by rotating (e.g., pivoting about a pivot point). In this embodiment, the skier-down flag <b>346</b> is moved by an actuator <b>354</b> to rotate the skier-down flag <b>346</b> and, more specifically, the pole <b>352</b> about the pivot point. The controller <b>320</b> is configured to operate the actuator <b>354</b> to move the skier-down flag <b>346</b> between the non-deployed position and the deployed position. The controller <b>320</b> may be configured to move the light <b>342</b> to the deployed position when the image processor <b>326</b> determines the rider is down. The skier-down flag <b>346</b> may be moved in other ways, such as by translation (e.g., being raised linearly or telescopically).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Other suitable mechanisms may be used to deploy the skier-down flag <b>346</b>. For example, a biasing member, such as a spring, may be used to provide the motive force to move the skier-down flag <b>346</b> from the non-deployed position to the deployed position. The skier-down flag <b>346</b> may be held in the non-deployed position by a latch. In this example, the indicator output from the controller <b>320</b> to deploy the flag may release the latch such as by operating a solenoid.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the controller <b>320</b> is also communicatively coupled to other systems on the boat <b>100</b>, such as the propulsion system <b>200</b>, for example. When the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the rider has fallen (e.g., the controller <b>320</b> receives the rider-down output), rider-down output may be used to trigger other actions on the boat <b>100</b>. For example, upon determination by the image processor <b>326</b> that the rider is down, the controller <b>320</b> may reduce the speed of the boat <b>100</b>. The controller <b>320</b> is communicatively coupled to the propulsion system <b>200</b>, and upon determination by the image processor <b>326</b> that the rider is down, the controller <b>320</b> may operate the propulsion system <b>200</b>, such as by operating the throttle <b>214</b>, to reduce the speed (revolutions per minute, &#x201c;rpms&#x201d;) of the engine <b>210</b>. The controller <b>320</b> may move the throttle <b>214</b> to an idle position (rpm speed). In another approach, the controller <b>320</b> may change the set speed of the cruise control. In a further approach, the controller <b>320</b> may place the drive train in neutral.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The controller <b>320</b> is also communicatively coupled to the audio system <b>330</b> for the boat <b>100</b>. Upon determination by the image processor <b>326</b> that the rider is down, the controller <b>320</b> may adjust the audio system <b>330</b>. For example, the controller <b>320</b> may reduce the volume output by the speakers <b>170</b> of the audio system <b>330</b> or even mute the speakers <b>170</b>. Further, the controller <b>320</b> may be configured to control the audio source <b>334</b> upon determination by the image processor <b>326</b> that the rider is down. When the audio source <b>334</b> has the ability to pause (e.g., a playback device or device streaming audio), the controller <b>320</b> may be configured to pause playing the audio from the audio source <b>334</b> upon determination by the image processor <b>326</b> that the rider is down.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the discussion above, the actions by the controller <b>320</b> to operate the audio system <b>330</b> when the rider is down occur automatically when the image processor <b>326</b> determines that the rider is down. The controller <b>320</b> also may be responsive to other inputs from the operator that are indicative of a rider being down and adjust the audio system <b>330</b>, as discussed above, in response to those other inputs. For example, the operator may &#x201c;chop&#x201d; the throttle (control lever <b>212</b>) when he or she determines that the rider is down or receives the alert from the indicator <b>340</b> that the rider is down. The controller <b>320</b> may be configured to monitor the propulsion system <b>200</b>, and, more specifically, in this embodiment, the engine <b>210</b>, the throttle <b>214</b>, and/or the control lever <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the operator moves the control lever <b>212</b> to reduce the speed of the engine <b>210</b>, the controller <b>320</b> may detect such a deceleration as an indication that the rider is down. The controller <b>320</b> may detect that the rpms of the engine <b>210</b> have decreased from operating speeds for the water sport (e.g., 3000 rpms to 3500 rpms) to a speed closer to idle (e.g., 1000 rpms) or even idle (e.g., 700 rpms). In some embodiments, the indication that the rider has fallen is a decrease in engine rpms over a predetermined period of time. The reduction in rpms may be at least 500 rpms, more preferably at least 1000 rpms, even more preferably 1500 rpms, and still more preferably 2000 rpms. The period of time for this reduction may be, for example, one second or less. In other embodiments, the indication that the rider has fallen is a decrease in the speed of the boat <b>100</b> over a predetermined period of time. For surfing and similar water sports, the reduction in speed may be from surf speeds, such as 10 mph to 12 mph, to speeds of about 4 mph to 8 mph for a reduction of from 2 mph to 8 mph. For other water sports that occur when the boat <b>100</b> is on plane, such as wakeboarding, the reduction may be to speed below planing, such as preferably less than 15 mph and more preferably less than 10 mph. In wakeboarding, for example, such a speed differential would be from wakeboarding speed of 17 mph to 23 mph. The period of time for the speed reduction may be, for example, several seconds, such as between 2 seconds and 10 seconds. In some embodiments, where the boat is planing for example, the indication that the rider has fallen may simply be a reduction in speed, such as when the boat reduces speed below a threshold speed without considering the period of time over which the speed reduction occurs. In other embodiments, the indication that the rider has fallen may be from a sensor indicating the control lever <b>212</b> has been placed in neutral.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, this control of the audio system <b>330</b> based on deacceleration may only be active in a particular mode, such as one of the tow modes. Accordingly, the controller <b>320</b> may activate (or deactivate) the audio control when the rider falls, based on a user selecting a user-selectable element (e.g., the surf button <b>195</b>).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The rider-down analyses (step S<b>720</b>) discussed above have generally been designed to implement steps in the analysis to minimize the likelihood of false positives. A false positive includes, for example, identifying a person in the image, but the identified person is not the rider. In such a case, the image processor will not indicate the rider has fallen, when in fact, the rider may have fallen. Another example of a false positive may occur when the rider is just getting up (starting). In many cases, the rider will start in the water, and in such cases some of the analysis methods discussed above would determine that the rider is down and provide an alert or other action. When getting started, however, the alerts that the rider is down (or other actions taken when the rider is down) may not be desired. As noted above with reference to the process discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the controller <b>320</b> activates the process in step S<b>705</b>. The side display <b>184</b> may include a button (rider down alert button <b>304</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) used to activate or deactivate the rider-down analysis. Additionally or alternatively, the rider-down analysis may be performed only when operating in a particular mode, such as a tow mode, and thus the controller <b>320</b> activates the rider-down analysis when one of the surf button <b>195</b>, the wake button <b>197</b>, or the ski button <b>199</b> is selected, and deactivates the rider-down analysis when the chill button <b>193</b> is selected or the boat <b>100</b> is operating in the drive mode (e.g., the drive button <b>191</b> is selected).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In other embodiments, the controller <b>320</b> activates the rider-down analysis based on the operation of the boat <b>100</b>. Typically, the boat <b>100</b> is stopped or moving slowly as the rider is in the water getting ready. Once ready, the driver begins to accelerate the boat <b>100</b>. As noted above, the controller <b>320</b> is communicatively coupled to the propulsion system <b>200</b> and/or other sensors (such as GPS receivers) to monitor the operation of the propulsion system <b>200</b>, such as the speed of the engine <b>210</b> or the speed of the boat <b>100</b>. The rider-down analysis may be activated based on this acceleration. For example, the controller <b>320</b> may activate (enable) the rider-down analysis after a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 5 seconds) has elapsed from when the boat <b>100</b> begins to accelerate. In another example, the controller <b>320</b> activates the rider-down analysis after the boat reaches a threshold speed or sustains operation above the threshold speed for the predetermined amount of time.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the examples discussed above, the controller <b>320</b> activates the rider-down analysis, but instead of (or in addition to) activating or deactivating the rider-down analysis, the controller <b>320</b> may activate the rider-down actions. For example, the rider-down analysis may proceed in the background, but the controller <b>320</b> activates or deactivates the alerts based on the conditions discussed above.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Although this invention has been described with respect to certain specific exemplary embodiments, many additional modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of this disclosure.
