The large aperture lens is borne by a lens bearing apparatus. However, the large aperture lens is relatively heavy. Therefore, internal impact stress of the lens bearing apparatus increases when the lens bearing apparatus moves or is forced to shake. Consequently, the lens bearing apparatus and the lens are prone to damage, and imaging is affected.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This application provides a camera motor, a camera module, and an electronic device, to reduce impact on a lens bearing apparatus and a lens, reduce a risk of damage to the lens bearing apparatus and the lens, and ensure imaging quality.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect, this application provides a camera motor, and the camera motor is configured to drive a lens. The camera motor includes a motor housing, a lens bearing apparatus, a cushioning part, and a drive apparatus. The motor housing has an accommodating cavity. The lens bearing apparatus is accommodated in the accommodating cavity, and is spaced apart from an inner wall of the accommodating cavity. The cushioning part is disposed on an outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus. The lens bearing apparatus is configured to bear the lens, and can drive the lens to move in an optical axis direction of the lens relative to the outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus. The drive apparatus is accommodated in the accommodating cavity, and the drive apparatus can drive the lens bearing apparatus to move in the accommodating cavity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The lens bearing apparatus may include a bearer housing, a focusing apparatus, and a lens barrel. Both the focusing apparatus and the lens barrel are installed in the bearer housing. The lens is fastened in the lens barrel, and the focusing apparatus is configured to drive the lens barrel to move in the optical axis direction of the lens relative to the bearer housing, so that the lens barrel drives the lens to move relative to the bearer housing, thereby implementing focusing. In other words, when the lens bearer apparatus drives the lens to perform focusing, the lens can be enabled to move relative to the hearer housing, and the lens does not move together with the lens bearing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Any outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus may be spaced apart from the inner wall of the accommodating cavity. The drive apparatus is configured to drive the lens bearing apparatus to move on a plane perpendicular to the optical axis direction (the plane may be referred to as a circumferential plane), or may drive the lens bearing apparatus to tilt relative to the circumferential plane even if the lens performs tilting movement relative to the optical axis direction of the lens, to implement optical image stabilization.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cushioning part may be disposed on any outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus, and the cushioning part may be made of a material that can cushion vibration absorption. When the lens bearing apparatus collides with the inner wall of the accommodating cavity, the cushioning part can reduce impact stress on the lens bearing apparatus and the lens, to protect the lens bearing apparatus and the lens.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an implementation, the cushioning part includes a first cushioning part, and the first cushioning part can move in the accommodating cavity along with the lens bearing apparatus, and is in contact with or is separated from the inner wall of the accommodating cavity. When the lens bearing apparatus collides with the inner wall of the accommodating cavity, the first cushioning part comes into contact with the inner wall of the accommodating cavity, and when the lens bearing apparatus moves in an inverse direction, the first cushioning part is separated from the inner wall of the accommodating cavity. The first cushioning part may be made of a single material or a mixed material of several materials. The first cushioning part can cushion impact and reduce impact stress on the lens bearing apparatus and the lens, to protect the lens bearing apparatus and the lens and limit the lens bearing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an implementation, the cushioning part includes a second cushioning part, the second cushioning part connects the outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus and the inner wall of the accommodating cavity, and the second cushioning part can be deformed when the lens bearing apparatus moves in the accommodating cavity. The second cushioning part is always connected to the outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus and the inner wall of the accommodating cavity. The second cushioning part may be made of a material that has cushioning performance and damping performance and that can be elastically detbrmed. Due to the damping performance, the second cushioning part can suppress vibration of the lens bearing apparatus, to reduce or eliminate abnormal sound of the camera motor. In addition, the second cushioning part is soil in texture, and may be deformed when the lens bearing apparatus moves. Therefore, movement of the lens bearing apparatus is not hindered. The second cushioning part can play a role of absorbing impact and reducing impact stress.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an implementation, the lens bearing apparatus has a mounting through hole, and the mounting through hole is used to mount the lens. The outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus includes a peripheral side surface, and the peripheral side surface surrounds an axis of the mounting through hole. The peripheral side surface is spaced apart from the inner wall of the accommodating cavity, and the cushioning part is disposed on the peripheral side surface, The axis of the mounting through hole may be parallel to or approximately parallel to the optical axis direction of the lens. When the cushioning part is disposed on the peripheral side surface, impact stress on the lens bearing apparatus and the lens can be greatly reduced tbr a scenario in which the lens bearing apparatus moves on the circumferential plane.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an implementation, the outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus includes an axial plane, the peripheral side surface is connected to a periphery of the axial pian, the axial plane is perpendicular to the axis of the mounting through hole, the axial plane is spaced apart from the inner wall of the accommodating cavity, and the cushioning part is disposed on the axial plane. When the cushioning part is disposed on the axial plane, impact stress on the lens bearing apparatus and the lens can be greatly reduced for a scenario in which the lens bearing apparatus moves in the optical axis direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an implementation, the drive apparatus can drive the lens bearing apparatus to move on a plane perpendicular to the axis of the mounting through hole. The axis of the mounting through hole may be parallel to an optical axis of the lens.

The power supply part is fastened in the accommodating cavity, and the power supply part is configured to supply power to the shape memory alloy wire. One end of the shape memory alloy wire is fastened to the power supply part, and the other end of the shape memory alloy wire is fastened to the body part. The shape memory alloy wire can be deformed when being powered on, to drive the body part and the lens bearing apparatus to move. The drive apparatus can drive, by using a feature of the shape memory alloy wire, the lens bearing apparatus to move on the circumferential plane, to implement optical image stabilization. The elastic arm of the spring plate can provide elastic force, and the elastic force can enable the lens bearing apparatus to move stably and pull the lens bearing apparatus back to a specified position when power is off. When the cushioning part is disposed in the camera motor that uses the drive apparatus, impact stress on the lens bearing apparatus and the lens can be greatly reduced,</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an implementation, the lens bearing apparatus includes a permanent magnet disposed inside the lens bearing apparatus, the drive apparatus includes a power supply part and a coil (which may be referred to as an image stabilization coil), both the coil and the power supply part are spaced apart from the lens bearing apparatus, both the coil and the power supply part are fastened in the accommodating cavity, the coil is fastened to the power supply part, and the coil can apply driving force to the permanent magnet when being powered on, to drive the lens bearing apparatus to move. The coil of the drive apparatus can interact with the permanent magnet in the lens bearing apparatus, to drive the lens bearing apparatus to move on the circumferential plane, thereby implementing optical image stabilization. When the cushioning part is disposed in the camera motor that uses the drive apparatus, impact stress on the lens bearing apparatus and the lens can be greatly reduced.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an implementation, the drive apparatus includes an elastic column, one end of the elastic column is fastened to the power supply part, and the other end of the elastic column is fastened to the lens bearing apparatus. When the lens bearing apparatus moves, the elastic column can be elastically bent when being pulled by the lens bearing apparatus. By using the elastic column, the lens bearing apparatus may hang on the power supply part. The elastic column may further play a role of conducting electricity, to electrically connect the power supply part to a focusing coil in the lens bearing apparatus. When the lens bearing apparatus moves, the elastic column is bent when being pulled by the lens bearing apparatus. The lens bearing apparatus can stably move to a required position under the joint action of the image stabilization coil, the permanent magnet, and the elastic column. When power is off, the elastic column can be restored from deformation, to pull the lens bearing apparatus back to the specified position.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a second aspect, this application provides a camera motor, and the camera motor is configured to drive a lens.

The cushioning part is disposed on an outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus. The drive apparatus is configured to drive the lens bearing apparatus to move in an optical axis direction of the lens and move on a plane perpendicular to the optical axis direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this application, the lens bearing apparatus does not drive the lens to perform focusing movement, the lens bearing apparatus is only used to fasten the lens, so that there is no relative movement between the lens bearing apparatus and the lens. The drive apparatus can drive the lens bearing apparatus to move in the optical axis direction to implement focusing. The drive apparatus can further drive the lens bearing apparatus to move on a circumferential plane to implement optical image stabilization. The drive apparatus may also drive the lens bearing apparatus to tilt relative to the circumferential plane to implement optical image stabilization. The cushioning part may be disposed on any outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus, and the cushioning part may be made of a material that can cushion vibration absorption. When the lens bearing apparatus collides with the inner wall of the accommodating cavity, the cushioning part can reduce impact stress on the lens bearing apparatus and the lens, to protect the lens bearing apparatus and the lens.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an implementation, the cushioning part includes a first cushioning part, and the first cushioning part can move in the accommodating cavity along with the lens bearing apparatus, and is in contact with or is separated from the inner wall of the accommodating cavity.

A shape of the first cushioning part <b>24</b> may be designed based on a requirement, and is not limited to a hump, a strip, a block, or the like.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In Embodiment 1, because the first cushioning part <b>24</b> is disposed on an outer surface of the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b>, the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> can obtain better cushioning protection regardless of any position to which the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> moves. In this design, cushioning protection of the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> can be implemented with a relatively high yield rate by using a relatively small quantity of cushioning materials and a relatively simple structure.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the contrary, if the first cushioning part <b>24</b> is disposed on an inner surface of the motor housing, it is difficult to accurately learn an area of the inner surface in which the first cushioning part <b>24</b> collides with the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b>. To comprehensively protect the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b>, a cushioning material needs to be disposed on the entire inner surface. Consequently, consumption of the cushioning material is increased. Alternatively, if the first cushioning part <b>24</b> is disposed inside the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> (for example, on an outer wall of the lens barrel <b>26</b>), because an internal structure of the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> is very complex, adding the first cushioning part <b>24</b> inside the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> greatly increases structural design, production, and assembly difficulty. In addition, when the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> moves or is impacted, the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> may squeeze and rub the first cushioning part <b>24</b>, and fragments generated by the first cushioning part <b>24</b> easily fall on the lens <b>15</b>, the optical filter <b>18</b>, or an image sensor, and consequently, imaging is affected.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In Embodiment 1, When the lens <b>15</b> is a relatively heavy large aperture lens, load of the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> increases, and both the first spring plate in the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> and the second spring plate <b>27</b> in the drive apparatus <b>22</b> are relatively &#x201c;soft&#x201d; in the optical axis direction, so that elastic force that can be provided is limited, and the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> cannot be properly stabilized. Therefore, the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> is prone to vibration or forced vibration, and consequently abnormal sound occurs on the camera motor <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">To suppress vibration of the camera motor <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a second cushioning part <b>25</b> (to clearly identify the second cushioning part <b>25</b>, and the second cushioning part <b>25</b> is schematically represented by using shadow) may further be disposed between the first axial surface <b>231</b> and the first cover <b>201</b>, and the second cushioning part <b>25</b> connects the first axial surface <b>231</b> and the first cover <b>201</b>. The second cushioning part <b>25</b> may be made of a material that has cushioning performance and damping performance and that can be elastically deformed, such as damping glue. Due to the damping performance, the second cushioning part <b>25</b> can suppress vibration of the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b>, to reduce or eliminate the abnormal sound on the camera motor <b>16</b>. In addition, the second cushioning part <b>25</b> is soft in texture, and may be deformed when the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> moves. Therefore, movement of the lens bearing apparatus <b>21</b> is not hindered. Certainly, the second cushioning part <b>25</b> can also play a role of absorbing impact and reducing impact of impact stress. It may be understood that, for any type of lens <b>15</b>, the second cushioning part <b>25</b> may be disposed to perform vibration absorption and cushioning, and is not limited to the large aperture lens.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Second cushioning parts <b>25</b> may be distributed in an area with relatively high vibration strength, to suppress vibration to a maximum extent. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, one second cushioning part <b>25</b> may be disposed on each of four former positions on the first axial surface <b>231</b>. Certainly, the second cushioning parts <b>25</b> may also be distributed in another area on the first axial surface <b>231</b>. To further suppress vibration, the second cushioning part <b>25</b> may be further connected between the peripheral side surface <b>232</b> and the side frame <b>202</b>. Alternatively, the second. cushioning part <b>25</b> may be disposed only between the peripheral side surface <b>232</b> and the side frame <b>202</b>.

When the image stabilization coil <b>322</b> is powered on, ampere force is applied to the image stabilization coil <b>322</b>, and the ampere force is in the direction parallel to the circumferential plane.
