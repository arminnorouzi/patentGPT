Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to devices and methods for monitoring patients in the course of the administration of a prescription therapeutic that is known to have consciousness altering effects requiring monitoring for safety and efficacy.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Background Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are many different prescription therapeutics that have consciousness-altering effects that require monitoring for safety and efficacy. One particular group of therapeutics having these effects are the class commonly referred to as psychedelics. Psychedelics are substances that are capable of inducing subjective effects such as a dream-like alteration of consciousness, affective changes, enhanced introspective abilities, visual imagery, pseudo- and true hallucinations, synesthesia, altered temporal and spatial perception, mystical-type experiences, disembodiment and ego dissolution (Liechti, 2017; Passie, Halpern, Stichtenoth, Emrich &#x26; Hintzen, 2008). Psychedelics have been used in isolation and to assist psychotherapy for many indications including anxiety, depression, addiction, personality disorder and others and can also be used to treat other disorders such as cluster headache and migraine and others (Passie et al., 2008; Hintzen et al., 2010; Nichols, 2016; Liechti, 2017).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, during a treatment session, patients are administered a consciousness-altering therapeutic such as a psychedelic and are continuously monitored by medical professionals throughout its duration of action. Patients often listen to music, are provided with eyeshades, and are encouraged to stay introspective and open to feelings, and attentive to thoughts and memories. Psychotherapy can be provided before, during, and/or after a treatment session (Schenberg, Front Pharmacol. 2018; 9: 733).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With a treatment session lasting between 30 mins and 12 hours, a medical professional is limited in how many treatments can be provided in a day. There are many people who might sustain benefit from such a psychotherapy, and the availability of treatment is limited by the time required of the medical professionals in monitoring the patients, and the limited number of appropriately qualified and trained medical professionals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patient monitoring systems are any devices that allow healthcare providers to monitor aspects of a patient's health. Usually, the devices include a sensor to detect a particular health parameter and wiring/electronics to relay the information to a processing unit and screen to display the parameter reading. The devices can include ECG machines, thermometers, pulse oximeters, capnography machines, and sphygmomanometers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Remote patient monitoring systems allow healthcare providers to monitor a patient remotely, i.e., outside of a hospital or physician's office. These devices collect data about a patient, store the data, and can transmit the data to a healthcare provider. The healthcare provider can review the data collected and make suggestions to the patient in treatment. Devices include health and fitness trackers, wearable heart monitors, and glucose monitors.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Remote patient monitoring provides several advantages. Providing real-time health data to a healthcare provider allows the healthcare provider to be aware of their patient's current health status, be aware of patient's safety, and make informed decisions and adjustments in dosing or type of medication. There are fewer in-person visits to a doctor's office required for the patient. The patient can often view their health results in a smart phone application so they can be aware of their health. It also allows for healthcare providers to monitor more patients at once.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There remains a need for a method of monitoring patients receiving consciousness-altering therapeutics such as psychedelics to allow more patients to receive treatment.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides for a system for monitoring patients during a consciousness-altering therapeutic treatment session including a data collection module in electronic communication with network servers for storage of data on non-transitory computer readable media for monitoring a patient's well-being during and after the treatment session.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention generally provides for a method of using the system in treating a patient, by continuously, continually, or at the healthcare professionals discretion monitoring the well-being of the patient during a consciousness-altering therapeutic treatment session through one or more wearable devices and a patient mobile device in electronic communication with a facilitator mobile device, and continuously monitoring the well-being of the patient after the treatment session with the wearable device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other advantages of the present invention are readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow chart of movement of information within the system;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a further detailed diagram of components and data of the system; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a screenshot of a facilitator pre-session checklist.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention generally provides for a system <b>10</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for monitoring the well-being of patients during a consciousness-altering therapeutic treatment session that includes a data collection module <b>12</b> in electronic communication with network servers <b>14</b> for storage of data on non-transitory computer readable media. The system <b>10</b> allows for continuous monitoring of patients both at a treatment center as well as after a treatment session at home or otherwise remote from the treatment center. The system <b>10</b> also enhances the ability of the administering healthcare professional, in combination with clinical judgment, to determine when the patient is no longer acutely affected by the therapeutic agent and the treatment session can be ended.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Most generally, the system <b>10</b> monitors the well-being of a patient, which includes how they are reacting to a consciousness-altering therapeutic treatment, both during a treatment session and immediately after a treatment session has ended. The system <b>10</b> can monitor adverse events (including negative emotional valence and anxiety) that can require acute attention or care to the patient, extent of a treatment session with consciousness altering effects, or change of therapeutic approach.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">More specifically, the data collection module <b>12</b> includes patient-associated devices including a patient mobile device <b>16</b> (such as a smartphone or tablet), at least one wearable device <b>18</b> (such as a smartwatch or fitness band), a sound system <b>20</b>, and a blood pressure monitor <b>22</b>.

The patient is scheduled for their first treatment visit, and the patient comes into the treatment facility.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A hardware and system check is performed. The facilitator comes in the session with a pre-calibrated and pre-set device toolkit, including the facilitator's mobile device <b>24</b>, the patient is given the wearable device <b>18</b> of a smart watch, the patient mobile device <b>16</b> (smart phone), and a blood pressure monitor <b>22</b>. The facilitator makes sure the devices are charged, makes sure the devices are paired/synchronized, makes sure the applications on the patient's devices are running/recording [status on screens], and makes sure the internet connection is working [status on screens].</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The facilitator has an introductory chat with the patient about what is going to happen during the sitting.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The facilitator sets up the devices on the patient by placing the smart watch on the patient's dominant hand and asking the patient to place the smart phone in the pocket, pouch, or on the table nearby. These devices monitor the patient's behavior and physiological status from this moment throughout the session (as well as after the session).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The facilitator sets up the session and can be guided step-by-step by an on-device application interface. The facilitator insets his ID (facilitator ID), selects the patient's ID from a list or adds a new one, confirms the pre-generated session ID, selects the session type (i.e. type of consciousness-altering therapeutic such as ketamine, LSD, psilocybin, ibogaine, or others listed above), selects dosing, and the facilitator makes sure that the setting is appropriate for treatment (i.e. there are no flashing lights, no loud noises, and this can be guided by the application on the facilitator mobile device <b>24</b>).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The facilitator performs a baseline assessment of the patient's psychological state and is guided step-by-step by on-device application interface, and an example of a checklist is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The facilitator asks the patient to fill in a battery of digitized questionnaires or cognitive tasks (a specific set depends on the patient's diagnosis and treatment, e.g., for anxiety&#x2014;OASIS [anxiety] Q-LES-Q-SF [quality of life]). These can be ePRO, eCOA, EMA or ClinRO. The results of these questionnaires can be visible on the facilitator mobile device <b>24</b>. The facilitator asks the patient to assume a resting position, and automatically gets readings for the patient's heart rate (via smart watch), blood pressure (via Bluetooth&#xae;-enabled blood pressure monitor <b>22</b>), the patient's overall stress level can be measured based on data collected so far from results of questionnaires, heart rate readings, blood pressure readings, and gathered audio (via sentiment analysis). The facilitator can ask the patient to run a urine pregnancy test and the facilitator can input the results in the application on his device <b>24</b>. The facilitator can perform a drug abuse test, and the patient can look straight into a camera on the facilitator mobile device <b>24</b>.

After device restart, triggered either by the user or because of low battery, the data collection needs to be initiated manually.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">Data upload protocol on smartphone: Through extensive battery profiling, it was found that uploads do not have as significant impact on battery as for instance zipping files or writing to disk. The system has configurable data saving and data upload periods. The system keeps recorded data backed on the device until the batch is sent successfully and deletes the data batch only after successful upload is confirmed. Phone-to-server upload is executed via Wi-Fi and/or via cellular data program. The system is optimized for Wi-Fi as the main upload channel.

In case the paired phone is out of reach, the watch has stored credentials to the Wi-Fi network used by the phone and will attempt to upload autonomously. The system is optimized for Wi-Fi as the main upload channel. If Wi-Fi is not available (or of unstable signal quality), the system sends data batches via cellular data program.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">Device charging protocol: The system and all devices are optimized for overnight or between-session charging, as most of the therapeutic sessions utilizing consciousness-altering occur during the day. Furthermore, it was desired to align the required device management with day shifts of a facility's clinical staff. This simplifies third-party annotation of patient physiological and psychological state and well-being. However, the system can be modified to fit differing charging requirements or study designs, as it is expected that in future use cases the device charging schedule would need to align with the patient's incidence (e.g., withdrawal or clinical stability).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">The system <b>10</b> is actively sending multiple alerts to the backend.

The system <b>10</b> can provide automatic detection of mood swings, early onset of panic attacks, and other psychological states and behavioral correlates of consciousness altering effects of the administered therapeutic. The system <b>10</b> can provide continuous monitoring and real-time detection of adverse events related to consciousness altering treatment (in-session and between sessions). There can be automatic analysis of the clinician's/facilitator's notes and the ability to automatically identify, extract, and present critical moments, comment, and highlights of the treatment session.

A clinician is no longer needed to run a treatment session, but rather a certified nurse or other facilitator can run a treatment session because the clinician can remotely monitor the data and supervise the treatment session. If anything serious occurs during a treatment session, the facilitator can review the data with the clinician quickly. This allows the clinician to monitor multiple patients at the same time instead of just a single patient. The data collected also allows the clinician to predict a serious event and this gives them time to adjust the treatment or intervene. After a treatment session, if any serious effects are present or if a serious event is predicted, the clinician can review the data that is collected while the patient is at home and intervene if necessary. Collecting data long term on patients can be used in building databases of patients and predicting results in new patients based on similar patients in the database.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">Providing real-time health data to the clinician allows the clinician to be aware of the patient's current health status, be aware of the patient's safety, and make informed decisions and adjustments in dosing or type of medication. Fewer in-person visits to a doctor's office are required for the patient. The patient can view their health results in a smart phone application so they can be aware of their health.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">The invention is further described in detail by reference to the following experimental examples.
