This rigidity presents limitations in many robotic applications, caused, at least in part, by the weight-to-power ratio of servomotors and other rigid robotics devices. The field of soft robotics improves on these limitations by using artificial muscles and other soft actuators. Artificial muscles attempt to mimic the versatility, performance, and reliability of a biological muscle. Some artificial muscles rely on fluid-based actuators. For example, certain artificial muscles may introduce fluid into and out of a volume to expand or contract the artificial muscles to perform mechanical work on a load. However, these artificial muscles have some material limitations due to a reliance on heat sealing and adhesives.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, a need exists for methods of manufacturing artificial muscles that facilitate the use of materials that are difficult to heat seal.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a method of manufacturing an electrode assembly includes positioning a layer stack comprising an electrode positioned between an electrode insulator and a support polymer in a vacuum bag, removing air from the vacuum bag thereby vacuum coupling the electrode to the electrode insulator, and removing the layer stack from the vacuum bag, where upon removal of the layer stack from the vacuum bag, the electrode remains vacuum coupled to the electrode insulator and the electrode insulator is in direct contact with the electrode, thereby forming an electrode assembly.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, a method of manufacturing an artificial muscle includes forming a first electrode assembly and a second electrode assembly.

The methods of manufacturing artificial muscles described herein include a vacuum sealing process, which facilitates the use of certain high performance electrode insulators that are unable to effectively heat seal. Without intending to be limited by theory, in the field of dielectric elastomer actuators, increasing the dielectric constant of the electrical insulating polymer (e.g., the electrode insulators of artificial muscles described herein) increases actuator performance. However, high dielectric constant polymers, such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), do not effectively heat seal to an electrode. While an adhesive layer may be positioned between the high dielectric constant polymer and the electrode, the inclusion of an adhesive will introduce series capacitance complexity. Thus, forming artificial muscles in which the electrode insulators are vacuum coupled to the electrode facilitates the use of high dielectric constant polymers, increasing the performance of the artificial muscles. Various embodiments of artificial muscles and methods of manufacturing artificial muscles are described in more detail herein. Whenever possible, the same reference numerals will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> depict an artificial muscle <b>101</b> that may be formed using the methods of manufacturing depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref>. In particular, the artificial muscle <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> comprises a housing <b>110</b> having an electrode region <b>194</b> and an expandable fluid region <b>196</b>. An electrode pair <b>104</b> comprising a first electrode <b>106</b> and a second electrode <b>108</b> is positioned in the electrode region <b>194</b> of the housing <b>110</b> and a dielectric fluid <b>198</b> is housed within the housing <b>110</b>. In operation, the electrode pair <b>104</b> is actuatable between a non-actuated state and an actuated state such that actuation from the non-actuated state to the actuated state directs the dielectric fluid <b>198</b> into the expandable fluid region <b>196</b>, expanding the expandable fluid region <b>196</b>, which may provide an actuation force. In addition, the artificial muscle <b>101</b> includes the first electrode insulator <b>111</b> vacuum coupled to the first electrode <b>106</b> in direct contact with the first electrode <b>106</b> and a second electrode insulator <b>112</b> vacuum coupled to the second electrode <b>108</b> in direct contact with the second electrode <b>108</b>.

Acome, S. K. Mitchell, T. G. Morrissey, M. B. Emmett, C. Benjamin, M. King, M. Radakovitz, and C. Keplinger (Science 5 Jan. 2018: Vol. 359, Issue 6371, pp. 61-65). Embodiments of the artificial muscle <b>101</b> including two pairs of tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> on each of the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>, respectively, reduces the overall mass and thickness of the artificial muscle <b>101</b>, reduces the amount of voltage required during actuation, and decreases the total volume of the artificial muscle <b>101</b> without reducing the amount of resulting force after actuation as compared to known HASEL actuators including donut-shaped electrodes having a uniform, radially-extending width. More particularly, the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> of the artificial muscle <b>101</b> provide zipping fronts that result in increased actuation power by providing localized and uniform hydraulic actuation of the artificial muscle <b>101</b> compared to HASEL actuators including donut-shaped electrodes. Specifically, one pair of tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> provides twice the amount of actuator power per unit volume as compared to donut-shaped HASEL actuators, while two pairs of tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> provide four times the amount of actuator power per unit volume. The bridge portions <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> interconnecting the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> also limit buckling of the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> by maintaining the distance between adjacent tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> during actuation. Because the bridge portions <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> are integrally formed with the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b>, the bridge portions <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> also prevent leakage between the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> by eliminating attachment locations that provide an increased risk of rupturing.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In operation, when the artificial muscle <b>101</b> is actuated, expansion of the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> produces a force of 3 Newton-millimeters (N&#xb7;mm) per cubic centimeter (cm3) of actuator volume or greater, such as 6 N&#xb7;mm per cm3 or greater, 10 N&#xb7;mm per cm3 or greater, 15 N&#xb7;mm per cm3 or greater, 25 N&#xb7;mm per cm3 or greater, 50 N&#xb7;mm per cm3 or greater, 100 N&#xb7;mm per cm3 or greater, or the like. Indeed, without intending to be limited by theory, increasing the dielectric constant of the first electrode insulator <b>111</b> and the second electrode insulator <b>112</b> causes a corresponding increase in the actuation force achievable by the artificial muscle <b>101</b>. That is, the dielectric constant of the first electrode insulator <b>111</b> and the second electrode insulator <b>112</b> has a linear relationship with the achievable actuation force of the artificial muscle <b>101</b> such that doubling the dielectric constant of the first electrode insulator <b>111</b> and the second electrode insulator <b>112</b> doubles the achievable actuation force of the artificial muscle <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, the size of the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> is proportional to the amount of displacement of the dielectric fluid <b>198</b>. Therefore, when greater displacement within the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> is desired, the size of the electrode pair <b>104</b> is increased relative to the size of the expandable fluid region <b>196</b>. It should be appreciated that the size of the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> is defined by the central openings <b>146</b>, <b>168</b> in the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>. Thus, the degree of displacement within the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> may alternatively, or in addition, be controlled by increasing or reducing the size of the central openings <b>146</b>, <b>168</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref> methods of manufacturing an artificial muscle, such as the artificial muscle <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, that include a vacuum coupling process to directly couple an electrode, such the first electrode <b>106</b>, to an electrode insulator, such as the first electrode insulator <b>111</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> depict a schematic cross section of a first layer stack <b>30</b>A and a second layer stack <b>30</b>B that comprise layers of material that may to be formed into a first electrode assembly <b>40</b>A and a second electrode assembly <b>40</b>B, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>).

The high dielectric constant polymer may comprise a halogenated polymer, for example, a fluoropolymer polymer such as PVDF. Without intending to be limited by theory, polymers that contain a VDF (vinylidene difluoride) monomer typically have a high dielectric constant.
