invention relates to storage systems. More specifically but not exclusively the present invention relates to storage systems for growing living organisms.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional systems and methods for growing certain crops are well known. Most require large areas of land and need to be positioned in appropriate locations for the conditions required for the crops to be grown.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">More recently, advanced farming techniques such as hydroponics have led to the ability to grow high quality crops indoors with very high utilisation of lighting, water and fertiliser. However, these systems have been less efficient in terms of land use, capital and labour.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure describes systems and methods for improving the efficiency of these types of techniques.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some commercial and industrial activities require systems that enable the storage and retrieval of a large number of different products. One known type of system for the storage and retrieval of items in multiple product lines involves arranging storage containers or containers in stacks on top of one another, the stacks being arranged in rows. The storage containers or containers are accessed from above, removing the need for aisles between the rows and allowing more containers to be stored in a given space.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Methods of handling containers stacked in rows have been well known for decades. In some such systems, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,701,065, to Bertel comprise free-standing stacks of containers arranged in rows in order to reduce the storage volume associated with storing such containers but yet still providing access to a specific container if required. Access to a given container is made possible by providing relatively complicated hoisting mechanisms which can be used to stack and remove given containers from stacks. The cost of such systems are, however, impractical in many situations and they have mainly been commercialised for the storage and handling of large shipping containers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The concept of using freestanding stacks of containers and providing a mechanism to retrieve and store specific containers has been developed further, for example as described in EP 0 767 113 B to Cimcorp. EP'113 discloses a mechanism for removing a plurality of stacked containers, using a robotic load handler in the form of a rectangular tube which is lowered around the stack of containers, and which is configured to be able to grip a container at any level in the stack. In this way, several containers can be lifted at once from a stack. The movable tube can be used to move several containers from the top of one stack to the top of another stack, or to move containers from a stack to an external location and vice versa. Such systems can be particularly useful where all of the containers in a single stack contain the same product (known as a single-product stack).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the system described in EP'113, the height of the tube has to be as least as high as the height of the largest stack of containers, so that that the highest stack of containers can be extracted in a single operation. Accordingly, when used in an enclosed space such as a warehouse, the maximum height of the stacks is restricted by the need to accommodate the tube of the load handler.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">EP 1037828 B1 (Autostore) the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, describes a system in which stacks of containers are arranged within a frame structure. Robotic load handling devices can be controllably moved around the stack on a system of tracks on the upper most surface of the stack.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other forms of robotic load handling device are further described in, for example, Norwegian patent number 317366, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further development of load handling device is described in PCT publication WO 2015/019055 A1 (Ocado Innovation Limited) where each robotic load handler only covers one grid space, thus allowing higher density of load handlers and thus higher throughput of a given size system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In such known storage systems a large number of containers are stacked densely. The containers are conventionally used to store goods to supply online grocery orders picked by robots.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Storage systems are known to be used for growing living organisms using hydroponic methods. As mentioned above, but now in more detail, hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil by instead using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. Plants typically grown in soil or land may be grown with their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid, or the roots may be physically supported by a medium such as perlite, Rockwool&#x2122;, vermiculite, coco fibre, sand or gravel. The nutrients used in hydroponic systems can come from an array of different sources. The delivery frequency of nutrients is governed by parameters such as plant size, plant growing stage, climate, substrate, and substrate conductivity, pH, and water content.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In connection with growing crops for consumptions, pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a group of chemicals that can be naturally occurring in plants as a defense mechanism against insects, other pests or microbiological hazards. Some PAs exhibit hepatotoxicity that is damaging to the liver. Therefore PAs may be subject to regulation in food and particularly in herbs and medicines because a build-up of these chemicals in the body can represent a health risk. PAs can be particularly prevalent in crops such as medicinal herbs so there is a need to minimise the level of PAs found in crops.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In hydroponic growing systems the quantity of water required to grow a crop to harvest is greatly reduce compared with soil-based agriculture. In a run-to-waste system, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;The Bengal System&#x201d;, nutrient and water solution is periodically applied to the medium surface. Nutrient-rich waste may be collected and re-used in the system.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A development of a growing system and method is described in PCT publication W<b>02016</b>/<b>166311</b>A<b>1</b> (Ocado Innovation Limited) where plants are grown in containers and the containers are stored in stacks. Within individual containers, services are provided for enabling plants to grow. Load handing devices are used to take containers from the stack and deposit them in alternative locations.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">UK application GB1911505.4 (Ocado Innovation Limited) &#x201c;Hydroponics Growing System and Method&#x201d; disclose another hydroponic growing system. Seeds are pre-treated and germinated in a &#x2018;high-care&#x2019; portion to reduce contamination during germination. Seedlings are then moved to a growing room in support vehicles containing growing trays move along a frame or rack as the crop grows and until the crop is ready for harvesting. The system disclosed includes illumination apparatus above each growing station, and a recirculating irrigation system for providing nutrients to a growing crop. The irrigation system uses mains water blended with nutrients, which is pumped to the growing crop. Water which drains from the racks is reintroduced to the water blend to minimise waste water.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention aims to further develop the systems and methods of growing living organisms or crops. An aim of the present invention is to maximise the quality and yield of the crop. Further, an aim of the present invention is to improve efficiency in terms of use of assets, resources and services required by the crop.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Aspects of the invention are set out in the accompanying claims.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Hydroponic system, growth trays, light boxes, growth tray systems, and methods for storing, germinating, propagating and or growing living organisms are provided.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A growth tray for storing, germinating, propagating and or growing living organisms, wherein the growth tray is a stackable item and comprises: a drainage system, the drainage system comprising: an inclined growing surface, inclined in a direction to at least one drainage hole; a drainage routing structure positioned over the at least one drainage hole, and having a down-pipe and a connecting routing pipe, wherein the down-pipe is for receiving fluid from an adjacent-above stackable item and transmitting the fluid to an adjacent-below down-pipe or a drain-pipe, and the connecting routing pipe is for receiving fluid from an adjacent-above drainage hole and routing the fluid to the down-pipe, and wherein fluid propagating from the inclined growing surface or an adjacent-above stackable item is directed through the growth tray to a down-steam point in the drainage system is provided.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The inclined growing surface may comprise a plurality of ribs providing a plurality of drainage channels therebetween. The growth tray may further comprise a drainage gutter, substantially centrally located, and the inclined growing surface comprises opposed first and second surfaces directed to drain into the drainage gutter; or wherein the drainage gutter is located along one edge or side of the growth tray and the inclined growing surface comprises a single surface directed to drain into the gutter.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this way a growth tray with an integrated or built-in drainage system is provided. The incline or slop of the tray ensures that there is no resting or standing fluid when the growth tray has finished draining. The arrangement may help to efficiently recycle fluid within the system, returning the fluid through the drain system to be filtered and remixed to properly balance the proportion of nutrients in the water for re-use in the system on the same. The integrated tray drainage system originates from the growing surface itself and continues directly to a main drain. As a result there is no need for additional pipes between the growth tray and the main drain to act as a conduit for run-off fluid. Thereby, the drainage/growth tray with integrated drainage ensures efficient use of water and nutrients as delivered to the growth surface and required by a crop of living organisms. In turn this may help to reduce the costs of resources for running a hydroponic system and reduce the environmental impact of a hydroponic system. Further, the length of drainage system may be reduced, and as a result proportionately reducing the amount of equipment that requires cleaning.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, as fluid from an adjacent-above drainage hole is routed directly into the down-pipe of an adjacent-above stackable item, contamination from overflow or run-off fluid from an above growth tray to a below growth tray may be avoided. Still further, the internal drainage system from the inclined surfaces and into the drain pipe system may reduce over splash from the growth trays on to other growth trays in the system thereby reducing cross-contamination between growth trays and reducing the amount of required cleaning.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The growth tray may be arranged in a stack with a plurality of stackable items. In some arrangements, the growth tray may further comprise: a body; and two or more stacking legs protruding from a lower surface of the body and arranged around the perimeter of the body, wherein at least one of the two or more stacking legs is located below the drainage routing structure and wherein the down-pipe extends through the at least one stacking leg. The stacking legs may be located at each corner and at a mid-point of the body.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The growth tray further may comprise one or more a structure for lifting the growth tray. The lifting structure may be a feature of the drainage routing structure, may be a feature of the growth tray body, or located at one or more corner(s) of the growth tray. The body of the growth tray may further comprise: reinforcement rods, wherein the reinforcement rods are encased within the body of the growth tray.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this way, the growth trays may be stacked with like growth trays or other items and may be moved around within a hydroponic system. This assists in using the space within the hydroponic system efficiently. Further, it allows growth trays to be moved around within the system as needed, for example, as a crop progresses through different growth stages and positioned in different areas of the high-care portion of the facility dependent on their particular needs. Growth trays containing crops with similar requirements may be positioned close to each other for efficiency of the system. Alternatively, some crops may benefit from being interspersed with other types of crops.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reinforcement rods may be necessary to avoid trays bending in use under the weight of the crop and fluid thereon. Reinforcement rods may be inserted during manufacture and then sealed into the growth tray structure to avoid additional surfaces that could require cleaning. This helps to ensure that the trays maintain their alignment features in the correct position and to ensure that the growth trays are reusable after a crop has been harvested. In this way, waste of growth trays is reduced and the need for replacement growth trays is minimised. In turn this assists in maximising the use of assets in the system.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment, a growth tray for storing, germinating, propagating and or growing living organisms, comprising: a body; a growing surface within the body; and at least one inductive coil or wireless power transfer means for receiving power.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The growth tray may further comprise: at least one control interface for receiving control signals from a central control system, and or for transmitting data from one or more sensors.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The growth tray may further comprise: first and second sets of wheels located on opposed sides the body for moving the growth tray along a track, wherein received power and control instructions may activate the first and second sets of wheels to propel the growth tray along the track.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The wheels may comprise: low friction sliders, low friction bearings, or magnetic components.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The growth tray may further comprise: at least one control interface.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this way, a mobilised growth tray is provided. Rather than moving growth trays around the system manually or using, for example, one or more load handling devices, the growth trays remain on a track for a substantial part of their growth cycle, and may be moved between different zones or areas along the track. As will be appreciated, this arrangement reduces the amount of labour required in managing the growth trays during the life-cycle of the living organisms.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Power and movement of the growth trays may be provided through the inductive coil from a corresponding inductive coil located on or along a track. Each tray may have more than one inductive coil, or a series of inductive coils&#x2014;for example each serving a different purpose. Two or more tracks may be arranged above one-another to form a rack.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this way, many trays may be arranged in a racking system to efficiently store, germinate, propagate and grow living organisms to maturity before harvesting. The growth trays may be provided with services and utilities to ensure substantially optimal growing conditions to maximise the crop yield and quality.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The location and movement of growth trays may be controlled by a centralised control system through a control interface on each of the growth trays. For example, a control interface may be positioned on the side of each of the growth trays so that they may be easily accessed to monitor and control each tray.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, as each growth tray may be individually traced and tracked within a hydroponic facility, consistency between crops may be improved&#x2014;for example using identification means such as RFID tags. Still further, sensors may be embedded within the trays making a &#x2018;smart&#x2019; tray. For example, sensors may comprise one or more sensors for detecting the temperature of the air, the relative humidity, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, the pH, temperature, concentration and or electrical conductivity of the nutrient fluid, one or more cameras, the air flow rate, for the air pressure, fluid volume and flow rate through values etc.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Information or data from the sensors may be relayed to the control system via the control interface. Similarly control instructions from the control system may be received via the control interface. It will be appreciate that the control interface may comprise any suitable means for data transmission. For example, the control interface may comprise a transmitter and receiver, a transceiver, a WiFi interface, an optical wireless communication interface such as a LiFi (light fidelity) wireless interface. In some arrangements, the data exchange may be through a physical channel, however, it will be appreciated that wireless communication may be preferred due to the advantages they provide.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Li-Fi systems are capable of transmitting data at high speeds over visible light, ultraviolet and infrared spectrums. Typically, optical wireless interfaces use light from LEDs. It will be appreciated that Li-Fi does not require a physical connection. Using Li-Fi has the advantage of avoiding potential interference with or from other electromagnetic interfaces. The spectrum of light used for communication may be selected to be outside the spectrum required for growth of the living organisms.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternatively, the communication interface may comprise a Wi-Fi interface. It will be appreciated that Wi-Fi does not require a physical connection.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The control system may receive data from the trays or elsewhere within the system, and provide control instructions based on that data.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The growth tray may further comprise: lights located on the lower surface of the body for providing light to another growth tray located adjacent-below.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Of course, it is well-known that many living organisms, such as plants, require light to grow. As will be appreciated, if growth trays are placed on a rack it would be advantageous to provide light over each level of the rack to ensure each growth tray receives optimal levels of light for growth. In use on a rack with several levels, or in a stack, as a result of providing lights on the lower surface of each growth tray, it is possible to provide lighting a growth tray positioned below. The lighting for each growth tray may be controlled by the control system on the basis of the growth tray located below&#x2014;therefore, positional and identification information of the trays may be provided to the central control system in order to control the lighting system.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another well-known requirement of living organisms is water and nutrients. The growth tray may further comprise: a fluid inlet, arranged to introduce fluid into a rim, substantially around the perimeter of the inclined growing surface wherein, introduced fluid spreads around the rim and disperses over the growing surface.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this way, each tray may be provided with fluid comprising a mix of water and nutrients, balanced for the particular crop. The rim helps to ensure that the fluid is distributed substantially evenly over the growth surface so that each individual living organisms may receive the require nutrition. Further, the rim helps to ensure that fluid may be received by the growth surface in a controlled way so as not to disturb the living organisms.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The fluid inlet may comprise a magnet cuff for attracting and locating an attachment, for example a hose. The hose and may be engageable with the fluid inlet. The hose may comprise an interfacing magnetic cuff, and or wherein the hose comprises a spring mechanism. The magnetic cuff may be an electromagnet.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this way, the control system, via the one or more inductive coils, may control when a hose is attached to the fluid inlet. For example, one or more hoses may be arranged along a track, and the electromagnet may be activated when the growth tray is near to a hose, or when the crop contained on the growth tray requires more fluid. It will be appreciated that different hoses may provide different nutritional blends, as required at different stages during a life cycle. Therefore, each growth tray may receive a specific dose of fluid tailored to the specific instance of the crop, for example, each tray may have individual dose patterns for providing fluid at different times throughout the growth period for the crop in the growth tray and further, may have a specific nutrient mix tailored to the crop type.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Fluid may be introduced to the growing surface from below or from the underside of the growth medium (rather than from above). Fluid may flood the base of the growth tray and saturate the roots and growth medium uniformly. In this way, seeds and seedlings are less likely to be disturbed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Fluid may be introduced and drained through the same hole in the growth tray. Typically located through the centre of the base of the growth tray.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The growing surface may be inclined in the direction of a drainage system, as noted above in connection with other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Another aspect of the invention provides, a light box, wherein the light box is a stackable item, the light box comprises: a frame structure having legs locatable on the perimeter of the growth tray;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">and a surface comprising lights on the underside, wherein the light box is arranged to be stacked as a lid to growth tray.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this way, where growth trays are arranged in a stack or at the top level of a rack, each growth tray may be provided with light.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The light box may be arranged to interface with the drainage system of a growth tray or another stacked item adjacent-above or adjacent-below the light box, and wherein the legs comprise a hollow tube to provide a continuous down-pipe.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this way, each growth tray in a stack may be provided with light and an integrated drainage system.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The light box may have a lattice structure extending between two or more legs of the frame structure. The lattice structure may be adaptable to match the length of the legs.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this way, the light box allows air to flow around and over the crop in the stack. Air flow within the system may be maintained, even where stacks of growth trays are positioned close to each other. Further, as a particular crop grows, it may be necessary to increase the height above the growth surface. In these instances, the legs of the light box may be increased in length to provide more space between each level of the stack. The lattice structure may assist in structural support of the stack.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, a modular growth tray system tray for storing, germinating, propagating and or growing living organisms comprising: a growth tray stacked with a light box is provided. The modular growth tray system may have interchangeable legs. The legs may be extendable in length between a first height and a second height.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As discussed above in connection with other embodiments, the structure of the system may be adjusted to accommodate the crop.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to a further embodiment, a hydroponic system for storing, germinating, propagating and or growing living organisms is provided and may comprise: one or more growth tray(s) or growth tray system(s) for providing at least one service to a crop in a high-care facility. The service provided may be integrated in the one or more growth tray(s) and is one or more of: fluid drainage; lighting;</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">automated movement; fluid delivery; tray reconfiguration; tray or stack rearrangement; or air-flow control.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the system, the drainage system may further comprise a drain-pipe located adjacent-below the lower-most one or more growth trays and wherein the one or more growth trays drain into the drain-pipe. In the system, fluid collected by the drainage system is recirculated to a filtration, nutrient recovery and or fluid mixing system, for re-use.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the system, two or more stackable items may be arranged in a stack, or wherein growth trays may be arranged on a rack having tracks. The system may further comprise at least one load handling device for relocating one or more growth trays and or stacks.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The system may further comprise a central control system. The central control system may control one or more of: fluid introduction into one or more growth trays; drainage of run-off fluid; recirculation of fluid; lighting; movement of growth trays; rearrangement of growth trays; hose attachment to a fluid inlet; increasing the height above growth surfaces(s); environmental control; air conditioning; temperature control; and one or more load handling devices.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the system, the high-care portion is substantially self-contained.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As will be appreciated the self-contained or closed nature of the high-care portion helps to minimise the risks of contamination and other hazards to the living organisms, and helps to reduce the need for regular deep-cleaning of the system.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Another aspect of the invention provides, a method of storing, germinating, propagating and or growing a plurality of living organisms, the method comprising the steps of: providing at least one growing medium prepared with seeds and or seedlings of a living organism; wherein each of the at least one growth medium(s) are placed on one or more growth trays, and providing the living organism(s) with services to enable propagation and or growth.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The method may further comprise: arranging the growth trays in a stack with other stackable items or on a rack. The method may further comprise the steps of: attaching a hose to one or more of the growth trays and controlling the fluid provided to the plurality of living organisms, or attaching a hose to one or more of the growth trays and providing cleaning fluid to at least one growth tray. The method may further comprise the step of: moving a growth tray along a track using inductive loops. The method may further comprise the step of: transferring or relocating the growth tray to a harvest area and harvesting the crop, when the living organisms have grown to maturity.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In at least some embodiments, the crop produced has reduced or substantially negligible Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids, PAs.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">This may be substantially due to the level of cleanliness and or control of the high-care environment.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this way, the present invention addresses some of the problems of the prior art and provides a method and system of increasing the efficiency or yield of a hydroponic growing system.

It will be appreciated that the larger system described herein is exemplary only, and other combinations and configurations of the apparatus and equipment described are anticipated by the inventors of the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the invention described herein.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The larger hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> comprises a system in which crucial parts of the system <b>100</b> comprise a &#x2018;high-care&#x2019; environment. A high-care environment is defined as an area requiring high levels of hygiene, careful and clean working practices, fabrication, and the design of facilities and equipment to minimise product contamination with regard to microbiological hazards. Generally speaking products produced in high-care areas will have undergone a process to reduce any microbiological contamination prior to entering the high-care area.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In hydroponic growing systems, the concept of high-care environments has not been fully utilised. Contamination in the absence of such a high-care environment can lead to reduction in yield of a given crop, infestation requiring sanitisation of a significant volume of the growing chamber or loss of a given crop entirely. Further, crops may have a higher level of PAs.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As illustrated in the schematic diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> may comprise a seed and equipment pre-treatment area <b>110</b>, a high-care portion <b>120</b> and a dispatch portion <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The seed and equipment pre-treatment area <b>110</b> may comprise hot water treatment means, UVC treatment means and in the case of the seeds, may comprise agitation means. The high-care portion <b>120</b> may comprise a seeding area <b>132</b>, a germination volume <b>134</b>, a growing volume <b>136</b>, and a harvesting area <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> may comprise equipment designed, treated and installed so as to assist in the maintenance of a high-care environment for seeding, germinating, growing and harvesting crops of any variety.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In order to assist with cleaning equipment located within the high-care portion <b>120</b>, the equipment is preferably raised off the floor enabling easier and more effective cleaning of the equipment and floor. Further, all uprights of apparatus and where possible as much of the equipment in the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the system <b>100</b> as possible is painted or treated with antimicrobial paint such as, for example, paint comprising silver. For instance, the walls, floor and ceiling of the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> are painted white to enable visual checks of the overall cleanliness of the growing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">To assist with preventing contamination by water borne contaminants, preferably the amount and length of drainage system is reduced. Further this may assist with enabling regular deep cleaning of the whole system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">It will be appreciated that ethylene may be produced in the germination and growing volumes <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> of the system <b>100</b> and this ethylene can stimulate decomposition in fresh or growing produce. Thus, it is vital that where unprocessed produce is held in storage, ethylene is controlled, to ensure that the freshness is preserved and that waste from the process is minimised. Preferably, the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> may comprise means for removing ethylene. For example, such ethylene removal means may comprise ethylene scrubbers that comprise dry chemical scrubbers. These machines generally have a pre-filter, a chemisorption bed and an after filter acting so as to remove ethylene from the environment. However, it will be appreciated that any other form of ethylene removal means may be used.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Further, it is important to maintain air-flow around the living organisms. For example, if the roots of a plant are properly oxygenated then the growing capabilities of the plant may be improved. It also helps to maintain a more stable or constant humidity around the root structure and plant thereby reducing the incidence of fungal or bacterial growth which may become prevalent where humidity is not controlled.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In use, a hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> comprising a high-care portion <b>120</b> may be used to produce crops with little contamination. Seeds for planting and growing in a high-care environment are pre-treated in such a seed pre-treatment area <b>110</b>. Such pre-treatment may comprise hot water, and optionally UVC treatment. Additionally, the seeds may be agitated. Once treated, the seeds are bagged and sealed. The pre-treatment area <b>110</b> may be a substantially sterile environment.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further, in the pre-treatment area <b>110</b>, all growing media is treated with UVC, and equipment for use in the high-care facility is treated with UVC to reduce as far as possible the chances of contamination within the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b>. Seeds are also treated with hot water.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">A plant room <b>140</b> provides plant services to each zone, portion and volume of the hydroponic growing facility. In some instances, it will be appreciated that duplicate service systems are used to separately serve low care and high-care portions <b>150</b>, <b>120</b> to avoid contamination of high-care portions <b>120</b> from low care portions <b>150</b>. Plant services may comprise, control boxes, air handling devices to maintain air humidity and temperature, air compression systems, water treatment and pump facilities, and UVC treatment machines, for example and amongst other things.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Once the seeds, the growing media and trays are all pre-treated they are transferred to the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">These pre-treatment steps may be undertaken at a location remote from the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the system <b>100</b>, however, it will be appreciated that such pre-treatment zones may be co-located with the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> comprises a seeding area <b>132</b>, a germination volume <b>134</b>, a growing volume <b>136</b>, and a harvesting area <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">As required, the cleaned seeds are further treated by, for example, UVC radiation immediately prior to arrangement on growing medium in the seeding area <b>132</b>, the growing medium being located in the trays. The seeds may be continually vibrated by vibrating means comprising, for example, a vibrating plate whilst UVC treated and whist being arranged on the growing medium. The speed of vibration of the plate may be controllable and the speed used will depend on the particular seeds being processed, the size and variety of the seed and the effect of the vibration with the UVC on the seeds.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Once the equipment and seeds have been pre-treated as required, the seeds are arranged on the growing medium within the trays, and the trays may pass through a transfer hatch located between the seeding area <b>132</b> and the germination volume <b>134</b>. The transfer hatch may comprise means for transferring trays between areas and volumes of the system <b>100</b> bounded by walls, for example, in a manner consistent with the maintenance of the high-care environment. It will be understood that a number of transfer hatches may be present in the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The germination volume <b>134</b> may comprise racking on which the trays comprising the seeds are placed for a predetermined time. The predetermined time depends on the seed type, the growth cycle and the yield required for any given crop. It will be appreciated that control of the environment in the germination volume <b>134</b> may enable the time taken to germinate seeds to be controlled to a certain extent.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The environment in the germination volume <b>134</b> may be controlled. For example, the temperature, humidity, air flow and lighting conditions may be controlled either manually or by a suitable control mechanism. The environment in the germination volume <b>134</b> may be sensed by a series of sensors and detectors and the environment controlled according to the environment detected by the sensors or detectors. Such control may be carried out remotely by a suitable control utility.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Once germinated, the seeds are moved to the growing volume <b>136</b>. For example, the growing trays may be placed on movable racking or may be placed using a pick and place system either robotically or manually. Similarly to the environment of the germination volume <b>134</b>, the environment of the growing volume <b>136</b> may be controlled. The environment in the growing volume <b>136</b> may be sensed by a series of sensors and detectors and the environment controlled according to the environment detected by the sensors or detectors. Such control may be carried out remotely by a suitable control utility.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The germinated seeds remain in the growing volume <b>136</b> until the crop is deemed ready to harvest. This may be determined visually by operators or may be determined remotely using camera means to view the progress of growth of the crop.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Once deemed ready to harvest, the trays comprising the crops are removed from the growing volume <b>136</b> and transferred by any suitable means, robotic or manual, to a harvesting area <b>138</b> where the crop is picked, harvested or processed in the appropriate manner for the given crop. Once harvested, the crop may be bagged for onward delivery to direct customers or to commercial retail enterprises.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The dirty trays may be removed from the high-care portion <b>120</b> for washing and deep clean before returning to the seeing area <b>132</b> to be reseeded with a new crop.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Only once the crop is harvested and bagged will it leave the high-care portion <b>120</b> of the hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> to the dispatch portion <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">It will be appreciated that high-care seeding, germinating, harvesting and growing environments reduce contamination during the production of crops in a hydroponic growing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">It will be appreciated that the seeding area <b>132</b>, the germination volume <b>134</b>, the growing volume <b>136</b> and the harvesting area <b>138</b> may be collocated in a single building. However, it will also be appreciated that it is possible to locate the areas and volumes in different locations, however, the high-care environments would need to be controlled in a similar manner across all locations with high-care transfer means implemented between locations.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">It will further be appreciated that the seeding area <b>132</b>, the germination volume, the growing volume and the harvesting area <b>138</b> may be located in adjacent rooms of a single building or may be located in a single volume with separately definable volumes as required. In this case, barriers and air locks between the various areas and volumes will be used.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">It will be appreciated that the system <b>100</b> described above includes many known aspects of high-care treatment. However, it may become possible to apply other treatment regimens or to use other forms of equipment to achieve the result described herein.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Moreover, the system <b>100</b> described above may be used to grow a single crop or multiple crops in a single facility. Any crop suitable for growth in a hydroponic growing system <b>100</b> may be grown in a high-care portion <b>120</b> of such a growing system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Further it will be appreciate that a nutrient rich fluid, provided to the may be recycled for reuse.
