id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to inhibitors of HSP70 protein, and their use for cancer treatment.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Apoptosis is a cell death process frequently observed in cancer cell after treatment with anti-cancer agents. In mammals, apoptosis involves mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c (Liu X, et al. Cell. 1996;86:147-157) and apoptosis-Inducing Factor (AIF) (Ferri K F, et al. Nat Cell Biol. 2001;3:E255-263). These molecules can be released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol of stressed or injured cells. Once in the cytosol, cytochrome c interacts with the adaptator molecule apoptotic protease activation factor-1 (Apaf-1) to trigger its ATP-dependent oligomerization (Hu Y. et al. Embo J. 1999;18:3586-3595; Li P et al. Cell. 1997;91:479-489) that allows the apoptosome complex formation (Zou H et al. J Biol Chem. 1999;274:11549-11556; Saleh A et al. J Biol Chem. 1999;274:17941-17945). Then, caspase-9 is activated by the apoptosome, setting on a caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis (Li P, et al. Cell. 1997;91:479-489). Unlike cytochrome c, AIF directly migrates to the nucleus to induce DNA fragmentation and a caspase-independent apoptosis (Daugas E et al. Faseb J. 2000;14:729-739; Susin S A, et al. Nature. 1999;397:441-446).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The inducible heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is an evolutionary conserved protein whose expression enhances the ability of the cell to survive to a panoply of lethal conditions. It is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that assists the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, the assembly of multi-protein complexes and the transport of proteins across cellular membranes (Beckmann R P et al. Science. 1990;248:850-854; Murakami H et al. J Cell Biol. 1988;107:2051-2057; Shi Y et al. Mol Cell Biol. 1992;12:2186-2192).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Under normal cell growth, HSP70 is no or very little expressed. In contrast, under stressful conditions, HSP70 expression is transiently induced. Elevated HSP70 levels allow the cells to survive the stressful situation. Part of HSP70 protective function is associated to its anti-apoptotic properties. HSP70 is a powerful anti-apoptotic protein able to block caspase-dependent apoptosis by its interaction with Apaf-1, and caspase independent apoptosis by its association with AIF. HSP70 is also able to block the release of cathepsines from the lysosomes thereby also blocking cell death. Confirming the important protective function of HSP70, cells lacking hsp70.1 and hsp70.3, the two genes that code for inducible HSP70, are highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by wide range of lethal stimuli (Schmitt E et al. Cancer Res. 2003;63:8233-8240).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">HSP70 is often constitutively expressed in human tumor samples from various origins, and its expression may further increase after chemotherapy (Parcellier A et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003;304:505-512). This overexpression of HSP70 is needed for the cancer cell survival. Overexpressed HSP70 in human cancer cells is associated with metastasis, poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy or radiation therapy (Conroy SE et al. Br J Cancer. 1996;74:717-721; Fuller K J, et al. Eur J Cancer. 1994;30A:1884-1891; Brondani Da Rocha A, et al. Int J Oncol. 2004;25:777-785; Vargas-Roig L M et al. Int J Cancer. 1998;79:468-475; Nanbu K et al. Cancer Detect Prey. 1998;22:549-555). The inventors and other group have previously shown that down-regulation of HSP70 by mean of an antisense construction or a siRNA, reduces cancer cell tumorigenicity in rodent models (Gurbuxani S. et al. Oncogene. 2001;20:7478-7485; Nylandsted J. et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2000;97:7871-7876).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A construct derived from AIF, ADD70 (AIF-Derived Decoy for HSP70), that inhibits and neutralizes HSP70 in the cytosol, was shown to allow cancer cell sensitization to anticancer drugs such as cisplatin or etoposide (Schmitt E, et al. Cancer Res. 2003;63:8233-8240). In vivo, ADD70 treatment in murine cancer models reduces tumor growth and even induces tumor regression. These effects are increased with a single cisplatin injection in animals (Schmitt E et al. Cancer Res. 2006;66:4191-4197).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, ADD70 is too big to serve as a biotherapeutic molecule. Thus, it remains a need to develop small molecules able to inhibit HSP70 for the treatment of tumor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventors characterized different aptamers which specifically block the HSP70 chaperone activity and induce tumor regression.

Interestingly, molecules 2 and 3 are analogues.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Screening</entry><entry>Confirmation</entry><entry>IC50</entry><entry>HSP70</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Molecule</entry><entry>inhibition</entry><entry>inhibition</entry><entry>(&#x3bc;M)</entry><entry>specificity</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>A</entry><entry>105</entry><entry>34</entry><entry>19.6</entry><entry>YES</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>B</entry><entry>105</entry><entry>59</entry><entry>0.2</entry><entry>YES</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>C</entry><entry>103</entry><entry>61</entry><entry>0.46</entry><entry>YES</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0158" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="133pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Activity profil/50%</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Name, formula and structure</entry><entry>effective concentration</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>A</entry><entry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00011" num="00011"><img id="EMI-C00011" he="47.41mm" wi="34.21mm" file="US20230000827A1-20230105-C00011.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="table" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></entry><entry>EC<sub>50 </sub>= 19.6 &#x3bc;M</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>B</entry><entry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00012" num="00012"><img id="EMI-C00012" he="40.89mm" wi="39.45mm" file="US20230000827A1-20230105-C00012.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="table" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></entry><entry>&#x2002;EC<sub>50 </sub>= 0.2 &#x3bc;M</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>C</entry><entry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00013" num="00013"><img id="EMI-C00013" he="46.57mm" wi="39.45mm" file="US20230000827A1-20230105-C00013.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="table" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></entry><entry>EC<sub>50 </sub>= 0.46 &#x3bc;M</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0159" num="0147">The Small Molecule Hit-Candidates Inhibits HSP70 Chaperone Activity In Vitro.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0148">A method to study the chaperone activity of HSPs was set up. Proteins were extracted from mouse embryonic HSF1&#x2212;/&#x2212; cells and they were heat shocked. HSF1 is the main transcription factor responsible of HSP expression after a stress. Therefore, this genetic background allowed us to work with reduced contamination with endogenous inducible HSPs like HSP70 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). An equal amount of proteins was submitted to a heat shock (55&#xb0; C., 1 h) and the percentage of protein aggregation (which is directly related to the amount of denatured proteins) was determined in the presence or absence of recombinant HSP70, with or without the chemical molecules to be tested. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, HSP70 was able to reduce the amount of aggregated proteins in a very significant manner, demonstrating its chaperone function. A similar effect was observed when adding HSC70 or HSP90. As expected, when the inventors added the A18 aptamer, a strong inhibition of HSP70 chaperone activity was observed that was not observed with a control aptamer (A0). This inhibitory effect was specific because A18 was unable to block recombinant HSC70 or HSP90 chaperone activity. All four small molecule hits inhibited HSP70 chaperone activity, albeit to a different extent. Molecule A only partially blocked HSP70 chaperone function but this effect seemed specific. Molecules B and C provoked a much more important inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0149">Chemo-Sensitizing Properties of the Chemical Molecules Targeting HSP70</p><p id="p-0162" num="0150">To study the effect of the molecules in cancer cells, the inventors used two different cancer cells lines: Human cervix cancer Hela cells and mouse colorectal cancer CT-26. Cells were treated with the small molecule hit (2 &#x3bc;M) either alone or together with cisplatin for 48 hours and cell survival was determined. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the molecules synergistically increased cell death induced by cisplatin, the most important effect been found for the molecule B. This cell death was associated with the inhibition of HSP70 because the molecules had hardly any effect on the MEF HSF1&#x2212;/&#x2212; cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) which, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, do not express inducible HSP70. Cells seem to die mainly by apoptosis, as detected by the amount of Annexin V positive/propidium iodide negative cells obtained after treatment with the molecule (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The inventors conclude that the hit candidates block HSP70 chaperone activity and sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis induced by cisplatin. Since throughout these results the molecule B seemed, in terms of specificity (IC50) and effect, the most promising, the inventors selected this molecule for the studies in vivo.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0151">Molecule B Displays an Anti-Tumor effect in Mice bearing a Colorectal Cancer, which Involve Cytotoxic Macrophages</p><p id="p-0164" num="0152">To study the molecule B in vivo, the inventors decided to vectorize the molecule with lipoproteins of high density (HDL) because these natural nano-vectors have been reported to solve solubility problems in hydrophobic and hardly soluble molecules (like all four molecules selected here including the molecule B) and to favor cellular uptake.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0153">A syngeneic model in which mouse colon cancer CT-26 cells were injected into Balb/c mice was used. When tumor size reached about 0.9 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were treated with the molecule B complexed to HDL (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>) at 5 mg/kg (average concentration described in the literature for similar small chemical compounds), which was given i.p. every three days until the end of the experiment (determined for ethical reasons by the size of the tumor in the control group) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>). Treatment by compound B induced a decrease in tumor growth of 60% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). In accord with the previous results, this tumor regression effect was associated with an increase in tumor cells apoptosis (caspase-3 activation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, E). But the most remarkable effect induced by the treatment with the vectorized molecule B was a strong accumulation within the regressing tumor of macrophages with a cytotoxic (anti-tumor) phenotype (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C-F</figref>), as shown by their ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C-G</figref>).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0154">This effect of the-molecule B favoring cytotoxic macrophages was confirmed in vitro, in macrophages isolated from buffy coats. HDL-molecule B was able to induced ROS production (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>) whereas the same amount of molecule complexed to LDL did not have any effect, indicating the importance of the lipoprotein used as a nano-vector.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0155">This molecule, the first described experimental therapeutic HSP70 inhibitor targeting macrophages in vitro and in vivo, may pave the way to a new type of immunotherapeutic molecules against chemo resistant cancers.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0156">Combinational Effect of Molecule B-HDL and Cisplatin-LDL Complexes</p><p id="p-0169" num="0157">Finally, the inventors tested the impact of the association of cisplatin-LDL complexes together with molecule B-HDL complexes. LDL were purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation from buffy coats and incubated with cisplatin (to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml) for 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C. Mice bearing CT-26 tumors were treated with LDL-Cisplatin alone, HDL-molecule B alone or the combination of both. The inventors observed a stronger decrease in tumor growth when using the combinational therapy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A</figref> and B) Immunofluorescent staining revealed i) a strong induction of cancer cell apoptosis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>C</figref> and E), comparable to that observed in the animals treated with LDL-Cisplatin alone ii) a strong burst in macrophage infiltration comparable to that observed with the HDL-molecule B alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>C</figref> and F). of note, a milder induction of ROS production was observed in this context (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>D</figref> and G), probably due to a more advanced tumor regression in response to the combined treatment. This suggest that this combined strategy aiming to simultaneous target cancer cells with one drug (cisplatin-LDL) and tumor-infiltrating macrophages with the other (molecule B-HDL) allows a complementary additive effect, with no apparent increase in the drugs side-effects toxicity -as determined by the unchanged weight of the animals and the absence of apoptosis in the animals' epithelial cells in the intestinal crypts (data not shown).</p><p id="p-0170" num="0158">Discussion</p><p id="p-0171" num="0159">In this work, the inventors have identified small chemical molecules, agonists of the peptide aptamer A18. A18 is a thioredoxin-based aptamer with a 13 aminoacid variable region that binds to the ATP domain of HSP70 (Rerole A L, et al. Cancer Res 20119;71:484-495). The hits interfere with the chaperone activity of HSP70 in vitro, thus strongly suggesting that, as A18, they bind to the ATP domain of HSP70.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0160">The four &#x201c;drug candidates&#x201d; described here sensitize cancer cells to death induced by cisplatin. Macrophages are essential component of the anti-cancer immune response and the inventors and others have reported a role for HSP70 in macrophages differentiation/maturation (Vega V L, et al. J Immnuol 2008;180:4299-307). Confirming these results, in the present application, the inventors have demonstrated that the i.p. injection of the molecule B in syngeneic mice bearing a tumor induced tumor regression that was associated with an impressive accumulation within the tumor of inflammatory cytotoxic macrophages (M1-like). Interestingly, to avoid problems of solubility, in these in vivo experiments the inventors vectorized the molecule by complexing it to natural HDL. The fact that the vectorization with HDL, but not with LDL, favors the effect of the molecule B in cultured macrophages suggests the importance of the nano-vector used and how the macrophages uptake of the HDL-molecule B complexes may involve specific receptors.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0161">Cancer cells must extensively rewire their metabolic and signal transduction pathways, thereby becoming dependent on proteins that are dispensable for the survival of normal cells.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0162">This HSPs-addition is the basis for the use of inhibitors of HSPs in cancer therapy. Today, with the exception of an inhibitor of HSP27 (an oligonucleotide antisense) all inhibitors in advanced clinical trials target HSP90 with somehow deceiving results and often unaccepted toxicity, which may be why they induce HSP70 expression that by its strong cell survival properties may counteract the efficacy of the HSP90 inhibitors. HSP70 can be considered as a protein that although it is not an oncogene, its presence is indispensable for the survival of cancer cells. HSP70 has a well-demonstrated role in apoptosis inhibition and autophagic cell death. Unfortunately, to date only a limited number of compounds that specifically target HSP70 have been identified. Leu et al described that the 2-phenylethynesulfonamide (PES), also known as pifithrin-&#x3b1; and originally identified as a molecule that interferes with the P53-induced apoptosis, specifically associated to the peptide binding domain of HSP70, induced autophagic cell death in cancer cells (but not apoptosis) and, in intraperitoneal administration, was able to inhibit the development of lymphomas in mice (Leu J I, et al.
