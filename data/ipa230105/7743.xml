For example, a lighting control system may be used to control the lighting loads in the user environment. A motorized window treatment control system may be used to control the natural light provided to the user environment. A heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system may be used to control the temperature in the user environment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A user of the load control system may configure the load control system to perform as intended. However, as a single load control system may include various types of load control systems (e.g., lighting control system, motorized window treatment system, HVAC system, etc.), the user may have numerous setting to configure for the load control system to perform as intended. Accordingly, the user may interact with a graphical user interface to accurately and efficiently configure the load control system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The vibrancy settings of a lighting load may be configured by a user. For example, a lighting load may be set to one of an auto vibrancy mode where a vibrancy value for the lighting load may be automatically determined, or an adjustable vibrancy mode where a user may select an adjustable vibrancy value for the lighting load. When the auto vibrancy mode is selected, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be based on the selected color setting, and may be configured to emit light from the lighting load at or above a target color rendering index (CRI) value for the selected color setting. For example, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be based on the distance between the selected color setting and the black-body curve.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The selected color setting may be a correlated color temperature (CCT) value on the black-body curve or an x-y chromaticity value. If the selected color setting is CCT value on the black-body curve, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be a pre-defined vibrancy value that is configured to emit light from the lighting load at or above the target CRI value for the selected CCT value. Further, the automatically determined vibrancy value may increase as the selected CCT value increases. If, however, the selected color setting is an x-y chromaticity value, a distance between the select x-y chromaticity value and the black-body curve may be determined. If the distance between the selected x-y chromaticity value and the black-body curve is less than a distance threshold, the selected x-y chromaticity value may have an equivalent CCT value, and the automatically determined vibrancy value may be the pre-defined vibrancy value that is configured to emit light from the lighting load at or above the target CRI value for the equivalent CCT value. If, on the other hand, the distance between the selected x-y chromaticity value and the black-body curve is greater than the distance threshold, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be a pre-defined vibrancy value.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The lighting load may also or alternatively be configured in an adjustable vibrancy mode. When the adjustable vibrancy mode is enabled, the user may select a vibrancy value at which to control the light load. For example, the user may select the adjustable vibrancy value from a range of vibrancy values (e.g., 0 to 100). Increasing the vibrancy value may decrease the contribution of at least one the plurality of LEDs within the lighting load (e.g., a white or substantially white LED within the lighting load). Similarly, decreasing the adjustable vibrancy value may increase the contribution of at least one of the plurality of LEDs.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As an example, a network device may include a display screen, a communications circuit, and at least one processor. The network device may further include at least one tangible memory device communicatively coupled to the at least one processor. The at least one tangible memory device may have software instructions stored thereon that when executed by the at least one processor may direct the at least one processor to receive via the communications circuit from a communications network information communicated by a controller.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The network device may be configured to define and/or control the vibrancy settings for a lighting load. The network device may be configured to display one or more graphical user interfaces that a user of the network device may interact with to define and/or update the vibrancy settings. For example, the graphical user interface displayed by the network device may include a palette for identifying a color setting for controlling the lighting load. The palette may be configured to display different coordinated color temperature (CCT) values at which the plurality of LEDs of the lighting load are capable of being controlled. The palette may also or alternatively be configured to display a color gamut of colors at which the plurality of LEDs of the lighting load are capable of being controlled.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The graphical user interface may also include a vibrancy control interface for identify the vibrancy settings of the lighting load. For example, the graphical user interface may include an actuator to indicate whether auto vibrancy mode is enabled. When the auto vibrancy mode is selected, a vibrancy value may be automatically determined vibrancy value based on the color setting selected via the palette. Further, as described herein, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be configured to emit light from the lighting load at or above a target CRI value for the selected color setting.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The graphical user interface may include an actuator to indicate whether the adjustable vibrancy mode is enabled. When the adjustable vibrancy mode is enabled, the graphical user interface may include a vibrancy control line for identifying a selection of the adjustable vibrancy value at which to control the light load. For example, the user may, using the vibrancy control line, select the adjustable vibrancy value from a range of vibrancy values (e.g., 0 to 100). Increasing the adjustable vibrancy value using the vibrancy control line may decrease the contribution of at least one the plurality of LEDs within the lighting load (e.g., a white or substantially white LED within the lighting load). Similarly, decreasing the adjustable vibrancy value using the vibrancy control line may increase the contribution of at least one of the plurality of LEDs.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color.

Load control system <b>100</b> may include a system controller <b>150</b> and load control devices for controlling (e.g., directly and/or indirectly) one or more electrical loads in a user environment <b>102</b> (also referred to herein as a load control environment). Example user environments/load control environments <b>102</b> may include one or more rooms of a home, one or more floors of a building, one or more rooms of a hotel, etc. As an example, load control system <b>100</b> may enable the automated control of lighting systems, shades, and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the user environment, among other electrical loads.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The load control devices of load control system <b>100</b> may include a system controller <b>150</b>, control-source devices (e.g., elements <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>122</b> discussed herein), and control-target devices (e.g., elements <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> discussed herein) (control-source devices and control-target devices may be individually and/or collectively referred to herein as load control devices and/or control devices). The system controller <b>150</b>, the control-source devices, and the control-target devices may be configured to communicate (transmit and/or receive) messages, such as digital messages (although other types of messages may be communicated), between one another using wireless signals <b>154</b> (e.g., radio-frequency (RF) signals), although wired communications may also be used. &#x201c;Digital&#x201d; messages will be used herein for discussion purposes only.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The control-source devices may include, for example, input devices that are configured to detect conditions within the user environment <b>102</b> (e.g., user inputs via switches or keypads, occupancy/vacancy conditions, changes in measured light intensities, and/or other input information) and in response to the detected conditions, transmit digital messages to control-target devices that are configured to control electrical loads in response to instructions or commands received in the digital messages. The control-target devices may include, for example, load control devices that are configured to receive digital messages from the control-source devices and/or the system controller <b>150</b> and to control respective electrical loads in response to the received digital messages. A single control device of the load control system <b>100</b> may operate as both a control-source device and a control-target device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one example, the system controller <b>150</b> may be configured to receive the digital messages transmitted by the control-source devices, to interpret these messages based on system configuration data of the load control system, and to then transmit digital messages to the control-target devices for the control-target devices to then control respective electrical loads. In other words, the control-source devices and the control-target devices may communicate via the system controller <b>150</b>. According to another and/or additional example, the control-source devices may directly communicate with the control-target devices without the assistance of the system controller <b>150</b>. The system controller may still monitor such communications. According to a further and/or additional example, the system controller <b>150</b> may originate and then communicate digital messages with control-source devices and/or control-target devices. Such communications by the system controller <b>150</b> may include programming/system configuration data (e.g., settings) for the control devices, such as configuring scene buttons on light switches. Communications from the system controller <b>150</b> may also include, for example, messages directed to control-target devices and that contain instructions or commands for the control-target devices to control respective electrical loads in response to the received messages. For example, the system controller <b>150</b> may communicate messages to change light levels, to change shade levels, to change HVAC settings, etc. These are examples and other examples are possible.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Communications between the system controller <b>150</b>, the control-source devices, and the control-target devices may be via a wired and/or wireless communications network as indicated above. One example of a wireless communications network may be a wireless LAN where the system controller, control-source devices, and the control-target devices may communicate via a router, for example, that is local to the user environment <b>102</b>. For example, such a network may be a standard Wi-Fi network. Another example of a wireless communications network may be a point-to-point communications network where the system controller, control-source devices, and the control-target devices communicate directly with one another using, for example, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, a proprietary communication channel, such as CLEAR CONNECT&#x2122;, Thread, ZigBee, etc. to directly communicate. Other network configurations may be used such as the system controller acting as an access point and providing one or more wireless/wired based networks through which the system controller, the control-source devices, and the control-target devices may communicate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For a control-target device to be responsive to messages from a control-source device, the control-source device may first be associated with the control-target device. As one example of an association procedure, a control-source device may be associated with a control-target device by a user <b>142</b> actuating a button on the control-source device and/or the control-target device. The actuation of the button on the control-source device and/or the control-target device may place the control-source device and/or the control-target device in an association mode for being associated with one another. In the association mode, the control-source device may transmit an association message(s) to the control-target device (directly or through the system controller). The association message from the control-source device may include a unique identifier of the control-source device. The control-target device may locally store the unique identifier of the control-source, such that the control-target device may be capable of recognizing digital messages (e.g., subsequent digital messages) from the control-source device that may include load control instructions or commands. The control-target device may be configured to respond to the digital messages from the associated control-source device by controlling a corresponding electrical load according to the load control instructions received in the digital messages. This is merely one example of how control devices may communicate and be associated with one another and other examples are possible. According to another example, the system controller <b>150</b> may receive system configuration data (e.g., or subsequent updates to the system configuration data) from a user that specify which control-source devices should control which control-target devices. Thereafter, the system controller may communicate this system configuration data to the control-source devices and/or control-target devices.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As one example of a control-target device, load control system <b>100</b> may include one or more lighting control devices, such as the lighting control devices <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>. The lighting control device <b>112</b> may be a dimmer, an electronic switch, a ballast, a light emitting diode (LED) driver(s), and/or the like. The lighting control device <b>112</b> may be configured to directly control an amount of power provided to a lighting load(s), such as lighting load <b>114</b>. The lighting control device <b>112</b> may be configured to wirelessly receive digital messages via signals <b>154</b> (e.g., messages originating from a control-source device and/or the system controller <b>150</b>), and to control the lighting load <b>114</b> in response to the received digital messages. One will recognize that lighting control device <b>112</b> and lighting load <b>114</b> may be integral and thus part of the same fixture or bulb, for example, or may be separate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The lighting control device <b>113</b> may be a wall-mounted dimmer, a wall-mounted switch, or other keypad device for controlling a lighting load(s), such as lighting load <b>115</b>. The lighting control device <b>113</b> may be adapted to be mounted in a standard electrical wall box. The lighting control device <b>113</b> may include one or more buttons for controlling the lighting load <b>115</b>. The lighting control device <b>113</b> may include a toggle actuator. Actuations (e.g., successive actuations) of the toggle actuator may toggle (e.g., turn off and on) the lighting load <b>115</b>. The lighting control device <b>113</b> may include an intensity adjustment actuator (e.g., a rocker switch or intensity adjustment buttons). Actuations of an upper portion or a lower portion of the intensity adjustment actuator may respectively increase or decrease the amount of power delivered to the lighting load <b>115</b> and thus increase or decrease the intensity of the receptive lighting load from a minimum intensity (e.g., approximately 1%) to a maximum intensity (e.g., approximately 100%). The lighting control device <b>113</b> may include a plurality (two or more) of visual indicators, e.g., light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which may be arranged in a linear array and that may illuminate to provide feedback of the intensity of the lighting load <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The lighting control device <b>113</b> may be configured to wirelessly receive digital messages via wireless signals <b>154</b> (e.g., messages originating from a control-source device and/or the system controller <b>150</b>). The lighting control device <b>113</b> may be configured to control the lighting load <b>115</b> in response to the received digital messages.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As described herein, a lighting control device, such as the lighting control device <b>113</b> or <b>112</b> may control a lighting load (e.g., or a plurality of lighting loads), such as the lighting load <b>114</b> or <b>115</b>, where the lighting load may include a plurality of multi-colored light emitting diodes (LEDs). In other words, the lighting load may include within a single package, for example, a number of differently colored emission LEDs and may be configured such that the chromaticity output of the LEDs is mixed to produce light having varying chromaticity coordinates (e.g., color points) within a color gamut formed by the various LEDs that make up the lighting load (e.g.,. a total light output from a lighting load that is made up of a plurality of LEDs). The CRI value may be a measurement of the white light emitted by the total light output. The contribution or intensity of each of the differently colored LEDs in emitting light may affect the CRI of the emitted light. As described herein, the CRI value of the light emitted from a given LED or the lighting load comprising a plurality of LEDs may be a quantitative measurement of the emitted light's ability to reveal the colors of various objects faithfully in comparison with an ideal or natural light source. Further, the CRI value of emitted light may be based on the spectrum emitted by the light. In some examples, the highest CRI value may be <b>100</b>, which may indicate that the emitted light is identical (e.g., or substantially identical) to daylight (e.g., the combination of direct and indirect sunlight during the day). In certain instances, as further described herein, a lighting load may be configured to emit light that achieves a CRI value is that at or above a target CRI value.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As one example, a lighting load may include one or more red LEDs, one or more green LEDs, one or more blue LEDs, and one or more white, or substantially white LEDs (e.g., such as yellow and/or mint green LED(s)) (which may be collectively referred to herein as a RGBW lighting load). Although the RGBW lighting load is described herein with a combination of four LEDs of certain colors, other combinations of LEDs (e.g., more or less LEDs and/or different color LEDs) may be used.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The lighting control device may adjust various settings of the lighting load(s) to adjust the light emitted from the lighting load. The adjustments may be made in response to system configuration data. The system configuration data may include control/configuration information comprising lighting control parameters (e.g., lighting intensity settings, color settings, vibrancy setting, etc.) for controlling the lighting loads at the lighting control devices. For example, the lighting control device may adjust the lighting intensity settings (i.e., brightness), the color settings (e.g., CCT value or full color value), vibrancy settings, CRI, etc., which are further described herein. The lighting control devices may receive lighting control parameters in the control/configuration information and control the corresponding lighting load in response to the lighting control parameters, for example, by generating control instructions based on the lighting control parameters and transmitting the control instructions to the corresponding load. In certain example, the lighting control device for controlling a respective lighting load may be self-contained within the lighting load (e.g., the lighting control device and lighting load exist within the same package, such as the lighting control device/lighting load <b>112</b>/<b>114</b>). When the lighting control device and corresponding lighting load are self-contained, the self-contained lighting control device (e.g., lighting control device/lighting load <b>112</b>/<b>114</b>) may itself receive the lighting control parameters, generate control instructions, and control the lighting load.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The lighting control parameters may also, or alternatively, be associated with a certain triggering event (e.g., a button press) and respectively stored/maintained by the lighting control device. Then, when the lighting control device receives an indication of a certain triggering event (e.g., an indication of a button press), the lighting control device may retrieve or otherwise determine (e.g., by querying another device that stores/maintains the lighting control parameters) the lighting control parameters associated with that triggering event, and generate control instructions based on the lighting control parameters and transmitting the control instructions to the corresponding load. Also, or alternatively, when the lighting control device and corresponding lighting load are self-contained, the self-contained lighting control device (e.g., lighting control device/lighting load <b>112</b>/<b>114</b>) may itself receive the lighting control parameters, generate control instructions, and control the lighting load.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, the lighting control parameters may include a color setting (e.g., x-y chromaticity or CCT values), a lighting intensity settings, and/or a vibrancy settings (e.g., vibrancy mode and/or vibrancy value).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The light emitted from the lighting load(s) may result in a different CRI value when different color settings, lighting intensities settings, and/or a vibrancy setting are selected. As further described herein, changes to the vibrancy settings may adjust the contribution of one or more LEDs within a lighting load (e.g., adjust the contribution/intensity ratio of the one or more LEDs), while maintaining the selected color settings and lighting intensity setting. Further, the lighting control device may adjust the lighting control parameters of lighting load(s) over time (e.g., referred to herein as natural show or natural lighting functionality). For example, the lighting control devices may adjust the lighting control parameters of the lighting load(s) over time to emulate a sunrise and/or sunset, which, as described herein, may be based on the local time of sunrise and/or sunset for the load control system/user environment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A lighting control device and corresponding lighting load may be configured to produce a range of colors on a color gamut. The lighting control device may produce a given color on the color gamut in response to the color setting and/or lighting intensity settings received in the control/configuration information. The color settings to which a lighting control device may control a corresponding lighting load may depend on the LEDs that make up the lighting load. For example, the lighting control device and the respective lighting load may be configured to produce white or near-white light of varying brightness/intensities within a range of correlated color temperatures (CCTs) on the black-body curve ranging from &#x201c;warm white&#x201d; (e.g., roughly 2600 K-3000 K), to &#x201c;neutral white&#x201d; (e.g., 3000K-5000 K) to &#x201c;cool white&#x201d; (e.g., 5000 K-8300 K), for example (i.e., produce light of varying chromaticity coordinates that lie along the black-body locus or curve). The white or near-white light may be produced by the lighting control device in response to the color setting being a CCT value, or in response to an x-y coordinate value on the color gamut. In certain situations (e.g., as further described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>) a given x-y coordinate value on the color gamut may also equate to a corresponding CCT value, for example, when the given x-y coordinate value on the color gamut is close to or located on the black-body curve. As a further example, such a lighting control device and its respective lighting load may be further configured to produce any of a plurality of colors of varying brightness/intensities within the color gamut formed by the various LEDs that make up the lighting load in response to the color setting and/or lighting intensity setting received in the control/configuration information.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">&#x201c;Vibrancy,&#x201d; as described herein, may be referred to as the ability to tune the individual colors that make light at a given color (e.g., x-y chromaticity value or a CCT value). When vibrancy is adjusted, the color of the light emitted by the lighting load may remain unchanged. Adjusting vibrancy may, however, adjust the light reflected off of objects in the space. Adjusting the vibrancy may further affect the CRI value of the light emitted by a lighting load. The effect that adjusting vibrancy has on the CRI value of the light emitted by a lighting load may, however, be based on the color (e.g., x-y chromaticity value or a CCT value) of the emitted light. For example, as the color of the emitted light diverges from the black-body curve, the ability to increase the CRI value of the emitted light may decrease.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, adjusting vibrancy may adjust spectral power distribution (SPD) of the light emitted by the lighting load. For example, as vibrancy increases, an SPD curve of the emitted light (e.g., relative intensity vs wavelength) may change (e.g., the contributions of the non-white colors may increase) and/or may result in individual colors on the objects to appear more vibrant when the light reflects off of them. As described herein, increasing the vibrancy of a lighting load may decrease the contribution or intensity of a white or substantially white LED within the lighting load, while increasing the contribution or intensity of the remaining LEDs within the lighting load (e.g., red, green, and blue LEDs). Taking, for example, an RGBW lighting load, increasing the vibrancy of the RGBW lighting load may decrease the contribution/intensity of the white LED and increase the contribution of the red, green, and blue LEDs, while maintaining a given color setting within the color gamut. That is, increasing vibrancy increases the contribution/intensity of red, blue, and green light in emitting light at a given color, which, in turn allows an increased amount of red, blue, and green light to be reflected off of objects in a space, causing the objects to be more vibrant. The vibrancy may be increased or decreased, while maintaining the color and/or intensity being emitted by the lighting load. In general, increasing the vibrancy of a RGBW lighting load may increase the intensity of one or more wavelengths produced by the red, green, and/or blue LEDs, for example, thereby causing certain objects within a space to look more &#x201c;vibrant.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The ability to adjust the vibrancy of a lighting load may be related to the individual LEDs that are comprised within the lighting load. As described herein, for example, the chromaticity output of each of these individual LEDs within a lighting load may be mixed to produce light having varying chromaticity coordinates (e.g., color points) within the color gamut formed by the plurality of LEDs. Further, the number and/or color of the LEDs included within a lighting load may determine how (e.g., the number of ways that) the lighting load can be controlled to emit light at a certain color (e.g., full color or CCT). That is, depending on the number and/or color of the LEDs within a light load, there may be multiple solutions for (e.g., multiple combinations of) the individual chromaticity contributions of each of the LEDs within the lighting load to emit light at a given chromaticity coordinate. Since, as described herein, the vibrancy may be adjusted for a lighting load while maintaining the color of the emitted light by changing the SPD of the emitted light (e.g., how the light reflects off of objects in the space), the vibrancy of a lighting load may be adjusted using a number of different solutions (e.g., combinations of intensities of different LEDs in the lighting load), while emitting light at a given color setting. The effect that adjusting vibrancy has on a lighting load may increase as the number of solutions available for a lighting load (e.g., combinations of intensities of different LEDs in the lighting load) to emit light at a given color increases. The number of solutions available for the lighting load (e.g., combinations of intensities of different LEDs in the lighting load) to emit light at a given color may be a result of the number and/or color of the LEDs included within the lighting load.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to an example, a lighting control device and its respective lighting load may be configured to one of two vibrancy modes, including an auto vibrancy mode (e.g., a vibrancy value at which to control the lighting load is automatically determined based on the selected color settings, as described herein), and/or an adjustable vibrancy mode (e.g., the user may select an adjustable vibrancy level from a range of vibrancy values). The selection of the various vibrancy modes may be included in the configuration/control information received by the lighting control device. The lighting control device may emit light at a mixed color output based on the color setting and/or lighting intensity setting received in the configuration/control information. The chromaticity coordinates of the mixed color output of the lighting load may be the same (or approximately the same) across various vibrancy values. However, the intensities and/or contributions of the various LEDs that make up a lighting load may be varied between various vibrancy values to maintain the selected color setting.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Taking, for example, an RGBW lighting load, as the color setting approaches white light or color values on or near (e.g., within a predefined distance that equates to a color temperature value on) the black-body curve, the lighting device may have a larger range (e.g., or number of solutions) of LED combinations (e.g., color and/or intensity combinations) available for emitting light at the selected color setting. When the adjustable vibrancy or the auto vibrancy modes are enabled, the intensity of the white LED(s) for example, may be reduced (such as to 0%, for example) as compared to when the vibrancy value is set to 0, with the intensities of the remaining red, green, and/or blue LEDs adjusted to maintain the same color setting (or approximately the same). As a result, the effect that configuring or controlling the vibrancy of a lighting load to different vibrancy values has on the light emitted by the lighting load may increase as the selected color setting approaches white light or color values on or near the black-body curve. For example, the effect that changes in vibrancy has on the CRI value of the light emitted by the lighting load may decrease as the distance between the selected color setting and the black-body curve increases. As such, as the distance of the color from the black body curve increases, changes in the vibrancy value may have less of an effect or fail to change the CRI value, and may fail by enough to reach or come close to the target CRI value that is set for colors that are on or near the black body curve. In addition, as the distance of the color from the black body curve increases, the relevancy of the CRI value of the emitted light may decrease (e.g., as the CRI value of the light is more relevant when the light is white or near white light, such as light that is near the black-body curve.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should, however, be recognized that controlling the vibrancy of a given lighting load depends on the lighting load itself (e.g., the individual LEDs within the lighting load). That is, the effect that changes in the vibrancy has on the CRI of the light emitted by the lighting load depends on the individual LEDs within the lighting load (e.g., the color, intensity, etc. of the individual LEDs within the lighting load). Changes in the vibrancy value may have a greater effect on the CRI of the light emitted by the lighting load as the selected color nears the black body curve. Similarly, changes in the vibrancy value may have less of an effect on the CRI of the light emitted by the lighting load as the selected color is further from the black body curve. Though the range of vibrancy values available at a given color may vary as colors are selected on the color gamut, the target CRI value that is set for being achieved at or within a predefined distance of the black body curve may be unable to be achieved at colors that are selected outside of the predefined distance of the black body curve.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Again, according to one example, the difference between given vibrancy values may be the intensity setting of the white LED(s)/the amount the white LED(s) (e.g., or other LEDs) contribute to the mixed color output of the lighting load, with the white LED(s) contributing less when the vibrancy value is higher. Similarly, the white LED(s) may contribute more when the vibrancy value is lower. Other examples are also possible. An example of such a lighting control device and respective lighting load is described as an illumination device, as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2018/0077770, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. One will recognize that other examples lighting control device and respective lighting loads are possible.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described herein, the light output of a lighting load and/or the light output of the individual LEDs within the lighting load may be measured by a CRI value. The CRI value may be a measurement of the lighting load's ability to reveal the actual color of objects as compared to an ideal light source (e.g., a natural light source, such as the sun). A higher CRI value may be a desirable characteristic of a user. For example, a lighting load with a higher CRI value may provide light such that the objects within a space reflect light at a natural color. A lighting load itself may be defined by a CRI value. CRI values may be in the range of 0 to 100, inclusively. For example, the lowest CRI value may be 0 and the highest CRI value may be 100.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The CRI value for a given color may change in response to changes in the vibrancy value used to control the lighting control device. For example, the lighting control device may control a respective lighting load to a color setting and/or intensity level that is received in control/configuration information. As described herein, a given color setting and/or lighting intensity setting may have a corresponding vibrancy value to which the lighting control device may be controlled when the auto vibrancy mode is enabled. In response to changes in the vibrancy value for a given color setting, the light emitted from the lighting load may have a different corresponding CRI value. As a result, when the auto vibrancy mode is enabled a vibrancy value may be automatically determined (e.g., by a control/configuration application) to emit light from the lighting load at a CRI value that is at or above a target CRI value for the selected color setting. The effect that the automatically determined vibrancy value has on the CRI value of the light emitted by the lighting load may, however, be based on the selected color setting. For example, the effect that the automatically determined vibrancy value has on the CRI value of the light emitted by the lighting load may increase as the selected color setting approaches the black-body curve. That is, in an auto vibrancy mode, the CRI value of the light emitted from a lighting load may be higher as the selected color setting approaches the black-body curve. Similarly, in an auto vibrancy mode, the CRI value of the light emitted from a lighting load may be lower (e.g., the highest achievable CRI value may be lower) as the selected color setting is further from the black-body curve and/or approaches more saturated colors. Accordingly, as the selected color setting diverges from the black-body curve (e.g., the distance between the selected color setting and the black-body curve increases), the CRI value of the emitted light that results from the automatically determined vibrancy value when the auto vibrancy mode is enabled may decrease. Thus, the target CRI value that is set for when the color setting is on or within a predefined distance of the black body curve may be unable to be achieved at other color settings (e.g., more saturated colors).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In auto vibrancy mode, a control/configuration application, as described herein (e.g., a control/configuration application running on a network device), may be used to automatically determine a vibrancy value to emit light from one or more lighting loads at a CRI value, that is greater than or equal to a target CRI value. A CRI value greater than or equal to a target CRI value (e.g., a CRI value of 90) may be desirable and may be referred to herein as &#x201c;optimal,&#x201d; &#x201c;optimized,&#x201d; or &#x201c;maximized.&#x201d; That said, other ranges (e.g., smaller and/or larger ranges) may also be considered &#x201c;optimal,&#x201d; &#x201c;optimized,&#x201d; or &#x201c;maximized.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When auto vibrancy mode is selected, the lighting load may be configured to an automatically determined vibrancy value so that the lighting load emits light at a CRI value that is greater than or equal to a target CRI value. As the target CRI value may be unable to be achieved for the selected color setting (e.g., due to the selected color setting being too far from the black-body curve), the vibrancy value that results in the highest CRI value toward the target CRI value may be selected. In certain instances, for example, when auto vibrancy mode is selected, the CRI value of a lighting load may be increased to a value greater than or equal to a target CRI value. For example, the target CRI value may be 90. One will appreciate, however, that the target CRI value may be other values. That is, the target CRI value may be a value which may be considered a desirable threshold that a system may attempt to achieve given the certain characteristics of the load control system and/or lighting control devices (e.g., quality, color, and number of the LEDs used in a lighting load). The vibrancy value may be automatically determined to increase the CRI value to a value that is toward the target CRI value. If a greater CRI value is available, the vibrancy value may be increased until a highest available CRI value is obtained for the selected color setting. As described herein, optimizing the CRI value towards or above the target CRI value may be referred to as optimizing the CRI value. This feature may be enabled through the auto vibrancy mode.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described herein, the vibrancy settings (e.g., vibrancy mode and/or vibrancy values), which, as described herein, may be used to control the CRI of the emitted light, for a lighting load that comprises a plurality of LEDs (e.g., an RGBW lighting load) may be configured via a control/configuration application. For example, the lighting load may be set to an auto vibrancy mode, wherein a vibrancy value may be automatically determined, for example, by the control/configuration application. The lighting load may alternatively be set to an adjustable vibrancy mode, wherein an adjustable vibrancy value for the lighting load is selected by a user.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring first to the auto vibrancy mode, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be based on a distance that the selected color setting for the lighting load is from the black-body curve on the color spectrum (e.g., or another predefined range of color values on the color spectrum). For example, as the selected color setting nears white light or the black-body curve, the automatically determined vibrancy value may increase as the selected color approaches white light or the black-body curve (e.g., in an attempt to increase the CRI value of the light being emitted from the lighting load). Further, since certain x-y chromaticity values may be close enough to the black-body curve to have an equivalent CCT value, the distance the selected color setting for a lighting load is from the black-body curve may indicate whether a certain color setting has an equivalent CCT value. Accordingly, if the distance that the selected color setting for the lighting load is from the black-body curve on the color spectrum is less than a distance threshold, the selected color setting may be considered to have an equivalent CCT value on the black-body curve. Further, the automatically determined vibrancy value for the selected color setting with a distance that is less than the distance threshold may be the same as the automatically determined vibrancy value for the equivalent CCT value of the selected color setting.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The effect that changes in vibrancy has on the CRI value of the light emitted by the lighting load may decrease as the distance between the selected color setting and the black-body curve increases. As a result, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be automatically selected to optimize CRI when the color setting is on, or within a predefined distance to have an equivalent value to, the black body curve. As the selected color setting diverges from the black-body curve (e.g., the distance between the selected color setting and the black-body curve increases), however, the effect of the automatically determined vibrancy value on the CRI value of the emitted light may decrease. The automatically determined vibrancy value may result in the emission of light from the lighting load approaching, at, or above the target CRI value when the selected color setting is within a predefined distance from the black-body curve.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be appreciated, however, that the effect the automatically determined vibrancy value has on a given lighting load may depend on the individual LEDs that make up the lighting load. That is, an automatically determined vibrancy value that results in the emission of light from the lighting load at or above a target CRI value may depend on the individual LEDs that are within the lighting load. Put differently, an automatically determined vibrancy value that results in the emission of light from a first lighting load at or above a target CRI value may differ from an automatically determined vibrancy value that results in the emission of light from a second lighting load at or above a target CRI value (e.g., based on the individual LEDs within each of the lighting loads). Though the vibrancy value may be different for a different lighting load comprising different LEDs, as the target CRI value may change for optimizing CRI, the vibrancy value may similarly increase as the color temperature value of the color setting increases to optimize CRI.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an example color gamut <b>200</b>.

The color gamut <b>200</b> may further include a black-body curve <b>201</b>. As described herein, the black-body curve <b>201</b> may illustrate the location of white or near-white light of varying brightness/intensities within the color gamut <b>200</b>. The black-body curve <b>201</b> may further be identified by a range of correlated color temperatures (CCTs), ranging from &#x201c;warm white&#x201d; (e.g., roughly 2600 K-3000 K), to &#x201c;neutral white&#x201d; (e.g., 3000 K-5000 K) to &#x201c;cool white&#x201d; (e.g., 5000 K-8300 K), for example. As described herein, adjusting the vibrancy of a lighting load may include adjusting the contribution of a white or substantially white LED included within the lighting load. Therefore, the effect that a given vibrancy value of a lighting load has on the CRI value of the light emitted by the light emitted by the lighting load may increase as the selected color approaches the black-body curve <b>201</b> (e.g., which illustrates the location of white or near-white light within the color gamut <b>200</b>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As described herein, however, the effect that a vibrancy value has on a given lighting load may depend on the individual LEDs that make up the lighting load. As a result, the effect that the vibrancy value has on the CRI value of the light emitted by the lighting load may also depend on the individual LEDs that make up the lighting load. Therefore, in certain situations (e.g., depending on the individual LEDs that make up a lighting load), the effect of configuring or tuning the vibrancy value of a lighting load may increase as the selected color approaches the output of a white or substantially white LED (e.g., a mint green LED) within the lighting load and/or as the number of differently colored LEDs within the lighting load increases.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the color setting <b>205</b>, may be selected as the configured color value for a lighting load.

Further, the automatically determined vibrancy value may result in the emission of light from the lighting load at a CRI value that is at or above the target CRI value. However, as described herein, the effect that the automatically determined vibrancy value of a lighting load has on the CRI value of the light emitted by the lighting load may decrease as the selected color setting diverges from the black-body curve <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The distance <b>207</b> may indicate whether the color setting <b>205</b> has an equivalent CCT value on the black-body curve <b>201</b>.

When the target CRI value is unable to be reached for the color setting, the vibrancy may be automatically determined such that the CRI value approaches the target CRI, such that the highest CRI value is achieved for the selected color setting. Further, as described herein, the effect that tuning or configuring the vibrancy value of a lighting load has on the light emitted by the lighting load (e.g., the CRI value of the light emitted by the lighting load) may decrease as the distance between the selected color setting <b>205</b> and the black-body curve <b>201</b> increases. As a result, if, for example, the distance <b>207</b> between the selected color setting <b>205</b> and the black-body curve <b>201</b> is greater than the distance threshold, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be set to a predefined value.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the effect that tuning or configuring the vibrancy value of a lighting load has on the light emitted by the lighting load (e.g., the CRI value of the light emitted by the lighting load) may peak when the selected color setting is on (e.g., or substantially near) the black-body curve <b>201</b>. As a result, when auto vibrancy is enabled for a lighting load that is configured to a color setting on (e.g., or substantially near) the black-body curve <b>201</b>, the automatically determined vibrancy value may correspond to a predefined vibrancy value that maximizes CRI at or above the target CRI value.

As another example, the system controller <b>150</b> and the network device <b>144</b> may communicate directly with one-another using, for example, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, etc. Other examples are possible such as the system controller acting as an access point and providing one or more wireless/wired based networks through which the system controller and network device may communicate.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">In general, the system controller <b>150</b> may be configured to allow a user <b>142</b> of the network device <b>144</b> to determine, for example, the system configuration data for the user environment <b>102</b> and load control system <b>100</b>, such as rooms in the environment, which control devices are in which rooms (e.g., the location of the control devices within the user environment, such as which rooms), to determine the status and/or control/configuration information of control devices (e.g., lighting intensity settings, color settings, vibrancy settings, HVAC levels, shade levels), to configure the system controller (e.g., to change time clock schedules), to issue commands to the system controller in order to control and/or configure the control devices (e.g., change light levels, change HVAC levels, change shade levels, change presets, etc.), etc. Other examples are possible as described herein.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">The network device <b>144</b> may include a control/configuration application for generating and/or compiling the intended system configuration data for the user environment <b>102</b> and load control system <b>100</b>, as further described herein. The control/configuration application may be used to generate system configuration data, for example, via the user providing inputs and/or configuration information to the control/configuration application. After generating the system configuration data and/or updating the system configuration data, the network device <b>144</b>, via the control/configuration application, may transmit the system configuration data (e.g., or any updates) to other devices in the load control system <b>100</b> (e.g., the system controller <b>150</b>, remote-control device <b>122</b>, control target devices, etc.). Then, in response to a triggering event (e.g., enabling a scene, enabling natural light, a sensor event, etc.), for example, one or more devices may perform control based on the system configuration data.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">System configuration data may include information about the devices in a user environment or load control system. For example, system configuration data may include the location of the devices within the load control system or user environment (e.g., a text string that represent a device's location) and/or if the device is assigned to a certain zone. In addition, the system configuration data may include control/configuration information that defines lighting control parameters. For example, the control/configuration information may define the scenes of the load control system, the respective lighting control parameters for each of the defined scenes (e.g., lighting intensity settings, vibrancy settings, color settings, etc.), and/or the buttons that may be pressed to enable each of the defined scenes. The system configuration data may also include control/configuration information for the natural show or natural lighting functionality (e.g., changes in the lighting control parameters over time) defined for the load control system. The system configuration data may include additional information about the devices in the user environment or load control system, and the examples provided herein are not exhaustive. The system configuration data may include any configuration information that may be used to configure or control a user environment or load control system (e.g., one or more of a unique identifiers of a device, a list of associated devices, a zone identifier, a scene identifier, etc.).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The load control system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> may be configured such that the system controller <b>150</b> is capable of communicating with a network device <b>144</b> when that device is local to the system controller, in other words, for the two to directly communicate in a point-to-point fashion or through a local network specific to the user environment <b>102</b> (such as a network provided by a router that is local to the user environment).

Accordingly, the control/configuration application may communicate with the other devices of the user environment (e.g., the system controller, control-source devices, control-target devices etc.) via a network local to the user environment (such as a Wi-Fi network). Nonetheless, one will recognize that the control/configuration application <b>203</b>/network device <b>280</b> may communicate with other devices using other communication systems and/or protocols, etc. In addition, the control/configuration application <b>203</b> is described herein as being a self-contained application that executes on the network device <b>280</b> and communicates messages with the system controller, for example. In other words, logic of the control/configuration application and generated graphics associated with the application are described herein as executing from the network device. Nonetheless, features and/or graphics of the control/configuration application may be implemented in other fashions, such as a web hosted application with the network device interfacing with the web hosted application using a local application (e.g., a web browser or other application) for providing features and functions as described herein. As one example, the system controller may function as the web host.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">In general, while a user environment may include control devices that the control/configuration application/network device <b>280</b> may interact with, control, and/or configure via a system controller (e.g., the system controller <b>150</b>), the user environment may also include other types of control devices that may be, for example, Wi-Fi enabled and/or internet of things enabled control devices for example (e.g., devices that are configured to communicate via wireless and/or wired based networks, such as HomeKit). For description purposes, such other control devices (e.g., control devices to which the control/configuration application and/or network device <b>280</b> does not communicate with via the system controller) may be referred to herein as Wi-Fi enabled and/or HomeKit enabled control devices. Nonetheless, one will recognize that the features described herein are not limited to Wi-Fi enabled and/or HomeKit enabled control devices. Examples of such other control devices may include lighting control devices/bulbs, thermostats, fans, etc.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">Network device <b>280</b> and the Wi-Fi enabled control devices, for example, may be configured to directly communicate with each other without having to communicate through a system controller (e.g., if the network device is also HomeKit enabled), and/or may communicate via one or more cloud based servers, for example, again without communicating through the system controller. According to one aspect of the control/configuration application <b>203</b> described herein, assuming the network device <b>280</b> is configured to communicate with such Wi-Fi enabled control devices (e.g., via HomeKit), for example, the control/configuration application may be configured to also interact with, control, and/or configure these devices, in addition to control devices. In so doing, the control/configuration application may combine within the graphical interfaces described herein information obtained from such Wi-Fi enabled devices, for example, and information obtained on control devices that are controlled by the system controller.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">The control/configuration application <b>203</b> may also provide interfaces that allow a user to control and/or configure both Wi-Fi enabled control devices, for example, and control devices that are controlled by the system controller.

Nonetheless, similar functionality as described herein may also apply to Wi-Fi enabled devices that may not be controlled via the system controller and to which the network device may directly and/or indirectly communicate. One will also recognize that the control/configuration application described herein may alternatively control Wi-Fi enabled devices, for example, with which the network device <b>280</b> is configured to directly and/or indirectly control/interact with. Again, one will further recognize that while control/configuration application <b>203</b> is described herein in the context of a load control system and communication systems, the features and functions of the control/configuration application are applicable to other types of control devices, load control systems, and communication systems including for example, Wi-Fi enabled and/or HomeKit enabled systems</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">As one example, the network device <b>280</b> may display to a user via a visual display screen <b>206</b> an icon associated with the control/configuration application <b>203</b>. The network device <b>280</b> may detect the selection of the icon by the user (e.g., such as detecting the using touching the icon) and in response, may start (e.g., which may also be referred to herein as launching, running, executing, activating and/or invoking) the control/configuration application <b>203</b>. The control/configuration application may be started in other ways, including the network device being configured to automatically start the application upon being reset and/or powered on. In response to being started or launched, the control/configuration application (in addition to performing security/authentication procedures, for example) may communicate one or more messages to the system controller, for example, to obtain/request/query for various information, such as status/state and/or configuration information of the load control system, and use this information to initially generate and display to the user via the display screen of the network device <b>280</b> a graphical user interface. Again, at starting, for example, the control/configuration application may also communicate with Wi-Fi enabled devices, for example, the network devices have been configured to communicate with. Thereafter, the control/configuration application may continue to request and/or receive various information from the system controller at various times depending on what information the control/configuration application may need to display to the user and/or is being generated by the system controller. Again, the control/configuration application <b>203</b> may also communicate with Wi-Fi enabled devices in a similar fashion.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">Upon receiving information requests from the control/configuration application <b>203</b> (such as requests for status and configuration information), the system controller may respond by communicating with control devices and/or a database(s), for example, to determine and provide the requested information and respond to the control/configuration application with one or more response messages. In addition to determining status and configuration of the load control system, for example, the control/configuration application <b>203</b> may also allow a user to communicate messages to the system controller to modify, edit, or change the configuration and/or state of the load control system as further described herein. In addition, the system controller may also asynchronously provide status and configuration information to the control/configuration application (e.g., provide an indication of status/state changes of control devices without the control/configuration application querying for such changes). The control/configuration application may use this information to update various graphical user interfaces displayed to the user via the network device <b>280</b>. Again, Wi-Fi enabled devices and the control/configuration application and/or network device may interact in similar fashions.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">Before turning to the various graphical user interfaces the control/configuration application <b>203</b> may provide to a user, a description of example types of information the control/configuration application may request/receive and/or configure, for example, to generate interfaces is discussed. For example, as described herein, the control/configuration application may request/obtain this information from another device (e.g. system controller and/or one more control source devices). Also, or alternatively, the information may be maintained or stored locally (e.g., stored at the memory device(s) <b>204</b>). In addition to receiving this information, the control/configuration application may also alter such information at the system controller, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">The control/configuration application may request/obtain information related to the configuration and current state/status of a load control system from another device in the load control system, such as the system controller and/or one or more control source devices (e.g., the remote-control device <b>122</b>). Also, or alternatively, the network device <b>280</b> may itself store or maintain the configuration and current state/status information (e.g. or a subset of the configuration and current stat/status information), and the control/configuration application <b>203</b> may request/obtain this information from the memory device(s) <b>204</b>. Such information may include, for example, the specific control devices that are part of the load control system including an identifier that indicates the type of the control device The specific control device types may include, for example, one or more lighting control devices (also referred to herein as lighting devices) that each directly controls one or more respective electrical lighting loads/lights, one or more temperature control devices (such as and hereinafter also referred to as a thermostat device(s)) that directly control respective HVAC systems, one or more ceiling fan devices (also referred to herein as fan devices) that each directly controls one or more respective fans (e.g., on, off, fan speed), one or more audio control devices (e.g., a speaker system), and one or more window shade devices that each directly controls positions or levels of one or more respective shades (One will recognize that while shade devices and shades are discussed herein as an example of motorized window treatments and window covering, other types of motorized window treatments and window coverings are possible such as drapes, curtains, blinds, etc.).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">The control devices may include one or more keypads, such as wall-mounted keypads, tabletop keypads, and/or remote-control/handheld keypads and devices. As an example, a given keypad may include one or more actuators such as buttons (although other types of actuators are possible), and may be configured to control one or more control devices/electrical loads (e.g., lighting control devices/lighting load(s), HVAC system(s), shade(s), fan(s), and/or speaker(s), etc.). A keypad may include different types of actuators such as on/off actuators, raise lower actuators for lights or shades, fan speed actuators, scene actuators, etc. A scene actuator may set one or more control devices/electrical loads controlled by the keypad to a pre-set configuration.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">The configuration and current state/status information may also include a location indicator for each control device that may indicate a location of the device within the user environment and/or the location of the electrical loads the device controls. This indicator may be in the form of a location name (e.g., a text string) and/or an indicator that may be translated into a location name (e.g., a text string), although other mechanisms may be used. For example, assuming the user environment is a home, possible locations may include standard locations like &#x201c;kitchen,&#x201d; &#x201c;living room,&#x201d; &#x201c;family room,&#x201d; &#x201c;dining room,&#x201d; &#x201c;master bedroom,&#x201d; &#x201c;bedroom,&#x201d; &#x201c;master bathroom,&#x201d; &#x201c;bathroom,&#x201d; &#x201c;basement,&#x201d; &#x201c;front porch,&#x201d; &#x201c;office,&#x201d; &#x201c;lobby,&#x201d; &#x201c;conference room,&#x201d; etc. Locations may also include sub-locations in a room like &#x201c;basement&#x2014;sitting area,&#x201d; &#x201c;basement&#x2014;game area,&#x201d; basement&#x2014;work area,&#x201d; basement&#x2014;storage area,&#x201d; etc. Locations may also include user defined/customized locations like: &#x201c;Mary's bedroom,&#x201d; &#x201c;John's bedroom,&#x201d; etc. The location of a control device may be programmed into the load control system (and stored in database, for example) by a user when installing the system within the user environment. One will recognize these are examples.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">For lighting control devices, the configuration and current state/status information may also include a type indicator that may indicate a type of a lighting load(s) (also referred to herein as a light(s)) controlled by the control device. A type of a lighting load may include, for example, the function/purpose of the lighting load within its defined location and/or indicate/suggest a specific location of the lighting load within its defined location (e.g., ceiling light vs floor lamp). A type indicator may be in the form of a name/function (e.g., a text string) and/or an indicator that may be translated into a name/function (e.g., a text string), although other mechanism may be used. As an example, assuming the user environment is a home, standard types may include ceiling or overhead light, chandelier, pendant(s), table lamp(s), floor lamp(s), sconce(s), sink light(s) (e.g., for a kitchen or bathroom), island light(s) (e.g., for a kitchen), closet light(s), accent lights, downlights, desk area lights, etc. Types may also include user defined/customized types. The type of lighting load may be programmed into load control system (and stored in a database, for example) by a user when installing the system within the user environment. One will recognize these are examples. Types may also apply to other control devices such as fans, shades, and keypads. Again, the type indicator may provide an indication of a specific function and or location within the device's defined location. Other example types may include &#x201c;left shade,&#x201d; &#x201c;right shade,&#x201d; &#x201c;center shade,&#x201d; &#x201c;wall keypad,&#x201d; &#x201c;tabletop keypad,&#x201d; etc.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">The control/configuration information may also include an indication of an icon to be used with applications (such as the control/configuration application) to graphically represent the control device on a graphical interface. The type of icon to associate with a device may be programmed into load control system (and stored in a database, for example) by a user or automatically when installing the system within the user environment.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">The control/configuration information may also include a current status/state and/or configuration of one or more of the control devices. For example, for a lighting control device the status information may include whether the respective lighting load(s) are in an on or off state, and if in the on state whether it is a dimmed state and possibly further the dimming level, color setting, vibrancy setting, etc. The control/configuration application may allow the user to modify scenes and/or to create new scenes, for example, via the network device. For an occupancy sensor, the status information may include, for example, whether the sensor has detected an occupancy event/condition and/or is in an occupancy state, has detected a continued occupancy event/condition and/or is in a continued occupancy state, and/or has detected a vacancy condition and/or is in a vacancy state. Again, these are examples and other information is possible.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">As another example, a device in the load control system, such as the system controller and/or one or more control source devices, may maintain information related to one or more pre-programmed scenes that may be actuated by a user from an application, such as the control/configuration application <b>203</b> or a control source device, such as the remote-control device <b>122</b> or other type of keypad as described herein. A scene may include, for example, certain settings for one or more lights, shades, etc. The device may maintain respective scene configuration information in a database. The control/configuration application may request/obtain information related to these pre-programmed scenes and as further described below, thereafter allow the user, via the network device, to a select a given scene, resulting in the control/configuration application instructing the another device (e.g., the system controller and/or one more control source devices) to configure control devices according to the selected scene (e.g., set one more light levels, fan speeds, shade levels, etc.). As also described below, the control/configuration application may allow a user to modify the pre-programmed scenes maintained and to create and store new scenes that may subsequently be selected by the user. After the scene are created and stored, the scenes may be assigned. For example, a scene may be assigned to one or more zones in the load control system, and enabled by, for example, pressing a certain button at a remote control device or keypad.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">As a still further example, various time clock schedules may be maintained where a schedule may be, for example, a certain setting for one or more control devices (e.g., lights, shades, etc.) that the system controller or one more control-source devices automatically configure based on the schedule. For example, the system controller may maintain respective time clock schedules in a database and the status of these schedules, such as whether a given schedule is active, inactive, or disabled. The control/configuration application may obtain control information related to these time clock schedules and as further described below, thereafter allow the user via the network device to modify these schedules and to create new schedules.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">According to another example, a lighting control device may control a lighting load (e.g., or a plurality of lighting loads), where the lighting load may include a plurality of multi-colored LEDs. In other words, the lighting load may include within a single package, for example, a number of differently colored emission LEDs and may be configured such that the chromaticity output of the LEDs is mixed to produce light having varying chromaticity coordinates (e.g., color points) within a color gamut formed by the various LEDs that make up the lighting load. As one example, a lighting load may include one or more red LEDs, one or more green LEDs, one or more blue LEDs, and one or more white, or substantially white LEDs (e.g., such as yellow and/or mint green LED(s)), which may be collectively referred to herein as a RGBW lighting load. Although the RGBW lighting load is described herein with a combination of four LEDs of certain colors, other combinations of LEDs (e.g., more or less LEDs and/or different color LEDs) may be used.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">The control/configuration application may be used to configure a CRI value of one or more lighting loads. A CRI value greater than or equal to a threshold (e.g., a CRI value of <b>90</b>) may be desirable and may be referred to herein as &#x201c;optimal,&#x201d; &#x201c;optimized,&#x201d; or &#x201c;maximized.&#x201d; That said, other ranges (e.g., smaller and/or larger ranges) may also be considered &#x201c;optimal,&#x201d; &#x201c;optimized,&#x201d; or &#x201c;maximized.&#x201d; In certain instances (e.g., depending on distance between the selected color setting and the black-body curve), the CRI value of a lighting load may be increased to a value greater than or equal to a target CRI value. For example, the target CRI value may be 90. One will appreciate, however, that the target CRI value may be other values. That is, the target CRI value may be a value which may be considered a desirable threshold that a system may attempt to achieve give the certain characteristics of the load control system and/or lighting control devices (e.g., quality of the LEDs used in a lighting load).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">A load control system may be configured and/or controlled according to one or more defined scenes. Also, or alternatively, the load control system may be further divided into one or more areas or locations (e.g., depending on the size of the load control system or user environment), and each of the areas or locations within the load control system may be configured and/or control according to one or more scenes. The scenes may be activated, for example, in response to a button press at a control source device (e.g., remote control device <b>122</b>), via a graphical user interface on a network device (e.g., the network devices <b>144</b>, <b>280</b>), and/or based on a time clock, as described herein. Also, or alternatively, a load control system may be configured and/or controlled according to natural show or natural lighting configuration, which as described herein, may be activated in response to a button press at a control source device, via a graphical user interface at a network device, and/or based on a time clock etc. As described herein, a natural show or natural lighting configuration may be defined separately from a scene, or assigned to a scene (e.g., such that activating a scene enables a natural show or natural light configuration). Further, a control/configuration application (e.g., the control/configuration application <b>203</b>) may display one or more graphical user interface to allow a user to define the scenes and/or configure the natural show or natural lighting settings.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">As described herein, the devices in a load control system may be grouped or organized together based on their respective location within the user environment. For example, the devices in a load control system may be grouped and/or organized based on their respective location in the user environment (e.g. the devices in a single room may be organized or grouped together). After the devices are grouped or organized based on their location in the user environment, the devices may also be assigned to a certain zone. For example, the lighting devices in a certain location of a user environment may be assigned to a zone based on their respective function (e.g., the lighting control devices that are intended to emit light a certain surface, such as desk, may be grouped, or organized together in a &#x201c;Desk Area&#x201d; zone).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Grouping or organizing the devices in a load control system based on their location and then assigning them to a zone (e.g., based on their function) may allow a user to configure or control the devices within a load control system more efficiently. For example, as the number of device in the load control system increases, the settings that may be configured by the user may also increase. And without grouping or organizing the device into a more manageable subset of devices, the user may fail to accurately and efficiently control the increased number of devices in the load control system. Moreover, the capabilities and, as a result, the configurable settings of each of the devices may differ, further increasing the complexity of configuring or controlling the load control system. If, however, the devices are grouped by their respective location and then assigned to a zone (e.g., based on their respective function), the user may configure the devices in the load control system by zone, which may improve the accuracy and efficiency of configuring and controlling the load control system.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">After the devices in a load control system are organized and grouped by location and subsequently assigned to a zone, a user may collectively configure or control the devices that are assigned to a given zone. Further, since the devices that are assigned to a given zone based on their respective function, the settings for devices in that zone (e.g., lighting intensity settings and/or color settings) may be configured to be the same, which may improve the accuracy and efficiency of configuring and controlling the load control system.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are flowcharts that illustrate example procedures for configuring or controlling a load control system. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, there is shown an example procedure <b>300</b> for performing vibrancy control in a load control system. The procedure <b>300</b>, or portions thereof, may be performed by a control/configuration application, such as the control/configuration application <b>203</b>, and may enter at <b>301</b>. For example, the procedure <b>300</b> may enter in response to an indication from a user to update or configure the system configuration data (e.g., control/configuration information and/or current state/status information) for a load control system (e.g., via a network devices, such as the network devices <b>144</b>, <b>280</b>). The procedure <b>300</b> may be performed after the devices in a load control system have been grouped or organized by their respective location in a user environment and subsequently assigned to zones. Also, or alternatively, the procedure <b>300</b> may be performed prior to the devices in a load control system being grouped or organized by their respective location in a user environment and/or assigned to a zone, which may be stored and/or maintained in the system configuration data.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">At <b>302</b>, the control/configuration application may retrieve the system configuration data for a given zone. For example, the system configuration data may indicate the lighting control device(s), which, as described herein may perform control of a corresponding lighting load, that are assigned to the zone. The system configuration data may indicate or otherwise describe the current state or control/configuration information defined for the lighting control device(s) assigned to the zone. For example, the system configuration data may include control/configuration information comprising lighting control parameters for controlling the corresponding lighting loads of the lighting control devices. As described herein, the lighting control parameters may indicate the lighting intensity settings and/or the color settings. The lighting intensity settings may indicate the lighting intensity settings, the color settings, the vibrancy setting, etc. to which lighting control devices in the zone are to be controlled. The color settings may include a color value (e.g., x-y chromaticity values, CCT value, etc.) to which the lighting load of the lighting control devices in the zone are to be controlled. The color value may be a coordinate on the color gamut or a color temperature value. The color value may identify a full color value or a CCT value of white light on the black-body curve. The lighting control parameters may also indicate vibrancy settings (e.g., vibrancy mode and/or vibrancy value) for controlling the lighting control devices in the zone. The vibrancy settings may include a selection of the vibrancy mode, such as the auto vibrancy mode, or the adjustable vibrancy mode for the lighting control devices assigned to the zone. The vibrancy settings may also include the vibrancy value for controlling the lighting control devices assigned to the zone.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">As described herein, the system configuration data may be retrieved from a single device (e.g., a system controller, such as the system controller <b>150</b>, or a network device), or portions of the system configuration data may be retrieved from multiple devices (e.g., a system controller, network device, one or more control source devices, and/or one or more control target devices). The system configuration data may also be obtained from devices external to the load control system, such as from cloud based system or other load control systems to which a given load control system is integrated with. The system configuration data may include predefined control/configuration information and/or control/configuration information based on a user selection (e.g., a user may provide a selection, via the control/configuration application <b>203</b>).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">After retrieving the system configuration data, the control/configuration application may display a representation of the system configuration data (e.g., or a portion of the system configuration data). For example, the control/configuration application may display a representation of a defined scene for controlling one or more zones in an area of user environment or load control system via a graphical user interface, as described herein. As described herein, one or more lighting control devices configured to control a corresponding lighting load may be assigned to each of the one or more zones. The graphical user interface may display various controls or control interfaces based on the lighting control device/lighting loads assigned to a given zone. For example, the graphical user interface may display a lighting intensity (e.g., via lighting intensity bar) for each of the lighting control device(s) assigned to the zone and/or a palette that identifies a color setting for controlling each of the one or more zones in the scene. The palette may be configured to display colors at different color temperatures at which the lighting control devices/lighting loads are capable of being controlled to, or a full color gamut of colors at which the lighting control devices/lighting load are capable of being controlled to. If, for example, the system configuration data indicates that a respective vibrancy mode is enabled (e.g., auto vibrancy mode and/or adjustable vibrancy mode is enabled), the graphical user interface may display a vibrancy control interface for each of the lighting control device(s) assigned to the zone.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">Also, or alternatively, the control/configuration application may display a representation of the system configuration data in the form of a graph. The graph may include one or more axes (e.g., a color temperature axis that indicates color temperatures, an intensity axis that indicates lighting intensity values, and/or a time axis that includes a period of time at which the lighting intensity and the color temperatures are controlled), which may indicate changes in lighting control parameters (e.g., lighting intensity settings, color settings, vibrancy setting, etc.) of the lighting control device/lighting loads assigned to a given zone over time (referred to herein as natural show). If a respective vibrancy mode is enabled (e.g., auto vibrancy mode or adjustable vibrancy mode is enabled), the graphical user interface may also display certain vibrancy control interfaces (e.g., a vibrancy bar).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">The control/configuration application may also be configured to receive updates or changes to the system configuration data, for example, from a user. As described herein, changes to the system configuration data may include changes or updates to the lighting control parameters (e.g., lighting intensity settings, color settings, vibrancy settings, etc.) for a defined scene; changes or updates to a natural show (e.g., changes or updates to the lighting intensity settings, color settings, vibrancy settings, etc., over time); etc. Accordingly, the control/configuration application may receive changes or updates to the system configuration data via the displayed lighting intensity, palette, and/or vibrancy controls.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">As described herein, a lighting control device may be set to and/or configured according to an auto vibrancy mode or an adjustable vibrancy mode. Accordingly, the control/configuration application may determine whether auto vibrancy mode is selected at <b>304</b>. When auto vibrancy mode is selected, the control/configuration application may automatically determine a vibrancy value at which to control the lighting load to emit light at a CRI value that is at or above a target CRI value. For example, the control/configuration application may automatically determine the vibrancy value based on a distance between the selected color setting and the black-body curve, such that the lighting load emits light toward, at, or above a target CRI value. Thus, at <b>306</b>, the control/configuration application may determine a distance between the selected color setting for the lighting load (e.g., which may be indicated or otherwise defined by the system configuration data) and the black-body curve. Although not show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the control/configuration application may also, or alternatively, determine a distance between the selected color setting for the lighting load and another set of predefined color values (e.g., the color output of a white or substantially white LED) on the color spectrum. At <b>308</b>, the control/configuration application may automatically determine a vibrancy value based on the distance between the selected color setting for the lighting load and the black-body curve (e.g., or another set of predefined color values on the color spectrum). The vibrancy value automatically determined at <b>306</b> may further be and/or alternatively be configured to emit light from the corresponding lighting load toward, at, or above a target CRI value. As described herein, when the auto vibrancy mode is enabled, a vibrancy value may be automatically determined based on the selected color setting. Further, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be updated as the selected color setting is updated (e.g., as the user changes or updates the selected color setting). Accordingly, the actions performed at <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> of the procedure <b>300</b> may be performed in response to changes in the selected color settings (e.g., the respective distances and vibrancy values may be re-determined in response to changes or updates to the selected color settings).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">As described herein, the distance between the selected color setting for the lighting load and the black-body curve may indicate whether the selected color setting has an equivalent CCT value on the black-body curve. If, for example, the distance is less than a distance threshold (e.g., indicating that the color setting has an equivalent CCT value), the automatically determined vibrancy value may be the automatically determined vibrancy that results in the emission of light from the lighting load at or above the target CRI value for the equivalent CCT value. In addition, when the distance between the selected color setting for the lighting load and the black-body curve is greater than the distance threshold, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be a predefined vibrancy value (e.g., 25%).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">As described herein (e.g., with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>), as the selected color setting nears white or near white light (e.g., nears the black-body curve), the effect that configuring or controlling vibrancy has on the light emitted by the lighting load (e.g., the CRI value of the light emitted by the lighting load) may increase. As a result, if the distance between the selected color setting for the lighting load and the black-body curve is less than the distance threshold, the automatically determined vibrancy value may increase. Further, as the selected color setting increases along the black-body curve (e.g., as the CCT value increase and/or as the selected color setting approaches higher CCT values), the automatically determined vibrancy value may increase (e.g., the contribution of the white or substantially white LED may decrease).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">The control/configuration application may determine whether adjustable vibrancy mode is selected at <b>310</b>. As described herein, when adjustable vibrancy mode is selected, the control/configuration application may be configured to receive an adjustable vibrancy value at which to control the corresponding lighting load. If adjustable vibrancy mode is not selected, the procedure <b>300</b> may end at <b>315</b>. If, however, adjustable vibrancy mode is selected at <b>310</b>, the control/configuration application may receive the adjustable vibrancy value at <b>312</b>, for example, via the vibrancy control interface displayed by the graphical user interface (e.g., a vibrancy control bar). As the selected vibrancy value increases, the contribution of at least one of the plurality of LEDs in the corresponding lighting load may decrease. For example, as the selected vibrancy value increases, the contribution of the white (e.g., or substantially white) LED in an RGBW lighting load may decrease to increase the vibrancy of reflected light from the lighting load. Additionally, or alternatively, as the selected vibrancy value increases, the contribution of at least one of the plurality of non-white LEDs in the corresponding lighting load may increase to increase the vibrancy of reflected light from the lighting load.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">At <b>314</b>, the control/configuration application may generate control instructions. For example, depending on the selected vibrancy mode, the control/configuration application may generate control instructions based on the automatically determined vibrancy value at <b>306</b> or the received adjustable vibrancy value at <b>312</b>. The control instructions may, based on the selected lighting intensity settings, color settings, vibrancy settings, etc., include a lighting intensity settings, a color setting, and/or a vibrancy value (e.g., the automatically determined vibrancy value at <b>306</b> or the received adjustable vibrancy value at <b>312</b>). Also, or alternatively, the control instruction may include an indication or a button press. And, as described further herein, a lighting control device that receives the generated control instructions may perform control of a corresponding load based on the control instructions. For example, the lighting control device may control the corresponding lighting load to emit light at the lighting intensity value and color value indicated by the selected lighting intensity settings, the selected color settings, and/or the selected vibrancy settings. If, for example, the control instructions include an indication of a certain button press, the lighting control device may determine the selected lighting intensity settings, the selected color settings, and/or the selected vibrancy settings based on the certain button that was pressed (e.g., by retrieving these settings from an internal storage medium), and control the corresponding lighting load to emit light at those selected settings. That is, the corresponding lighting load may set the intensity of each of its respective LEDs to maintain the selected color setting and lighting intensity setting while controlling to the vibrancy value (e.g., the intensity or contributions of each of the respective LEDs). And, when the auto vibrancy mode is selected, the lighting load may set the intensity of each of its respective LEDs such the lighting load emits light at a CRI value at, or above the target CRI value.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">The procedure <b>300</b> may also be performed in a natural show example. For example, if the system configuration data indicates that lighting control devices and corresponding lighting loads assigned to a zone are configured with natural show with auto vibrancy mode enabled, the control/configuration application may be configured to automatically determine vibrancy values for each of the selected color settings over a period of time. That is, the control/configuration application may determine a respective distance between each of the selected color setting over the period of time and the black-body curve (e.g., or another predefined range of color values on the color gamut), and then determine respective vibrancy values for each of the selected color settings over the period of time to emit light at a CRI value that achieves the target CRI based on the respective color setting selected at that time.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">Similarly, when the system configuration data indicates that lighting control devices and corresponding lighting loads assigned to a zone are configured with natural show and adjustable vibrancy mode enabled, the control/configuration application may receive a selection of the adjustable vibrancy value, and the selection of the adjustable vibrancy value may apply to the selected color setting over the period of time. One will appreciate, however, that although the selection of the adjustable vibrancy value may remain the same over the period of time, the intensity or contribution of the white LED in the lighting may differ based on the selected color setting. For example, although the selection of the adjustable vibrancy value may remain the same over the period of time, the intensity or contribution of the white LED may decrease as the selected color setting (e.g., CCT value) increase over the period of time.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the control/configuration application may update the system configuration data to reflect the control instructions generated at <b>314</b> before exiting the procedure <b>300</b> at <b>315</b>. For example, the control/configuration application may update the system configuration data in response to determining that there are no additional updates to be made to the system configuration data (e.g., when the control/configuration application receives an indication from a user that there are not additional updates to the system configuration data, for example, by selecting a &#x201c;Save&#x201d; or &#x201c;Finished&#x201d; button, such as the &#x201c;Save to Scene&#x201d; button <b>438</b> described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, there is shown an example procedure <b>350</b> for controlling a load control system based on a system configuration data, which, as described herein, may be defined or updated using the procedure <b>300</b>. The procedure <b>350</b> may be performed by a single device. For example, the procedure <b>350</b> may be performed by a system controller, a lighting control device, a network device, or another control device to perform control using the system configuration data stored thereon. Also, or alternatively, the procedure <b>350</b> may be performed by multiple devices (e.g., a portion of the procedure <b>350</b> may be performed by a first load control device and another portion of the procedure <b>350</b> may be performed by a second load control device). For example, the system controller may retrieve the system configuration data (e.g., either locally or from another device) and perform control based on the system configuration data (e.g., by transmitting one or more message that include control instructions to perform control based to one or more lighting control devices based on the system configuration data).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the procedure <b>350</b> may be performed in response to the detection of a triggering event at <b>351</b>. A triggering event may be an event that causes the devices in a load control system to be controlled according to the system configuration data. For example, as described herein, a triggering event may be caused by a user actuation for activating a scene (e.g. by pressing a button that corresponds to a scene at a remote control device or keypad); a scheduled event (e.g., based on a time clock); and/or a sensor event (e.g., an occupancy sensor detecting occupancy). Accordingly, the system configuration data may be retrieved at <b>352</b>. As described herein, the system configuration data may be stored at a system controller and/or across one or more other devices (e.g., remote-devices, network devices, lighting control devices, other control devices, etc.). Therefore, the system configuration data may be retrieved from a system controller and/or from one or other devices in the load control system.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">After retrieving the system configuration data, control may be performed based on the system configuration data at <b>354</b>. For example, control may be performed by transmitting one or more messages that include control instructions (e.g., the control instructions generated at <b>314</b> of the procedure <b>300</b>) to the load control device and/or a corresponding lighting load based on the system configuration data (e.g., the lighting control parameters indicated in the system configuration data). Referring now to a lighting control device and corresponding lighting load configured in an auto vibrancy mode or an adjustable vibrancy mode, the control instructions may include the selected lighting intensity settings (e.g., lighting intensity value), the selected color settings (e.g., x-y chromaticity values or CCT values), and a vibrancy value. As describe herein, the vibrancy value may be an automatically determined vibrancy value (e.g., when the auto vibrancy mode is enabled), or an adjustable vibrancy value selected by a user (e.g., when the adjustable vibrancy mode is enabled). These control instructions may be transmitted to the lighting control device and/or the corresponding lighting load. In response to receiving these control instructions, the lighting control device and/or corresponding lighting load may, based on the vibrancy value indicated by the control instructions, determine contribution/intensity of the separately colored LEDs to emit light at the selected lighting intensity settings and the selected color settings. The lighting control device may output the same total color and/or intensity, while varying the individual contribution/intensity of the separately colored LEDs in response to the vibrancy value. As the vibrancy value increases, the contribution/intensity of the non-white LEDs may increase and/or the contribution/intensity of the white LED(s) may decrease. As the vibrancy value decreases, the contribution/intensity of the non-white LEDs may decrease and/or the contribution/intensity of the white LED(s) may increase. It will be understood that the vibrancy value may be a relative value (e.g., between 0 and 100) that is different for different lighting loads having different combinations of colored LEDs.

For example, a natural show may be assigned to a scene and/or enabled when the scene is activated (e.g., via a button press at a remote control device or keypad, via a time clock schedule etc.). The natural show indicator <b>425</b> may be selectable or configurable, and/or may allow the user to select or define the natural show settings for one or more lighting control devices (e.g., the one or more lighting control devices in the preselected area or zone). A natural show setting may include a time clock based configuration of one or more lighting control devices where the control devices may be automatically controlled to change their lighting intensity values/brightness and/or color output over a defined period of time. After selecting the natural show indictor <b>425</b>, the control/configuration application may display a graphical user interface that provides a user with the ability to configure the natural show settings. As an example, after selecting the natural show indictor <b>425</b> the control/configuration application may display the graphical user interface <b>510</b><i>a </i>to configure the natural show settings, as described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>B</figref>. As another example, after selecting the natural show indictor <b>425</b> the control/configuration application may display the graphical user interface <b>510</b><i>a </i>to configure the natural show settings, as described herein with respect to <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>B. Further, although the natural show indicator <b>425</b> is provided on the graphical user interface <b>410</b> for configuring and/or controlling the natural show, other graphical user interfaces may also be provided for configuring and/or controlling the natural show.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">As described herein, the devices in a load control system may be grouped or organized by their respective location in a user environment and subsequently assigned to a zone (e.g., based on their function). Turning now for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, there is shown an example of the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>that may be displayed by the control/configuration application to control the lighting intensity settings, color settings, and/or vibrancy settings defined for scenes (e.g., after selection of the scene indicator <b>412</b>). The graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may be provided for configuring scenes in response to the scene indicator <b>412</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>), for example. As described herein, a scene may control one or more zones in a given location or area of a user environment. Thus, the control/configuration application may be configured to display the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>(e.g., or another similar graphical user interface) such that a user is provided with the ability to configure or control devices assigned to each zone based on their respective functionality and/or capabilities. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> and as further described herein, the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may display different types of controls based on the functionality and/or capabilities of the devices assigned to each of the zones (e.g., the devices in the &#x201c;Desk Area <b>1</b>&#x201d; zone are capable of adjusting their lighting intensity and thus control interface <b>418</b> is display, whereas the devices in the &#x201c;Hallway zone&#x201d; are capable of toggling between an on and off and thus the control interface <b>430</b> is displayed). The graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may include scene icons <b>414</b>. The scene icons <b>414</b> may indicate the scenes that are defined, e.g., for a particular area of the load control system. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the defined scenes may include: &#x201c;Bright,&#x201d; &#x201c;Cleaning,&#x201d; &#x201c;Event,&#x201d; &#x201c;Relax,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Off&#x201d; Further, as described herein, each of these scenes may correspond to a respective button, for example, of a keypad that is located in given location or area of a user environment.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">As described herein, the scenes defined for the load control system (e.g., or a certain area in the load control system) may be stored and/or maintained at a single device (e.g., a system controller) or across multiple devices (e.g., the system controller, and/or, the network device, one or more control source devices, and/or one or more control target devices). When a scene is selected, one or more messages that include control instructions to control the loads as defined by the scene may be transmitted. In addition, the scenes defined for the area of the load control system may be selected via the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a. </i>The scenes (e.g., and their respective configurations) may be communicated to a system controller. Each of the scenes may be separately configurable and/or programmable via the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a. </i>Further, the graphical user interface may indicate the scene that is presently being configured/programmed and/or is currently active may be indicated. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the &#x201c;Bright&#x201d; scene may be the scene that is presently being configured/activated (e.g. as indicated by the &#x201c;Bright&#x201d; scene icon being highlighted).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">After configuration, a scene may be activated via a graphical user interface, such as the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>(e.g., or a different graphical user interface), or a control device, such as the remote-control device <b>122</b> and/or keypad. For example, as described herein, the control device may include one or more buttons, each of which may correspond to a configured scene. The scene may then be activated by actuating (e.g., pressing) the button that corresponds to that scene. Upon activation, the configurations defined for the scene may be retrieved. For example, the configurations may be stored and retrieved from the control device, and/or a system controller, such as the system controller <b>150</b>, or the load control device(s)/lighting control device(s) themselves. Also, or alternatively, the configurations for the scene, or portions thereof, may be stored and retrieved from multiple devices. For example, part of the configuration for a scene may be stored and retrieved from the system controller, and another part of the configuration for the scene may be stored and retrieved from the control device and/or the load control device(s)/lighting control device(s) themselves. After the configuration for the scene has been retrieved, one or more messages including control instructions may be transmitted to control one or more load control devices based on the configuration of the scene.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">The load control devices configured for being controlled in a given scene may be organized or grouped into one or more zones. For example, the load control devices may be organized or grouped into a given zone based on their location, function, etc. Referring to FIG. <b>4</b>B, for example, the &#x201c;Bright&#x201d; scene may include lighting control devices that are organized or grouped in a &#x201c;Front Downlights&#x201d; zone, a &#x201c;Desk Area&#x201d; zone, and an &#x201c;Accent Lights&#x201d; zone. Each of the zones may be separately controllable via a respective control interface. For example, the &#x201c;Desk Area&#x201d; zone may be controlled by the control interface <b>440</b> and the &#x201c;Front Downlights&#x201d; zone may be controlled by control interface <b>452</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">The control interface of a respective zone may vary based on the load control device and/or lighting loads associated with the zone. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the load control device(s) associated with the &#x201c;Desk Area&#x201d; zone may be a dimmer. Accordingly, control interface <b>440</b> may be configured to include one or more control interfaces to enable the user to control the dimmer. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the control interface may include an indicator <b>432</b>, control line <b>436</b>, and/or actuators <b>422</b>, <b>420</b><i>a, </i><b>420</b><i>b. </i>The indicator <b>432</b> may indicate the configured lighting intensity for the &#x201c;Desk Area&#x201d; zone (e.g., 50% as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). As described herein, the actuator <b>422</b> may be actuated along the control line <b>436</b> to control the lighting intensity of the &#x201c;Desk Area&#x201d; zone. Similarly, actuator <b>420</b><i>a </i>may be actuated to decrease the lighting intensity of the &#x201c;Desk Area&#x201d; zone and actuator <b>420</b><i>b </i>may be actuated to increase the lighting intensity of &#x201c;Desk Area&#x201d; zone. Each of actuators <b>420</b><i>a </i>and <b>420</b><i>b </i>may be configured to increase/decrease the intensity by a set amount, such as 1%.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">The control/configuration application may be configured to allow the user to rename a scene and/or the corresponding zones. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may include a rename light and scenes button <b>426</b>. The rename light and scenes button <b>426</b> may be actuated to adjust the name of the zones and/or scenes defined for the area of the load control system. The graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may include a save scene button <b>438</b>, which, when actuated, may save the configuration of and/or changes to a respective scene.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">The control/configuration application may be configured to provide the user real-time feedback of the settings being configured. For example, the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>displayed by the control/configuration application may include a &#x201c;Live Changes Enabled&#x201d; actuator <b>428</b>. When the Live Changes Enabled actuator <b>428</b> is enabled (e.g., as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>), the lighting controls that are defined by the user via the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may be present at the respective lighting control devices in the load control system. For example, control instructions that indicate the defined lighting intensities may be transmitted to the respecting lighting control devices, and the lighting control devices may transition to indicate the lighting intensities. In response, the user may be provided with live and real-time feedback of the defined lighting intensities. When the &#x201c;Live Changes Enabled&#x201d; actuator <b>428</b> is disabled, the lighting controls may be defined by the user via the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>and may be saved for being implemented in the defined zones in the area when the defined scene is triggered (e.g., via occupancy event/condition, actuation of a button, a scheduling event, etc.).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">A scene may define the lighting intensity settings, color settings (e.g., x-y chromaticity values or CCT values), and/or vibrancy settings (e.g., vibrancy mode and/or vibrancy value) of a respective zone, and the control/configuration application may provide the user with the ability to configure the lighting intensity settings, color settings (e.g., x-y chromaticity values or CCT values), and/or vibrancy settings (e.g., vibrancy mode and/or vibrancy value) defined by the scene (e.g., to a user selected color point along the black-body curve).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">The graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may include a control interface <b>440</b> to control the lighting intensity and color temperature defined for a zone (e.g., the &#x201c;Desk Area&#x201d; zone as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>), for example, upon detecting that the user has selected the warm/cool actuator <b>446</b>. The control interface <b>440</b> may include an indicator <b>442</b>, a palette <b>448</b>, an actuator <b>444</b>, and/or a control line <b>450</b>. The palette <b>448</b> may show a range of colors ranging from cool colors <b>443</b><i>a </i>at the top of the palette <b>448</b> to warm colors <b>443</b><i>b </i>at the bottom of the palette <b>448</b>. As described herein, these colors may correspond to colors that lie along the black-body curve. For example, the palette <b>448</b> may show colors along a range of correlated color temperatures (CCTs) ranging from &#x201c;warm white&#x201d; (e.g., roughly 2600 K-3000 K) at <b>443</b><i>b, </i>to &#x201c;neutral white&#x201d; (e.g., 3000 K-5000 K) to &#x201c;cool white&#x201d; (e.g., 5000 K-8300 K) at <b>443</b><i>a. </i>As one example, the range CCTs may be from 1400K to 7000K, although other examples are possible.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">Superimposed over the palette <b>448</b> may be an actuator <b>444</b>. The actuator <b>444</b> may be movable/slide-able (e.g., here vertically movable) along the control line <b>450</b> to select different CCTs along the black-body curve. Accordingly, actuator <b>444</b> may allow a user to configure the lighting control device(s) such that the lighting load(s) produces colored light at a color point along the black-body curve. Assuming the lighting load(s) is producing light at a color point along the black-body curve at a time prior to actuator <b>444</b> being selected by the user, the control/configuration application may display actuator <b>444</b> at a relative point along control line <b>450</b>/palette <b>448</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> to indicate the color being produced by the lighting load(s). Similarly, indicator <b>442</b> may also display the corresponding color. Alternatively, if the lighting load(s) is not configured to produce light at a color point along the black-body curve (or is out of range of palette <b>448</b>) at a time prior to actuator <b>444</b> being selected by a user, the control/configuration application may not display actuator <b>444</b>. The actuator <b>444</b> may only appear once the user interacts with palette <b>448</b>. And, as described herein, if the &#x201c;Live Changes Enabled&#x201d; actuator is enabled, the lighting loads may adjust their respective color in real time as the actuator <b>444</b> is moved across the control line <b>450</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">The control interface <b>440</b> may include similar indicators and/or controls for controlling the intensity of the lighting control devices as illustrated in the control interface <b>418</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. For example, the control interface <b>440</b> may include an indicator <b>432</b>, control line <b>436</b>, and/or actuators <b>422</b>, <b>420</b><i>a, </i><b>420</b><i>b. </i>The control interface <b>440</b> may allow the user to control the intensity and color temperature of lighting control devices in the defined zone.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">A scene may provide for full color control of a respective zone, and the control/configuration application may provide the user with the ability to configure the full color settings defined by the scene. Accordingly, the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may be displayed by the control/configuration application to control the full color defined by a zone for the respective scene. The graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may include a control interface <b>452</b> to control the lighting intensity and full color for a zone (e.g., the Front Downlights zone as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). The control interface <b>452</b> may include control line <b>436</b> and actuators <b>422</b>, <b>420</b><i>a, </i><b>420</b><i>b </i>to control the lighting intensity of the &#x201c;Front Downlight&#x201d; zone.

The color palette <b>454</b> may be displayed such that a user may select the x-y chromaticity coordinates corresponding to a given color. The color palette <b>454</b> may include white colors on the far-right side of the color palette <b>454</b>, though the white colors may be located in other areas of the color palette <b>454</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the control interface may identify a user selection on the color palette <b>454</b>. Superimposed over the palette <b>454</b> may be an actuator <b>458</b> that identifies a user selection within the color palette <b>454</b>. The actuator <b>458</b> may be movable/slide-able (e.g., up, down, left, right, etc.) by the user to any of a plurality of locations/colors within palette <b>454</b>. The graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may display together with actuator <b>458</b> two perpendicular control lines that intersect at the center of the actuator <b>458</b>. These control lines and the intersection point may move with the actuator <b>458</b> as it is moved by a user within palette <b>454</b>, or as the user selects another location within the palette <b>454</b> independently. These control lines may assist the use in moving actuator <b>458</b> either horizontally or vertically or diagonally, etc. Accordingly, actuator <b>458</b> may allow a user to configure the zone such that the zone produces colored light at a color point that lies within the color gamut formed by the various RGBW LEDs, e.g., that make up the one or more lighting loads of the defined zone.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">The color gamut formed by the various RGBW LEDs that make up the lighting load may be referenced using an x-y chromaticity coordinate system. Accordingly, the control interface <b>452</b> may include a coordinate indicator <b>456</b>. The coordinate indicator <b>456</b> may illustrate the x-y chromaticity coordinates of the selected color. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the color selected for the Front Downlights zone may be indicated by the x-y chromaticity coordinates [0.123, 0.455].</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">Upon the full color tab <b>421</b><i>b </i>being actuated by a user from control interface <b>452</b>, or prior to the color being defined for the zone, the control/configuration application may initially display control interface <b>452</b> without actuator <b>458</b> and without the control lines, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. Upon the user performing a selection within the palette <b>454</b>, the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may display actuator <b>458</b> and the control lines at a relative point within palette <b>454</b> to indicate the color being defined and/or produced by the one or more lighting loads within the zone.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">The control/configuration application may provide a user with the ability to configure advanced options for a scene (e.g., timing options, such as fade and/or delay times, and vibrancy). Accordingly, graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>displayed by the control/configuration application may receive an indication from the user to allow for the configuration of advanced options. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may include an icon such as a &#x201c;Show Advanced Options&#x201d; button <b>460</b>, which, when actuated by the user may cause the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>to display advanced options for control of a scene.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> shows an example of the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>displaying advanced options for control of a scene. As described herein, control/configuration application may display the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>in response to receiving a user indication to configure advanced options (e.g., actuating or selecting the &#x201c;Show Advanced Options&#x201d; button <b>460</b>). Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may include one or more interfaces to configure the advances options, such as: an Include box <b>462</b>, Fade time box <b>464</b>, Delay time box <b>466</b>, and/or Vibrancy selector <b>468</b> for each of the respective zones in the area. When the Include box <b>462</b> is selected (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>), the respective zone may be included in the scene. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the Front Downlight and Desk Area zone may be included in the Bright scene, and when the Bright scene is activated the lighting control device(s) and/or lighting load(s) assigned to the Front Downlight and Desk Area zones may be controlled to the settings defined in the Bright scene. When the zone is included in the scene and the user selects the &#x201c;Save to Scene&#x201d; button <b>438</b>, the lighting intensity and/or color temperature settings that are defined in the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may be generated and stored for controlling the zone in response to the scene being triggered. If, however, a zone is not included in a scene (e.g., because an indicator, such as the Include box <b>462</b>, is not selected), the lighting control device(s) and/or lighting load(s) assigned to the zone may remain at their current settings. For example, the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may also include an indicator for each of the individual settings (e.g., lighting intensity, color) defined for a given zone. When an indicator for a respective setting is &#x201c;included,&#x201d; the lighting control device(s) and/or lighting load(s) assigned to the zone may be controlled to defined value of that setting. Similarly, when an indicator for a respective setting is not &#x201c;included,&#x201d; the lighting control device(s) and/or lighting load(s) assigned to the zone may remain unchanged when the scene is activated.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">The control/configuration application may further provide the user with the ability configure the vibrancy settings (e.g., vibrancy value) defined by a scene for a respective zone. For example, the control/configuration application may display a graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>that includes a &#x201c;Vibrancy&#x201d; selector <b>468</b>, which may be used by the user to select and/or configure the vibrancy for a particular zone within a scene. As indicated above, the vibrancy may not change (or substantially change) the color point/chromaticity coordinates of the color being produced by the lighting load. The vibrancy may, however, alter the contribution of each of the RGBW LEDs, for example, in generating the colored light, which may include reducing the intensity/contribution of the white LED(s) for example, thereby making certain objects in a space appear more vibrant.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">The vibrancy may adjust the wavelength of the light emitted by the zone, which may affect the color of the light (e.g., the reflected light) on objects within the zone. Increases and/or decreases in vibrancy may increase/decrease saturation of the color of objects in the area without changing the color of the light when the user looks at the light (e.g., the color of the emitted light). The Vibrancy selector <b>468</b> may allow the user to select a relative level of vibrancy (e.g., between zero and one-hundred percent) for increasing/decreasing the vibrancy of the one or more lighting loads for a defined zone. Changing the relative level of vibrancy may include decreasing or increasing the intensity of one or more white LEDs that make up the one or more lighting loads for a defined zone, thereby increasing or decreasing vibrancy, respectively. Changing vibrancy in this manner may also include changing the intensities of other LEDs (e.g., red, green, and/or blue LEDs) of the loads in the zone to maintain the same color output of the lighting loads (e.g., to maintain the same (or approximately the same) chromaticity coordinates of the mixed color output of the lighting loads in the zone). As described herein, the effect that configuring or controlling vibrancy (e.g., or the degree to which it can be controlled) has on the light emitted by the lighting load (e.g., the CRI value of the light emitted by the lighting load) may be based on the distance between the selected color setting and the black-body curve (e.g., or another predefined range of values, such as the color output of a white or substantially white LED within a respective lighting load). Vibrancy selector <b>468</b> may be referred to as an adjustable vibrancy mode.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145">The control/configuration application may provide the user with information about how vibrancy may affect objects within the load control system. For example, the control/configuration application may be configured to display an information button <b>469</b>, which may be selected by a user. In response to selecting the information button <b>469</b>, the control/configuration application may display information about the effects of vibrancy and how the vibrancy may be selected for a zone by the user. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> illustrates an example display <b>474</b> that may be shown if the user selects the information button <b>469</b>.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">The vibrancy may be changed for each of the zones that are configured for control along the black-body curve. The vibrancy may be enabled for zones that are defined for control using the warm/cool color temperature palette. The vibrancy may be controlled for lighting control devices in a zone that are being controlled along the black-body curve, as the lighting control devices may be using a number of colored LEDs to generate the color temperatures that are generated along the black-body curve, while also allowing variation in the use of different LEDs to increase the color being reflected to saturate the colors in the area (e.g., by reducing the intensities of the white LEDs). For zones that are being controlled using full color, the vibrancy control may be limited to colors that are within a predefined range of the colors. For example, referring to the color palette <b>454</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the vibrancy control may be limited to a predefined set of colors on the right side of the palette <b>454</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> (e.g., based on a respective color's distance from the black-body curve, as described herein). The predefined colors may be the 10% or 20% of colors on the right side of the palette. Vibrancy control may be disabled or set to a default value when the user selects colors in the palette that are outside of this predefined set of colors, as it may not be possible to render these colors in multiple ways using, for example, different intensities of RGB and white LEDs. One will recognize that the ability to control or not control vibrancy for colors on the right of the palette may be based on the number of different color LEDs that comprise a lighting load(s).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may control the lighting intensity of different zones of lighting control devices separately, while controlling the color temperature of the different zones in uniform. For example, the graphical user interface <b>410</b><i>a </i>may include control interfaces <b>470</b><i>a, </i><b>470</b><i>b </i>to control the lighting intensities of two or more zones (e.g., Desk Area <b>1</b> and Desk Area <b>2</b>) separately and control interface <b>472</b> to control the color temperature of the two or more zones in uniform.

For example, the control/configuration application may display one or more graphical user interfaces that enable the user to change the color and/or lighting intensities of the lighting control devices. Further, when the lighting devices are configured to change in color and/or lighting intensity over time, the lighting devices may simulate a natural lighting functionality, which may be referred to herein as natural light and/or natural show. As described herein, natural lighting functionality may include controlling one or more lighting control devices/lighting loads to emulate a sunrise and a sunset, and may further include emulating natural light/sunlight between sunrise and sunset. As described herein, natural lighting or natural show may be enabled or disabled based on: a schedule (e.g., a time clock); an event (e.g., by an occupancy event triggered by an occupancy sensor); and/or by assigning and enabling natural show to a scene (e.g., assigning natural show to a scene that is enabled in response to pressing a button at a remote control device). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate example graphical user interfaces that may be displayed by the control/configuration application to configure or control natural show.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0149">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, there is shown another example graphical user interface <b>510</b><i>a </i>that may be displayed by the control/configuration application to a user via a network device. For example, the user may use the graphical user interface <b>510</b><i>a </i>to enable and/or control natural lighting functionality (also referred to herein as a natural show) for one or more lighting control devices (e.g., after selection of the natural show indicator <b>425</b> on the lights tile <b>417</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> or another graphical user interface). The natural lighting functionality may change the color temperature and/or lighting intensity of one or more lighting control devices in a preselected area to simulate a change in color temperature/lighting intensity of natural lighting over the course of a period of time (e.g., a day, a portion of a day, etc.). The network device may communicate with the lighting control devices, for example, via a system controller as described herein. For example, the natural lighting functionality may be defined at the network device and stored at the system controller and/or a control device and/or the lighting control devices for being implemented in the lighting control devices in a given location or area in the user environment and assigned to a certain zone(s). Further, the natural lighting functionality may be assigned to a scene and/or may be activated, for example, by pressing a button on a control device or the network device. Natural lighting functionality may include emulating sunrise, sunset, and natural light/sunlight there between.

The length of the time axis <b>508</b> may represent the length of a day, or a portion of the day. For example, the time axis <b>508</b> may begin at midnight and end at midnight of the next day. In another example, the time axis <b>508</b> may represent a period of time over which the lighting control devices may be turned on, or the period of time that the natural lighting functionality may be enabled, such as a period of time between 6 AM and 6 PM.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">The graph <b>504</b> may include an area <b>514</b> that displays a function of the color temperature of the lighting control devices/lighting loads at a given time of day.

The area <b>514</b> may track the color temperature set for the lighting control devices at the corresponding times of day when the scene is configured.

For example, the bar <b>512</b> may track the lighting intensity values at the given time of day, while the bar itself may reflect/include a defined/different color temperature for each respective time of day (e.g., warmer colors on color temperature axis <b>506</b> to reflect corresponding warm temperatures and cooler colors on the color temperature axis <b>506</b> to reflect corresponding cool color temperatures). The control interface <b>570</b> may include one or more high-end or low-end controls. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, there may be a high-end color temperature box <b>516</b><i>a </i>and a low-end color temperature box <b>516</b><i>b. </i>The high-end color temperature box <b>516</b><i>a </i>and the low-end color temperature box <b>516</b><i>b </i>may allow the user to control/change/reconfigure the color temperature settings for the natural lighting functionality.

The bar <b>512</b> may have a minimum height of the minimum lighting intensity value and a maximum height of the maximum lighting intensity value.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">One or more thresholds or triggers may be set on the time axis <b>508</b> for a starting time and/or an ending time at which changes may be made to the intensity and/or color temperature. For example, the color temperature of natural light provided in a space by the lighting control devices may start ramping up earlier in the day (e.g., toward a cooler color temperature/higher intensity&#x2014;i.e., the configured high end values, such as to emulate sunrise for example) and may start ramping down later in the day (e.g., toward a warmer color temperature/lower intensity&#x2014;i.e., the configured low end values, such as to emulate sunset for example). The thresholds may be indicated on the graph <b>504</b> by dotted vertical lines. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the graph <b>504</b> may include a &#x201c;Start Ramp Up&#x201d; threshold <b>511</b>, an &#x201c;End Ramp Up&#x201d; threshold <b>513</b>, a &#x201c;Start Ramp Down&#x201d; threshold <b>515</b>, and an &#x201c;End Ramp Down&#x201d; threshold <b>517</b>. Before the Start Ramp Up threshold and after the End Ramp Down threshold the color temperature and intensity may stay constant at the configured low end values. Between the End Ramp Up threshold and the Start Ramp Down threshold the color temperature and intensity may stay constant at the configured high end values.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">Between the time of day indicated by the &#x201c;Start Ramp Up&#x201d; threshold <b>511</b> and the time of day indicated by the &#x201c;End Ramp Up&#x201d; threshold <b>511</b>, the color temperature of the lighting control devices may increase from the minimum color temperature until the maximum color temperature is met.

From the time period between the &#x201c;Start Ramp Up&#x201d; threshold <b>511</b> and the &#x201c;End Ramp Up&#x201d; threshold <b>511</b>, the color temperature of the lighting control devices may increase from 2800K to 4000K and the lighting intensity value may increase from 85% to 100%.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">Similarly, between the time of day indicated by the &#x201c;Start Ramp Down&#x201d; threshold <b>515</b> and the time of day indicated by the &#x201c;End Ramp Down&#x201d; threshold <b>517</b>, the color temperature and/or the lighting intensity value of the lighting control devices may decrease from the maximum color temperature/lighting intensity value until the minimum color temperature/lighting intensity value are met.

The color temperature/lighting intensity value of the lighting control devices may change linearly, step-wise, according to a sigmoid function (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>), etc. The time periods over which the color temperature/lighting intensity value of the lighting control devices increases or decreases may be automatically set, or may be user-selected.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">The graph <b>504</b> may be displayed with a default configuration for the natural show that may be modified by the user.

The lighting control devices may have a default minimum/maximum color temperatures and/or a default minimum/maximum lighting intensity values.

If, for example, the &#x201c;Auto/Manual&#x201d; actuator <b>577</b> is set to &#x201c;Manual&#x201d; (e.g., adjustable vibrancy mode is selected or enabled), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the lighting devices in the zone may be configured to the adjustable vibrancy state/mode and the vibrancy box <b>573</b> may include an indicator that displays the range of adjustable vibrancy values, such as a vibrancy bar <b>574</b>. For example, the vibrancy bar <b>574</b> may include an actuator <b>575</b> and/or a control line <b>576</b>. The actuator <b>556</b><i>a </i>may be superimposed over the control line <b>576</b>. The actuator <b>575</b> may be movable/slide-able (e.g., here vertically movable) along the control line <b>576</b> to select different vibrancy values along the control line <b>576</b>. The vibrancy box <b>573</b> may include a text box that allows the user to input the vibrancy value and/or that reflects the vibrancy value selected by the user with the actuator <b>575</b>. As described herein, when the vibrancy is set to &#x201c;Manual&#x201d; (as shown), the user may adjust the vibrancy settings (e.g., the intensity/contribution of the white LED(s)), and when the Vibrancy is set to &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; the CRI value of the emitted light may be optimized towards or above a target CRI value.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0164">Increasing/decreasing vibrancy using the vibrancy bar <b>574</b> when in the adjustable vibrancy mode may increase/decrease the apparent saturation of the color of objects in the space without changing (or substantially without changing) the color setting of the lighting control devices. Moving the actuator <b>575</b> upwards along the vibrancy bar <b>574</b> may increase the vibrancy of the lighting control devices for a selected color setting/CCT value as the color setting/CCT value changes over time. As the vibrancy of a lighting control devices is increased, the contribution of the white, or substantially white, LED(s) (e.g., yellow and/or mint green LED) of the lighting loads may decrease (e.g., given a certain color point and/or CCT), while increasing one or more of the RGB LEDs to maintain the color setting and/or lighting intensity setting of the light emitted by the entire lighting load while increasing saturation. Similarly, moving the actuator <b>575</b> downwards along the vibrancy bar <b>574</b> may decrease the vibrancy value of the lighting control devices. In addition, as the vibrancy value of the lighting control devices is decreased, the contribution of the white, or substantially white, LED(s) of the lighting control devices may increase (e.g., given a certain CCT) and correspondingly decreasing the intensity of one or more of the RGB LEDs, while maintaining the color setting and/or intensity of the light emitted by the entire lighting load.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0165">The selected adjustable vibrancy value may then be applied to the lighting loads over the time axis <b>508</b> based on the configured intensity and/or color of the natural show. For example, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the lighting loads may be set to an adjustable vibrancy value of 23% based on the configured color or intensity over the day. One will appreciate, however, that although the selection of the adjustable vibrancy value may remain the same over the period of time, the intensity or contribution of the white LED in the lighting may differ based on the selected color setting.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0166">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the &#x201c;Auto/Manual&#x201d; actuator <b>577</b> may also be set to &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; (e.g., auto vibrancy is enabled). When the &#x201c;Auto/Manual&#x201d; actuator <b>577</b> is set to &#x201c;Auto,&#x201d; the lighting control devices may be configured to the auto vibrancy mode and the control/configuration application may automatically determine the vibrancy value of the lighting control devices based on the selected color setting and/or intensity value. For example, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be based on a distance of the selected color setting for the lighting load is from the blackbody curve on the color spectrum. However, as natural show changes color temperature or CCT values over time, the selected color settings for natural show may be CCT values on the black-body curve (e.g., the distance between the select color setting and the black-body cure is zero or substantially zero). The automatically determined vibrancy value may be set to a predefined value that results in the emission of light from the lighting load at or above the target CRI value at the selected CCT value. That is, the control/configuration application may determine a respective vibrancy value for each of the selected color settings over the period of time to achieve the target CRI for the given color setting at that time. As described herein, however, this automatically determined vibrancy value may depend on the individual LEDs within the lighting load (e.g., based on the color of each of the individual LEDs that make up the lighting load).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">In certain instances (e.g., for certain color settings or CCT values) the CRI value may be unable to be a value that is greater than or equal to the target CRI value.

For example, the control line <b>576</b> and vibrancy bar <b>574</b> may be disabled (e.g. grayed out and/or non-configurable) when the &#x201c;Auto/Manual&#x201d; actuator <b>577</b> is set to &#x201c;Auto,&#x201d; and may be enabled (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) when the &#x201c;Auto/Manual&#x201d; actuator <b>577</b> is set to &#x201c;Manual.&#x201d; Further, when the &#x201c;Auto/Manual&#x201d; actuator <b>577</b> is set to &#x201c;Auto,&#x201d; the vibrancy value of the lighting loads may be automatically determined such that the lighting loads emit light at a CRI value that is greater than or above a target CRI value based on the selected CCT value for given time of the natural show. That is, when the &#x201c;Auto/Manual&#x201d; actuator <b>577</b> is set to &#x201c;Auto,&#x201d; the control/configuration application may automatically determine vibrancy values as the CCT values indicated by the area <b>514</b> change over the time axis <b>508</b>.

Superimposed over the palette <b>619</b> may be an actuator <b>620</b> that identifies a user selection within the color palette <b>619</b>. The actuator <b>620</b> may be movable/slide-able by the user to any of a plurality of locations/colors within palette <b>619</b> as similarly described above for other embodiments. The graphical user interface <b>600</b> may display together with actuator <b>620</b> two perpendicular control lines that intersect at the center of the actuator <b>620</b>. These control lines and the intersection point may move with the actuator <b>620</b> as it is moved by a user within palette <b>619</b> (e.g., to indicate the selected x-y coordinates), or as the user selects another location within the palette <b>619</b> independently.

Accordingly, color may be selected by manually inputting x-y coordinates into the coordinate indicators <b>624</b><i>a, </i><b>624</b><i>b </i></p><p id="p-0186" num="0184">Referring now to the &#x201c;Vibrancy&#x201d; portion of the control interface <b>622</b>, an &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b, </i>which may be used to enable the auto vibrancy mode may be included. When the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;On&#x201d; (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>), the control/configuration application may be configured to display the graphical user interface <b>600</b>. In addition, the control/configuration application may automatically determine a vibrancy value based on the selected color settings. For example, as described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the control/configuration application may automatically determine the vibrancy value based on a distance between the selected color setting and the black-body curve. As described herein, the distance between the selected color setting for the lighting load and the black-body curve may indicate whether the selected color setting has an equivalent CCT value on the black-body curve. If, for example, the distance is less than a distance threshold (e.g., indicating that the color setting has an equivalent CCT value), the automatically determined vibrancy value may be the automatically determined vibrancy that results in the emission of light from the lighting load at or above the target CRI value (e.g., <b>90</b>) for the equivalent CCT value. In addition, when the distance between the selected colors setting for the lighting load and the black-body curve is greater than the distance threshold, the automatically determined vibrancy value may be a predefined vibrancy value (e.g., 25%) In certain instances (e.g., for a certain color point or CCT) the CRI value may be unable to be a value that is greater than or equal to the target CRI value. In those instances, the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>being set to &#x201c;On&#x201d; may cause the lighting loads to increase the CRI value towards (e.g., as close as possible to) the target CRI value. In addition, when the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is set to &#x201c;On,&#x201d; the automatic configurations may be transmitted as they are performed, such that the user is able to the effect of the automatic configuration at the lighting load in real time.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0185">The user may adjust the color point of the lighting loads in a zone while the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;On&#x201d; (e.g., when the auto vibrancy mode is enabled), for example, by moving the actuator <b>620</b> either horizontally or vertically within the palette <b>620</b>. As the user adjusts the color point, the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>being set to &#x201c;On&#x201d; may automatically adjust vibrancy of the lighting loads (e.g., to achieve a CRI value that is greater than or equal to the target CRI value). As described herein, however, if the actuator <b>620</b> is adjusted to a color point or setting that farther than the distance threshold from the black-body curve, the vibrancy value of the lighting loads may be automatically adjusted to a predefined value. In addition, as described herein, the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>being set to &#x201c;On&#x201d; may cause the CRI of the lighting loads to be increased to a value greater than or equal to the target CRI value as the user adjusts the color point. These configurations may be subsequently transmitted (e.g., immediately or substantially immediately) to the lighting load(s) in a manner such that the user is able to see the changes at the lighting load(s) as the user adjusts the color point (e.g., make &#x201c;live&#x201d; changes). As described herein, similar functionality may occur as the user adjusts the CCT of lighting loads when the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;On.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0188" num="0186">As described herein, the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>may provide the user with the option to enable the auto vibrancy mode, wherein the control/configuration application may automatically determine a vibrancy value (e.g., which may be used to adjust the RGBW color mixing for a given color setting) to emit light at a CRI value at or above a target CRI value. When the auto vibrancy mode is enabled (e.g., when the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;On&#x201d;), certain settings, such as adjusting vibrancy via the actuator <b>626</b>, may no longer be configurable by the user, or may have a limited configuration control (e.g., vibrancy limited within certain range in which CRI value is greater than 90). Optimization of the CRI may or may not result in the highest CRI value. Rather, an optimized CRI may be a value of 90 or greater based on the selected color. In addition, in certain scenarios, optimizing the CRI value may decrease the vibrancy. As a result, when the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;On,&#x201d; the vibrancy of the lighting loads in a zone may automatically be changed (e.g., increased or decreased) to the vibrancy level when the CRI is optimized (e.g., the CRI is at or above 90).</p><p id="p-0189" num="0187">When the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;On,&#x201d; the user may be provided with a limited ability to adjust vibrancy (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). For example, when the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;On,&#x201d; the vibrancy control maybe disabled from user control (e.g., the &#x201c;Vibrancy&#x201d; portion may be grayed out, as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). Although the user may be unable to control the vibrancy, the actuator <b>626</b> may move across the control line <b>628</b> to indicate the automatically configured vibrancy. Whereas, when the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;Off,&#x201d; the user control may be able to adjust the vibrancy via moving the actuator <b>626</b> across the control line <b>628</b>. The &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>may have two settings: &#x201c;On&#x201d; and &#x201c;Off&#x201d; When the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;Off,&#x201d; vibrancy may be controllable or adjustable by the user. When the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;On&#x201d; (e.g., the auto vibrancy mode is enabled) the user may be unable to control or adjust the vibrancy.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0188">In addition, when the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;On,&#x201d; the vibrancy of the lighting loads may be automatically determined and/or may not be configurable by the user. The graphical user interface <b>600</b> may provide the user with the ability to configure the load controls system using live updates, which may allow the user to see the effects in real time. For example, when the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;On,&#x201d; the network device may transmit control instructions to the lighting loads in a zone such that the lighting loads may respond to the control instructions and change their respective states so that the user can see the effects of the configurations in real time.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0189">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the Vibrancy portion of the control interface <b>622</b> may also include an actuator <b>626</b>, and/or a control line <b>628</b>. And although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, when the &#x201c;Auto&#x201d; actuator <b>618</b><i>b </i>is &#x201c;Off&#x201d; (e.g., adjustable vibrancy mode is enabled), the actuator <b>626</b> may be actuated along the control line <b>628</b> to control the vibrancy of the lighting load(s) in zone b. As described herein, the actuator <b>626</b> may be used to adjust the vibrancy value, which may adjust color mixing (e.g., the relative intensities or contributions of) of the respective RGBW LEDs, which may affect the apparent color of objects within the zone (e.g., may affect the color rendering). Increasing/decreasing vibrancy value via the actuator <b>626</b> may increase/decrease the apparent saturation of the color of objects in the area without changing (or substantially without changing) the color point of the light source. As described herein, the effect that configuring or controlling vibrancy has on the light emitted by the lighting load may be based on the distance between the selected color setting and the black-body cure (e.g., or another range of predefined values, such as the color output of a white or substantially white LED within a given lighting load). Accordingly, vibrancy may be enabled for lighter or less saturated colors (e.g., colors towards the right side of the color palette <b>619</b> and/or closer to the black-body curve). Further, the effect produced by adjusting the vibrancy via the actuator <b>626</b> may decrease as the distance between the selected color setting and the black-body curve or the color saturation increases (e.g., colors towards the right side of to palette <b>619</b> and/or farther from the black-body curve). Accordingly, vibrancy control may be disabled or less controllable (e.g., the range of adjustable vibrancy values decreases), for selected color setting that are farther from the black-body curve or are more saturated (e.g., colors toward the left side of the color palette <b>619</b>). For example, as the selected color point on the color palette <b>619</b> becomes more saturated (e.g., toward the left of the color palette <b>619</b>, away from the black-body curve), flexibility in changing the color mixing of the RGBW LEDs to increase vibrancy while maintaining the desired color point may be reduced, as there may be fewer color mixing options of the RGBW LEDs to achieve the desired color or CCT.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0190">Moving the actuator <b>626</b> upwards along the control line <b>628</b> may increase the vibrancy of the lighting loads in a zone for a selected color. As described herein, the lighting loads may be RGBW lighting loads, although one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the concepts disclosed herein may be applicable to lighting loads with at least four LEDs having different spectra. For example, the embodiments described herein may be applicable to lighting loads with three discrete LEDs and a phosphor-converted LED (e.g., or combinations thereof, such as more than four LEDs of this combination). As the vibrancy of a lighting load is increased, the contribution of the white, or substantially white, LED(s) (e.g., yellow and/or mint green LED) of the lighting load in a zone may decrease (e.g., based on a given a certain color setting and/or CCT), while increasing one or more of the RGB LEDs to maintain the color point while increasing saturation. Similarly, moving the actuator <b>626</b> downwards along the control line <b>628</b> may decrease the vibrancy of the lighting loads in a zone.
